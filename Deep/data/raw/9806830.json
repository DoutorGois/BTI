     "PG": "59-69",
     "AB": "Bfp (brain finger protein) is a member of the RING finger protein family, which is highly expressed in the brain. We have previously shown that one copy of the human bfp gene, mapped at 17p11.2, was actually deleted in six of six Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) patients. Now we have isolated the mouse bfp cDNA. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the distribution of mouse bfp mRNA and protein was identified especially in neural cells of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, lateral amygdaloid nucleus, and ventromedial hypothalamus. In primary culture of the whole brain in a neonatal mouse, the Bfp protein was detected in both neuron and glial cells, and its subcellular localization was predominantly in the nucleus, but some amounts were also found in the cytoplasm. The bfp mRNA was also expressed strongly in the marginal zone of brain vesicles, optic stalk, and cartilage primordium, which are part of the critical tissues frequently involved in SMS patients, and in such tissues as nasal epithelium and primordium of follicles in a 13. 5-dpc embryo. Subsequently, its amount in the developing brain further increased during embryogenesis, reaching the highest level in the adult brain. These findings suggest a possibility that Bfp might be involved in the pathogenesis of Smith-Magenis syndrome as a regulator protein related to neural differentiation and function.",
