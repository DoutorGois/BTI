     "AB": "To study the relationship between cerebral blood flow, energy metabolism, and the formation of amyloid precursor protein (APP), an in vivo animal model was established in which stepwise long-term cerebral hypoperfusion states were induced. Adult rats underwent a stepwise chronic cerebral hypoperfusion by crosswise occlusion of the carotid and vertebral arteries with different periods and severity of hypoperfusion until the final steady-state experiment. Investigations of metabolic compounds were done in hippocampus and parietotemporal cerebral cortex. The analysis of energy-rich phosphates and adenosine was examined by HPLC analysis. Substrate concentrations of pyruvate and lactate were measured spectrophotometrically. The APP holoprotein was investigated by immunblot technique. Long-term cerebral hypoperfusion induced a decrease of energy-rich phosphates in the brain areas studied, whereas the concentration of adenosine and the ATP turnover were increased. Pyruvate decreased, and lactate was increased, pointing to a shift in the cytoplasmatic redox state. More severe changes were found in parietotemporal cerebral cortex in comparison to the hippocampus. After 2-vessel occlusion, the concentration of APP decreased, whereas the APP concentration was significantly increased in rat brain after 4-vessel occlusion. It has been demonstrated for the first time in vivo that the reduction in cerebral energy metabolism alters the formation of APP due to cerebral hypoperfusion.",
