     "AB": "We report on a 66-year-old woman with segmental dystonia treated with chronic bilateral deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus internus, in whom accidental high-voltage, high-frequency stimulation induced an episode of transient global amnesia (TGA) via an electrode contact which was misplaced in the right hippocampus. A possible mechanism underlying this TGA episode may have been the inhibition of local neuronal activity or fiber activation by high current density via direct electrical stimulation of hippocampal structures. While a unifying etiology of TGA has not been proven so far, our case demonstrates a possible link between focal electrical stimulation of hippocampal structures and the full clinical picture of the syndrome.",
