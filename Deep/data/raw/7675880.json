     "AB": "The effects of MCI-225 on amnesia, the cerebral glucose metabolism, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in basal forebrain (BF)-lesioned rats were studied in comparison with those of tacrine. Bilateral BF lesions with ibotenic acid impaired the performance in passive avoidance (PA) tasks. Single administration of MCI-225 (10 mg/kg, PO) after a 2-week postoperative recovery period, increased the escape latencies in the PA task, but was not statistically significant. Repeated administration of MCI-225 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, PO for 6 days) significantly reversed the PA failure. The BF-lesioned rat exhibited a marked decrease in the local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and caudate-putamen. MCI-225 (1 mg/kg, PO for 5 days) significantly ameliorated the reduction of the LCGU in the parietal cortex. MCI-225 did not change the decrease in the cortical ChAT activity induced by the BF lesion. Repeated administration of tacrine reversed the PA failure (0.3 mg/kg, PO) but failed to prevent the decrement in the LCGU and the ChAT activity. These results suggest that MCI-225 could be effective in the treatment of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, which is accompanied with both deficit in the BF-cortex cholinergic neuron and cerebral glucose hypometabolism.",
