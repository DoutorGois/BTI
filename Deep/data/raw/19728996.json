     "AB": "The serotonin system densely innervates the brain and is implicated in psychopathological processes. Here we studied the effect of serotonin and serotonin pharmacological compounds on the outgrowth of serotonergic projections using organotypic slice co-cultures of hippocampus and dorsal raphe nuclei. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that several serotonergic neurites had grown into the target slice within 7 days in culture, after which the neurite density stabilized. These projections expressed the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme Tryptophan hydroxylase and the serotonin transporter and contained several serotonin-positive varicosities that also accumulated presynaptic markers. Chronic application of a 5-HT(2) agonist reduced the serotonergic neurite density, without effects on survival of serotonergic neurons. In contrast, application of a 5-HT(1A) agonist or the serotonin transporter inhibitor fluoxetine did not affect serotonergic neurite density. We conclude that serotonergic connectivity was reproduced in vitro and that the serotonin neurite density is inhibited by chronic activation of the 5-HT(2) receptor.",
