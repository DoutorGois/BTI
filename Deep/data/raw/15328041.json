     "AB": "In the present study, we investigated layer-specific changes in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor localization in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of neuronal nitric oxide synthase knockout (nNOS-/-) mice using immunohistochemistry. In the cerebral cortex of control mice, moderately stained cells were seen through the layers II-VI in several cortical regions. In nNOS-/- mice, there was a significant decrease in IGF-I receptor immunoreactivity in the same cortical regions. In the hippocampus of control mice, a distinct immunoreactivity pattern was observed in the CA1-3 areas and dentate gyrus. The immunoreactivity for IGF-I receptor was differentially decreased in each layer in nNOS-/- mice. In nNOS-/- cerebellum, IGF-I receptor immunoreactivity was also significantly decreased in each layer of cerebellar cortex and cerebellar nuclei. To clarify whether decreased expression of IGF-I receptor in nNOS-/- mice was specific, the expression of other receptors for IGF-I was also evaluated. Receptor tyrosine kinase type A (TrkA receptor) and TrkB receptor were differentially decreased in each layer of the hippocampus or cerebellum of nNOS-/- mice. Although further studies of functional features of IGF-I systems in the nNOS-/- mice are required, our first morphological data may provide insights into NO-induced changes in trophic support as well as basic knowledge required for the study of NO-associated neurological diseases.",
