     "AB": "Glucokinase (GK) and its regulatory protein (GKRP) play roles in glucose utilization as well as glucose-sensing process in the brain. In the present study, we compared GK and GKRP protein expressions in the hippocampus of adult (postnatal month 6) and aged (postnatal month 24) gerbils using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Both GK and GKRP immunoreactivities were observed primarily in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus proper and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus of the adult and aged hippocampus. GK, not GKRP, immunoreactivity was apparently decreased in the pyramidal and granule cells of the aged group compared with that in the adult group. In addition, western blot analysis also showed that the GK, not GKRP, protein level was significantly decreased in the aged hippocampus. These results indicate that the decrease of GK may be closely related to the reduction of glucose utilization and uptake, although the ability for regulation of GK is maintained in the aged hippocampus.",
