     "AB": "To investigate the underlying mechanism of neurotoxicity of cadmium, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injection of cadmium on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) and Bax (Bcl2-associated x) genes and caspase-3/7 activation in rat hippocampus and frontal cortex. Twenty-eight male Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were randomly divided into four groups. Control group received saline and three other groups received cadmium at doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg (body weight) for 15 successive days. One day after the last injection, the hippocampus and frontal cortex were dissected and removed and then the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax genes was evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction and apoptotic studies was done using caspase-3/7 activation assay. Cadmium reduced the mRNA level of Bcl-2 in the control group at doses of 1 ( p < 0.01), 2 and 4 mg/kg ( p < 0.001) in rat hippocampus and cortex cells. The mRNA level of Bax increased significantly compared to the control group at the doses of 1 ( p < 0.05), 2 and 4 mg/kg ( p < 0.001) in rat hippocampus. The mRNA level of Bax was increased significantly compared to the control group at the doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg ( p < 0.001) in rat cortex cells. Cadmium increased caspase-3/7 activity at doses of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg in rat hippocampus. Caspase-3/7 activity was increased significantly at dose of 4 mg/kg in rat cortex. This decreased Bcl-2/Bax mRNA ratio induces cell apoptosis. Apoptotic effect of cadmium may be through the mitochondrial pathway by the activation of caspase-3/7.",
