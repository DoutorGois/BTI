     "AB": "This case report describes a progressive dementia in a 49-year-old black male on long-term hemodialysis. The initial presentation simulated depression. The dementia persisted after an unsuccessful cadaver homograft transplant. The character of the dementia was nonspecific but typical features of dialysis dementia were lacking. Autopsy revealed a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, polycystic kidneys, moderately severe atherosclerosis, miliary tuberculosis, and neurofibrillary degeneration of the hippocampus. The significance of a possible relationship between end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hemodialysis, and Alzheimer's disease in this case is discussed.",
