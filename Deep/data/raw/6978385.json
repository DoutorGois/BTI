     "AB": "Electrolyte destruction of certain nuclei of the brain cause specific structural and functional changes in the immune system. Lesions in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area result in thymic involution and a decrease in the number and blastogenic reactivity of splenocytes. In contrast, lesions in the hippocampus increase thymic and splenic mitogenic responsiveness and cellularity. Hypophysectomy abrogates all changes in splenocyte number and function induced by hypothalamic and limbic lesions. The effects of ablating the hippocampus and amygdaloid complex on thymocyte number and function also are abolished. Hypothalamic lesions in hypophysectomized animals result in an increase in the number of thymocytes but suppressed mitogenic activity. These data indicated that neuroimmunomodulation is mediated predominantly but not exclusively by the pituitary gland.",
