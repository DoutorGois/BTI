     "AB": "This study investigated the influence of chronically administered curcumin on normal ageing-related parameters: lipid peroxidation, lipofuscin concentration and intraneuronal lipofuscin accumulation, activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and Na(+), K(+), -adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+), K(+), -ATPase) in different brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla) of 6- and 24-month-old rats. In normal ageing, lipid peroxidation and lipofuscin concentration were found to increase with ageing, the activities of SOD, GPx and Na(+), K(+), -ATPase, however, decreased with ageing. Chronic curcumin treatment of both 6 and 24 months old rats resulted in significant decreases in lipid peroxide and the lipofuscin contents in brain regions, the activities of SOD, GPx and Na(+), K(+), -ATPase however, showed significant increase in various brain regions. The present study, thus, demonstrated the antioxidative, antilipofusinogenesic and anti-ageing effects of curcumin in the brain.",
