     "AB": "Deletion of the core clock gene, Bmal1, ablates circadian rhythms and accelerates aging, leading to cognitive deficits and tissue atrophy (e.g., skeletal muscle) (Kondratov et al., 2006, Kondratova et al., 2010). Although normal aging has been shown to attenuate Bmal1 expression in the master circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), relatively little is known about age-related changes in Bmal1 expression in other tissues, where Bmal1 may have multiple functions. This study tested the hypothesis that aging reduces Bmal1 expression in extra-SCN oscillators including brain substrates for memory and in skeletal muscle. Brains and gastrocnemius muscles were collected from young (3-5 months) and old hamsters (17-21 months) euthanized at four times of day. Bmal1 mRNA expression was determined by conducting in situ hybridization on brain sections or real-time PCR on muscle samples. The results showed age-related attenuation of Bmal1 expression in many brain regions, and included loss of diurnal rhythms in the hippocampal CA2 and CA3 subfields, but no change in muscle. In situ hybridization for Per2 mRNA was also conducted and showed age-related reduction of diurnal rhythm amplitude selectively in the hippocampal CA1 and DG subfields. In conclusion, aging has tissue-dependent effects on Bmal1 expression in extra-SCN oscillators. These finding on normal aging will provide a reference for comparing potential changes in Bmal1 and Per2 expression in age-related pathologies. In conjunction with previous reports, the results suggest the possibility that attenuation of clock gene expression in some brain regions (the hippocampus, cingulate cortex and SCN) may contribute to age-related cognitive deficits.",
