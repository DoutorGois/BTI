     "AB": "Neural progenitors/stem cells (NSCs) exist in neonatal mouse subventricular zone (SVZ). To explore the differentiation of the NSCs in neonatal mouse SVZ and the distribution of the progeny cells derived from these NSCs in early adulthood, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid was transferred into the NSCs in the lateral ventricle of newborn mice (P0) by in-vivo electroporation to trace these cells and their progeny cells. Thirty days after electroporation, histological sections of mouse brain were prepared for immunofluorescence with cell-specific antibodies to identify the type(s) of cells that were marked by EGFP. The results showed that EGFP-positive cells were distributed mainly in the olfactory bulb (OB), cortex, and SVZ, and double labeled with NeuN (neuron marker) in OB, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocyte marker) in the cortex, and Blbp and GFAP (astrocyte marker) in SVZ. However, there was no-EGFP-positive cell in the hippocampus. The present results indicate that the NSCs in SVZ of the neonatal mouse can give rise to neurons in the OB and astrocytes in the cortex in early adulthood, but not generate progeny cells residing in the hippocampus. In addition, there are still neural progenitors in SVZ until early adulthood.",
