     "AB": "The brain mechanisms of the selective verbal attention were studied using evoked potential (EP) technique. It was shown that the late \"cognitive\" EP components (400-800 ms) related to memory function were more positive to the words presented via a relevant sensory channel and more negative to irrelevant words. The hypothesis is advanced that words delivered via two competing sensory channels, such as visual and auditory, are perceived, i.e., the subject sees and hears them. However, irrelevant signals are not stored in episodic memory due to the active inhibition of the information transmission to the hippocampal structures.",
