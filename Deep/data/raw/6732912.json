     "AB": "Overshadowing (Experiment 1) and blocking (Experiment 2) were investigated using a conditioned suppression paradigm in rats. Neither hippocampectomy nor cortical control lesions affected the extent to which a salient stimulus overshadowed a less salient one. Nor did the lesions affect the extent to which a stimulus that was highly correlated with shock overshadow a stimulus that was less well correlated with shock. Finally, the lesions did not alter the extent to which a previously reinforced stimulus blocked conditioning to another stimulus when both were presented as a reinforced compound stimulus. It is thus possible for hippocampectomized rats to show apparently normal overshadowing and blocking, at least under some testing conditions.",
