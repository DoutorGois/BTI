     "AB": "Oxidative stress (OS) generates or intensifies cocaine-evoked toxicity in the brain and peripheral organs. The aim of this study was to examine superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and lipid peroxidation [measured by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels] in rats during maintenance of cocaine self-administration and after withdrawal by a yoked-triad procedure. Our results indicate that repeated cocaine self-administration provoked an elevation of SOD activity in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, dorsal striatum, and liver. MDA levels were reduced in the brain, increased in the liver, kidney, and heart during maintenance of self-administration, and increased in the kidney in cocaine-yoked rats. In addition, following extinction training, we found enhanced MDA levels and SOD activity in the rat hippocampus, while changes in the activity of OS biomarkers in other brain structures and peripheral tissues were reminiscent of the changes seen during cocaine self-administration. These findings highlight the association between OS biomarkers in motivational processes related to voluntary cocaine intake in rats. OS participates in memory and learning impairments that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. Therefore, further studies are necessary to address protective mechanisms against cocaine-induced brain and peripheral tissue damage.",
