     "AB": "Cellular actions of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) resemble those of micro-, delta-, and kappa-opioids, i.e. activation of inwardly rectifying K(+) conductance, inhibition of high-voltage-activated Ca(2+) channel currents, and impediment of neurotransmitter release. Differences in ORL(1) and micro-receptor distribution lead to: 1) more widespread actions of N/OFQ on periaqueductal gray neurons than opioids and 2) differential effects of N/OFQ and opioids in the brainstem. Also, unlike opioids, N/OFQ inhibits T-type Ca(2+) channel current in sensory neurons. Opioids and N/OFQ may modulate glutamate responses in different ways, and certain actions of N/OFQ are potentiated following nerve injury whereas those of micro-opioids are attenuated. Agonists at ORL(1) receptors may therefore be of clinical interest in the management of neuropathic pain.",
