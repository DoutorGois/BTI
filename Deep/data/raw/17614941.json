     "AB": "Differential gene expression across the embryonic cerebral cortex is assumed to play a role in the subdivision of the cortex into distinct areas with specific morphology, physiology and function. In a search for genes that may be involved in the cortical regionalization during late neurogenesis in mouse, we performed an extensive in-situ expression analysis at embryonic day (E)16 and E18. The examined candidate genes were selected beforehand by a microarray screen by virtue of their preferential expression in the anlagen of the motor, somatosensory, visual and cingulate cortices or hippocampus. We present new information about graded or regionally enriched expression of 25 genes (nine of which are novel genes) across the mouse embryonic cortex, in progenitor cells as well as in the cortical plate. The established differential expression of most of these genes is persistent at both stages studied, suggesting that their expression is regulated by an intrinsic programme. For some of the genes, the concept of intrinsic regulation is further substantiated by the high similarity of the reported expression patterns at E16 and E18 and published data from earlier stages. Few genes with robust expression in the E16 caudal cortex showed a more restricted pattern at E18, possibly because of their response to extrinsic cues. In addition, several genes appeared to be suitable novel markers for amygdalar and diencephalic nuclei. Taken together, our findings reveal novel molecular partitions of the late mouse cortex that are in accordance with the model of a leading role of intrinsic mechanisms in cortical arealization.",
