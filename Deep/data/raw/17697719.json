     "AB": "Previous studies show that early life events result in neurobehavioural alterations that may be either beneficial or detrimental to the stress response. Given the close relationship between corticosterone secretion and mnemonic processes, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of brief (BMS, 15 min) and long maternal separations (LMS, 180 min) on memory tasks in adult rats, assessed by context and tone fear conditioning. At adulthood, males were evaluated for behavioural and hormonal reaction to the training environment, being tested for context fear conditioning; tone fear conditioning; and learning curve in the context fear conditioning, in which rats were daily re-exposed to the context, followed by a brief footshock and in the last day of the experiment (day 5) animals were exposed to the context. Corticosterone and ACTH plasma levels were determined in naive rats (basal) or 5, 25 or 45 min after each test. Peak ACTH and corticosterone levels were similar among the groups after context fear conditioning; however, levels of CTL rats remained elevated for a longer time. In the learning curve of context fear conditioning, both BMS and LMS rats exhibited less freezing behaviour than CTL rats, without differences in hormone secretion. There was neither an association between activity of the HPA axis and performance on memory tasks nor different activational properties of the tasks on the HPA axis between BMS and LMS rats, i.e., both manipulations lead to similar performance in hippocampus-dependent and independent memory tasks.",
