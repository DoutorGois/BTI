     "AB": "Destruction of meningeal cells during brain development results in alterations of the extracellular matrix over the surface of the central nervous system, and a regional disruption of the external glial limiting membrane, associated with a reorganization of the glial scaffold. These changes of the glial organization have repercussions on neuronal migration and aggregation leading to a failure of neurons to segregate into spatially separated layers and lobules. We propose that meningeal cells stabilize the labile outer surface of the brain and the glial scaffold during development by specifically controlling the composition of the extracellular matrix at the interface with glial end-feet.",
