     "AB": "Postsynaptic depolarization of dendrites paired with spike generation at the soma is considered to be a central mechanism of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and a prime example of a Hebbian synapse. This pairing, however, has never been actually demonstrated on tetanic stimulation. Optical imaging of neural activity with a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) is one potentially suitable method for examining this pairing. It is possible with optical recording to examine simultaneously the excitation of postsynaptic neurons at multiple sites. Thus the pairing of spike generation at the soma and dendritic depolarization can be examined with population level optical recording in highly laminar structures such as the hippocampal slice preparation. For example, one can correlate the optical signals obtained from cell layers with the activity of the soma, and, similarly, optical signals from stratum radiatum can be correlated with the activity of the apical dendrite, even though one cannot calibrate the optical signals in terms of actual membrane potential. Using the VSD aminonaphthylethenylpyridinium in rat hippocampal slices, we aimed to examine the pairing. Standard tetanic stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s) that elicited LTP in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) resulted in a long-lasting depolarizing optical signal (about 2 s) that spread progressively along the known input pathway of CA1. The time course of this long-lasting depolarization was similar to that recorded intracellularly and to that reflected in the fEPSP. The long-lasting depolarization was insensitive to D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D,L-APV, 50 microM), but D,L-APV inhibited the induction of LTP; this allowed us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the optical signal by averaging several trials. Using this improved optical signal, we confirmed that postsynaptic cells practically \"missed\" spikes during tetanic stimulation in most parts of CA1, which had been suggested in the intracellular recordings. Intracellular recordings revealed a 23% reduction in input resistance, which might explain the failed spike generation at the soma via shunting. A steep spatial convergence of the depolarization along the transverse axis of area CA1 was observed. In contrast to the response resulting from a standard 100-Hz tetanus, broader activation, and paired depolarization with somatic spikes was observed on theta-burst stimulation. Overall we concluded that postsynaptic spike generation, at least in synchronous form, has less effect on LTP induction with standard tetanic stimulation, while theta-burst tetanic stimulation can elicit pairing of dendritic depolarization and somatic discharge.",
