     "AB": "Cerebral ischemia results in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins associated with postsynaptic densities (PSDs). The authors investigated the possible relation between these events by determining the effect of ischemia on tyrosine phosphorylation of the brain-specific, PSD-enriched, Ras-GTPase activating protein, SynGAP. Transient (15 minutes) global ischemia was produced in rats by 4-vessel occlusion and PSDs prepared from forebrains immediately after ischemia or at 20 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours of reperfusion. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SynGAP was elevated relative to sham-operated controls by 20 minutes of reperfusion and remained elevated for at least 24 hours. Tyrosine phosphorylation of SynGAP also increased in CA1 and CA3/DG subfields of the hippocampus. Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of SynGAP was not accompanied by a change in PSD RasGAP activity. SynGAP bound to the SH2 domains of Src and Fyn in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent fashion, and this interaction increased after ischemia. SynGAP binds to the PDZ domains of PSD-95/SAP90 and coimmunoprecipitated with PSD-95. The coimmunoprecipitation of SynGAP with PSD-95 decreased after ischemia. The results indicate that changes in the properties and interactions of SynGAP may be involved in the neuropathology of ischemia.",
