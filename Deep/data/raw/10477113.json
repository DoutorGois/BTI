     "AB": "The El mouse is an animal model for human epilepsy. The mouse manifest seizures in response to periodically repeated vestibular stimuli such as being tossing-up. Although this technique has been traditionally employed to accelerate this disease in the mouse, its meaning remained obscure. The present study was conducted to estimate the effects of tossing-up stimuli on expression of c-fos, a well-known marker of neuronal activation. Expression of c-fos was significantly increased even after single tossing-up specimen. It was blocked by pretreatment of the mouse with MK-801, a NMDA receptor antagonist. A marked expression of the oncoprotein was observed in the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus and CA1-3 pyramidal cell layer in the hippocampus of the mouse. These results suggest that the El mice are genetically hyper-sensitive to the vestibular stimuli.",
