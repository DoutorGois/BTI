     "AB": "We observed the changes of excitatory amino acids (EAA) in extracellular fluid (ECLF) in rat hippocampus in case of cerebral ischemia after giving Wuto Granule compring the test groups with the control groups by microdialysis method. Results showed that there was no effect on EAA in extrcellular fluid by the drug before cerebral ischemia, but there existed staistical singnifcant changes of EAA in extracellular fluid one hour after cerebral ischemia comparing the test groups Glu and Asp with the control groups (P < 0.01). We found that there is a decrease of release of release of EAA in ECLF in case of ischemia by Wuto Granule. It could be deduced that Wuto Granule can penetrate the brain-blood barrier and this can protect the brain incse of ischemia. The application of intracerebral micrdialysis has provided a new method for the research work of pharmacology.",
