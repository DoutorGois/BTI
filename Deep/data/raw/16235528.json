     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1alpha (MGLUR1alpha) in the different brain areas of the kindled epilepsia models of rats by Coriaria Lactone (CL). METHODS: Thirty male SD rats were divided into 3 groups and were given intramuscular injections of 0.75, 1.0 and 1.25 ml/kg Coriaria Lactone respectively. 5 rats in the control group were given intramuscular injection of 1.0 ml/kg saline. After the kindling models were completed, the EcoG of all groups were recorded with the multi-electrophysiology recorder to view whether the EcoG of kindled rats accord with their seizures and to know whether there are differencees in EcoG among the kindled, non-kindled and control groups. The coronary sections of brain tissue were HE stained and MGLUR1alpha immunohistochemistry stained, and were observed under light microscope. RESULTS: The kindled rats had all grade (Simialowski scale) seizures after CL injection and their seizures accorded with their EcoG features. The MGLUR1alpha expression of kindled rats in hippocampus and temporal cortex outside hippocampus was stronger than that of non-kindled and control rats (P < 0.05); the strong expression was noted to be of no obvious difference between neuron and glia. CONCLUSION: The MGLUR1alpha expression of kindled rats in hippocampus and temporal cortex outside hippocampus is stronger than that of non-kindled and control. It is possible that MGLUR1alpha participates in epileptic seizures.",
