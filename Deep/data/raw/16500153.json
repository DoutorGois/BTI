     "AB": "Identification of targets and delivery platforms for gene therapy of neurodegenerative disorders is a clinical challenge. We describe a novel paradigm in which the neuroprotective gene is the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) antiapoptotic gene ICP10PK and the vector is the growth-compromised HSV-2 mutant DeltaRR. DeltaRR is delivered intranasally. It is not toxic in rats and mice. ICP10PK is expressed in the hippocampus of the DeltaRR-treated animals for at least 42 days in the absence of virus replication and late virus gene expression. Its expression is regulated by an AP-1 amplification loop. Intranasally delivered DeltaRR prevents kainic acid-induced seizures, neuronal loss, and inflammation, in both rats and mice. The data suggest that DeltaRR is a promising therapeutic platform for neurodegenerative diseases.",
