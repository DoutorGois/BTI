     "AB": "Experimental evidences of calcium-dependent proteolysis dysregulation in brain of murine model of Alzheimer disease were obtained. Experimental treatment consisted in intra-hippocampal injection of amyloid beta-peptide (AP1-40) promoted activation of main calpain forms in murine brain along with decrease incontent of natural calpain inhibitor, calpastatin. As a result of prognostic experiment on the correction of neurodegeneration induced in murine the neuroprotective properties of steroid hormone estradiol were confirmed and one of the possible protective action mechanisms was suggested. Obtained results allow considering both biochemical modifications in protein facilities of pathology-affected brain and the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and neuroprotection.",
