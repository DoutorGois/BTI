     "AB": "Hippocampal stem cells (HSCs) are considered promising donor cells to promote reorganization of degenerated regions of the injured hippocampus in the epileptic brain. However, the efficacy of HSC grafting for repairing injured hippocampus remains unclear. To address this issue, we transplanted neonatal rat HSCs into the right hippocampus in rats with kainite acid (KA)-induced epilepsy. The activity of the hippocampus and amygdala nucleus was monitored with electroencephalogram (EEG) throughout 24 weeks posttransplantation. Rats with grafted HSCs exhibited reduced frequency of epileptic wave discharge and a 50% decrease in the amplitude of discharge. At 1, 4, 8, and 24 weeks posttransplantation, the aberrant mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) was evaluated with Timm's stain and the number of CA3 pyramidal neurons was analyzed with Nissl staining. Aberrant MFS induced by KA-lesion was notably suppressed by HSC grafts beginning 4 weeks posttransplantation, and was most effective by 8 weeks. In addition, the loss of CA3 pyramidal neurons was partially restored and reached the most recovery at 8 weeks. Taken together, these results suggest that HSCs derived from the postnatal hippocampus offer a promising reparative effect on KA-induced epileptic brain.",
