     "AB": "Adult rats with unilateral fimbria-fornix lesion received fetal hippocampal grafts into the lesion cavity. Seven to ten months after the transplantation the graft was examined for long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to host hippocampus and direct graft stimulation. High frequency tetanizing trains delivered to either the host hippocampus or the graft resulted in augmented field potentials and prolonged neuronal discharges in the graft lasting several hours. Very low currents (10-30 microA) were required to induce LTP by direct graft stimulation. In addition to the enhancement of evoked responses, the frequency of occurrence of spontaneously occurring EEG spikes and concurrent population neuronal bursts in the graft increased significantly after the tetanizing trains. These findings suggest that the physiological-biochemical mechanisms required for plastic changes of synaptic efficacy are present in the grafted hippocampus.",
