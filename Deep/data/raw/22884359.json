     "AB": "The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease where the presence of high titers of circulating autoantibodies causes thrombosis with consecutive infarcts. In experimental APS (eAPS), a mouse model of APS, behavioral abnormalities develop in the absence of vessel occlusion or infarcts. Using brain hemispheres of control and eAPS mice with documented neurological and cognitive deficits, we checked for lymphocytic infiltration, activation of glia and macrophages, as well as alterations of ligand binding densities of various neurotransmitter receptors to unravel the molecular basis of this abnormal behavior. Lymphocytic infiltrates were immunohistochemically characterized using antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8 and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), respectively. GFAP, Iba1 and CD68-immunohistochemistry was performed, to check for activation of astrocytes, microglia and macrophages. Ligand binding densities of NMDA, AMPA, GABAA and 5-HT1A receptors were analyzed by in vitro receptor autoradiography. No significant inflammatory reaction occurred in eAPS mice. There was neither activation of astrocytes or microglia nor accumulation of macrophages. Binding values of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors were largely unchanged. However, ligand binding densities of the modulatory serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus and in the primary somatosensory cortex of eAPS mice were significantly upregulated which is suggested to induce the behavioral abnormalities observed.",
