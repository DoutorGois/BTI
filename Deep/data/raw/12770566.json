     "AB": "Repetitive sound-induced seizures, known as audiogenic kindling (AK), gradually induce the transference of epileptic activity from brainstem to forebrain structures along with behavioral changes. The aim of our work was to correlate the behavioral changes observed during the AK with possible alterations in neuronal proliferation, cell death, hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting and in the EEG pattern of Wistar audiogenic rats, a genetically susceptible strain from our laboratory. Susceptible and non-susceptible animals were submitted to repeated sound stimulations for 14-16 days and hippocampal mitotic activity was studied through the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Cell death and mossy fiber sprouting were assessed, respectively, by using Fluoro-Jade and Timm staining, 2 and 32 days after the last kindling stimulation. In addition, we used immunofluorescent double labeling for a glial and a mitotic marker to evaluate newly born cell identity. Some animals had hippocampus and amygdala electrodes for EEG recordings. Our results show that kindled animals with 6-11 generalized limbic seizures (class IV-V) had increased cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus when compared with animals with zero or one to three seizures. BrdU-positive cells labeled on day 2 and on day 32 were both GFAP negative. In the later group, rounded and well-defined BrdU-positive/GFAP-negative nuclei were seen in different portions of the granule cell layer. We did not observe any Fluoro-Jade or differential Timm staining in kindled animals at both killing times. However, EEG recordings showed intense epileptic activity in the hippocampus and amygdala of all animals with limbic seizures.Therefore, our data indicate that AK-induced limbic epileptogenicity is able to increase the hippocampal mitotic rate, even though it does not seem to promote neuronal death or mossy fiber sprouting in the supragranular layer of the dentate gyrus.",
