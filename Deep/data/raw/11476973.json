     "AB": "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a rare and progressive neurological disorder characterised by the presence of ballooned neurons (BN) and tau positive inclusions in neurons and glial cells. We studied the spatial patterns of the BN, tau positive neurons with inclusions (tau+ neurons), and tau positive plaques in the neocortex and hippocampus in 12 cases of CBD. All lesions were aggregated into clusters and in many brain areas, the clusters were distributed in a regular pattern parallel to the tissue boundary. In the majority of cortical areas, the clusters of BN were larger in the lower compared with the upper laminae while the clusters of tau+ neurons were larger in the upper laminae. Clusters of BN and tau+ neurons were either negatively correlated or not significantly correlated in the upper and lower cortical laminae. Hence, BN and tau+ lesions in CBD exhibit similar spatial patterns as lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Pick's disease (PD). The location, sizes and distribution of the clusters in the neocortex suggest that the tau+ lesions may be associated with the degeneration of the feedforward and the BN the feedback cortico-cortical and/or the efferent cortical pathways.",
