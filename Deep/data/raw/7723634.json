     "AB": "PAC-1 mRNA has previously been found only in activated T-cells in vitro and in vivo. The gene encodes a dual specificity protein phosphatase that regulates MAP kinase activity. Here, I describe that PAC-1 mRNA is induced also in neurons in the rat brain following 30 min of forebrain ischemia. At 6, 12 and 24 h after ischemia, PAC-1 mRNA was found most prominently in hippocampal cells which are resistant to 30 min of forebrain ischemia, but not in the selectively vulnerable CA1 sector. At later time points and in control animals no PAC-1 mRNA could be detected in any brain region. The protein-tyrosine/threonine phosphatase PAC-1, therefore, may be involved in adaptational responses of hippocampal cells resistant to ischemic injury.",
