     "AB": "Neuronal damage in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the brain is thought to occur at least in part through NMDA receptor (NMDAR) excitation initiated by soluble neurotoxins from HIV-infected brain macrophages. Furthermore, brain regions enriched in NMDAR-2A (NR2A) and NMDAR-2B (NR2B) subunits, such as the hippocampus, are particularly vulnerable. Using cultured rat hippocampal cells and HIV-1-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (HIV/MDM), we examined the role of NR2A and NR2B in HIV/MDM-induced hippocampal neuronal death. We used the primary HIV-1 strain Jago derived from the CSF of an individual with HIV-associated dementia and that robustly replicates in MDM. We found the following: (1) hippocampal neuronal susceptibility to HIV/MDM excitotoxins varies according to the developmental expression patterns of NR2A and NR2B; (2) NMDAR activation by HIV/MDM results in neuronal calpain activation, which results in neuronal death; and (3) selective antagonists of homomeric NR2B/NR2B- and heteromeric NR2A/NR2B-containing NMDARs, as well as an inhibitor of calpain activity, afford neuroprotection against HIV/MDM. These studies establish a clear link between macrophage HIV infection, neuronal NR2A and NR2B activation, and calpain-mediated hippocampal neuronal death. They further suggest a dominant role for NR2A and NR2B in determining neuronal susceptibility in HIV-infected brain. Antagonists of NR2A and NR2B subunits as well as inhibitors of calpain activation offer attractive neuroprotective approaches against HIV in both developing and mature brain.",
