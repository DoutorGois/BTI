     "AB": "Microdialysis has been proven to be a valuable tool to study in vivo release of various neurotransmitters in the rat brain. Recently we demonstrated for the first time the release of neurotrophic bioactivity in the brains of awake rats. Neurotrophic factors, however, exist in extremely low concentrations in the brain compared to neurotransmitters, rendering their detection particularly difficult. This review summarizes knowledge about the use of microdialysis for the detection of neurotrophic bioactivity, its limits, and its problems.",
