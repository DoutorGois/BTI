     "AB": "The phosphorylation state of three identified neural-specific protein kinase C substrates (RC3, GAP-43/B-50, and MARCKS) was monitored in hippocampal slices of mice lacking the gamma-subtype of protein kinase C and wild-type controls by quantitative immunoprecipitation following 32Pi labeling. Depolarization with potassium, activation of glutamate receptors with glutamate, or direct stimulation of protein kinase C with a phorbol ester increased RC3 phosphorylation in wild-type animals but failed to affect RC3 phosphorylation in mice lacking the gamma-subtype of protein kinase C. Our results suggests the following biochemical pathway: activation of a postsynaptic (metabotropic) glutamate receptor stimulates the gamma-subtype of protein kinase C, which in turn phosphorylates RC3. The inability to increase RC3 phosphorylation in mice lacking the gamma-subtype of protein kinase C by membrane depolarization or glutamate receptor activation may contribute to the spatial learning deficits and impaired hippocampal LTP observed in these mice.",
