     "AB": "The morphology of the claustrum in Galloway syndrome was investigated. Galloway syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disease that causes microcephaly and is associated with kidney pathology. The brain examined was small, and the external surface of the hemispheres was lissencephalic, with an abnormal gyrification pattern. The whole cerebral cortex showed severe pathological changes, but the most affected area was the cortex lying on the medial aspect of the temporal lobe, especially the entorhinal cortex. In addition, the paraamygdalar and temporal parts of the claustrum were intensively changed. These results may confirm the opinion that the claustrum is a cortico-dependent structure and that the limbic cortex receives large projection from its ventral parts.",
