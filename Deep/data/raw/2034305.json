     "AB": "Effect of intraperitoneal injection of phenylalanine on the calcium current of hippocampal neurons of rats has been studied by the voltage clamp method of the whole-cell recordings. Calcium currents in hippocampal neurons of control animals after 5-7 days in culture can be separated into two components: low and high voltage-activated ones. The value of high voltage-activated calcium current was 69 +/- 13% at Vt = -10 mV from total calcium inward current in these neurons. High voltage-activated Ica in neurons of phenylalaninemic rats was significantly depressed and its value was 32 +/- 14%, the Vt value being the same. Low voltage-activated calcium current was resistant to intraperitoneal injection of L-phenylalanine.",
