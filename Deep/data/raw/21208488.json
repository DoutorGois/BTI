     "AB": "Accumulating evidence suggests that changes in dietary folate intake may modulate the risks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through as yet unknown mechanisms. The aims of the present study were to investigate how dietary folate affects the brain folate distribution, levels of oxidised lipid and DNA damage in the absence/presence of beta-amyloid(25-35) (Abeta) peptide challenge, a pathogenic hallmark of AD. Male Wistar rats were assigned to diets with folic acid at 0 (folate deprivation; FD), 8 (moderate folate; MF) and 8 mg folic acid/kg diet+0.003 % in drinking-water (folate supplementation; FS) for 4 weeks. A single injection of Abeta peptide (1 mg/ml) or the vehicle solution was intracerebroventricularly (icv) administrated to rats a week before killing. Brain folate, a marker of oxidative injury, and neuronal death were assayed. In the absence of an Abeta injection, FD rats showed reduced folate levels, and increased 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and a mitochondrial (mt)DNA 4834 bp large deletion (mtDNA4834 deletion) in the hippocampus compared with the counterpart brains of control rats (P < 0.05). A single icv injection of Abeta peptide potentiated lipid peroxidation in the medulla of FD rats, which was ameliorated by feeding FD rats with the MF and FS diets (P < 0.05). Feeding the FS diet to Abeta-injected rats enriched brain folate levels and reduced mtDNA4834 deletion in the hippocampal and medullary regions compared with corresponding tissues of Abeta+FD rats (P < 0.05). Abeta+FS rats had reduced rates of neuronal death in the frontal cortex compared with Abeta+FD rats (P < 0.05). Taken together, our data revealed that folate deprivation differentially depleted brain folate levels, and increased lipid peroxidation and mtDNA4834 deletions, particularly, in the hippocampus. Upon Abeta challenge, the FS diet may protect various brain regions against lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial genotoxicity and neural death associated with folate deprivation.",
