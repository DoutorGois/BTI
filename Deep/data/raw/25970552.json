     "AB": "Conventional structural imaging is often normal after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). There is a need for structural neuroimaging biomarkers that facilitate detection of milder injuries, allow recovery trajectory monitoring, and identify those at risk for poor functional outcome and disability. We present a novel approach to quantifying volumes of candidate brain regions at risk for injury. Compared to controls, patients with mTBI had significantly smaller volumes in several regions including the caudate, putamen, and thalamus when assessed 2 months after injury. These differences persisted but were reduced in magnitude 1 year after injury, suggesting the possibility of normalization over time in the affected regions. More pronounced differences, however, were found in the amygdala and hippocampus, suggesting the possibility of regionally specific responses to injury.",
