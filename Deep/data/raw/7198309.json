     "AB": "The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChaT) in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, midbrain and pons of adult, male mice injected with 2 g/kg ethanol and of control mice injected with physiological saline, were determined by spectrophotometric methods. All animals were killed 30 min after injection between 11.00 h and 12.00 h. Results show that the acute dose of ethanol significantly decreased AChE activity only in the cerebral cortex whereas ChaT activity was reduced in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus. These findings show that the effect of an acute dose of ethanol on the cholinergic system of mouse brain is mediated through its effect on AChE and ChaT in specific regions.",
