Recent reports from Northern China indicate that 3-NPA is also likely to be responsible for the development of putaminal necrosis with delayed dystonia in children after ingestion of mildewed sugar cane. This article discusses the role of 3-NPA in the causation of the disease in China, its neurotoxic effects in animals and the potential role for this compound as a probe of selective neuronal vulnerability.",
