     "AB": "Thirty-three men and 42 women who underwent left, and 26 men and 24 women who underwent right temporal lobectomy (TL) were studied retrospectively to determine if there were sex differences in (1) verbal memory outcome, and (2) relationships between verbal memory and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampal volumes. All patients were left hemisphere language dominant. The surgical specimen and MRI were consistent only with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Verbal memory was evaluated by Logical Memory percent retention (LMPER) from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). Women experienced a significant improvement while men experienced a significant decline in postoperative LMPER. The difference between right and left hippocampal volumes predicted verbal memory outcome in both men and women. Preoperative LMPER was positively correlated with both the left and right hippocampal volumes in left TL women only. No verbal memory sex differences or correlations between LMPER and MRI data were found in the right TL group. The data support the presence of human neurocognitive sexual dimorphism. Verbal memory abilities supported by the hippocampus are less lateralized in women with left temporal lobe epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis. Women appear to have greater verbal memory plasticity following early left mesial temporal lobe insult.",
