     "AB": "Modifiers play an important role in most, if not all human diseases, and mouse models. For some disease models, such as the cystic fibrosis knockout mouse model, the effect of genetic factors other than the causative mutation has been well established and a modifier gene has been mapped. For other mouse models, including those of the fragile X syndrome, a common form of inherited mental retardation, controversies between test results obtained in different laboratories have been well recognized. Yet, the possibility that modifiers could at least explain part of the discrepancies is only scarcely mentioned. In this review we compare the test results obtained in different laboratories and provide evidence that modifiers may affect disease severity in the fragile X knockout mouse.",
