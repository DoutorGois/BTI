     "AB": "The effect of cigarette smoke on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and on the concentration of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits 2A and 2B in the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to cigarette smoke for 2h/day for a period of 4 weeks was determined. It was observed that NMDAR 2A and 2B concentrations in the hippocampus were enhanced in the case of animals exposed to cigarette smoke, whereas lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities did not show any change as compared to control animals. The results of our study suggest that cigarette smoke induces NMDAR 2A and 2B expression in the hippocampus, and that this is not due to an increased lipid peroxidation, because cigarette smoke has no effect on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in the hippocampus.",
