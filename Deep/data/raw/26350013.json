     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the waveform of electrical stimulus affects the antiepileptic effect of focal low-frequency stimulation (LFS). METHODS: The antiepileptic effects of the LFS in sine, monophase square and biphase square waves were investigated in hippocampal kindled mice, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, sine wave focal LFS (30 s) inhibited seizure stages (2.85 +/- 0.27 vs 4.75 +/- 0.12, P<0.05), lowered incidence of generalized seizures (53.6% vs 96.5%, P<0.01) and reduced afterdischarge durations [(16.2 2 +/- 1.69)s vs (30.29 +/- 1.12)s, P<0.01] in hippocampal kindled mice, while monophase or biphase square wave LFS (30 s) showed no antiepileptic effect. Monophase square LFS (15 min) inhibited seizure stages (3.58 +/- 0.16, P<0.05) and incidence of generalized seizures (66.7%,P<0.01), but had weaker inhibitory effect on hippocampal afterdischarge durations than sine wave LFS. In addition, pre-treatment and 3 s but not 10 s post-treatment with sine wave LFS resulted in suppression of evoked seizures (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The antiepileptic effect of LFS is dependent on its waveform. Sine wave may be optimal for closed-loop LFS treatment of epilepsy.",
