     "AB": "Growth factors bind to their specific receptors on the responsive cell surface and thereby initiate dramatic changes in the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of their target cells. In the present study we have examined the mechanism by which growth factor-induced signals are propagated to the nucleus, leading to the activation of transcription factor, cis-acting cAMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), in immortalized hippocampal progenitor cells (H19-7). During the differentiation of H19-7 cells by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) a critical regulatory Ser(133) residue of CREB was phosphorylated followed by an increase of CRE-mediated gene transcription. Expression of S133A CREB mutants blocked the differentiation of H19-7 cells by bFGF. Although the kinetics of CREB phosphorylation by EGF was transient, bFGF induced a prolonged pattern of CREB phosphorylation. Interestingly, bFGF-induced CREB phosphorylation and subsequent CRE-mediated gene transcription is not likely to be mediated by any of previously known signaling pathways that lead to phosphorylation of CREB, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-p70(S6K), calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase, and casein kinase 2. By using in vitro in gel kinase assay the presence of a novel 120-kDa bFGF-inducible CREB kinase was identified. These findings identify a new growth factor-activated signaling pathway that regulates gene expression at the CRE.",
