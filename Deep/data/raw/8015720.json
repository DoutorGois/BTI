     "AB": "Changes in the distribution pattern of mRNA encoding the zif268 transcription factor (also referred to as NGFI-A, Krox-24 or EGR-1) were investigated by in situ hybridization histochemistry during postnatal rat brain development. Marked changes in zif268 expression patterns were seen in particular in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampal formation during the first 3 wk. In the 1st postnatal week, zif268 mRNA levels were highest in the corpus striatum and the piriform cortex. In the neocortex, expression rose sharply in the sensorymotor area between postnatal days (PNDs) 10 and 12. In the frontal and occipital cortex, in contrast, an increase in zif268 mRNA levels was first seen on PND 14. After PND 17, levels decreased in the sensorymotor and the frontal cortex but remained high in the occipital and the piriform cortex. In the hippocampus, an initially uniform increase in expression during the 2nd week was followed by a marked dissociation in expression levels between CA1, with continuously high expression levels on the one hand, and CA3, CA4 and the dentate gyrus, with a strong decline of expression during the 3rd week, on the other hand. Our results indicate that zif268 expression displays a highly dynamic expression pattern during plastic adaptations of different cerebral subregions during postnatal development, suggesting a possible involvement in gene regulatory processes during these phases.",
