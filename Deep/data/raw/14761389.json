     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the changes of amino acids contents in hippocampus of rats and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) exposure. METHODS: Rats were decapitated and hippocampus were removed after EMP (6 x 10(4) V/m, rise time 20 ns, pulse width 30 micro s, 5 pulses in 2 minutes) irradiation, and contents of amino acids were detected with high performance liquid chromatograpy (HPLC). RESULTS: The contents of aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamic acid (Glu) increased significantly 0, 3, 6 h after irradiation. The peak values of Asp [(17.25 +/- 1.63) pmol/ micro l] and Glu [(13.67 +/- 0.95) pmol/ micro l] were higher than those of control [(10.56 +/- 1.50), (6.94 +/- 1.10) pmol/ micro l respectively, P < 0.05]. Then both decreased gradually and reached the normal level 24 - 48 h after irradiation. The contents of glycine (Gly), taurine (Tau) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) also rose after exposure, the peak value of them [(4.51 +/- 0.60), (29.85 +/- 2.70), (5.14 +/- 0.73) pmol/ micro l respectively] were higher than those of control group [(2.18 +/- 0.31), (9.88 +/- 1.47), (2.84 +/- 0.67) pmol/ micro l, P < 0.05], then recovered 48 h after irradiation. The value of Glu/GABA increased immediately after exposure (3.45 +/- 0.25, P < 0.05), then decreased 24 h (1.62 +/- 0.23, P < 0.05) and recovered 48 h after exposure. CONCLUSION: The toxic effect of excess excitatory amino acids may be partly responsible for the early retardation (within 24 h) of learning of rats.",
