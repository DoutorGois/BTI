     "AB": "Replacement cell therapy with transplantation of stem cells is a promising approach for the therapy of various neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease. However, the behavior of transplanted cells in the damaged tissue should be thoroughly studied before introduction of this method into clinical practice. We studied the pathways of migration of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells after their systemic transplantation into the brain of bulbectomized mice characterized by the development of Alzheimer-type neurodegenerative process. Immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to human nuclear antigen (HNA) and immunofluorescent analysis of the results of transplantation of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene showed that these cells can cross the blood-brain barrier and penetrate into some structures of recipient brain. Analysis of differentiation of transplanted human cells using antibodies to neurospecific enolase (NSE) or astroglial marker (GFAP) with parallel staining for human nuclear antigen revealed no neural differentiation of transplanted cells in the brains of bulbectomized animals. However, some of these cells differentiated into astrocytes, which brought us to an assumption on important role of astroglial abnormalities in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",
