     "AB": "The effects of certain GABA-modulating drugs, fornicotomy, hippocampectomy and various septal lesions were analysed in a discrete-trial fixed ratio 5 (FR5) bar-press paradigm. Chlordiazepoxide, fornicotomy, hippocampectomy, electrolytic lateral septal lesions and ibotenic acid medial septal lesions facilitate extinction of the FR5 response. Some of these treatments (chlordiazepoxide, hippocampectomy, electrolytic lateral septal lesions) have previously been found to increase resistance to extinction of alley-running after continuously reinforced (CRF) acquisition training. The treatments which facilitated extinction in the discrete-trial FR5 paradigm have been found to reduce or abolish the partial reinforcement extinction effect in the alley. These results indicate that the discrete-trial FR5 paradigm is not analogous to a runway CRF schedule, but may be analogous to a runway partial reinforcement schedule.",
