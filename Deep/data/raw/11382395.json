     "AB": "The sympathetic-related regions of the cerebral cortex were identified in rats after pseudorabies virus injections were made in functionally different targets: adrenal gland, stellate ganglion which regulates the heart, or celiac ganglion which innervates the gastrointestinal tract. Extensive transneuronal labeling was found in limbic system areas: (1) extended amygdaloid complex, (2) lateral septum, and (3) infralimbic, insular, and ventromedial temporal cortical regions (viz., ectorhinal cortex=Brodmann's area 36, perirhinal cortex=area 35, lateral entorhinal=area 28, and ventral temporal association cortex=Te3 region). Deep temporal lobe structures were prominently labeled, including the amygdalopiriform and amygdalohippocampal transition areas, ventral hippocampus and ventral subiculum. The cortical circuits mediating emotional-autonomic changes (i.e., mind-body control) are discussed.",
