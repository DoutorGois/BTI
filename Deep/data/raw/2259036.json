To the contrary, tumorous lesions are found more frequently in epilepsy with lateral temporal seizures. In view of the presumed known etiologies in relation to the localization of epileptogenic foci, the Classification of Epileptic Syndrome (1989), subdividing temporal lobe epilepsies into 2 groups, was found to be useful.",
