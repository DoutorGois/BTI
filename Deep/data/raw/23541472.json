     "AB": "The effects of amitraz oral exposure (20, 50 and 80mg/kg bw, 5 days) on brain region monoamine levels of male rats at 30 and 60 days of age were examined. The amitraz-treated rats at the oral doses of 20 and 50mg/kg bw had no visible injury, i.e., any clinical signs of dysfunction observed in any of the animals. However, rats treated with amitraz at the highest dose (80mg/kg bw, 5 days) showed a slight motor incoordination after 1-2h of treatment. These signs were reversible approximately at 6h after dose. After the last dose of amitraz, NE, DA and 5-HT and its metabolites levels were determined in the brain regions hypothalamus, midbrain, prefrontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus by HPLC. Amitraz caused changes in the NE, DA and 5-HT and their metabolite levels in a brain regional-, dose- and age-related manner. In the brain regions studied, amitraz induced a statistically significant increase in 5-HT, NE and DA content with age interaction, but the NE increases in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was without age interaction. Moreover, in the brain regions studied, amitraz induced a statistically significant decrease in the metabolite 5-HIAA, MHPG, DOPAC and HVA levels displaying an age interaction, excepting the 5-HIAA decrease in midbrain and the DOPAC decrease in hypothalamus and striatum which were without age interaction. Furthermore, amitraz evoked a statistically significant decrease in 5-HT, NE and DA turnover in the brain regions studied. The present findings indicate that amitraz significantly altered CNS monoaminergic neurotransmitters in a brain regional-, dose- and age-related manner.",
