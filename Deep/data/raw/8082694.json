     "AB": "The neuroprotective effect of a novel anticonvulsant, zonisamide, was investigated in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. Rats underwent left carotid ligation followed by hypoxic exposure (8% O2) for 2.5 h. When zonisamide (75 mg/kg) was administered i.p. 1 h before hypoxia, it reduced the cortical infarction volume to 6 +/- 5% (mean +/- S.E.M.) from 68 +/- 7% in vehicle-treated controls and the striatal volume to 8 +/- 4% from 78 +/- 7%. Zonisamide also reduced neuronal necrosis in 5 hippocampal regions (the dentate gyrus, CA4, CA3, CA1, and the subiculum). The plasma zonisamide concentration before and after hypoxia was 47.9 +/- 2.0 microgram/ml and 42.3 +/- 3.9 microgram/ml, respectively. Epidural electrodes were implanted in 6 pups one day before hypoxia-ischemia. Electroencephalograms were recorded during hypoxia-ischemia in rats given zonisamide or vehicle before the insult. The intensity of seizure activities was similar in the zonisamide-treated pups and the vehicle-treated controls. These findings demonstrate that zonisamide reduces neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and that this protective effect does not depend on its anticonvulsant action.",
