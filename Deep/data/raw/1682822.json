     "AB": "The reaction of the glutamatergic systems in the rat hippocampus to the withdrawal of cholinergic function after cholinergic degeneration induced by ethylcholine aziridinium (AF64A) was investigated. Furthermore, the question whether blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by MK-801 has an impact on the extent of the cholinergic lesion was addressed. After bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of AF64A (2 nmol/ventricle) the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) started to decline in the hippocampus within 24 h. The reduction of ChAT activity reached its maximum within 4 days (65%) and persisted during the observation period of 65 days. The loss of ChAT activity was accompanied by a transient decline in the level of glutamate, which was most pronounced 1 to 2 days after AF64A (25% reduction). Within 65 days the glutamate level returned to normal. A detailed subdissection of the hippocampus revealed that the cholinergic system was most affected in the ventral part of the hippocampus and the CA3 subfield. On the other hand, the transient reduction in glutamate was restricted to the CA1 and CA3 area. In the dentate gyrus the marked loss of cholinergic function was not accompanied by any reduction in glutamate level. Treatment of the AF64A-injected rats with the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine prevented the decline in glutamate levels. The transient nature of the decline in glutamate as well as its reversal by treatment with pilocarpine are suggestive of an increased release of glutamate in response to the withdrawal of cholinergic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
