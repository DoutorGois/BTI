     "AB": "To identify specific genes involved with epileptogenesis kindling was examined in mice carrying mutations engineered by gene targeting. Amygdala kindling was tested in mice with a null-mutation in the Fyn tyrosine kinase gene, a mutation that raises the threshold for the induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. The fyn mutants had a normal threshold, duration and stability of epileptiform after-discharge, which is crucial for kindling. Despite the normal after-discharge, fyn mutants showed a striking retardation in the rate of kindling. Once the kindled state was established in fyn mutants it remained stable. This implicates a Fyn-dependent biochemical pathway in the induction but not the maintenance of normal amygdala kindling. fyn is the first gene identified to be required for normal epileptogenesis.",
