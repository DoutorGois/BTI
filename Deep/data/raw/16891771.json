     "AB": "Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats lack cholecystokinin-A receptor (CCK-AR) because of a genetic abnormality. We observed that body temperature homeostasis in response to changes in ambient temperature was deteriorated in OLETF rats, while the functions of the signal outputs from the hypothalamus to effectors were not impaired. Deteriorated homeostasis was also seen in CCK-AR deficient (-/-) mice. In the present study, we examined whether the sensory pathway involved in transmitting signals about temperature from the skin to the brain was impaired in OLETF rats. To elucidate the involvement of CCK-AR function, we conducted the same experiment in CCK-AR(-/-) mice. Responses to thermal pain were assessed using the Hargreaves' plantar test apparatus. Shortening of withdrawal latency was observed in OLETF rats compared to control rats, indicating thermal hyperalgesia. Behavioral responses following paw withdrawal were disturbed in OLETF rats. The 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid contents in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of OLETF rats were significantly higher than in those of the controls. CCK-AR(-/-) mice did not show any differences from wild-type mice. In conclusion, OLETF rats showed thermal hyperalgesia and disturbed responses to thermal pain, and an alteration of 5-HT function might have a role in this disturbance.",
