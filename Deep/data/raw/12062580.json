     "AB": "In a previous experiment [Eur J Neurosci 12 (2000) 79], combined intracerebroventricular injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; 150 microg) and 192 IgG-saporin (2 microg) in female rats produced working memory impairments, which neither single lesion induced. In the present experiment, we report on an identical approach in male rats. Behavioral variables were locomotor activity, T-maze alternation, beam-walking, Morris water-maze (working and reference memory) and radial-maze performances. 192 IgG-saporin reduced cholinergic markers in the frontoparietal cortex and the hippocampus. 5,7-DHT lesions reduced serotonergic markers in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Cholinergic lesions induced motor deficits, hyperactivity and reduced T-maze alternation, but had no other effect. Serotonergic lesions only produced hyperactivity and reduced T-maze alternation. Beside the deficits due to cholinergic lesions, rats with combined lesions also showed impaired radial-maze performances. We confirm that 192 IgG-saporin and 5,7-DHT injections can be combined to produce concomitant damage to cholinergic and serotonergic neurons in the brain. In female rats, this technique enabled to show that interactions between serotonergic and basal forebrain cholinergic mechanisms play an important role in cognitive functions. The results of the present experiment in male rats are not as clear-cut, although they are not in obvious contradiction with our previous results in females.",
