     "AB": "To see electrophysiological and neurochemical events during microdialysis with high [K+], direct current (DC) and excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (fEPSPs) due to perforant path stimulation were recorded in the granule cell layer of the fascia dentata, while 3, 25, 50 or 100 mM KCl was perfused through a microdialysis probe placed 1.5 mm from the recording electrode. Glutamate and glutamine content of the dialysate was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Raising [K+] from 3 to 25 mM reduced the efflux of glutamine, without affecting that of glutamate or the electrical activity. In about 50% of experiments, 50 mM K+ induced large (20-30 mV) negative waves of spreading depression (SD), and a suppression of fEPSPs. In the other 50%, without SD, fEPSPs did not change. Glutamate efflux increased 3-fold in both groups. SD waves were produced in all experiments with 100 mM K+ which evoked a more than 10-fold increase in glutamate release. Glutamine efflux decreased equally, by about 50%, with the 3 concentrations of K+. Microdialysis with 20 mM fluoroacetate, a glial metabolic poison, decreased the spontaneous efflux of glutamine and glutamate and increased the incidence of SD waves. Results suggest that perfusion of 50 or 100 mM K+ through a microdialysis probe causes spreading depression which blocks surrounding electrical activity. The activity of glia partly protects against spreading depression caused by high [K+].",
