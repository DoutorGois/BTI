     "AB": "The relationship between electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movements was studied in rabbits during optokinetic, vestibular, and optovestibular tests. EEG was recorded through permanently implanted electrodes. Exposure to noise and vibration increased the frequency and the velocity of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). The increase was greater during vibration but greatest during combined noise and vibration. EEG activity was closely linked to changes in OKN and was particularly evident with the appearance of theta waves in the dorsal hippocampus. Also, rotation of the rabbit produced considerable activation in the EEG.",
