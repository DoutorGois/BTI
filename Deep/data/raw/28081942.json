     "AB": "Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) was recently revealed to be a synaptic player during plasticity events in addition to its well-established role as a general controlling factor in cell proliferation and neuronal growth during development. Alterations of these direct actions of PTEN at synapses may lead to synaptic dysfunction with behavioral and cognitive consequences. A recent paradigmatic example of this situation, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with excessive recruitment of PTEN into synapses leading to pathological synaptic depression. By contrast, some forms of autism are characterized by failure to weaken synaptic connections, which may be related to insufficient PTEN signaling. Understanding the modulation of synaptic function by PTEN in these pathologies may contribute to the development of new therapies.",
