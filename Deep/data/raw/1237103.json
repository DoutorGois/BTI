     "AB": "Following acute tetraethyllead intoxication in rabbits classic neurofibrillary tangles develop. As studied by electron microscopy, such tangles develop in hydropic degenerating neurons and consist primarily of bundles of 200 A diameter smooth tubules of enormous length. In two of 16 animals a few twisted tubules (periodicity of 800 A) also could be found. The significance of these lead-induced twisted tubules, so characteristic of Alzheimer's pre-senile dementia in man, is discussed.",
