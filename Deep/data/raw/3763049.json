     "AB": "Pronounced changes in the content of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) have been found after limbic seizures induced by i.p. injection of kainic acid. Three hours after injection of the toxin a significant decrease in CCK-8 was observed in the frontal cortex and amygdala/pyriform cortex reflecting an increased release during acute seizures. A persistent decrease in the content of the peptide in the amygdala/pyriform cortex suggests destruction of the respective neurons. In the substantia nigra and in the striatum and, more moderately, in the hippocampus and frontal cortex increases in CCK-8 were observed 10 days after injection of kainic acid suggesting an increased synthesis or decreased release of the peptide in these brain areas subsequently to the acute seizures.",
