     "AB": "The fluorescent retrograde tracer, fluorogold, was used to identify commissurally projecting neurons in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. After injection of fluorogold into the hippocampus, the contralateral hippocampus was evaluated for fluorogold-immunoreactive or fluorescent neurons. In addition to observing labeled hilar neurons and CA3 pyramidal cells that previously have been reported to send commissurally projecting axons to the contralateral hippocampus, the authors unexpectedly found a population of fluorogold-labeled cells in the granule cell layer with the morphology and location of GABA-immunoreactive basket cells. Immunocytochemical staining revealed that all fluorogold-labeled cells of the granule cell layer were immunoreactive for parvalbumin. However, not all parvalbumin cells, shown previously to be a subset of GABA neurons, were fluorogold-labeled. The association between fluorogold transport and parvalbumin immunoreactivity was unique for these cells of the granule cell layer. In the adjacent hilus, relatively few of the many fluorogold-labeled cells were parvalbumin- or GABA-immunoreactive. These results (1) identify a population of presumed inhibitory neurons that apparently form commissural projections; (2) document that all of these cells contain the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin; and (3) indicate that the vast majority of commissurally projecting hilar neurons are neither parvalbumin- nor GABA-immunoreactive.",
