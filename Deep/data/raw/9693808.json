     "AB": "Regulation of expression of the voltage-gated chloride channel, C1C-2, was investigated during development and adult life in rat brain. RNase protection assays demonstrated a marked increase in levels of expression of C1C-2 in brain during early postnatal development which was also detected in adult brain. In situ hybridization of E15 and E18 rat brains demonstrated C1C-2 expression in deep brain nuclei and scattered cells within the neuroepithelial layers, but not in the regions of subventricular zone that primarily give rise to glial populations. By E18 all neurons within the emerging cortical plate and its equivalent in other areas of the CNS were heavily labeled. During the first postnatal week, C1C-2 was highly expressed in most neurons. By P7 a pattern of differential expression emerged with evidence of decreased expression of C1C-2 mRNA in many neuronal populations. In adult rat brain, C1C-2 was expressed at highest levels in large neurons as found within layer V of cortex, Ammon's Horn of hippocampus, or mitral cells of the olfactory bulb and Purkinje cells within the cerebellum. Many smaller neurons within the diencephalon maintained significant levels of expression. A functional conductance was readily detected in hippocampal neurons during the first postnatal week, which had the same characteristic properties as the conductance observed in adult neurons. The observed expression and functional presence of C1C-2 suggest a widespread role in neuronal chloride homeostasis in early postnatal life, and demonstrated that cell specific shut-down resulted in the adult pattern of expression.",
