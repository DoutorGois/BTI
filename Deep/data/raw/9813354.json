     "AB": "In humans, cortical malformations are highly epileptogenic. In rats, prenatal treatment with methylazoxymethanol (MAM) cause a diffuse cortical malformation that is yet not associated with seizures. We performed rapid hippocampal kindling in MAM and control rats. We show that MAM rats present (i) a lower initial afterdischarge threshold; (ii) a more rapid progression to generalized seizures. We conclude that MAM rats may serve as models for human epileptogenic cortical malformations.",
