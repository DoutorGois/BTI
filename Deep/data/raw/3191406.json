     "AB": "The content of cytosolic and membrane-bound calmodulin was radioimmunologically determined in fractions of rat hippocampal slices 5 min to 7 hours after long-term potentiation (LTP) had been induced by tetanization or exposure of slices to 4 mM Ca++. In light of concepts presuming multistage dynamics in LTP development as reflecting different cellular mechanisms, similar patterns of calmodulin alterations were observed with both models: The alterations in calmodulin content occurred during the early phase(s) of LTP development and continued for two and one hours during tetanic- and calcium-induced LTP, respectively. Thus, 5-30 min after LTP elicitation, membrane-bound calmodulin increased while cytosolic calmodulin diminished and, inversely, 30 min later an increase in cytosolic and decrease in membrane-bound calmodulin were observed. Consequently, the present results indicate that calmodulin was involved in the early phases(s) of LTP development in terms of a two-step translocation sequence. Hence, calmodulin translocation within both intracellular compartments may reflect the involvement of Ca++-calmodulin-dependent intraneuronal metabolic processes which might induce and/or temporarily maintain neuronal functional changes occurring immediately after repeated or intense stimulation of synaptic functions.",
