     "AB": "Taste memories are amongst the most important kinds of memories, as adequate identification of safe and toxic edibles will determine the subject's survival. Despite the well-established role that the medial temporal lobe plays in consolidation of memory, specific contributions of the different regions of the temporal lobe to taste memory consolidation remain unknown. In the present report, we assessed the participation of perirhinal cortex (Ph), dorsal hippocampus (Hipp), basolateral (BLA) and central nuclei of the amygdala (CeA) in safe and aversive taste memories by means of local infusions of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin in the rat. The results showed that protein synthesis in the CeA, but not BLA, is required to stabilize taste aversion memory. Surprisingly, the Ph and Hipp seem to be essential to consolidate safe taste memory. These data suggest that different networks within the temporal lobe are recruited to consolidate memory depending on the consequences associated with tastes.",
