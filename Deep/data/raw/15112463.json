     "AB": "For many years, investigators have been trying to identify the neuroanatomical structures responsible for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, specifically depression and schizophreniform disorders. The available data were based on observations made in neurological patients who developed a psychiatric comorbid disorder following the neurologic insult. With the advances in high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and functional neuroimaging studies, we have witnessed in the last decade a wealth of new data that identify structural neuroimaging changes in mesial temporal structures, prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia in major depressive disorders. The purpose of this article is to briefly review the published data on neuroanatomical structural changes associated with major depressive and bipolar disorders.",
