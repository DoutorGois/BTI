     "AB": "Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) is a bacterial superantigen that induces pronounced T cell expansion and cytokine production. In addition, SEA activates the HPA axis and forebrain regions relevant to cognitive functions. Since learning-related cognitive changes have not been assessed in response to SEA, spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) was determined in male C57BL/6J mice subjected to acute or repeated injections of 5mug SEA or Saline. Injections were given 2h prior to 4-5days of hidden platform sessions. Animals were then rested for 1month and given retraining without further injections. In addition, splenic IL-1beta, IL-2 and TNFalpha, plasma corticosterone, and hippocampal IL-1beta and TNFalpha were measured after the regimen of treatment used in the behavioral experiments. The results showed no learning impairment following acute or repeated SEA challenge. Moreover, when retested 1month later, and without further injections, the SEA group showed more rapid relearning of the MWM. This suggested that coincidental superantigenic T cell activation and training served to promote long-term improvement in recovery of learning. Furthermore, repeated SEA challenge continued to drive increases in plasma corticosterone, but with a compensatory reduction in hippocampal IL-1beta. However, while hippocampal TNFalpha was reduced after acute and repeated SEA treatment, this was not statistically significant. In view of the importance of modest glucocorticoid elevations and hippocampal IL-1beta in promoting contextual learning, the data point to the hypothesis that SEA promotes long-term plasticity by restraining disruptive increases in hippocampal IL-1beta, and possibly TNFalpha, during learning.",
