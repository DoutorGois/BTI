     "AB": "Calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels governs important aspects of CNS development. Multiple alternative splicings of the pore-forming alpha(1) subunits have been evidenced in adult brain but little information about their expression during ontogenesis is presently available. The aim of this study was to focus on the expression of three rat voltage-gated calcium channel alpha(1A) splice variants (alpha(1A-a), alpha(1A-b) and alpha(1A-EFe)) during brain ontogenesis in vivo. Using a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction strategy, we found that the three isoforms have different timings of development throughout the brain: alpha(1A-b) is expressed from embryonic to the adult stage, alpha(1A--EFe) is restricted to the embryonic period whereas alpha(1A-a) is expressed only postnatally. In situ hybridization indicated that alpha(1A-a) and alpha(1A-b) isoforms develop with different regional and cellular patterns. In hippocampus and cerebellum, alpha(1A-b) represented the predominant isoform at all developmental stages. Taken together, these data reveal that alternative RNA splicing may modulate the alpha(1A) calcium channel properties during development.",
