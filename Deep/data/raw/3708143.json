     "AB": "The effects of kyotorphin (Tyr-Arg) on CA1 and CA3 field responses were studied on rat hippocampal slice preparations. Slice perfusion with 10(-6)-10(-4) M of kyotorphin resulted in reactivity changes both in mossy fibers (CA3) and Schaffer collaterals (CA1). The principal effect was the increase in pop-spike amplitude. Kyotrophin (10(-6)-10(-5) M) and metenkephalin (10(-7)-10(-6) M) were found to produce similar reactivity changes (facilitation) in CA1 region of most preparations. However, kyotorphin effect, in contrast to enkephalin-induced facilitation was not blocked by naloxone. The data suggest that the mechanisms of kyotorphin action in the hippocamp are not related to endogenous enkephalin release.",
