     "AB": "Endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs) mobilized from postsynaptic cells activate presynaptic cannabinoid receptors and thereby inhibit synaptic transmitter release. The inhibition can be either brief (seconds) or long-lasting (minutes to hours). Recent studies provide insight into the presynaptic mechanisms responsible for long-lasting, eCB-mediated long-term depression. Among these, the proteins PKA and RIM1alpha appear to be crucial, although other possibilities are emerging.",
