     "AB": "We investigated the distribution of somatostatin receptors (SSTs) in the hippocampi of SR (seizure-resistant) and SS (seizure-sensitive) gerbils in order to characterize the alterations in SST expressions induced by seizure activity. SST2A immunodensity in the hippocampus of SS gerbils was lower than that of SR gerbils, though its localization in the hippocampus was similar in both SR and SS gerbils. SST3 immunodensity in the hippocampus of SS gerbils was lower than in SR gerbils. In SR gerbils, strong SST4 immunoreactivity was detected in the dentate gyrus and in the CA3 region, in contrast little immunoreactivity was detected in these regions in SS gerbils. In SR and SS gerbils, the strong SST5 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was also detected in the stratum oriens of the CA2-3 regions and the septal area of CA1 region. However, SST5 immunodensity in the stratum radiatum in SS gerbils was lower than in SR gerbils. These results are the first comprehensive description of the distribution of SSTs in the normal and epileptic hippocampus of gerbils, and suggest that these alterations in the hippocampus of the SS gerbil may be related with a regulatory mechanism for seizure activity in these seizure prone animals.",
