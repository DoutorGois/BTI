     "AB": "The neuroprotective effects of NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline) were assessed on hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss and locomotor hyperactivity following transient bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) in the gerbil. NBQX, a selective blocker of the AMPA glutamate receptor subtype, was injected 1 h after 5 or 10 min BCAO, or sham surgery. Both 5 and 10 min ischemia produced equivalent hyperactivity 3 days post ischemia and CA1 neuronal loss on Day 4, while activity was unchanged in the sham-operated group. NBQX protected from both hippocampal damage and post-ischemic hyperactivity. These results demonstrate that NBQX can protect from behavioral pathology induced by global cerebral ischemia.",
