     "AB": "We previously identified a family of novel developmentally regulated genes: BRINP1, 2, and 3, which are predominantly and widely expressed in the CNS from earlier developmental stages to adulthood. In the present study, we investigated the activity-dependent regulation of BRINP expression in the CNS. Among the three BRINP genes, BRINP1-mRNA was specifically up-regulated in the dentate gyrus of mouse hippocampus by kainic acid treatment. In cultured hippocampal neurons, the induction of BRINP1-mRNA was also observed by the activation of glutamate receptors. Although BDNF-mRNA is up-regulated in a similar activity-dependent manner, BDNF itself did not induce BRINP1-mRNA. From these results, the physiological roles of the activity-dependent induction of BRINP1-mRNA are discussed.",
