     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Emerging research demonstrates that aerobic-based physical activity is favourably associated with episodic memory function. Despite resistance exercises being associated with a multitude of health outcomes, independent of aerobic physical activity, less research has examined the effects of resistance exercise on episodic memory function. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review to examine the extent to which resistance exercise may be associated with episodic memory function. METHODS: Computerized searches were performed in PubMed, PsychInfo and Sports Discuss. Studies were included if they employed an experimental, cross-sectional or prospective study design, and included acute or chronic resistance exercise as the independent variable, with episodic memory function as the outcome variable. RESULTS: Eight experimental (one acute and seven chronic training studies) studies met the study inclusionary criteria. Seven of these studies were published in the last 5 years, highlighting the infancy of this line of research. Only three of the eight evaluated studies provided evidence of a positive effect of resistance exercise on memory function; within each of these three studies, there was also some indication of null (or unfavourable) effects. CONCLUSION: The findings of this systematic review do not provide compelling evidence for a beneficial effect of acute or chronic resistance exercise on episodic memory function. Additional research in this under-investigated field is warranted.",
