     "AB": "The present study was to investigate the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the rats with hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) on apoptosis of cultured hippocampal neurons in neonate rats under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Adult Wistar rats were exposed to 3 h of hypoxia for HPC, and then their CSF was taken out. Cultured hippocampal neurons from the neonate rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6): normal control group, OGD group, normal CSF group and HPC CSF group. OGD group received 1.5 h of incubation in glucose-free Earle's solution containing 1 mmol/L Na2S2O4, and normal and HPC CSF groups were subjected to 1 d of corresponding CSF treatments followed by 1.5 h OGD. The apoptosis of neurons was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscope and flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double staining. Moreover, protein expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by immunofluorescence. The results showed that few apoptotic cells were observed in normal control group, whereas the number of apoptotic cells was greatly increased in OGD group. Both normal and HPC CSF could decrease the apoptosis of cultured hippocampal neurons injured by OGD (P < 0.01). Notably, the protective effect of HPC CSF was stronger than that of normal one (P < 0.01). Compared to OGD group, normal and HPC CSF groups both showed significantly higher levels of Bcl-2 (P < 0.01), and Bcl-2 expression level in HPC CSF group was even higher than that in normal CSF group (P < 0.01). Whereas the expressions of Bax in normal and HPC CSF groups were significantly lower than that in OGD group (P < 0.01), and the Bax expression in HPC CSF group was even lower than that in normal CSF group (P < 0.01). These results suggest that CSF from hypoxic-preconditioned rats could degrade apoptotic rate of OGD-injured hippocampal neurons by up-regulating expression of Bcl-2 and down-regulating expression of Bax.",
