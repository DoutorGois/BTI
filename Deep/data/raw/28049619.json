     "AB": "Brain metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of schizophrenia-like symptoms arising from increased glutamate transmission in the forebrain. However, there does not exist a reliable tool for the study of mGluR2 in human neuroimaging. The purpose of this study was to radiosynthesize 1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4-(4-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydrop yridine-3-carbonitrile ([(11)C]CMDC) and evaluate its potential as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging mGluR2 in the rat brain. CMDC, a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR2, showed potent functional activity (EC50: 98nM) for human mGluR2 in vitro. [(11)C]CMDC was synthesized by O-[(11)C]methylation of 1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine -3-carbonitrile (1) with [(11)C]methyl iodide. [(11)C]CMDC (2.2+/-0.9GBq; n=20) was obtained from [(11)C]CO2 of 14.0-17.8GBq with >98% radiochemical purity and 86-150GBq/mumol specific activity at the end of synthesis. In vitro autoradiography indicated that [(11)C]CMDC binding was expressed (>50% of total binding) in mGluR2-rich brain regions including the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. However, small-animal PET showed low in vivo specific binding of [(11)C]CMDC in the rat brain. While [(11)C]CMDC has limited potential as a PET tracer for brain mGluR2, it can be used to develop new radiotracers with improved behaviors.",
