     "AB": "Voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs) are important in regulating a variety of cellular functions in neurons. It remains poorly understood how VGCCs with different functions are sorted within neurons. Here we show that the t-complex testis-expressed 1 (tctex1) protein, a light-chain subunit of the dynein motor complex, interacts directly and selectively with N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, but not L-type Ca(2+) channels. The interaction is insensitive to Ca(2+). Overexpression in hippocampal neurons of a channel fragment containing the binding domain for tctex1 significantly decreases the surface expression of endogenous N- and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels but not L-type Ca(2+) channels, as determined by immunostaining. Furthermore, disruption of the tctex1-Ca(2+) channel interaction significantly reduces the Ca(2+) current density in hippocampal neurons. These results underscore the importance of the specific tctex1-channel interaction in determining sorting and trafficking of neuronal Ca(2+) channels with different functionalities.",
