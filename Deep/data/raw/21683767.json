     "AB": "Stress effects on learning and memory are widely recognized, but less agreement exists on whether they are positive or negative as well as on their neuronal and neuromolecular correlates. Stress involves expression of certain genes such as neurotrophin BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), which is also involved in learning, but results are not consistent. Here effects of stress on memory and BDNF expression were studied using on adult male rats exposed to \"immobilization stress\" for various \"short\" durations, i.e., 1-h, 3-h, 5-h and \"long-term\" ones (2-h/day for 1 week). Learning and memory was measured using passive avoidance testing (STL=step-through-latency scores) as well as plasma corticosterone (CSt) levels and hippocampal BDNF gene expression. CSt increased in the 3-h and longer stressed groups but differences were significant in the 5-h and 1-week stressed subgroups. Three and 5-h of stress markedly and significantly (60-69%, p<0.01) decreased memory retention in the stressed animals, while 1-h of stress had no effect; prolonged stress (2-h daily for 1-week) increased memory significantly (33%, p<0.05). Hippocampal BDNF gene expression increased in the 1-h and 3-h stressed groups (44%, p<0.05 and 71%, p<0.01); but this parameter steadily declined in the 5-h stressed group (26%, p<0.05) and weeklong stressed group (6%, not significant). Statistical analysis revealed an apparent but significant negative correlation between changes in memory and those of BDNF gene expression, indicating that BDNF may possibly play a compensatory role, reversing deleterious effects of stress on hippocampal memory functions.",
