     "AB": "The accumulation of lipopigment may indicate ageing, certain diseases and cellular damage, while phenytoin, which has been claimed to cause selective clinical cerebellar dysfunction and degeneration, has been reported to produce increased lipopigment accumulation in rat Purkinje neurones. In the present study, 8 rats received phenytoin, 300 mg/kg/day for 20 weeks, and were compared with a control group of 9 rats in respect of lipopigment in Purkinje and hippocampal neurones. Neuronal lipopigment was identified by fluorescence microscopy. The results did not indicate that phenytoin administration was associated with an increase in the area corresponding to (i.e. within the outlines of) neuronal lipopigment in Purkinje neurones, although the relatively small number of animals limits the power of the study. However, in hippocampal neurones, a two-way analysis of variance for numbers of discrete regions of lipopigment demonstrated a significant interaction (P = 0.003) between, firstly, size categories of discrete regions of lipopigment and, secondly, phenytoin administration or a control procedure. In hippocampal neurones, phenytoin administration was accompanied by a decrease in the numbers of discrete lipopigment regions in the smaller size categories and an increase in the numbers in the larger size categories. This finding indicates the need for further investigation into the effects of phenytoin on brain regions other than the cerebellum, as intellectual deterioration may be related to chronic use of this drug.",
