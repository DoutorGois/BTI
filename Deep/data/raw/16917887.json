     "AB": "Adrenarche, the prepubertal onset of adrenal production of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), is a distinctive aspect of the human life course. Yet its evolutionary origins remain unexplained. Production of DHEAS is associated with the development of the zona reticularis, a novel histological layer within the adrenal gland, derived from the fetal adrenal gland, and associated with primates more generally. Evidence that DHEAS is a neurosteroid, together with the fact that increases in DHEAS parallel patterns of cortical maturation from approximately age 6 years to the mid-20s, suggests that DHEAS may play an important role in extended brain maturation among humans. DHEAS has demonstrated effects on mood in humans, and acts at neuron receptor sites. I suggest three ways in which DHEAS may play a role in human brain maturation: 1) increasing activity of the amgydala; 2) increasing activity of the hippocampus; and 3) promoting synaptogenesis within the cortex. I propose that associated changes in fearfulness and anxiety, and memory, could act to increase social interaction with nonfamiliar individuals and shape cognitive development. Comparison with the African apes suggests that the timing of adrenarche in chimpanzees may be similar to that in humans, though the full course of age-related changes in DHEAS and their relationship to reproductive and brain maturation are not clear. The role of DHEAS as a physiological mechanism supporting increased brain development, extended life span, and decreased sexual dimorphism is most compatible with Kaplan et al.'s (2000) theory of the evolution of human life history and intergenerational transfers.",
