     "AB": "The long-term effects of haloperidol on phosphoinositide turnover in rat brain slices were investigated. Continuous treatment with haloperidol decanoate (21 mg/kg I.M. biweekly for 6 weeks) significantly attenuated carbachol- and norepinephrine (NE)-induced inositol phosphate accumulation in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. In the striatum, the haloperidol treatment also significantly decreased carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate level but did not significantly affect NE-sensitive phosphoinositide turnover. These effects were not observed in rats treated with a single dose of haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg). Basel levels of inositol phosphate in these 3 brain regions did not change following continuous or single haloperidol doses.",
