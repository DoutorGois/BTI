     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia predominantly affecting the elderly. It is believed that soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers are involved in the pathogenesis of AD, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. OBJECTIVES: Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction likely plays a critical role in Abeta-induced neuronal degeneration. Previously, we demonstrated that Abeta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) induce reduced mitochondrial density in neurites, and we suspect that an impaired mitochondrial trafficking might be involved, which is tested in this study. METHODS: Using live cell imaging, anterograde and retrograde transport of mitochondria in primary hippocampal neurons treated with sub-lethal doses of ADDLs was measured. RESULTS: We found that ADDLs induced significant impairment in both anterograde and retrograde transport of mitochondria along axons. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that an impaired mitochondrial transport likely contributes to ADDL-induced abnormal mitochondrial distribution and dysfunction and also reinforce the idea that axonal transport is likely involved in AD pathogenesis.",
