     "AB": "Even in the absence of neurodegenerative diseases, progressing age often coincides with cognitive decline and morphological changes. However, longitudinal studies that directly link these two processes are missing. In this proof-of-concept study we therefore performed repeated within-subject testing of healthy male R26R mice in a spatial learning task in combination with manganese-enhanced volumetric MRI analyses at the ages of 8, 16, and 24 months. We grouped the mice into good and poor performers (n = 6, each), based on their spatial learning abilities at the age of 24 months. Using this stratification, we failed to detect a priori volume differences, but observed a significant decrease in total hippocampal volume over time for both groups. Interestingly, this volume decrease was specific for the dorsal hippocampus and significantly accelerated in poor performers between 16 and 24 months of age. This is the first time that individual changes in hippocampal volume were traced alongside cognitive performance within the same subjects over 1(1/2) years. Our study points to a causal link between volume loss of the dorsal hippocampus and cognitive impairments. In addition, it suggests accelerated degenerative processes rather than a priori volume differences as determining trajectories of age-related cognitive decline. Despite the relatively small sample sizes, the strong behavioral and moderate morphological alterations demonstrate the general feasibility of longitudinal studies of age-related decline in cognition and hippocampus integrity.
