     "AB": "Diazepam was shown to increase postexcitatory inhibition within the brain cortex as revealed by its influence upon the recovery cycles both of intracortical and primary responses. The specific interrelationship between diazepam and some drugs affecting brain GABA level suggests the possibility of a GABA mediated mechanism in the diazepam effect. The sensitivity of the brain cortex to diazepam is not lower than that of the amygdala and significantly higher than that of the hippocampus.",
