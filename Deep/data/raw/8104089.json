     "AB": "Participation of muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors in the modulation of long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied in the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse of guinea pig hippocampal slices. The magnitude of tetanus-induced LTP was attenuated in the presence of 0.01-0.1 microM carbachol, at which concentration the pre-tetanus amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) was not affected. The attenuation of LTP by the low concentration of carbachol was reversed by an M2 muscarinic antagonist, AF-DX 116, but not by an M1 antagonist, pirenzepine. On the contrary, a high concentration (10 microM) of carbachol decreased the pre-tetanic amplitude of fEPSP, however, the magnitude of LTP was significantly larger than that in control slices in which pre-tetanic amplitude of fEPSP was reduced to the level of carbachol-treated slices by reducing the intensity of stimulation or extracellular Ca2+ concentration. The augmentation of LTP by 10 microM carbachol was blocked by pirenzepine but not by AF-DX 116. These results suggest that the synaptic plasticity in the guinea pig hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapse is inhibited and facilitated by muscarinic agonist through muscarinic M2 and M1 receptors to inhibit and facilitate the LTP, respectively.",
