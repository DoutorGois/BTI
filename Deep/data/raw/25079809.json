     "AB": "Amyloid-beta peptides such as Abeta1-42 (Abeta42) play a pivotal role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abeta42 is neurotoxic and can activate microglial cells. These cells in turn migrate toward senile (neuritic) plaques and help to clear Abeta deposits through an endocytotic mechanism. It is of potential significance to characterize the Abeta42 receptors that mediate microglia chemotaxis and Abeta42 uptake. We found that the transcript of the chemerin receptor CMKLR1 was upregulated in the brain of AD patients and in mouse brain tissue following systemic LPS administration. CMKLR1 and Abeta42 colocalized in hippocampus and cortex of AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic mice. Moreover, Abeta42 bound specifically to CMKLR1 in stably transfected rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells (CMKLR1-RBL), suggesting that CMKLR1 is a receptor for Abeta42. Abeta42 induced migration of primary microglia, the mouse microglial cell line N9, and CMKLR1-RBL cells, but not untransfected RBL-2H3 cells. Mechanistic studies showed that Abeta42 induced CMKLR1-dependent cell migration through activation of the ERK1/2, PKA, and Akt pathways, but not Ca2+ mobilization. Abeta42 stimulation of CMKLR1-RBL cells and primary glial cells led to internalization of the Abeta42-CMKLR1 complex, suggesting a potential role for CMKLR1 in Abeta42 clearance. Taken together, these results indicate that Abeta42 activates CMKLR1, leading to glia cell migration and clearance of Abeta42. CMKLR1 is a new addition to the repertoire of cell surface molecules that are responsible for Abeta processing and clearance.",
