     "AB": "It appears that aberrant but functional circuitry can rapidly develop after removal of particular afferent projections. The parameters describing this process appear to vary according to (1) the age at which the experimental manipulation was performed, (2) the specific afferent being studied, and (3) the particular input which is eliminated or possibly the brain region which is deafferented. It must also be emphasized that abnormal growth is not always found after lesions even in situations which a priori appear appropriate. Hopefully, these anatomical and physiological results obtained in a relatively \"simple\" brain system will be of help in evaluating the role played by abnormal wiring in the development of behavioral deficits.",
