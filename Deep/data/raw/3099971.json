     "AB": "Rats treated with amphetamine exhibited an increase in hippocampal acetylcholine turnover, as determined by a mass fragmentographic technique. However, administration of amphetamine to rats which had received stereotaxically placed bilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine in the ventral noradrenergic bundle 10 days previously did not increase hippocampal acetylcholine turnover. Because the ventral noradrenergic bundle projects to the septal area, it is suggested that amphetamine increases acetylcholine turnover in the hippocampus by an action on noradrenergic neurons in this pathway.",
