     "AB": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of worldwide disability and mortality. Currently, the incidence and prevalence of TBI is markedly increasing and an effective therapy is lacking. Therapeutic hypothermia (3235 C) has been reported to reduce intracranial pressure and induce putative neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of mild induced hypothermia (MIH) on the expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) and glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) in the hippocampus following TBI in rats. A rat model of TBI was created using a modified weightdrop device, followed by 4 h of hypothermia (33 C) or normothermia (37 C). A wetdry weight method was used to assess brain edema and spatial learning ability was evaluated using a Morris water maze. The levels of Cx43 and GLT1 were detected by immunohistochemical and western blot analysis, respectively. The results demonstrated that MIH treatment improved TBIinduced brain edema and neurological function deficits. In addition, therapeutic MIH significantly downregulated Cx43 expression and upregulated the levels of GLT1 in the hippocampus postTBI. These findings suggested that treatment with MIH may provide a novel neuroprotective therapeutic strategy for TBI through reversing the increase in Cx43 protein and the decrease in GLT1.",
