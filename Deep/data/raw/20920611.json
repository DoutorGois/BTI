     "AB": "The assumption that disease specific risk factors are similar or the same in men and women may lead to incorrect primary prevention strategies. This study focused on the evaluation of gender-specific Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors. In AD, female gender appears to be an important risk factor associated with the aberrant production of beta amyloid (betaA) peptides. Although decreased levels in plasma DHA concentration are associated with cognitive decline in healthy elderly and Alzheimer's patients, pre-treatment with DHA significantly reduced the survival of cortical neurons incubated with beta amyloid (betaA). Hence, in the presence of an increasing amount of betaA, paradoxically women - who have higher plasma levels of DHA - are more likely to develop AD. Aspirin (ASA) converts cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 into a form that generates new neuroprotective docosanoids from DHA; therefore, ASA might positively resolve the paradoxical effect of the concomitant presence of DHA and betaA.",
