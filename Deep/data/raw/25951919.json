     "AB": "Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs) are single-spanning transmembrane proteins that belong to the family of synaptically localized adhesion molecules that play various roles in the formation, maturation, and function of synapses. LRRTMs are highly localized in the post-synaptic density; however, the mechanisms and significance of LRRTM synaptic clustering remain unclear. Here, we focus on the intracellular domain of LRRTMs and investigate its role in cell surface expression and synaptic clustering. The deletion of 55-56 residues in the cytoplasmic tail caused significantly reduced synaptic clustering of LRRTM1-4 in rat hippocampal neurons, whereas it simultaneously resulted in augmented LRRTM1-2 cell surface expression. A series of deletions and further single amino acid substitutions in the intracellular domain of LRRTM2 demonstrated that a previously uncharacterized sequence at the region of -16 to -13 from the C-terminus was responsible for efficient synaptic clustering and proper cell surface trafficking of LRRTMs. Furthermore, the clustering-deficient LRRTM2 mutant lost the ability to promote the accumulation of post-synaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). These results suggest that trafficking to the cell surface and synaptic clustering of LRRTMs are regulated by a specific mechanism through this novel sequence in the intracellular domain that underlies post-synaptic molecular assembly and maturation. Leucine-rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs) are synaptic cell adhesion molecules promoting synapse formation. LRRTMs are highly localized in the postsynaptic density. We report amino acid sequence YxxC in the intracellular domain of LRRTMs is responsible for the postsynaptic localization of LRRTMs. This novel amino acid sequence of LRRTMs facilitates synapse maturation. We propose this regulated synaptic clustering of LRRTMs by the intracellular domain presents a novel molecular mechanism of synapse maturation.",
