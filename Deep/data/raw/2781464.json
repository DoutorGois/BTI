     "AB": "The distribution of muscarinic-M2 receptors in rat brain was investigated by in vitro autoradiography using [3H]AF-DX 116, a putative probe for the muscarinic-M2 receptor subtype. Incubation of rat brain coronal sections with 10 nM [3H]AF-DX 116 showed highest binding site densities in discrete areas such as the superior colliculus and certain thalamic and brainstem nuclei, similar to the distribution reported for [2H]acetylcholine/M2 sites. [3H]AF-DX 116 site densities were markedly lower in forebrain areas such as cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, in contrast to the distribution seen for [3H]pirenzepine-M1 binding sites, which were concentrated in these forebrain areas; however, differential patterns of labeling were observed for the two muscarinic-M2 probes, [3H]AF-DX 116 and [3H]acetylcholine, in the hippocampal formation. Although [3H]AF-DX 116 binding was broadly distributed in multiple subfields of the hippocampus, [3H]acetylcholine binding was discretely distributed in a manner resembling that of acetylcholinesterase staining. This suggests the existence of muscarinic-M2 subtypes in the CNS, especially in the hippocampal formation.",
