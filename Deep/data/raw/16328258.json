     "AB": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity in slice cultures of the young rat hippocampus were comparable to previously reported synaptic plasticity and metaplasticity in acute adult hippocampal slices. This is relevant since differences do exist between the preparations as a result of age and the ex vivo maintenance. We prepared and maintained slice cultures from 5- to 6-day-old rats according to the porous membrane method. After 12-16 days in vitro, extracellular low-frequency stimulation (LFS) and high-frequency stimulation (HFS) protocols were applied to the Schaffer collaterals, and extracellular field potentials were recorded in area CA1. LFS and HFS induced long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), respectively. LTP could be reversed by LFS, as could LTD by HFS 60 min after induction. Plotting the amount of LTD and LTP versus stimulation protocol demonstrated frequency-dependence of the sign and extent of plasticity. Priming activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with DHPG facilitated subsequent LTP, revealing a metaplastic effect similar to that observed in acute slices. Immunohistochemistry for group 1 mGluR subtypes mGluR1alpha and mGluR5 showed both receptors to be present in these cultures. We conclude that synaptic plasticity and mGluR-mediated metaplasticity are largely comparable to those effects found in acute in vitro techniques.",
