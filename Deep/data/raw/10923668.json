     "AB": "Glutamate transporters are essential for the homeostasis of glutamate and normal function of glutamatergic synapses. Their function was shown to be regulated by redox agents and dimerizations that involves redox changes of cysteine residues. Peptide neurotoxins are also known to be rich in cysteine residues that contribute to their activity and stability. Among them is the toxin Tx3-4, from the spider Phoneutria nigriventer, which is able to inhibit glutamate uptake in rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Based on results obtained with manipulation of the redox state of cysteine residues in synaptosomes and in Tx3-4, we suggest that the effect of this toxin on glutamate uptake is due to interactions that involve cysteines both in the toxin and in the transporters.",
