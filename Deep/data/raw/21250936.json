     "AB": "Neurological diseases and related conditions affect an estimated 1 billion of individuals worldwide [1]. There is still no cure for neurological diseases and disorders, barely a few treatments more or less efficient. This mandates the design and development of novel paradigms and strategies, to discover and develop new treatments and cures for these diseases. Neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain of mammals primarily in two regions, the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, in various species including in humans. Neural progenitor and stem cells have been isolated, propagated and characterized in vitro from the adult brain of mammals, including humans. The confirmation that neurogenesis occurs in the adult brain and neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in the adult central nervous system (CNS) of mammals, opens new avenues and opportunities for treating neurological diseases and injuries [2].",
