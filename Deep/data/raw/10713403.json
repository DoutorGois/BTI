     "AB": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been reported to support the survival of cultured brain neurons. In the present study, we investigated whether the neurotrophic effect of EGF is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Recombinant human EGF (0.1-10 ng/ml) induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) in a concentration-and time-dependent manner. EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and promotion of neuronal survival were both blocked by U0126 and PD98059, inhibitors of the MAPK-activating enzyme MEK. These results suggest that the MEK/ERK signal transduction cascade is involved in the neurotrophic effect of EGF.",
