     "AB": "In vitro addition or pretreatment with >/=1 microM ferrous chloride markedly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner [3H]dizocilpine (MK-801) binding to an open ion channel associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in rat brain synaptic membranes. The addition of NMDA agonists invariably attenuated the inhibition of [3H]MK-801 binding in hippocampal synaptic membranes previously treated with ferrous chloride, without significantly affecting that in cerebellar synaptic membranes. In the absence of spermidine, ferrous chloride was more potent in inhibiting binding in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in adult rats than in those in rats at 3 days after birth, while in the striatum [3H]MK-801 binding was 10 times more sensitive to inhibition by added ferrous chloride in neonatal rats than in adult rats. Addition of spermidine significantly attenuated the potency of ferrous chloride to inhibit binding in the cerebral cortex of adult rats, with facilitation of the inhibition in newborn rats. Moreover, spermidine significantly reduced the inhibitory potency of ferrous chloride in neonatal rat striatum, without markedly affecting that in adult rat striatum. These results suggest that ferrous ions may interfere with opening processes of the native NMDA channel through molecular mechanisms peculiar to neuronal development in a manner associated with the polyamine recognition domain.",
