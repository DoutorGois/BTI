     "AB": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an endogenous intestinal peptide that enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Its natural cleavage product GLP-1(9-36)(amide) possesses distinct properties and does not affect insulin secretion. Here we report that pretreatment of hippocampal slices with GLP-1(9-36)(amide) prevented impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) and enhanced long-term depression induced by exogenous amyloid beta peptide Abeta((1-42)). Similarly, hippocampal LTP impairments in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mutant mice that model Alzheimer's disease (AD) were prevented by GLP-1(9-36)(amide). In addition, treatment of APP/PS1 mice with GLP-1(9-36)(amide) at an age at which they display impaired spatial and contextual fear memory resulted in a reversal of their memory defects. At the molecular level, GLP-1(9-36)(amide) reduced elevated levels of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species and restored dysregulated Akt-glycogen synthase kinase-3beta signaling in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Our findings suggest that GLP-1(9-36)(amide) treatment may have therapeutic potential for AD and other diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction.",
