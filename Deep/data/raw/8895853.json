     "AB": "Alterations in ryanodine binding and local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were examined at 30 minutes and 2 hours post-ischemia in the gerbil brain in order to evaluate the influence of cerebral ischemia on the intracellular channels of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Severe hemispheric cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the right common carotid artery. LCBF was measured at the end of the experiment using [14C]iodoantipyrine method, and the ryanodine binding was evaluated in vitro using [3H]ryanodine as a specific ligand for CICR channels. An autoradiographic method developed in our laboratory enabled us to determine both parameters within the same brain. A group of gerbils who underwent a sham procedure served as controls. LCBF was found to be significantly reduced in most of the cerebral regions on the occluded side at both 30 minutes as well as 2 hours post-ischemia. In contrast, a significant reduction in ryanodine binding was noted only in the hippocampus CA1 on the occluded side at 30 minutes and 2 hours after the occlusion. These findings suggest that regionally specific changes of CICR may be the cause of decreased ryanodine binding in the hippocampus CA1, and that these changes may be related to the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause this region to be particularly vulnerable to ischemia.",
