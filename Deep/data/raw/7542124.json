     "AB": "These experiments investigated in the rat the impact on spatial delayed non-matching to sample and on acquisition of the Morris water maze of (i) AMPA-induced lesions of the medial septal nucleus, which produced a marked reduction of hippocampal choline acetyltransferase activity and acetylcholine levels (measured using in vivo dialysis) together with lesser reductions in cholinergic markers in the cingulate cortex and (ii) similar AMPA-induced lesions of the vertical limb nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (vDB), which produced more marked reductions in cholinergic markers in the cingulate cortex than in the hippocampus. Medial septal lesions produced a delay-dependent deficit in spatial working memory, while lesions of the vDB resulted in a delay-independent performance deficit. In addition, rats with vDB lesions adopted biased response strategies during the imposition of long delays. Neither lesion significantly affected the acquisition of a spatial reference memory task, the Morris water maze. The results are discussed in terms of cholinergic- and GABAergic-dependent functions of the hippocampal formation and cingulate cortex in spatial short-term and reference memory.",
