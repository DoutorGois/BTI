     "AB": "A rabbit antiserum to neuropeptide Y (NPY) was used to develop a radioimmunoassay for measuring NPY in brain tissue. By high-performance liquid chromatography, two peaks of immunoreactivity were detected in human postmortem cortex. A minor peak was seen at the void volume, while the majority of immunoreactivity comigrated with synthetic NPY standards. Using the Spokes-Koch rat model simulating human autopsy conditions, it was shown that cortical, hippocampal and striatal concentrations of NPY-like immunoreactivity are stable for up to 24 h.",
