     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that beta amyloid (Abeta) peptide triggers the activation of several signal transduction cascades in the hippocampus, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. In this study we sought to characterize the cellular localization of phosphorylated, active ERK in organotypic hippocampal cultures after acute exposure to either Abeta (1-42) or nicotine. RESULTS: We observed that Abeta and nicotine increased the levels of active ERK in distinct cellular localizations. We also examined whether phospho-ERK was regulated by redox signaling mechanisms and found that increases in active ERK induced by Abeta and nicotine were blocked by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling is required for Abeta-induced activation of ERK, and suggest a similar mechanism may occur during early stages of Alzheimer's disease.",
