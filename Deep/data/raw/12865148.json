     "AB": "An electrode drive is described for recordings of neurons in freely moving and chaired monkeys during the performance of behavioural tasks. The electrode drives are implanted for periods of up to 6 months, and can advance up to 42 electrodes using 14 independent drive mechanisms. The drive samples 288 points within a 12 mmx12 mm region, with 15 mm of electrode travel. Major advantages are that recordings are made in freely moving monkeys, and these recordings can be compared with those in chaired experiments; waveforms of single neurons are stable, enabling prolonged recordings of the same neurons across periods of days; recordings can be made throughout the brain, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus; the drive accommodates both sharp microelectrodes and fine wire assemblies such as tetrodes.",
