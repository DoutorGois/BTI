     "AB": "Members of the inducible transcription factor Fos family, that are part of the AP-1 complex that binds to the corresponding promoter site, are implicated in the regulation of gene transcription after acute and chronic seizures. However, little is known about the temporal expression of the AP-1 transcription factors and if individual proteins composing this complex have distinct roles in development and maintenance of permanent epilepsy. In this study, the AP-1 binding capacity, its content of different Fos proteins, and the anatomical specificity, were analyzed 2 or 18 h after achieving full kindling in rats. The same analysis was performed in fully kindled animal receiving a new stimulus after a 3-week pause to determine the extent of stability of the AP-1 transcription factors. While both c-Fos and FosB were induced in all cortical areas after a single stimulus, only FosB-immunoreactivity remained after 18 h. A single stimulation to kindled animals left undisturbed for 3 weeks induced a long-lasting upregulation of AP-1 binding in the frontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus suggesting a permanent exposure of AP-1 heterocomplexes in the frontal cortex. Supershift assays showed that FosB is the dominant component of the long-term AP-1 complex. It is concluded that the AP-1 binding complex in fully kindled rats is composed of different proteins, and that FosB-containing AP-1 complexes mediate long-term effects in the frontal cortex.",
