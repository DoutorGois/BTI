     "AB": "Plant amino acids beta-N-oxalylamino-L-alanine (L-BOAA, present in Lathyrus sativus) and beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (L-BMAA, present in Cycas circinalis) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human neurological disorders lathyrism and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-Parkinson's dementia complex of Guam (ALS-PD), respectively. In view of the conflicting reports that have emerged on the role of L-BMAA in ALS-PD, we reinvestigated the comparative toxicity of L-BMAA and L-BOAA. We report here the potent toxicity of L-BOAA as examined in an in vitro model consisting of sagittal slices of mouse brain. Incubation of sagittal slices of mouse brain with L-BOAA (1 pM) resulted in significant leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and potassium from the slices into the medium. Under similar conditions, L-BMAA-induced LDH leakage from the slices into the medium was observed only at very high concentration of the toxin, namely 1 mM. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists ameliorated the toxic effects of L-BMAA, while non-NMDA receptor antagonists (quinoxalinediones) protected against the toxicity of L-BOAA. Incubation of slices with L-BOAA for 1 h resulted in extensive vacuolation and degeneration of neurons in the thalamus and brain stem, and to a lesser extent in the hippocampus and cerebellar nuclei. The large sized neurons appeared to be affected to a greater extent than the smaller ones. The neurons in other areas of the brain also revealed variable degree of degeneration with swelling of axons and dendrites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
