     "AB": "The effects of repeated amphetamine (AMPH) pretreatment on norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the hypothalamus and hippocampus were assessed using in vivo microdialysis. Rats were pretreated with either saline or an escalating-dose AMPH regimen (1-->10 mg/kg) over 10 consecutive days, and then were withdrawn from AMPH for either 1 day or 30 days, at which time the animals underwent two consecutive days of testing. As expected, repeated treatment with AMPH resulted in time-dependent changes in both spontaneous locomotor activity and in the psychomotor response to a subsequent challenge injection of AMPH. In addition, repeated exposure to AMPH resulted in time-dependent and regionally-specific changes in the basal concentrations of NE in dialysate, and in the NE response to an AMPH challenge. For example, AMPH pretreatment produced a persistent (at least one month) increase in the basal concentration of NE in the hippocampus, but not the hypothalamus, although the response to an AMPH challenge was altered in both structures. It is suggested that AMPH treatment produces adaptations in NE systems that far outlast the acute effects of the drug, and that these may contribute to both transient and more persistent behavioral sequelae associated with the discontinuation of chronic AMPH use.",
