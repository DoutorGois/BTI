     "AB": "BACKGROUND: In some cases, single-stage or delayed amygdalohippocampectomy (AHE) can be used for effective treatment of epileptic syndrome upon resection of temporal lobe cavernomas. The efficacy of AHE in treatment of temporal epilepsies is proved in general; however, the indications for surgery in patients with cavernomas are not developed. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety AHE in the treatment of epilepsy in patients with temporal lobe cavernomas and to define the indications for surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Of 14 patients with temporal lobe cavernomas, which manifested as epileptic seizures, 10 patients underwent selective AHE, and 4 patients underwent anteromedial temporal lobectomy. In 12 cases, AHE was performed simultaneously with cavernoma resection. Delayed AHE was carried out in 2 cases. All patients underwent preoperative MRI and EEG. Preoperative video-EEG monitoring was performed in 3 cases. The duration of postoperative follow-up was at least 1 year (mean follow-up was 3.3 years). RESULTS: Improvement in the epileptic syndrome was observed in all patients. In the postoperative period, 7 patients had no seizures (Engel class IA); of them, 3 patients discontinued anticonvulsants. The surgery outcome depended on the disease duration. Significant postoperative complications in the form of reversible hemiparesis were observed in 1 case. CONCLUSION: Amygdalohippocampectomy is highly efficient in treatment of severe forms of epilepsy in patients with temporal lobe cavernomas. In the case of long history of typical temporal seizures and pharmacoresistant epilepsy, AHE can be performed simultaneously with cavernoma resection.",
