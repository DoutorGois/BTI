     "AB": "Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) have a vital role in forming connections between neurons during embryonic development. Increasing evidence suggests that CAMs also participate in activity-dependent plasticity during development and synaptic plasticity in adults. Neural impulses of appropriate patterns can regulate expression of specific CAMs in mouse neurons from dorsal-root ganglia, alter cell-cell adhesion and produce structural reorganization of axon terminals in culture. Synaptic plasticity in Aplysia, learning in chick and long-term potentiation in rat hippocampus are accompanied by changes in CAM expression. Long-term potentiation can be blocked by disrupting CAM function in rat hippocampus, and learning deficits result from antibody blockade of CAMs in chicks and in transgenic mice lacking specific CAMs. Cell adhesion molecules might produce these effects by controlling several cellular processes, including cell adhesion, cytoskeletal structure and intracellular signaling.",
