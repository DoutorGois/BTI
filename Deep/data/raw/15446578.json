     "AB": "Hypoxia as well as global and focal ischemia are strong activators of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian central nervous system. Here we show that the hypoxia-inducible vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGFR-2/Flk-1 are expressed in clonally-derived adult rat neural stem cells in vitro. VEGF stimulated the expansion of neural stem cells whereas blockade of VEGFR-2/Flk-1-kinase activity reduced neural stem cell expansion. VEGF was also infused into the lateral ventricle to study changes in neurogenesis in the ventricle wall, olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Using a low dose (2.4 ng/d) to avoid endothelial proliferation and changes in vascular permeability, VEGF stimulated adult neurogenesis in vivo. After VEGF infusion, we observed reduced apoptosis but unaltered proliferation suggesting a survival promoting effect of VEGF in neural progenitor cells. Strong expression of VEGFR-2/Flk-1 was detected in the ventricle wall adjacent to the choroid plexus, a site of significant VEGF production, which suggests a paracrine function of endogenous VEGF on neural stem cells in vivo. We propose that VEGF acts as a trophic factor for neural stem cells in vitro and for sustained neurogenesis in the adult nervous system. These findings may have implications for the pathogenesis and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.",
