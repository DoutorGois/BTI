Recent research has proven the functional interactions between opioid and endogenous cannabinoid system in the central nervous system (CNS). The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1-R) is one of the receptors that mediate the actions of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids in the CNS. Here, we investigated the expression of CB1-R in mRNA and protein levels in the brains of rats treated with acute and repeated morphine. Three groups of rats received intraperitoneal injections (ip injections) of saline, acute morphine (10 mg/kg) and repeated morphine (10 mg/kg, twice daily for 12 consecutive days), and the mRNA levels and protein expressions of CB1-R were examined. RT-PCR and western blot analyses supported that both mRNA and protein levels of CB1-R in cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus were increased by repeated morphine treatment. However, the mRNA level in cerebellum was down-regulated only after acute morphine treatment and would returned to basal levels later. We used immunohistochemistry techniques to determine the functional expression of CB1-R in morphine treated rat's brain. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) revealed the significant increase of cytokine (IL-1beta, IL-6) levels in the repeated morphine treatment rats' cortex and hippocampus regions, which are both addiction-related brain areas. In addition, the results from RT-PCR and western blot assay indicated that the expression of CB1-R was directly increased by morphine treatment in vitro. All the results indicated that the CB1-R expression could be changed by morphine exposure and it might be involved in neural immune function, which provided a potential target for neurogenic disease treatment.",
