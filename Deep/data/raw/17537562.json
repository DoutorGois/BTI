     "AB": "The mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of endemic fluorosis still remain unknown. To investigate the expression level of neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM), oxidative stress, and apoptosis induced by fluoride, the primary rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with 20, 40, and 80 mg/l sodium fluoride for 24 h in vitro. The results showed that the cell survival rate in the 80 mg/l fluoride-treated group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Forty and 80 mg/l of fluoride induced significantly increased lactate dehydrogenase release, intracellular reactive oxygen species, and the percentage of apoptosis. Compared with control group, the malondialdehyde levels were significantly elevated while glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase activities were decreased in all fluoride-treated groups, accompanied by the markedly reduced superoxide dismutase activity in 80 mg/l fluoride-treated group. With respect to NCAM mRNA expression levels, a significant dose-dependent decrease was observed in 40 and 80 mg/l fluoride-treated groups against the control group. In addition, as compared to the control group, the protein expression levels of NCAM-180 in 40 and 80 mg/l fluoride-treated groups, NCAM-140 in all fluoride-treated groups, and NCAM-120 in the 80 mg/l fluoride-treated group were significantly decreased. Our study herein suggested that fluoride could cause oxidative stress, apoptosis, and decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of NCAM in rat hippocampal neurons, contributing to the neurotoxicity induced by fluoride.",
