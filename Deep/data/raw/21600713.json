     "AB": "Status epilepticus triggers a mixture of apoptotic and necrotic cell death within the hippocampus. This neuronal loss may result in the development of epilepsy and cognitive deficits. Erythropoietin mediates a number of biological actions within the central nervous system and has been shown to be neuroprotective. In the present study, we investigated the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin on hippocampus of rat after lithium-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus. Twenty-one dam reared Wistar male rats, 21-day-old were divided into three groups: control group, lithium-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus and lithium-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus and erythropoietin treated group. Erythropoietin treated group received recombinant human erythropoietin 10 U/g intraperitoneally 40 min after pilocarpine injection for 5 days. Rats were sacrificed and brain tissues were collected at 5th day of experiment. Neuronal cell death and apoptosis were evaluated. Histopathological examination showed that erythropoietin significantly decreased neuronal cell death in CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus regions of hippocampus. It also diminished apoptosis in the CA1 and dentate gyrus regions of hippocampus. In conclusion, erythropoietin may preserve the number of neurons and decrease apoptosis in model of status epilepticus induced by lithium-pilocarpine. This experimental study suggests that erythropoietin administration may be neuroprotective in status epilepticus.",
