     "AB": "High frequency afferent stimulation of chemical synapses often induces short-term increases in synaptic efficacy, due to increased release probability and/or increased supply of readily releasable synaptic vesicles. This may be followed by synaptic depression, often caused by vesicle depletion. We here describe an additional, novel type of delayed and transient response enhancement phase which occurred during prolonged stimulation at 5-20 Hz frequency of excitatory glutamatergic synapses in slices from the adult mouse CA1 hippocampal region. This second enhancement phase, which was most clearly defined at physiological temperatures and essentially absent at 24 degrees C, was dependent on the presence of F-actin filaments and synapsins I and/or II, and could not be ascribed to changes in presynaptic action potentials, inhibitory neurotransmission or glutamate receptor desensitization. Time course studies showed that the delayed response phase interrupted the synaptic decay 3-4 s after stimulus train initiation and continued, when examined at 5-10 Hz frequencies, for approximately 75 stimuli before decay. The novel response enhancement, probably deriving from a restricted pool of synaptic vesicles, may allow maintenance of synaptic efficacy during prolonged periods of excitatory synaptic activity.",
