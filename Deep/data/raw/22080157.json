     "AB": "Interactions between dopamine and glutamate receptors are essential for prefrontal cortical (PFC) and hippocampal cognitive functions. The hippocampus has been identified as a detector of a novel stimulus, where an association between incoming information and stored memories takes place. Further to our previous results which showed a strong synergistic interaction of dopamine D1 and glutamate NMDA receptors, the present study is going to investigate the functional status of that interaction in rats, following their exposure to a novel environment. Our results showed that the \"spatial\" novelty induced in rat hippocampus and PFC (a) a significant increase in phosphorylation of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits, as well as a robust phosphorylation/activation of ERK1/2 signaling, which are both dependent on the concomitant stimulation of D1/NMDA receptors and are both abolished by habituation procedure, (b) chromatin remodeling events (phosphorylation-acetylation of histone H3) and (c) an increase in the immediate early genes (IEGs) c-Fos and zif-268 expression in the CA1 region of hippocampus, which is dependent on the co-activation of D1/NMDA and acetylcholine muscarinic receptors. In conclusion, our results clearly show that a strong synergistic interaction of D1/NMDA receptor is required for the novelty-induced phosphorylation of NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits and for the robust activation of ERK1/2 signaling, leading to chromatin remodeling events and the expression of the IEGs c-Fos and zif-268, which are involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation.",
