     "AB": "Expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins RB and p34cdc2 was examined in the adult rat brain, with special emphasis on proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampal formation and olfactory bulb. RB-like immunoreactivity (RB-IR) was detected throughout the brain, with particularly intense staining observed in hippocampal pyramidal cells, pyriform cortex, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Intense RB-IR and cdc2-IR were also detected in proliferating neuronal precursor cells in the subgranular region of the dentate gyrus and in the subependymal region extending from the anterior lateral ventricle into the olfactory bulb. Many of these cells developed into neurons as assessed by the expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and, in the hippocampal formation, the expression of Fos-IR following pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure activity. A good correlation was observed between the number of proliferating cells expressing intense nuclear RB-IR staining and the number of thymidine-labeled cells that had differentiated into functional hippocampal neurons. A substantial decrease in RB-IR during differentiation was also observed and occurred prior to the expression of NSE. The possibility that the loss of RB may be necessary for neuronal differentiation to proceed is discussed.",
