     "AB": "Cysteamine was used as a tool aimed at investigating the role of central somatostatin (SS-14) and was shown to modulate learning in a task-dependent manner. However, direct arguments have not yet been provided to support the hypothesis that impairments and facilitation of learning produced by cysteamine are both mediated by the hippocampus. Mice were given daily intrahippocampal injections of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or cysteamine at doses of either 2.5 microg/0.2 microl or 25 microg/0.2 microl 1 h prior to each learning session of a bar-pressing task, for which the acquisition was previously shown to be improved by systemic injections. The results showed that, with respect to CSF, the mice injected with cysteamine learned the bar pressing task faster whereas no evidence of changes in locomotor activity was provided. Moreover, the results showed that retention was specifically increased in the two groups injected with cysteamine. It is argued that the action of cysteamine on the hippocampus is sufficient to modulate specifically learning-memory processes in a task-dependent manner. In conclusion, the blockade of some hippocampal information processing function by cysteamine is discussed to understand the bidirectional effects of drugs on learning and memory.",
