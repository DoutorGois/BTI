     "AB": "Low expression of the human serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene presumably interacts with stressful life events enhancing susceptibility for affective disorders. 5-Htt knockout (KO) mice display an anxious phenotype, and behavioural differences compared to wild-type (WT) mice are exacerbated after repeated loser experience in a resident-intruder stress paradigm. To assess whether genotype-dependent and stress-induced behavioural differences are reflected in alterations of neuronal morphology in limbic areas, we studied dendritic length and complexity of pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortices (CG, IL), hippocampus CA1 region, and of pyramidal neurons and interneurons in the lateral (La) and basolateral (BL) amygdaloid nuclei in Golgi-Cox-stained brains of male WT and 5-Htt KO control and loser mice. Spine density was analysed for IL apical and amygdaloid apical and basal pyramidal neuron dendrites. While group differences were absent for parameters analysed in CG, CA1 and amygdaloid interneurons, pyramidal neurons in the IL displayed tendencies to shorter and less spinous distal apical dendrites in 5-Htt KO controls, and to extended proximal dendrites in WT losers compared to WT controls. In contrast, spine density of several dendritic compartments of amygdaloid pyramids was significantly higher in 5-Htt KO mice compared to WT controls. While a tendency to increased spine density was observed in the same dendritic compartments in WT after stress, changes were lacking in stressed compared to control 5-Htt KO mice. Our findings indicate that disturbed 5-HT homeostasis results in alterations of limbic neuronal morphology, especially in higher spinogenesis in amygdaloid pyramidal neurons. Social stress leads to similar but less pronounced changes in the WT, and neuroplasticity upon stress is reduced in 5-Htt KO mice.",
