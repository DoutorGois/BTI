     "AB": "N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is a calcium-permeable ionotropic glutamate receptor and plays a role in many neurologic disorders such as brain ischemia through its involvement in excitotoxicity. We have performed differential display PCR to identify changes in gene expression that occur in the hippocampus of the mouse brain after intraperitoneal injection of NMDA and identified a gene, Tex261 as an inducible gene by NMDA stimulation in vivo. Tex261 mRNA was gradually induced in response to NMDA and reached about 4.5-fold at 24 h. When HEK 293 cells are transfected with NMDA receptors, the cells die in a manner that mimics excitotoxicity in neurons. HEK 293 cells transfected with the combination of Tex261 and the NMDA receptors NR1/NR2A produced the greater cell death compared with the cells transfected with the NMDA receptors alone. These findings suggest that Tex261 modulates the excitotoxic cell death induced by NMDA receptor activation.",
