Although electric activity study of epileptic brain had been emphasized in the past, the neuropathological study of epilepsy has become a main focus in clinical and forensic medicine recently. This article reviews the recent progress in neuropathology of epilepsy including developmental disorder, abnormal tumoral proliferation, hippocampal sclerosis, dual pathological alteration, and mossy fiber sprouting. Its significance in forensic medicine, particularly for the diagnosis of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy, is discussed.",
