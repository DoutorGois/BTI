     "AB": "This study mapped the distribution of ferroportin in the developing rat brain using Wistar rats aged postnatal (P) days P7, P21, and P70 (adult). Ferroportin immunoreactivity was observed in neurons throughout the CNS regardless of the age of the animals studied. The neuronal labeling was detected in both perikarya, and axons and dendrites. The labeling intensity within the neurons varied among the different ages of the rats with an overall higher ferroportin immunoreactivity seen at P21, particularly in axons and white matter tracts. The neuronal labeling was high in the neocortex, striatum, hippocampus, brain stem nuclei, deep cerebellar nuclei, catecholaminergic neurons, and reticular nuclei, and particularly high in neurons of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus and medial habenular nucleus. In axonal tracts, ferroportin immunoreactivity was high in fibers of the internal capsule, fimbria, mamillothalamic tract and the habenulo-interpedunculo pathway. Slight ferroportin immunoreactivity was observed in oligodendrocytes and differentiating macrophages that invade the postnatal brain. The finding of a pronounced content of ferroportin in axons of the developing brain are in keeping with the idea of elevated axonal transport and export of iron possibly because of higher metabolic needs.",
