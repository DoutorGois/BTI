     "AB": "Head direction (HD) neurons fire selectively according to head orientation in the yaw plane relative to environmental landmark cues. Head movements provoke optic field flow signals that enter the vestibular nuclei, indicating head velocity, and hence angular displacements. To test whether optic field flow alone affects the directional firing of HD neurons, rats walked about on a circular platform as a spot array was projected onto the surrounding floor-to-ceiling cylindrical black curtain. Directional responses in the anterodorsal thalamus of four rats remained stable as they moved about with the point field but in the absence of landmark cues. Then, the spherical projector was rotated about its yaw axis at 4.5 degrees /s for approximately 90 s. In 27 sessions the mean drift speed of the preferred directions (PDs) was 1.48 degrees /s (SD=0.78 degrees /s; range: 0.15 to 2.88 degrees /s). Thus, optic flow stimulation entrained PDs, albeit at drift speeds slower than the field rotation. This could be due to conflicts with vestibular, motor command, and efferent copy signals. After field rotation ended, 20/27 PDs drifted back to within 45 degrees of the initial values over several minutes, generally following the shortest path to return to the initial value. Poststimulation drifts could change speed and/or direction, with mean speeds of 0.68+/-0.64 degrees /s (range 0 to 1.36 degrees /s). Since the HD cell pathway (containing anterodorsal thalamus) is the only known projection of head direction information to entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal place cells, yaw plane optic flow signals likely influence representations in this spatial reference coordinate system for orientation and navigation.",
