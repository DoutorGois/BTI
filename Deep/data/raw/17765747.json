The reviewed data suggest that the dentate gyrus withstands the formation of plaques, tangles and neuronal death until late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, changes related to a disconnecting process, and more subtle intrinsic alterations, may contribute to disturbances in memory and learning observed in early stages of AD.",
