     "AB": "1. The effects of increasing K+ concentration in Mg2(+)-free extracellular solution on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced current were studied in cultured rat hippocampal neurons with the use of the whole-cell and outside-out configurations of the patch-clamp technique. 2. When the K+ concentration in the external solution was increased by replacement of Na+ with isomolar K+, the amplitude of the NMDA-induced current decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of K+ was almost saturated at 100 mM, when the NMDA response was reduced to 12% of that in K(+)-free, 150 mM Na+ solution. Increasing the external K+ concentration did not affect either the kainate- or quisqualate-induced current in these experimental conditions. 3. Increase in the external K+ concentration reduced the NMDA-induced current almost equally over the whole range of membrane potential tested (-60-30 mV). The reversal potential of the NMDA-induced current was not significantly shifted by the replacement of Na+ with K+. 4. A rise in the external K+ concentration to 100 mM did not reduce the single-channel conductance of the NMDA channel, whereas it reduced the mean open time to about two-thirds of that in the control external solution. 5. The suppressed activation of the NMDA receptor channel in high-K+ environments may have a functional significance to alleviate entry of toxic Ca2+ into neurons of the CNS in pathological conditions such as hypoxia and ischemia.",
