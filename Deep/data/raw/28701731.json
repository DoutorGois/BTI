     "AB": "Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) is a protein complex involved in the formation of endosomal tubular structures that mediates the sorting of protein cargoes to specialised compartments. In this study, we present insights into the metabolic consequences caused by BLOC-1 deficiency in pallid mice, which carry a null mutation in the Bloc1s6 gene encoding an essential component of this complex. The metabolome of the hippocampus of pallid mice was analysed using an untargeted, liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometric approach. After data pre-treatment, statistical analysis and pathway enrichment, we have identified 28 metabolites that showed statistically significant changes between pallid and wild-type control. These metabolites included amino acids, nucleobase-containing compounds and lysophospholipids. Interestingly, pallid mice displayed increased hippocampal levels of the neurotransmitters glutamate and N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamic acid (NAAG) and their precursor glutamine. Expression of the sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 1 (SNAT1), which transports glutamine into neurons, was also upregulated. Conversely, levels of the neurotransmitter precursors phenylalanine and tryptophan were decreased. Interestingly, many of these changes could be mapped to overlapping metabolic pathways. The observed metabolic alterations are likely to affect neurotransmission and neuronal homeostasis and in turn could mediate the memory and behavioural impairments observed in BLOC-1-deficient mice.",
