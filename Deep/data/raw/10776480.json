     "AB": "The hypothalamo-limbic system has been implicated in recognizing the affective significance of pain and elicitation of related emotional responses. Several evidences from different studies support a role of these areas in endogenous analgesic mechanisms for pain modulation as elucidated by different pain tests in more than one animal model. In the above context, the aim of this study was to investigate the relative effectiveness of the pain modulatory action of hypothalamic and limbic structures in rat using similar stimulation parameters, and studying the effect on tooth pulp stimulation evoked jaw opening reflex (TP-JOR). To achieve the objective, unilateral stimulation of hypothalamic (lateral = LH; ventromedial = VMN; anterior = AH) and limbic areas (amygdala = AMYG; hippocampus = HIPP) was done on the TP-JOR test. A significant reduction in the amplitude of EMG recorded from the digastric muscle (dEMG) as a result of tooth-pulp stimulation was observed on stimulation of LH, VMN, AMYG and HIPP but not from AH. Also, the magnitude of this effect was almost similar from these areas. The results suggest that these areas (except AH) have an antinociceptive role in tooth-pulp stimulation evoked pain response.",
