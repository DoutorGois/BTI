The purpose of this study was to evaluate quantitative changes in MR signals in patients with liver cirrhosis by using the magnetization transfer technique. METHODS: Magnetization transfer ratios were measured in seven different regions of the brain in 37 patients with liver cirrhosis and in 37 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The magnetization transfer ratios in patients with liver cirrhosis were significantly lower than those in control subjects in the globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, corona radiata, and subcortical white matter. CONCLUSION: Abnormal magnetization transfer ratios may be found in otherwise normal-appearing cerebral regions.",
