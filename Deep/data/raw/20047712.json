     "AB": "Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used as a first-line treatment in depression. However, many depressed patients are also treated with benzodiazepines to alleviate increased anxiety and sleep disturbances normally associated with depression. Since benzodiazepines inhibit 5-HT neuronal firing activity, they might attenuate SSRI-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT levels. This study aimed to assess, using in-vivo microdialysis, the effects of the benzodiazepines oxazepam or temazepan on the SSRI paroxetine-induced 5-HT increase in the hippocampus of freely moving guinea-pigs. It was found that the acute systemic administration of paroxetine increased extracellular 5-HT levels. Pre-administration of oxazepam or temazepam significantly diminished the paroxetine-induced elevation of extracellular 5-HT levels (from 350% to 200% of baseline). It was concluded that benzodiazepines attenuate the ability of SSRIs to elevate hippocampal 5-HT levels. Thus, co-administration of benzodiazepines might affect the therapeutic efficacy of SSRI treatment.",
