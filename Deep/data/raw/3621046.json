     "AB": "The dose-dependent effects of phencyclidine were examined in guinea pig hippocampal slices using intracellular and extracellular recordings. Orthodromically evoked population potentials from the CA1 cell body layer were enhanced by low doses (0.2-0.4 microM) and depressed by high doses (0.01-10 mM). Medium doses of the drug (2.0-10.0 microM) showed little effect. Intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons gave similar dose-dependent results. Low doses increased spontaneous firing rates and caused silent cells to fire. Medium doses both increased and decreased firing rates, whereas high doses depressed firing rates. Large transient depolarizing shifts were seen in some phencyclidine-treated cells at medium and high doses. Phencyclidine effects took 15-30 min to develop and were only partially reversible after a washout of up to 1 h.",
