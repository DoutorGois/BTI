     "AB": "This study is to investigate the effects of etomidate and propofol on memory and possible involved mechanisms using immature rats. Forty-eight rats randomly received intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg etomidate (n = 16), 50 mg/kg propofol (n = 16) or normal saline (control, n = 16). Three hours after awakening, memory was assessed by Y-maze test using 10 rats in each drug group. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in hippocampal tissue was measured using six rats in each group. Etomidate group had more total reaction time (TRT) compared with the control group in Y-maze test ( p < 0.05). No other difference between these two groups was observed. Propofol group had less number of correct response ( p < 0.01) and more TRT ( p < 0.05) in Y-maze test, as well as more GABA concentration detected in hippocampal tissue ( p < 0.01) than the control group. Propofol group also showed less number of correct response ( p < 0.05) and more hippocampal GABA concentration ( p < 0.01) compared with etomidate group. Etomidate does not show significant effects on memory in rat and further investigation is required. Propofol can affect memory in rat possibly via increasing the synthesis and/or secretion of GABA as one of the factors.",
