     "AB": "Brain serotonin (5-HT) system has been implicated in pathophysiology of anxiety, depression, drug addiction, and schizophrenia. 5-HT2A receptor is involved in the mechanisms of stress-induced psychopathology and impulsive behavior. Here, we investigated the role of 5-HT2A receptor in the autoregulation of the brain 5-HT system. The chronic treatment with agonist of 5-HT2A receptor DOI (1.0 mg/kg, i.p./14 days) produced considerable decrease of 5-HT2A receptor-mediated \"head-twitches\" in AKR/J mice indicating desensitization of 5-HT2A receptors. Chronic DOI treatment failed to alter 5-HT2A receptor gene expression in the midbrain, hippocampus and frontal cortex. At the same time, the increase in the expression of the gene encoding key enzyme of 5-HT synthesis, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), the increase in TPH2 activity and 5-HT levels and decreased expression of serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene was found in the midbrain of DOI-treated mice. The results provide new evidence of receptor-gene cross-talk in the brain 5-HT system and the implication of 5-HT2A receptor in the autoregulation of the brain 5-HT system.",
