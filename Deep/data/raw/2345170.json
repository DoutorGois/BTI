     "AB": "Secretogranin II is a very acidic, tyrosine-sulfated protein found in secretory granules of cells belonging to the diffuse neuroendocrine system. It gained more general importance recently as a universal immunohistochemical marker for endocrine neoplasms. Sequence information was obtained from secretogranin II isolated from bovine anterior pituitaries, allowing the isolation of cDNA clones and deduction of its primary structure. Bovine secretogranin II is a 586-amino acid protein of 67,455 Da which is preceded by a signal peptide of 27 residues and contains 9 pairs of basic amino acids in its sequence which are used as potential cleavage sites for generation of physiologically active peptides. Moderately abundant mRNA levels were found in adrenal medulla, pituitary, hippocampus, and caudate. Secretogranin II message was absent from parathyroid gland, adrenal cortex, kidney, liver, and spleen. Depolarization of isolated chromaffin cells by various secretagogues significantly up-regulated secretogranin II mRNA levels by mechanisms distinct from those established for chromogranins and neuropeptides, components maintained along with secretogranin II in neuroendocrine storage vesicles.",
