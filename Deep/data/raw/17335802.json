     "AB": "A systemic inflammatory response (SIR) occurs prior to and during the treatment of severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and C5b-9 are components of SIR and have been speculated to be involved in the clinical brain edema (BE) of DKA. We studied IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, C5b-9, inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), ICAM-1, IL-10 and Hsp70 expression in the brains of two patients who died as the result of clinical BE during the treatment of DKA. IL-1beta was strongly expressed in the choroid plexus epithelium (CPE) and ependyma, and to a lesser extent in the hippocampus, caudate, white matter radiation of the pons, molecular layer of the cerebellum and neurons of the cortical gray matter. TNF-alpha was expressed to a lesser extent than IL-1beta, and only in the CP. C5b-9, previously shown to be deposited on neurons and oligodendrocytes, was found on CPE and ependymal cells. iNOS and ICAM-1 had increased expression in the CPE and ependyma. Hsp70 and IL-10 were also expressed in the CPE of the case with the shorter duration of treatment. Our data demonstrate the presence of a multifaceted neuroinflammatory cytotoxic insult of the CPE, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of the fatal brain edema of DKA.",
