     "AB": "Sickness behaviour is an adaptive response to infection that includes lethargy, anorexia and of direct relevance to this work, learning and memory impairments. It has been suggested that proinflammatory cytokines may disrupt learning and memory by interfering with memory consolidation [C.R. Pugh, K. Kumagawa, M. Fleshner, L.R. Watkins, S.F. Maier, J.R. Rudy, Selective effects of peripheral lipopolysaccharide administration on contextual and auditory-cue fear conditioning, Brain Behav. Immun. 12 (1998) 212-229]. We tested whether systemic interleukin-1beta is sufficient to induce impairments in memory consolidation by comparing the effects of post-learning administration of interleukin-1beta with, the potent endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide; and saline, on retention of conditioned fear of a context. We administered an acute intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta or saline immediately following a single conditioning episode in which rats received two tone-shock pairings. Two days following the learning episode, animals were tested for strength of conditioned responding to both the context and tone. Lipopolysaccharide-injected animals, but not interleukin-1beta-injected animals, exhibited less conditioned fear of context compared to saline-treated controls. All groups showed similar conditioned fear of tone. Our results suggest that systemic interleukin-1beta is not sufficient to disrupt memory consolidation, but rather, the synergistic actions of the proinflammatory cytokines released by lipopolysaccharide are required to disrupt memory consolidation.",
