     "AB": "The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) is abundant in the CNS and is expressed in a subset of inhibitory interneurons, particularly in their axon terminals. The expression profile of CCK undergoes numerous changes in several models of temporal lobe epilepsy. Previous studies in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy have shown that CCK immunohistochemical labeling is substantially reduced in several regions of the hippocampal formation, consistent with decreased CCK expression as well as selective neuronal degeneration. However, in a mouse pilocarpine model of recurrent seizures, increases in CCK-labeling also occur and are especially striking in the hippocampal dendritic layers of strata oriens and radiatum. Characterizing these changes and determining the cellular basis of the increased labeling were the major goals of the current study. One possibility was that the enhanced CCK labeling could be associated with an increase in GABAergic terminals within these regions. However, in contrast to the marked increase in CCK-labeled structures, labeling of GABAergic axon terminals was decreased in the dendritic layers. Likewise, cannabinoid receptor 1-labeled axon terminals, many of which are CCK-containing GABAergic terminals, were also decreased. These findings suggested that the enhanced CCK labeling was not due to an increase in GABAergic axon terminals. The subcellular localization of CCK immunoreactivity was then examined using electron microscopy, and the identities of the structures that formed synaptic contacts were determined. In pilocarpine-treated mice, CCK was observed in dendritic spines and these were proportionally increased relative to controls, whereas the proportion of CCK-labeled terminals forming symmetric synapses was decreased. In addition, CCK-positive axon terminals forming asymmetric synapses were readily observed in these mice. Double labeling with vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and CCK revealed colocalization in numerous terminals forming asymmetric synapses, confirming the glutamatergic identity of these terminals. These data raise the possibility that expression of CCK is increased in hippocampal pyramidal cells in mice with recurrent, spontaneous seizures.",
