     "AB": "The confluence of micropatterning, microfabricated multielectrode arrays, and low-density neuronal culture techniques make possible the growth of patterned neuronal circuits overlying multielectrode arrays. Previous studies have shown synaptic interaction within patterned cultures which was more active on average than random cultures. In our present study, we found patterned cultures to have up to five times more astrocytes and three times more neurons than random cultures. In addition, faster development of synapses is also seen in patterned cultures. Together, this yielded greater overall neuronal activity as evaluated by the number of active electrodes. Our finding of astrocytic proliferation within serum-free culture is also novel.",
