     "AB": "This study investigated the effects of electrical stimulation with theta burst stimulation (eTBS) on seizure suppression. Optimal parameters of eTBS were determined through open-loop stimulation experiments and then implemented in a close-loop seizure control system. For the experiments, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) was injected into the right hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats to induce an acute seizure. eTBS was applied on the ventral hippocampal commissure and the effects of eTBS with different combinations of burst frequency and number of pulses per burst were analyzed in terms of seizure suppression. A closed-loop seizure control system was then implemented based on optimal eTBS parameters. The efficiency of the closed-loop eTBS was evaluated and compared to that of high frequency stimulation. The results show that eTBS induced global suppression in the hippocampus and this was sustained even after the application of eTBS. The optimal parameter of eTBS in the open-loop stimulation experiments was a burst frequency at 100Hz with nine pulses in a burst. The eTBS integrated with the on-off control law yielded less actions and cumulative delivered charge, but induced longer after-effects of seizure suppression compared to continuous high frequency stimulation (cHFS). To conclude, eTBS has suppressive effects on 4-AP induced seizure. A closed-loop eTBS system provides a more effective way of suppressing seizure and requires less effort compared to cHFS. eTBS may be a novel stimulation protocol for effective seizure control.",
