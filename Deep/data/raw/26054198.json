     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture intervention on gastric ulcer (GU) and sleeping quality from the viewpoint of brain-gut axis which plays an important role in the regulation of many vital functions in the body. METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were randomized into normal control, GU model, acupuncture of \"Zhongwan\"(CV 12)-\"Zusanli\"(ST 36, gastric function regulating acupoints), acupuncture of \"Shenmai\" (BL 62)-\"Zhaohai\" (KI 6, sleep-promotion acupoints), and acupuncture of CV 12-ST 36+ BL 62-KI 6 (combined treatment) groups, with 8 rats in each group. GU model was established by intragastric perfusion of dehydrated alcohol (1 mL/rat), and sleep model established by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg) after the last treatment. The abovementioned acupoints were punctured with filiform needles and stimulated by manipulating the needle for about 30 s, once every 5 min during 20 min of needle retention. The treatment was conducted once daily for five days. The contents of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-25(IL-25) in the serum and hippocampal tissues were detected by ELISA. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the gastric ulcer index score, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, and TNF-alpha and IL-25 contents in both serum and hippocampus were significantly increased in the model group (P < 0.01). Following acupuncture treatment, in comparison with the model group, the gastric ulcer index score, barbiturate-induced sleeping time, and TNF-alpha and IL-25 contents in both serum and hippocampus were significantly down-regulated in the CV 12-ST 36, BL 62-KI 6 and combined treatment groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The effects of the CV 12-ST 36 and combined treatment groups were remarkably superior to those of the BL 62-KI 6 group in down-regulating ulcer index score, serum IL-25, and hippocampal TNF-alpha and IL-25 contents (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). In addition, the effects of the BL 62-KI 6 and combined treatment groups was considerably better than that of the CV 12-ST 36 group in shortening barbiturate-induced sleeping time (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The effect of the combined treatment group was markedly better than that of the CV 12-ST 36 and BL 62-KI 6 groups in lowering serum TNF-alpha content (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture stimulation of CV 12, ST 36, KI 6 and BL 62 can relieve the gastric mucosal lesion, and shorten barbiturate-induced sleeping time in gastric ulcer rats, which may be related to its effects in reducing TNF-alpha and IL-25 contents in the serum and hippocampus tissues, suggesting a correlation between the gastrointestinal disorder and sleeping.",
