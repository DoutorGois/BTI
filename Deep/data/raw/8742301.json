     "AB": "In situ hybridization was used to determine 1) the relative concentrations of mRNAs encoding different subunits of the alpha-amino 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionate receptor family in select regions of rat forebrain and 2) whether limbic seizures alter the balances of the subunit mRNAs. GluR1 and GluR2 mRNA levels were about equal and were much greater than GluR3 mRNA levels in the principal neurons of each hippocampal subdivision. Probable interneurons in hippocampal molecular layers had much higher levels of GluR1 mRNA than of either GluR2 or GluR3 mRNA. Pyramidal cell layers in neo- and paleocortex had a balance of mRNAs that was significantly different from the balance in hippocampus: GluR1 mRNA and GluR3 mRNA levels were about equal and were substantially lower than those of GluR2 mRNA. Lesion-induced limbic seizures caused transient changes in mRNA levels that were differentiated with regard to subunit and brain region. All three mRNAs were decreased in the pyramidal layers of cortex, and changes in hippocampal pyramidal cells were smaller. Seizure-induced changes in granule cells of the dentate gyrus differed from all other regions examined: GluR1 mRNA was reduced to a greater degree than GluR2 mRNA, whereas GluR3 mRNA content was markedly increased. These data strongly suggest that the subunit composition of alpha-amino 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors differs significantly between areas of the cortical telencephalon. Furthermore, the data indicate that aberrant patterns of physiological activity differentially influence the expression of subunit mRNAs in a region-specific and/or cell-type-specific manner.",
