     "AB": "The effect of general hypothermia was investigated in 15 unanesthetized cats. The animals were immobilized with Flaxedil and maintained on mechanical respiration. An epileptogenic focus was induced by stereo-tactical injection of penicillin to the right hippocampus. Cooling of the body was followed by a marked decrease of the amplitude and frequency of the penicillin spikes. The antiepileptic effect of general hypothermia was not dependent on brain stem section as suggested by previous investigations. Seizures generated by a hippocampic penicillin focus were more resistant to hypothermia than discharges produced by penicillin applied to the visual cortex.",
