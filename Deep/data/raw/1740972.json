     "AB": "We investigated the effect of thyroxine against neuronal damage caused by ischemia in the rat. Neuronal damage was evaluated in the hippocampal CA1 subfield 7 days after a 10 min forebrain ischemia. Thyroxine was administered to animals divided in three groups: 15 min prior to ischemia (group 1), immediately after ischemia (group 2), and both before and after ischemia (group 3). The treatment of rats with a single dose of thyroxine given pre- or postischemia failed to prevent the loss of CA1 pyramidal cells. In contrast, repetitive administration of thyroxine before and after ischemia reduced the damage of the CA1 pyramidal cells. The mechanisms possibly underlying this neuroprotective effect are discussed.",
