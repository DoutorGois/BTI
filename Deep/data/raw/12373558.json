     "AB": "Iron deficiency (ID), the most prevalent nutritional disorder in the world, impairs cognition in early development. The involvement of hippocampus in cognition has prompted investigation into distribution of the iron storage protein ferritin (FER) in rat hippocampus. (a) In normal rats, FER positive cells appeared first in lateral CA3 and hilus of dentate gyrus and then spread over the entire mossy fiber (MF) system. No such spread was observed in CA1 field. (b) Nutritional iron deficiency retarded development of FER in the MF system. No change in FER was observed in CA1 field. (c) Zinc distribution can be altered by iron deficiency. Thus, the effect of zinc added to iron supplementation was tested in iron-deficient rats. Significant FER recovery was observed only in hippocampal MF of rats receiving both zinc and iron. It is apparent that for accelerating recovery of hippocampal function in iron deficiency, both zinc and iron are required.",
