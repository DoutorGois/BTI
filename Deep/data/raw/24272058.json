     "AB": "The action of 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg (i.p.) of corticosterone on serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) contents and on serotonin turnover, measured by an MAO-inhibitor method, was studied at 30 and 120 min after administration. A 1.0 mg/kg dose of corticosterone increased the serotonin content and turnover in the hypothalamus and mesencephalon 30 min after administration; however, it was ineffective on dorsal hippocampus and frontal and parietal cortex. 5-HIAA content did not change significantly in any of the brain areas studied. A 10.0 mg/kg dose of corticosterone decreased the serotonin content and turnover in the hypothalamus and mesencephalon; it was ineffective in other brain areas investigated. 5-HIAA content significantly decreased in the hypothalamus while it increased in the mesencephalon and dorsal hippocampus. In the parietal and frontal cortex, 5-HIAA content did not change following administration of 10.0 mg/kg of corticosterone. At 120 min after corticosterone administration, neither 5-HT content and turnover nor 5-HIAA content showed any change in the brain areas investigated. The results suggest that corticosteroids might change the activity of the brain serotoninergic system in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and in this way the serotoninergic system might play an important role in mediation of the corticosteroid effect exerted on brain function.",
