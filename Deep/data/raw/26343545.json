     "AB": "The existence of beta-adrenoceptors (ARs) in the hippocampus and the importance of beta-ARs in regulating synaptic plasticity and learning/memory function are well documented. As known, beta-ARs in area cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) are involved in regulating memory consolidation. However, little is known about the functional roles of the beta-ARs subtypes, beta1- and beta2-ARs, in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) region. To address this question, we firstly locally infused the beta1- or beta2-ARs antagonist into the CA3 region and observed that blockage of either beta1-AR or beta2-AR impaired long-term contextual fear memory and water-maze spatial memory. We also found that, following the contextual fear conditioning, the expression of beta1-AR in the CA3 region significantly increased, whereas beta2-AR was unchanged. Then intra-CA3 infusion of recombinant lentiviral RNAi vectors for beta1 or beta2-ARs also produced deficit in contextual memory consolidation. Taken together, the results suggested that the beta1- and beta2-ARs in the CA3 region were involved in hippocampus dependent memory consolidation.",
