     "AB": "Temporal lobe epilepsy in humans is a chronic condition with a highly variable temporal evolution. Animal models of this disorder have been developed to recapitulate many of the characteristics seen in humans with temporal lobe epilepsy. These animal models generate chronic spontaneous electrographic and motor seizures with a progressive increase in frequency over many months. In order to understand the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms driving epileptogenesis, a practical means for accurately assessing seizure progression over this extended time period must be devised. In this report, we describe the use of a three-channel radiotelemetry system to record spontaneous electrographic interictal \"spikes\" and seizure activity from the cortical surface and the two hippocampi. This approach has allowed continuous recording before, during, and several months after kainate-induced status epilepticus. The important advantages of this approach are the potential for long-term continuous electrographic recording with comparatively unrestricted behavior; the disadvantages include increased cost, surgical difficulty and lower frequency-response in the recordings.",
