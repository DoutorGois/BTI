     "AB": "We report the molecular characterization of a novel human homologue of mouse npdc1 (neural proliferation, differentiation and control, 1) gene, designated human npdc1 (hnpdc1). hnpdc1 was identified by large-scale sequencing of fetal liver cDNA libraries and the full-length cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification. The hnpdc1 gene, which contains nine exons, was mapped to human chromosome 15. It encodes a polypeptide of 325 amino acids, which shows high homology (77% identity) to the mouse NPDC1. Sequence analysis has shown that hNPDC1 protein contains a putative signal peptide of 34 amino acids, a transmembrane segment, and a typical bipartite nuclear localization signal. Northern blot and dot blot hybridization indicates that, just like mnpdc1, hnpdc1 mRNA is strongly expressed in adult brain (especially in hippocampus, frontal lobe and temporal lobe) and about 1.82-fold higher in adult brain than that in fetal brain. Unlike mnpdc1, however, hnpdc1 contains two transcripts instead of only one (1.5 kb), and has high expression levels in prostate, pituitary gland, and mammary glands. These results support that hNPDC1 plays a role in the control of neural cell proliferation and differentiation, and suggest that it may be involved in the development of several secretion glands.",
