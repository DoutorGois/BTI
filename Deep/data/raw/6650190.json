     "AB": "Modification of the viscerosensory evoked potentials (EPs) were studied during the sleep-wakefulness cycle of the rat. Electrical stimuli of various intensity were delivered either to the mucosal surface of a fistula of the small intestine or to the left splanchnic nerve during wakefulness (W), drowsiness (D), slow-wave-sleep (SWS), and paradoxical sleep (PS). The average EPs were recorded from the somatosensory (SI and SII) and associative (AS) areas of the cortex, the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus (VPL), the posterior hypothalamus (HPT) and the dorsal hippocampus (HPC). The amplitude of each component of the EPs in all explored structures were the largest in SWS and the smallest in W. A phasic increase in amplitude was observed in the EPs recorded immediately before the appearance of the spindles of SWS and during the REM episodes of PS. The peak latencies of the late components were the longest in SWS. These changes of the amplitudes and latencies were greater in the responses to weak stimulation than in EPs to strong ones. The possible synaptic events of the sleep-dependent control of viscerosensory activity are discussed.",
