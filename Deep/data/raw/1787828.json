In turn, a subset of patients with affective disorders present with hypercortisolemia, and non-suppression in the Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST). We have shown that long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative memory mechanism, is significantly affected by steroids when tested on the hippocampus, a crucial structure for memory processes. We propose that an imbalance of adrenal steroids and their metabolites, interacting at the level of the hippocampus, play a fundamental role in the psychophysiopathology of Cushing's and depressive disorders. By biasing memory mechanisms, the imbalance of these hormones sets both distorted mood, and hence memory contents, and distorted cognition based on recollection and present experiences.",
