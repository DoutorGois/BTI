     "AB": "The in vitro hippocampal brain slice is a 0.4 mm thick neural network that can be used to study brain responses to radiation and related injuries. This preparation is unique in that it responds to ionizing radiation within minutes after exposure without complications from changes in vascularity, blood flow, blood pressure, etc. Electrophysiological studies have shown that x- and gamma-rays alter synaptic transmission and spike generation, elements of normal brain activity. To evaluate the role of hydroxyl free radicals (OH) in these changes, slices were exposed to dilute H2O2 solutions. EPR spin trapping experiments verified that OH is produced. Neural responses, while similar, were not identical to those due to radiation, possibly because of a different distribution of OH. Although H2O2 is freely diffusible, it produces OH at specific sites where, e.g. iron reduces it. In contrast, x- and gamma-rays produce OH more uniformly throughout the tissue. H2O2 may provide a better model for high-LET radiation where yields of radical products of water radiolysis are decreased and peroxide reactions predominate.",
