     "AB": "The involvement of dopaminergic projection to the hippocampus in the facilitatory effect of cholecystokinin-unsulphated octapeptide (CCK-8 us) and caerulein (CER) on memory motivated affectively was investigated in male rats. CCK-8 us and CER were given subcutaneously at the doses of 10 microg kg(-1)and 0.5 microg kg(-1), respectively, immediately after a single learning trial in a passive avoidance situation, after bilateral 6-OHDA lesions to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In order to protect noradrenergic neurones against destruction by neurotoxin, 30 min before surgery rats were pre-treated intraperitoneally with 25 mg kg(-1)of desmethylimipramine, an inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake. Bilateral 6-OHDA lesions to the hippocampus significantly attenuate the facilitatory effect of CCK-8 us and CER on retention of passive avoidance behaviour evaluated 24 h after the learning trial. Neither, destruction of dopaminergic endings in the hippocampus, nor application of CCK-8 us and CER changed the spontaneous psychomotor activity of rats estimated in an 'open field' test. These results may indicate that the facilitatory effect of CCK-8 us and CER on memory motivated affectively is, in part, mediated by dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.",
