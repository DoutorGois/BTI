     "AB": "To achieve inducible and reversible gene expression in the adult mouse brain, we exploited an improved version of the tetracycline-controlled transactivator-based system (rtTA2(S)-M2, rtTA2 hereafter) and combined it with the forebrain-specific CaMKIIalpha promoter. Several independent lines of transgenic mice carrying the CaMKIIalpha promoter-rtTA2 gene were generated and examined for anatomical profile, doxycycline (dox)-dependence, time course, and reversibility of gene expression using several lacZ reporter lines. In two independent rtTA2-expressing lines, dox-treatment in the diet induced lacZ reporter expression in neurons of several forebrain structures including cortex, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Gene expression was dose-dependent and was fully reversible. Further, a similar pattern of expression was obtained in three independent reporter lines, indicating the consistency of gene expression. Transgene expression could also be activated in the developing brain (P0) by dox-treatment of gestating females. These new rtTA2-expressing mice allowing inducible and reversible gene expression in the adult or developing forebrain represent useful models for future genetic studies of brain functions.",
