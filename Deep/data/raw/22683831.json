     "AB": "Organophosphorus poisoning manifests as a cholinergic syndrome due to an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. It is treated symptomatically by anticholinergics and oxime reactivators are used as causal antidotes. Reactivators possess a complex mechanism of action and interact at various levels of the cholinergic transmission. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of standard oxime reactivators (HI-6, obidoxime, trimedoxime, methoxime and pralidoxime) on the hemicholinium-3 sensitive carriers, which are involved in the high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) transport, a key regulatory step in the synthesis of acetylcholine. The activity of the carriers was estimated in vitro on hippocampal synaptosomes using the substrate (3H)-choline and the competitive inhibitor (3H)-hemicholinium-3. Furthermore, the effect of the reactivators on the fluidity of hippocampal membranes was assessed. All tested compounds, except methoxime, showed an acute inhibitory effect on the carriers, however, only at muM concentrations. Trimedoxime showed the highest potency to inhibit HACU among all tested compounds (I(max) 62%, IC(50)=3 muM). All compounds, except HI-6, influenced also a membrane fluidity in the region of the hydrophilic heads of phospholipid bilayer, nevertheless, only methoxime was able to penetrate more deeply into the hydrocarbon core. We suggest that the direct interaction of oxime reactivators with the carrier protein (HI-6 and trimedoxime) and/or the changes in carrier conformation mediated by alterations in membrane fluidity (trimedoxime, obidoxime and pralidoxime) could occur here. The influence of reactivators on the carriers could be unfavorable in the case of their prolonged administration in vivo. From this point of view, the application of methoxime appears to be the best.",
