     "AB": "To determine the effect of phencyclidine (a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist) on expression of Bax and Bcl-2 (apoptosis-regulating proteins) in gerbil hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia, brain sections were immunohistochemically evaluated 48, 72, 96 h and 7 days following ischemia. In ischemic control animals, the expression of Bax in CA1 neurons was increased with time and peaked at 72 h, then disappeared at 96 h. In the phencyclidine (5 mg kg-1, intraperitoneally)-treated animals, the intensity of Bax expression at 72 h was weaker than that of ischemic control animals. Furthermore, at 96 h, Bax expression was still observed in CA1 neurons. No expression of Bcl-2 in the CA1 neurons was detected in either control or phencyclidine-treated animals. From these results, it is possible that NMDA receptor antagonists exert their preventive effect against delayed neuronal death through inhibition of Bax protein expression, although the precise relationship between the function of Bax protein and delayed neuronal death is still unclear.",
