     "AB": "1. The effects of KB-2796, a new diphenylpiperazine calcium antagonist, on the mitochondrial dysfunction and energy metabolism deficits were examined in the ischemic rat brain. 2. KB-2796 (30 mg/kg, p.o.), administered 60 min prior to decapitation, improved the reduced respiratory activity of mitochondria obtained from rat brain 5 min after decapitative ischemia. 3. KB-2796 (30 mg/kg, p.o.), administered 60 min prior to ischemic insult, improved both the reductions in pyruvate and ATP and prevented increases in the lactate/pyruvate ratio induced by 30-min forebrain ischemia in rats with 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO). 4. The effect of KB-2796 on local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was examined by a quantitative autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method in normal and 4-VO rats. 5. Postischemic LCGU measured 24 hr after reperfusion in the forebrain, in particular in the cortex, thalamus, geniculate body, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, colliculus, and corpus callosum, was below the normal control value. 6. KB-2796 (1 mg/kg, i.v.), administered 1 min prior to the injection of 2-[14C]deoxyglucose, improved the reductions in LCGU that were produced by cerebral ischemia in the cortex, thalamus, geniculate body, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra, but did not affect LCGU in normal rats. 7. These findings suggest that KB-2796 minimized the deficits in brain energy metabolism produced by ischemia; this agent may therefore be a valuable therapeutic drug in cerebrovascular-related disorders.",
