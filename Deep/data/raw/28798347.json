     "AB": "Recent studies have shown that overexpression of tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) is associated with many inflammatory diseases, including diabetes mellitus, which causes neuroinflammation in the hippocampus as well as hepatic steatosis. However, the exact mechanism in diabetic neuroinflammation is unknown. We report that haploinsufficiency of TonEBP inhibits hepatic and hippocampal high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) expression in diabetic mice. Here, mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks and received an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) and followed by continued HFD feeding for an additional 4 weeks to induce hyperglycemia and hepatic steatosis. Compared with wild-type diabetic mice, diabetic TonEBP(+/-) mice showed decreased body weight, fat mass, hepatic steatosis, and macrophage infiltration. We also found that adipogenesis and HMGB1 expression in the liver and hippocampus were lower in diabetic TonEBP(+/-) mice compared with the wild type. Furthermore, iba-1 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was decreased in diabetic TonEBP(+/-) mice compared with that in the wild type. Our findings suggest that TonEBP haploinsufficiency suppresses diabetes-associated hepatic steatosis and neuroinflammation.",
