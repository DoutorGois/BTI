     "AB": "The postsynaptic field potential (population spike; PS) was recorded in the CA1 area of guinea pig hippocampal slices in response to electrical stimulation of Schaffer's collateral. After tetanic stimulation (100 Hz for 1 s) to Schaffer's collateral, the PS amplitude increased to 127.9 +/- 7.7% (mean +/- S.E.M.) of the original level at 20 min and 140.1 +/- 7.7% at 60 min, and formed long-term potentiation (LTP). After application of 10 nM propentofylline, a synthetic xanthine derivative, which did not enhance the amplitude of the PS evoked by the test stimulus, the tetanic stimulation increased the amplitude to 160.3 +/- 3.8% at 20 min and 173.3 +/- 4.3% at 60 min. Thus, propentofylline enhances the formation of LTP in hippocampal slices.",
