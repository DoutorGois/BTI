In addition, the effect of prolonged administration of piracetam together with ethanol on rabbit EEG and after-discharges evoked by electrical stimulation of the hippocampus was studied. The blood ethanol concentrations were also monitored. Single administration of piracetam did not change the effects of ethanol, while when given prolongly with ethanol piracetam attenuated the effects of ethanol. Piracetam did not affect the ethanol blood level.",
