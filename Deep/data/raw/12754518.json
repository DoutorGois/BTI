Exogenous protein kinase activators increase release probability at several mammalian CNS synapses, but the physiological conditions under which presynaptic protein kinases become activated are not known. We report here that calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) is activated by high-frequency stimulation and mediates post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) in the rat hippocampus.",
