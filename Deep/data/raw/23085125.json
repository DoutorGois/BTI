     "AB": "Paired associates learning is impaired in both schizophrenia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), which may reflect hippocampal pathology. In addition, schizophrenia is characterized by the dysfunction of the retino-geniculo-striatal magnocellular (M) visual pathway. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between visual perceptual and memory dysfunctions. We administered a modified version of the CANTAB paired associates learning task to patients with schizophrenia (n=20), aMCI (n=20), and two groups of matched healthy controls (n=20 for each patient group). The stimuli in the paired associates learning task biased information processing toward the M pathways (low contrast, low spatial frequency) and parvocellular (P) pathways (high contrast, high spatial frequency). Results revealed that patients with schizophrenia exhibited a more pronounced learning deficit for M-biased relative to P-biased stimuli. In aMCI, there were similar memory deficits for both types of stimuli. Orientation discrimination for M- and P-biased stimuli was intact in both groups of patients. The number of errors in the M-biased memory condition significantly and inversely correlated with the volume of the right hippocampus in schizophrenia. These results suggest an interaction between M-biased perceptual processing and short-term relational memory in schizophrenia, which may be associated with the structural alteration of the right hippocampus.",
