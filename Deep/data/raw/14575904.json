     "AB": "Post-weaning social isolation of rats produces psychological and physiological changes that are relevant to schizophrenia. Here, we report that long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 to subiculum pathway is lower by 34%, (P<0.0001) in brain slices from isolates compared with those from socially housed rats. We also report that LTP in this pathway is NMDA receptor-dependent.",
