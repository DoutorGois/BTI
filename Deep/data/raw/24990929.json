     "AB": "Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is an RNA-binding protein implicated in RNA metabolism. Here, we investigated the role of hnRNP K in synapse function. We demonstrated that hnRNP K regulates dendritic spine density and long-term potentiation (LTP) in cultured hippocampal neurons from embryonic rats. LTP requires the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2-mediated phosphorylation and cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP K. Moreover, hnRNP K knockdown prevents ERK cascade activation and GluA1-S845 phosphorylation and surface delivery, which are essential steps for LTP. These findings establish hnRNP K as a new critical regulator of synaptic transmission and plasticity in hippocampal neurons.",
