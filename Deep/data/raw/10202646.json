     "AB": "In this study has been reveibed the peculiarities of convergence of afferent cortical inputs to the hypothalamic neurons. Single and the serial stimulation of phylogenetically distinct cortical areas (proreal cortex (field 8), cingular cortex (field 24), pyriform lobule (periamygdala cortex), and hippocampus (CA3) were used. We have established two main focuses of expressed convergence of signals from the above mentioned cortical areas. First of them was located in the lateral hypothalamus nucleus, second--in the centromedial hypothalamus nucleus. Single cortical stimulation was found to excite majority of hypothalamus neurons. Expressed prevalence of inhibitory responses over excitatory ones were found in case of serial stimulation application. This functional organisation of the hypothalamic nucleus allow to propose tonic character of the cortical influences due to serial stimulation and the eventual character of these influences due to single stimulation.",
