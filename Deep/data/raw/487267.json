     "AB": "The effect of tricyclic antidepressants, chlorpromazine, and some monoamine oxidase inhibitors on the accumulation of [14C]choline by crude synaptosomal (P2) fraction from different regions of rat brain (cortex, striatum, and hippocampus) was investigated. Analysis of choline uptake kinetics resulted in high- and low-affinity components with different Michaelis constants. All tricyclic antidepressants tested inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the high-affinity choline uptake in the three regions, amitriptyline being the most potent. The IC50 values correlated significantly with the relative potencies of imipramine congeners in binding to muscarinic receptors in the brain. Neither tranylcypromine nor pargyline in concentrations up to 0.1 mM had any effect on choline transport. Concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants effective in inhibiting the uptake of choline failed to influence significantly the activity of choline acetyltransferase in brain regions examined. The results suggest that the effect of imipramine congeners on high-affinity choline uptake may be reflected in the anticholinergic properties of these compounds.",
