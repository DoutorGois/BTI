     "AB": "The nicotinic antagonists d-tubocurarine and trimethaphan camsylate competitively inhibit GABA-induced currents. Hexamethonium, mecamylamine and dihydro-beta-erythroidine, other nicotinic antagonists, do not affect GABA-elicited currents. The trimethaphan effect is completely reversed by a putative convulsant receptor antagonist, alpha-isopropyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone, which implies that the trimethaphan binding site may be closely associated with the convulsant site. However, nicotine was ineffective in competing for either the d-tubocurarine or trimethaphan effect at the GABAA receptor. From these observations, we propose that the nicotinic and GABAA receptor ionophore complexes share similar configurational patterns that accommodate some of the same molecules. Possible mechanisms for the trimethaphan and d-tubocurarine blockades are discussed.",
