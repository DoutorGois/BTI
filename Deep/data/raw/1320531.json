     "AB": "Based on comparative clinical and morphometric studies in 45 autopsy cases of Parkinson's disease (PD), 27 clinically presenting with akinesia and rigidity (AR-type), 18 with predominant resting tremor (T-type), the neurobiological basis of the major clinical subtypes in PD is discussed. The AR-type showed higher neuronal losses in locus coeruleus (LC) and in medial and lateral parts of substantia nigra (SNM, SNL), suggesting lesion patterns different from the T-type. More severe cell loss in the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus was observed in PD patients with depression than in non-depressed ones. Demented PD subjects showed higher cell loss in SNM than non-demented ones indicating dysfunction of the mesocortical dopamine system, and significantly more severe Alzheimer lesions in isocortex and hippocampus. These and other recent data from the literature indicate that some major clinical features of PD are related to lesions of distinct neuronal systems.",
