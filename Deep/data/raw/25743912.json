     "AB": "Numerous rodent models of depression have been reported, most requiring a long experimental period and significant effort. We explored a new potential mouse model for depression by investigating whether exposure to a 15-day chronic stress paradigm could induce depression-like behavior in ICR mice. Animals in the stress-exposed groups were subjected to 3 h of restraint while immersed in a 28 degrees C water bath daily for 15 consecutive days. Immobility time in the forced swim test was increased in the chronic stress-exposed mice compared with the controls. Serum corticosterone levels were also much higher in the stressed mice than in the control mice. Hippocampal cell survival (BrdU-positive cells) and neurotrophic factor (NGF, TrkA) mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the chronic stress-exposed mice compared with controls. Administration of the anti-depressant drugs clomipramine (20 mg/kg/d) or imipramine (30 mg/kg/d) did not change the immobility time in the forced swim test, but treatment with lithium (100 mg/kg/d) did result in slight improvement. These results suggest that this 15-day chronic stress paradigm can induce depression-like behavior and neurological changes, in a short time and with minimal effort, facilitating the assessment of treatments for depression.",
