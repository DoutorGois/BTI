     "AB": "Optogenetic proteins are powerful tools for advancing our understanding of neural circuitry. However, the precision of optogenetics is dependent in part on the extent to which expression is limited to cells of interest. The Thy1-ChR2 transgenic mouse is commonly used in optogenetic experiments. Although general expression patterns in these animals have been characterized, a detailed evaluation of cell-type specificity is lacking. This information is critical for interpretation of experimental results using these animals. We characterized ChR2 expression under the Thy1promoter in line 18 in comparison to known expression profiles of hippocampal cell types using immunohistochemistry in CA1. ChR2 expression did not colocalize with parvalbumin or calbindin expressing interneurons. However, we found ChR2 expression to be localized in the deep sublayer of CA1 in calbindin-negative pyramidal cells. These findings demonstrate the utility of the Thy1-ChR2-YFP mouse to study the activity and functional role of excitatory neurons located in the deep CA1 pyramidal cell layer.",
