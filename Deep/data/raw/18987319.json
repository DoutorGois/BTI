     "AB": "Endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPA receptors is a mechanism through which efficiency of neurotransmission is regulated. We have genetically tested the hypothesis that synaptojanin 1, a phosphoinositide phosphatase implicated in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles presynaptically, may also function in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors postsynaptically. Electrophysiological recordings of cultured hippocampal neurons showed that miniature excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes were larger in synaptojanin 1 knockout (KO) neurons because of an increase of surface-exposed AMPA receptors. This change did not represent an adaptive response to decreased presynaptic release in KO cultures and was rescued by the expression of wild type, but not catalytically inactive synaptojanin 1, in the postsynaptic neuron. NMDA-induced internalization of pHluorin-tagged AMPA receptors (GluR2) was impaired in KO neurons. These results reveal a function of synaptojanin 1 in constitutive and triggered internalization of AMPA receptors and thus indicate a role for phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate metabolism in the regulation of postsynaptic AMPA responses.",
