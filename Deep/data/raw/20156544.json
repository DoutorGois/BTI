     "AB": "Aging leads to functional changes in the hippocampus, and consequently induces cognitive deficits, such as failure of memory. Neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus continues throughout life, but steadily declines from early adulthood. Apoptosis occurs under various pathologic and physiologic conditions, and excessive apoptotic cell death can cause a number of functional disorders in humans. Apoptosis in the hippocampus also disturbs cognitive functions. In this study, we examined the effect of treadmill exercise on memory in relation to neurogensis and apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of old-aged rats. The present results showed that loss of memory by aging was associated with a decrease in neurogenesis and an increase in apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Treadmill exercise improved short-term and spatial memories by enhancing neurogenesis and suppressing apoptosis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of old-aged rats. In the present study, we showed that treadmill exercise is a very useful strategy for preventing failure of memory in the elderly.",
