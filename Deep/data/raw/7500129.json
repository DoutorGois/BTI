     "AB": "1. The effects of somatostatin (SS) on the low-voltage-activated and high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels in pyramidal neurons acutely dissociated from the hippocampal CA1 region of 2- to 3-wk-old rats were investigated in a nystatin perforated-patch recording configuration under voltage-clamp conditions. 2. SS had no effect on the low-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel but did inhibit the HVA Ca2+ channel in a concentration-, time-, and voltage-dependent manner. 3. SS showed the activation phase of Ba2+ current (IBa) passing through HVA Ca2+ channels, and the maximum inhibition was 28% of the total current amplitude measured 10 ms after the current activation. The inhibitory effect was eliminated by applying larger depolarizing prepulses. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) completely blocked the effect of SS on HVA IBa, suggesting the contribution of PTX-sensitive Gi/Go proteins to the SS-induced inhibition. 4. The applications of forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, dibutyryl-guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate, staurosporine, and 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine did not affect either the control HVA IBa or the SS-induced inhibition of HVA IBa. 5. Pretreatment with protein kinase C (PKC) activators had no significant effect on HVA IBa but did remove the inhibition of HVA IBa by SS. 6. Omega-Conotoxin-GVIA, omega-agatoxin-IVA, nicardipine, and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC blocked HVA IBa by 27, 13, 38, and 9% of the total HVA current, respectively, which suggested the existence of N-, P-, L-, and Q-type HVA Ca2+ channels in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
