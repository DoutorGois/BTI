     "AB": "Place navigation is essential for an animal's survival and this behavior has attracted the attention of scientists focused on the neural and neuropharmacological bases of learning and memory. Many navigational tests are employed today, such as the Morris water maze (MWM) which demands a precise representation of an unmarked place. Another spatial paradigm is the active place avoidance task. It requires mainly cognitive coordination in contrast to the MWM. Various rat strains are used in the research of animal models of cognitive impairments. The aim of this study was to compare sensitivity to the administration of higher doses (1.5mg/kg and 3mg/kg) of the central cholinergic blocker, scopolamine in outbred Long-Evans and Wistar rats. The results showed that while Wistar rats were more strongly affected by cholinergic blockade in the active place avoidance than Long-Evans rats, no differences were seen in the MWM. Long-Evans rats also showed better baseline performance in the active place avoidance and visible platform versions of the MWM (the latter suggesting better vision). This study demonstrated task-specific inter-strain differences in sensitivity to central cholinergic blockade in an active place avoidance task requiring cognitive coordination.",
