     "AB": "Tritiated thymidine autoradiography has established that after interrupting the commissural afferents to the dentate gyrus a number of non-neuronal cells proliferate in the molecular layer. In the present study the fine structure of the proliferating cells was analyzed by reembedding the 2-microns thick plastic sections of the dentate gyrus which had been previously coated with a nuclear emulsion and processed for light microscopic autoradiography. The location of the labeled cells was plotted with a camera lucida and a few ultrathin sections were taken from the re-embedded sections. In these the labeled cells were re-identified and photographed in an electron microscope. Most of the identified proliferating cells exhibited the following morphological features: The nuclei were irregularly oval, sometimes with deep indentations and contained dense clumps of chromatin; their diameters ranged between 4.5 and 6.5 microns. The cytoplasm was generally disposed to one side of the nucleus and often extended into a few broad processes. The Golgi apparatus was well developed. Many rosettes of free ribosomes were scattered throughout the cytoplasm, and the rough endoplasmic reticulum usually consisted of a few short cisternae. Small multilamellated bodies were common, but dense inclusion bodies were infrequent. The observations reported in this paper suggest: 1. that the nonneuronal cells which proliferate in a neuropil undergoing a mild denervation are morphologically closely related to microglia; 2. that in young adult animals these cells do not seem to have been previously involved in intense phagocytic activity; and 3. that the proliferating cells are present in the neuropil at the time of the denervation.",
