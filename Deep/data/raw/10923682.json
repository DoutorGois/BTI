     "AB": "The human hippocampus is critical to episodic encoding, but the role of the amygdala in memory is less clear. Animal research suggests a role for the amygdala in associative memory, but this has not been examined systematically in humans. Using fMRI, we compared amygdala and hippocampus activation for seven healthy subjects during two visual encoding tasks: serially presented single faces and faces presented as pairs. Single faces activated bilateral hippocampi, but not the amygdala. Paired faces activated bilateral amygdala, but only the left hippocampus. Subtraction of the two conditions revealed greater activation within the left amygdala and hippocampus during paired face encoding, suggesting that associative encoding activates a left-lateralized limbic network including the hippocampus and amygdala.",
