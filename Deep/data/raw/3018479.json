     "AB": "t-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) produces dose-dependent enhancement of [3H]propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]PCC, 40 pM) binding to the benzodiazepine1 (BZ1) receptor subtype in hippocampus. Furthermore, TBPS enhancement of [3H]PCC binding was antagonized by micromolar concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in a way reversible by bicuculline. BZ receptor ligands that are \"GABA positive\" (i.e., enhance GABA neurotransmission) allosterically inhibited [35S]TBPS binding, whereas \"GABA-negative\" ligands (i.e., inhibit GABA neurotransmission) produced the opposite effect. The efficacy of the ligands as modulators of [35S]TBPS binding was consistent with their reported in vivo pharmacology. The effects of positive and negative ligands on [35S]TBPS binding were modulated by micromolar concentrations of GABA. Examination of the kinetics of [35S]TBPS binding suggested the presence of slowly and rapidly dissociating components. The GABA-positive clonazepam stabilized the rapidly dissociating component of [35S]TBPS binding, whereas methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate had a similar effect on the slowly dissociating component. It is speculated that the slowly dissociating component of [35S]TBPS binding is associated with a closed chloride channel, whereas the opposite is proposed for the rapidly dissociating component. The differential effects of GABA-positive versus GABA-negative ligands on [35S]TBPS binding and the modulatory effect of GABA provide further evidence to suggest that [35S]TBPS labels a site near the chloride ionophore linked to the GABA-BZ receptor complex.",
