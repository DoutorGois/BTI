     "AB": "Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) following intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) injection have been described in a previous paper from our laboratory. The SRSs are clinically similar to the seizures induced by kindling the amygdala and we suggested that the amygdala plays a role in initiating the SRSs. Accordingly, the present paper examines the effect of amygdaloid lesions on intrahippocampal KA-treated rats. There were short- and long-term effects. (1) Short-term: the toxicity of KA was increased in lesioned animals. Status epilepticus followed by death of the animals was evoked with half of the dose required to cause the same effect in intact rats. Moreover, a gross haematuria was encountered 6-12 h after KA injection. This was not observed in non-lesioned rats even following the highest KA doses. (2) Long-term: amygdaloid lesions delayed the occurrence of the SRSs, reduced their incidence and modified their expression. In lesioned animals seizures began with a period of tonic immobility with no sign of the masticatory movements seen in intact animals. Histological examination of the KA-induced lesions did not show any major differences between lesioned and intact animals. It is suggested that the short-term effects are due to an unspecific effect on homeostatic mechanisms, whereas the long-term ones reflect a specific involvement of the amygdala in the late appearing seizures.",
