     "AB": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of chronic (2-month) estradiol (E2) treatment on cholinergic function in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus of the female rat. Chronic E2 treatment selectively increased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the frontal cortex and decreased ChAT activity in the hypothalamus: hippocampal ChAT activity was not significantly changed. The decrease of ChAT activity in the hypothalamus was paralleled by a significant reduction in the content and release (basal and evoked) of acetylcholine (ACh) in this structure. Neither the content nor the release of ACh was altered in the frontal cortex. In the hippocampus, there was a significant increase in spontaneous ACh release; however, hippocampal ACh content and evoked ACh release were not changed. Chronic E2 treatment also altered nicotinic binding sites in these same regions as determined by saturation analysis of [3H]methylcarbamylcholine (MCC) to membranes. There was a decrease in the affinity and an increase in the density of [3H]MCC binding sites in hippocampal membranes and an increase in the density of [3H]MCC binding sites was observed in hypothalamic membranes. These alterations were paralleled by changes in nicotinic autoreceptor function within these two structures. In the hippocampus, the increase in spontaneous ACh release induced by MCC in control animals was no longer apparent after chronic treatment with E2. In hypothalamus, higher concentrations of the nicotinic agonist were required to increase spontaneous ACh release in slices from E2-treated rats as compared to control rats. Taken together, these results suggest that chronic E2 treatment decreases presynaptic cholinergic function in the female rat hippocampus and hypothalamus.",
