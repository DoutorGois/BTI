     "AB": "To relate different forms of synaptic plasticity to the formation and maintenance of place cells in the hippocampus, we have recorded place cells in freely behaving, transgenic mice that express a mutated Ca2+-independent form of CaM Kinase II. These mice have normal long-term potentiation (LTP) at 100 Hz, but they lack LTP in response to stimulation at 5-10 Hz and are impaired on spatial memory tasks. In these transgenic mice, the place cells in the CA1 region have three important differences from those of wild types: they are less common, less precise, and less stable. These findings suggest that LTP in the 5-10 Hz range may be important for the maintenance of place-field stability and that this stability may be essential for the storage of spatial memory.",
