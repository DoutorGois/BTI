     "AB": "Seizure-induced memory deficits are frequent in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the neural mechanisms responsible for this memory impairment are not entirely clear. Persistent changes in synaptic efficacy, long-term potentiation (LTP), and depression are considered a cellular substrate underlying the learning and memory processes. Using a lithium-pilocarpine model to induce status epilepticus (SE) in rats, the present study investigated whether the induction of LTP was altered in hippocampal slices obtained 3 h, 1, 3, and 7 days after SE. One week after SE, LTP induction was decreased in hippocampal slices. The reduced plasticity in post-SE tissue was attributable to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent LTP. In contrast to control tissue, ifenprodil, a GluN2B-selective antagonist, did not reduce the LTP level in post-SE tissue, suggesting that SE disturbs the functional properties of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. These changes in synaptic transmission may contribute toward the genesis of epilepsy and seizure-associated memory deficits.",
