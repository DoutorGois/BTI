     "AB": "We report on novel sites of expression of the bHLH transcription factor NSCL1 in the developing forebrain, hindbrain and spinal cord in chick and mouse. In the hindbrain in particular, NSCL1 is the first bHLH transcription factor detected so far in rhombomere boundaries and its expression is coincident with boundary formation and maintenance. Novel sites of expression of this gene include the hippocampus, septum, tectum and hypothalamic nuclei. NSCL1 is thus expressed in various neuronal populations that are either not actively proliferating or postmitotic.",
