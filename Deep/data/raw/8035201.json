     "AB": "Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are a heterogeneous family of G protein-coupled glutamate receptors that are linked to multiple second messenger systems in the CNS. In this study the selectivity of mGluR agonists for different mGluR second messenger effects was characterized in slices of the rat hippocampus. The mGluR agonists (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid and (2S,3S,4S)alpha-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine produced multiple effects on second messengers that included enhanced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in both adult and neonatal rat hippocampus, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation in adult tissue, and increases in basal cAMP formation in the neonatal hippocampus. In contrast, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine was potent and effective in increasing phosphoinositide hydrolysis in both adult and neonatal hippocampus but unlike the other mGluR agonists did not inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation (in the adult) or substantially enhance basal cAMP formation (in the neonate). Thus, in the rat hippocampus mGluR agonist-mediated increases or decreases in cAMP formation are not secondary to mGluR-mediated changes in phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Furthermore, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine can be used to activate subpopulations of mGluRs coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis with minimal effects on cAMP-mGluR second messenger systems.",
