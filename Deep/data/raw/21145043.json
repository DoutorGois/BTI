     "AB": "The subcallosal cingulate gyrus (SCG), including Brodmann area 25 and parts of 24 and 32, is the portion of the cingulum that lies ventral to the corpus callosum. It constitutes an important node in a network that includes cortical structures, the limbic system, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem nuclei. Imaging studies have shown abnormal SCG metabolic activity in patients with depression, a pattern that is reversed by various antidepressant therapies. The involvement of the SCG in mechanisms of depression and its emerging potential role as a surgical target for deep brain stimulation has focused recent interest in this area. We review anatomic and histologic attributes of the SCG and the morphologic and imaging changes observed in depression. Particular attention is given to the regional and downstream structures that could be influenced by the application of deep brain stimulation in this region.",
