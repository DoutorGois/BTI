     "AB": "Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) undergo caspase-mediated retrograde apoptosis after target removal (bulbectomy), in which axonal caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation leads to terminal apoptosis in ORN soma of the olfactory epithelium. Here, we show that caspase-8 can act as an initiator of ORN apoptosis after bulbectomy and also after synaptic instability is induced by NMDA-mediated excitotoxic death of ORN target neurons in the olfactory bulb. Caspase-8 and caspase-3 are sequentially activated within ORN presynaptic terminals, and caspase-8 complexes with dynactin p150Glued, (a retrograde motor protein) and is transported retrogradely, preceding axonal caspase-3 activation and apoptosis of ORN cell bodies. Focal in vivo inhibition of initiator caspase activation or microtubule-dependent transport (with Taxol) at the lesioned axon terminus results in a significant reduction in retrograde axonal caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and inhibition of retrograde ORN death. Caspase-8 activation and retrograde transport after NMDA lesion is similarly reduced in mice null for p75, the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor. The retrograde apoptosis of ORNs thus involves a novel mechanism that used p75 in the local activation of caspase-8. Once caspase-8 is maximally activated in the presynaptic terminal, it is transported retrogradely by the motor complex dynactin/dynein, a process that can be inhibited focally to inhibit ORN apoptosis after acute axonal lesion. These data have revealed a novel mechanism of retrograde apoptosis, in which caspase-8 complexes directly with axonal dynactin p150Glued to reveal a differential vulnerability of subpopulations of ORNs to undergo apoptosis after axonal damage and the loss of olfactory bulb target neurons.",
