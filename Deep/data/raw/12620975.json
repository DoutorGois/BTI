     "AB": "Neurotrophins have multiple functions during peripheral nervous system development such as controlling neuronal survival, target innervation and synaptogenesis. Neurotrophin specificity has been attributed to the selective expression of the Trk tyrosine kinase receptors in different neuronal subpopulations. However, despite overlapping expression of TrkB and TrkC in many sensory ganglia, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin 3 (NT3) null mutant mice display selective losses in neuronal subpopulations. In the present study we have replaced the coding part of the BDNF gene in mice with that of NT3 (BDNF(NT3/NT3)) to analyse the specificity and selective roles of BDNF and NT3 during development. Analysis of BDNF(NT3/NT3) mice showed striking differences in the ability of NT3 to promote survival, short-range innervation and synaptogenesis in different sensory systems. In the cochlea, specificity is achieved by a tightly controlled spatial and temporal ligand expression. In the vestibular system TrkB or TrkC activation is sufficient to promote vestibular ganglion neuron survival, while TrkB activation is required to promote proper innervation and synaptogenesis. In the gustatory system, NT3 is unable to replace the actions of BDNF possibly because of a temporally selective expression of TrkB in taste neurons. We conclude that there is no general mechanism by which neurotrophin specificity is attained and that specificity is achieved by (i) a tightly controlled spatial and temporal expression of ligands, (ii) different Trk receptors playing distinct roles within the same neuronal subpopulation, or (iii) selective receptor expression in sensory neuron subpopulations.",
