     "AB": "Zinc plays an important role in the development and maintenance of central neural system. Zinc deficiency has been known to alter normal brain function, whose molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. In the present study, we established a zinc deficiency-exposed rat model, and, using western blot and immunohistochemical analyses, found that the expression of FoxO3a and p27(kip1) was remarkably up-regulated in the rat brain hippocampus. Immunofluorescence assay showed that FOXO3a and p27(kip1) were significantly co-localized with nestin, the marker of neural stem cells (NSCs). Furthermore, we identified that the proportion of proliferating NSCs was markedly decreased in zinc-deficient rat hippocampaus. Using C17.2 neural stem cells, it was revealed that exposure to zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethy) ethylenediamine induced the expression of FoxO3a and p27(kip1) , which coincided with reduced NSC proliferation. Furthermore, depletion of FoxO3a inhibited p27(kip1) expression and restored the growth of NSCs. On the basis of these data, we concluded that FoxO3a/p27(kip1) signaling might play a significant role in zinc deficiency-induced growth impairment of NSCs and consequent neurological disorders. We describe here that zinc deficiency induces the proliferative impairment of hippocampal neural stem cells partially through the activation of FOXO3a-p27 axis in rats. Neural progenitor cells exhibited significantly up-regulated expression of FOXO3a and p27 after zinc deficiency in vivo and in vitro. Depletion of FOXO3a ameliorates zinc deficiency-induced expression of p27 and growth impairment of neural stem cells. We provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying zinc deficiency-induced neurological deficits.",
