     "AB": "In previous studies electrically-evoked release of acetylcholine in septal slices was demonstrated. The present experiment aimed at verifying if this release involved intrinsic neurons bearing p75(NTR) receptors. Long-Evans rats sustained injections of 192 IgG-saporin into the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (0.8 microg). Sham-operated rats served as controls. Two to 3.5 weeks later, the electrically-evoked release of acetylcholine ([(3)H]ACh) was measured in slices from the lateral septum (LS), medial septum (MS) and diagonal band of Broca (DBB). Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and monoamine concentrations were measured in the septum, cortex and hippocampus. The lesion extent was also assessed by ChAT immunostaining in a separate series of rats. In the septum, the number of ChAT-positive neurons was depleted dramatically (>90% at the level of the injection site). In the hippocampus, the lesions reduced ChAT and AChE activity by 91% and 84%, respectively. In the cortex, this reduction was weaker (-55% and -47%). In the septal region, the reduction was either weak or not significant. The evoked release of acetylcholine in septal slices was not reduced, except in the slices from the LS (-64%). The effects of physostigmine and atropine confirmed the presence of autoreceptors. Our data exclude that a major part of the acetylcholine released by MS and DBB slices derived from intrinsic neurons bearing p75(NTR) receptors. In the LS, part of the released acetylcholine might be from projections of such neurons located in the LS, MS and/or DBB. These data also suggest that the MS and the DBB may be the target of extrinsic cholinergic innervation that does not bear p75(NTR) receptors.",
