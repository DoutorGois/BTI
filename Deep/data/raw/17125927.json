     "AB": "Changes of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in the hypophysis and brain (frontal cortex, hippocampus, medial septum and basal ganglia), and butyrylcholinesterase in plasma and liver following galanthamine (GAL) administration were studied in rats pretreated with L-carnitine (CAR). Following only GAL administration (10 mg/kg, i.m.), both cholinesterases (without clinical symptoms of GAL overdosage) were significantly inhibited. Pretreatment with CAR (3 consecutive days, 250 mg/kg, p.o.) followed by GAL administration showed higher AChE inhibition in comparison with single GAL administration. However, a statistically significant difference was observed for AChE in the hippocampus only. The activity of peripheral cholinesterases was not influenced by CAR pretreatment. Thus, pretreatment with CAR enhanced AChE inhibition in some brain parts of the rat following GAL administration.",
