     "AB": "In slices of rat hippocampus, adenosine and several adenosine derivatives depressed evoked neuronal responses to afferent stimulation. The nanomolar potency of adenosine derivatives and their relative effectiveness indicate that the depression of evoked potentials is mediated via an A1-adenosine receptor. A remarkable similarity was found between the relative potencies of nucleoside derivatives with respect to their electrophysiological effects and to their inhibition of high affinity [3H] cyclohexyladenosine ([3H]CHA) binding to rat brain membranes. We conclude that the [3H] CHA binding site in rat brain membranes represents a physiological receptor of the A1-type.",
