     "AB": "The modes of stem cell divisions (e.g., symmetric vs. asymmetric) can have a profound impact on the number of progeny and tissue growth, repair, and function. This is particularly relevant for adult neural stem cells, since stem cell-derived neurons affect cognitive and mental states, resistance to stress and disease, and response to therapies. Here we show that although dividing stem cells in the adult hippocampus display a certain bias towards paired distribution (which could imply the prevalence of symmetric divisions), this bias already exists in the distribution of the general population of stem cells and may be responsible for the perceived occurrence of symmetric stem cell divisions. Remarkably, the bias in the distribution of stem cells decreases with age. Our results argue that the preexisting bias in stem cell distribution may affect current assumptions regarding stem cell division and fate as well as conjectures on the prospects of brain repair and rejuvenation.",
