     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study if the Pueraria crude extreact (CP) and standard preparation of pure puerarin (SP) possess the same neuroprotective effects on the expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 in the embryonic mouse hippocampal cells. METHODS: The hippocampus of 18-days-old mouse embryo was taken out and suspension of single cells was cultured. Ethanol was added to cause HSP70 mRNA expression. Solvent, ethanol of different concentrations (50, 200, and 300 mmol/L), SP + ethanol, and SP + ethanol were added respectively. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of the expression of HSP70 mRNA. RESULTS: Ethanol of different concentrations increased the expression of HSP70 mRNA and the protein in comparison with the solvent control group. SP and CP inhibited the expression of HSP70 mRNA and protein. CONCLUSION: With identical effect of anti-oxidative stress, both SP and CP inhibit the increase of expression of HSP70 mRNA and protein, thus demonstrating I vitro anti-oxidative neuroprotection.",
