     "AB": "This study deals with the question of whether in vivo application of [125I]iodo-quinuclidinyl-benzilate (QNB) is able to demonstrate changes in cortical muscarinic receptor density induced by a cholinergic immunolesion of the rat basal forebrain cholinergic system, and whether the potential effects on IQNB distribution in vivo are also associated with effects on regional cerebral perfusion. Immunolesioned and control animals were injected with (R,S) [125]iodo-QNB and with [99mTc]-d,l-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO). The cerebral distribution of both tracers was imaged using double tracer autoradiography. Impaired cholinergic transmission was paralleled by a 10-15% increase of [125I]iodo-QNB binding in the regions of cortex and hippocampus. The local cerebral blood flow remained unchanged after cholinergic lesion.",
