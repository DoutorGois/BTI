     "AB": "In our study, we used rapid electrical hippocampal kindling and in vivo microdialysis methods to assess the involvement of inflammatory mediators: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and proinflammatory interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in mechanisms of epileptogenesis. We observed, that both, LPS and IL-1beta, administered into stimulated hippocampus, accelerated kindling process. LPS also increased the expression of IL-1beta in stimulated hippocampus in kindled rats. In vivo acute LPS perfusion, via a microdialysis cannula implanted into the naive rat's hippocampus, produced an increase in extracellular glutamate release. We suppose, that particularly IL-1beta action and increased glutamate concentration may significantly contribute to LPS effects on kindling development.",
