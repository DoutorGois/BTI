     "AB": "Cell therapy is thought to have a central role in restorative therapy, which aims to restore function to the damaged nervous system. The purpose of this study was to establish an autologous neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation model using adult rats and to compare survival, migration, and differentiation between this system and allogeneic NSC transplantation. Furthermore, we compared the immunologic response of the host tissue between autologous and allogeneic transplantation. NSCs were removed from the subventricular zone of adult Fischer 344 rats using stereotactic methods. NSCs were expanded and microinjected into normal hippocampus in the autologous brain. Allogeneic NSC (derived from adult Wistar rats) transplantation was performed using the same procedure, and hippocampal sections were analyzed immunohistologically 3 weeks post-transplantation. The cell survival and migration rate were higher for autologous transplantation than for allogeneic transplantation, and the neuronal differentiation rate in the autologous transplanted cells far exceeded that of allogeneic transplantation. Furthermore, there was less astrocyte and microglia reactivity in the host tissue of the autologous transplantation compared with allogeneic transplantation. These findings demonstrate that immunoreactivity of the host tissue strongly influences cell transplantation in the CNS as the autologous transplantation did not induce host tissue immunoreactivity; the microenvironment was essentially maintained in an optimal condition for the transplanted cells.",
