     "AB": "It is well recognized that the neurotrophin family of factors as well as neurotransmitters play critical roles in the ontogeny of the brain. Moreover, a growing literature suggests that these environmental signals do not operate individually, but interact in critical ways to enhance maturation. This review focuses on three brain systems where this collaboration is particularly evident: the cerebellum, the basal forebrain-hippocampus and locus coeruleus-hippocampus. The material presented indicates that cross-talk between neurotransmitters and neurotrophins may be a mechanism common to the development of multiple neuronal groups throughout the central nervous system. Moreover, this cross-talk appears to involve the interaction of both neuronal and glial cell populations.",
