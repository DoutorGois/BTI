The results suggest that the activation of V1 receptor induces IP3 production which release Ca2+ from IP3-sensitive Ca2+ storage sites. The Ca2+ binds to CaM, resulting in the activation of Ca2+/CaM-sensitive adenylate cyclases. Consequently, the activation of PKA inhibits IGly. The inhibitory actions of NC-1900 and its analogues on IGly might be involved in their ameliorating effects on impairments of learning and memory in the CA1 neurons.",
