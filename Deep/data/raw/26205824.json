     "AB": "Immunotherapy with the cytokine interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) can induce symptoms of depression, and it is likely that the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway may be involved in this regard. In this study we investigated the effects of IFN-alpha on depression-like behaviour and central metabolites of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway in rats. Secondly, we explored the modulating effects of an antidepressant (imipramine) and anti-inflammatory drug (celecoxib) on IFN-alpha-induced behavioural and pathophysiological changes in the brain. The following treatment groups were used: Control (saline), IFN-alpha (6x10(4)IU/kg s.c.), IFN-alpha+imipramine or IFN-alpha+celecoxib. Drugs were administered daily for 1 week. IFN-alpha treatment induced depression-like behaviour by increasing immobility in the forced swim test (FST), and decreased tryptophan levels in the brain. There was a trend for an increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, indicative of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activation, and increased quinolinic acid in the hippocampus. Imipramine decreased immobility in the FST, but did not reverse the IFN-alpha-induced changes in the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway. There was a trend for celecoxib to decrease immobility and to reverse the IFN-alpha-induced increase in the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. Thus, our study provides further evidence for IFN-alpha-induced depression-like behaviour through central changes of the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway.",
