     "AB": "The lipofuscin of pyramidal cells in each hippocampal subfield of each of seven human autopsy cases without brain disease at the age of 3-12 months (infants) and of 17-23 years (young adults) was comparatively investigated at the electron microscopic level. In infant pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal subfields CA 1, CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4 O-2, very small lipofuscin particles were observed. The lipofuscin composition showed a slightly larger granular component compared to the vacuolar component with one or two small lipid droplets. No obvious ultrastructural variability of lipofuscin granules was observed. The CA 1 lipofuscin in young adults consists of larger particles than in infants, but no obvious difference in the composition of granular and vacuolar components from the infant lipofuscin was seen. The amount of lipofuscin in CA 1 strongly increased in young adults compared to infants and appeared in a perinuclear distribution. In young adults, in contrast to the infant group, the amount of lipofuscin in the subfields CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4 was significantly higher than in CA 1. In CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4 pyramidal neurons, the vacuolar component was significantly larger than the granular component. The similarity of infant hippocampal lipofuscin patterns in all subfields is discussed as a state of immaturity. To explain the observed differences between the CA 1 and the other subfields during neuronal development, as shown in the young adult group, several factors are discussed: the effects of cell specific metabolism, cellular functional activity, cytoprotective mechanisms and effects of efferent and afferent pathways connected with the subfields.",
