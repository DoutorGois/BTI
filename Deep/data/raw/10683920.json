     "AB": "Employing the immunocytochemical analysis, we observed the alterations of Substance P-Immune Reaction (SP-IR) positive neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala in rats suffering from epilepsy induced by Penicillin (PEN). The result showed that the number of neurons of epileptic group was higher than that of the control group and no significant change in the rumber of neurons was observed in the group in which PEN was given after injection of Nimodine. It indicates that SP and Ca2+ participate in the process of epileptogenesis.",
