     "AB": "The molecular mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus are not well understood. Transient depolarisation of cultured postnatal hippocampal neurones (3x1 s exposure to 90 mM K+) induces a form of LTP that is manifest primarily as an increase in mEPSC frequency. Site-directed antibodies that recognise an extracellular region of all AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits (GluR1-4) were used for the immunolabelling of living neurones. These antibodies were raised in two species to enable sequential immunofluorescent labelling of individual living neurones before and after the induction of LTP. High K+ treatment resulted in the appearance of new AMPAR clusters at sites on the neuronal surface that previously lacked detectable AMPARs. The appearance of new AMPAR clusters was NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent since it was antagonised by the application of NMDAR antagonists. Our data indicate that the transient synaptic activation of NMDARs can lead to the insertion of native AMPARs at sites on the neuronal membrane that initially lacks AMPARs.",
