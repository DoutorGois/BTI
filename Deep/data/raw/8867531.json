     "AB": "Studies of age-related changes based on the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test appear to be inconsistent and contradictory. In our work, real basal (hypothetical, corrected to the zero concentration of atmospheric oxygen), basal (atmospheric oxygen-stimulated) and stimulated (L-glutamic and hydrochloric acids) levels of TBA-reactive products (TBARP) were estimated in the brain (hippocampus--HPC, cortex--COR, cerebellum--CRB) from young (3 months) and old (28 months) male and female Wistar rats. The values of basal levels of TBARP were different in young (HPC > COR > CRB) as well as in old animals (COR > CRB > HPC). Thus, the process of aging caused a significant decrease in the HPC (to 72%) and no change in the COR and CRB. Levels stimulated by L-glutamic acid were significantly decreased (COR, CRB) and unchanged (HPC) in old compared to young animals. The real basal levels estimated by regression analysis seem to be higher in the brain tissue damaged by aging. We discuss the usefulness of the TBA test applied to aged tissue, the effect of acidosis, the effectivity of L-glutamic acid to generate free radicals and the differences between individual brain areas.",
