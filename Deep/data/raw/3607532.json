     "AB": "High affinity choline uptake (HACU) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity were measured in synaptosomal P2 fractions from four brain regions in a mammalian hibernator, the golden-mantled ground squirrel. The 14CO2 evolution from [6-14C]glucose was also measured. Comparisons were made across the euthermic (not hibernating) and hibernation state in synaptosomes from cortex (CTX), preoptic area and hypothalamus (POA/HYP), olfactory apparatus (OA), and hippocampus (HPC). HACU was significantly increased in the CTX, from hibernating ground squirrels compared to euthermic animals. ChAT activity was significantly increased in the CTX and OA from hibernating animals. No change in either cholinergic marker was evident for the POA/HYP and HPC. The evolution of 14CO2 from [6-14C]glucose was generally, though not significantly, higher for synaptosomes from euthermic animals compared to hibernating animals. The results are discussed with reference to the involvement of cholinergic mechanisms in the control of hibernation.",
