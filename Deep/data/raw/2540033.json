     "AB": "Two full-length cDNA clones encoding alpha- and beta-subunits of a GABAA receptor have been isolated from a rat cerebral cortex cDNA library. The mature alpha-subunit protein consists of 428 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 48,680. This protein is highly homologous (approximately 99% amino acid identity) with the bovine brain alpha 1-subunit receptor [(1988) Nature 335, 76-79]. The mature rat beta-subunit receptor is a 448 amino acid polypeptide and shares approximately 80% amino acid identity with the previously characterized bovine GABAA receptor beta-subunit [(1987) Nature 328, 221-227]. Co-expression of the cloned DNA in Xenopus oocytes produces a functional receptor and ion channel with pharmacological characteristics of a GABAA receptor. GABAA alpha- and beta-subunit mRNA is detectable in the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus.",
