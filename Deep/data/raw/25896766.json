     "AB": "Recent studies suggest that the toxic effects of Abeta can be attributed to its capability to insert in membranes and form pore-like structures, which are permeable to cations and molecules such as ATP. Our working hypothesis is that Abeta increases extracellular ATP causing activation of P2X receptors and potentiating excitatory synaptic activity. We found that soluble oligomers of beta-amyloid peptide increased cytosolic Ca(2+) 4-fold above control (415 +/- 28% of control). Also, ATP leakage (157 +/- 10% of control) was independent of extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting that ATP traveled from the cytosol through an Abeta pore-mediated efflux and not from exocytotic mechanisms. The subsequent activation of P2XR by ATP can contribute to the cytosolic Ca(2+) increase observed with Abeta. Additionally, we found that beta-amyloid oligomers bind preferentially to excitatory neurons inducing an increase in excitatory synaptic current frequency (248.1 +/- 32.7%) that was blocked by the use of P2XR antagonists such as PPADS (Abeta + PPADS: 110.9 +/- 18.35%) or Apyrase plus DPCPX (Abeta + inhibitors: 98.97 +/- 17.4%). Taken together, we suggest that Abeta induces excitotoxicity by binding preferentially to excitatory neuron membranes forming a non-selective pore and by increasing intracellular calcium by itself and through P2XR activation by extracellular ATP leading to an augmention in mEPSC activity. All these effects were blocked with a non-specific P2XR antagonist, indicating that part of the neurotoxicity of Abeta is mediated by P2XR activation and facilitation of excitatory neurotransmitter release. These findings suggest that P2XR can be considered as a potential new target for the development of drugs or pharmacological tools to treat Alzheimer's disease.
