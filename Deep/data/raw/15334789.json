     "AB": "Possible diabetes mellitus-induced changes in hippocampal monoaminergic activities were studied to understand the relationships between neurotransmitter levels and various abnormalities in freely moving diabetic rats. We used both experimentally (STZ rats) and spontaneously diabetic rats (WBN/Kob rats) as the diabetic animal model, and compared the findings with those obtained from non-diabetic rats (C rats). Measurement of neurotransmitters (serotonin and dopamine) was carried out using an in vivo microdialysis method. We found that: 1) the basal level of serotonin in the hippocampus was lowest in WBN rats, followed by STZ rats, then by C rats. The level of serotonin in WBN rats was about a half of that in C rats; 2) the basal level of dopamine was also significantly lower in the diabetic WBN and STZ rats than in C rats. The data show that diabetes mellitus decreases in the monoamine release from the hippocampus in both experimentally and spontaneously diabetic rats.",
