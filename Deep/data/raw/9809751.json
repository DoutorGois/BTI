     "PG": "897-909",
     "AB": "A novel member of the metallocarboxypeptidase gene family was identified from its homology with carboxypeptidase E and has been designated CPX-2. The cDNA of 2500 nucleotides encodes a protein of 764 amino acids that contains an N-terminal signal peptide-like sequence, a 158-residue discoidin domain, and a 400-residue carboxypeptidase domain. The 400-residue metallocarboxypeptidase domain has 59% amino acid identity with a protein designated AEBP-1; 44% to 46% identity with carboxypeptidases E, N, and Z; and lower homology with other members of the metallocarboxypeptidase gene family. The discoidin domain of CPX-2 has 22% amino acid identity with the carbohydrate-binding domain of discoideum-I, 29% to 34% identity with the phospholipid-binding domain of human factors V and VIII, and 59% identity with the discoidin-like domain on AEBP-1. CPX-2 is missing several of the predicted active-site residues that are conserved in most other members of the metallocarboxypeptidase gene family and which are thought to be required for enzyme activity. Expression of CPX-2 using the baculovirus system produced several forms of protein, from 80 to 105 kDa, but no detectable activity toward a variety of carboxypeptidase substrates. A shorter 50-kDa form of CPX-2, which contains the carboxypeptidase domain but not the discoidin domain, was also inactive when expressed in the baculovirus system. CPX-2 is able to bind to Sepharose-Arg; this binding is blocked by 10 mM Arg. Northern blot analysis showed CPX-2 mRNA in mouse brain, liver, kidney, and lung. In situ hybridization analysis of brain revealed a broad distribution. Areas that are enriched in CPX-2 include the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, median eminence, and choroid plexus. Taken together, these data suggest a widespread function for CPX-2, possibly as a binding protein rather than an active carboxypeptidase.",
