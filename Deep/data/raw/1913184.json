     "AB": "We recently demonstrated that long-lasting photosensitivity is acquired as a result of kindling of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and that the LGN-kindled cat pretreated with D, L-allylglycine represents a useful model of epilepsy for drug studies. The present experiments studied anticonvulsant effects of a serotonin precursor, L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), on photosensitivity in the LGN-kindled cat under D,L-allylglycine and on LGN-kindled seizures. 5-HTP suppressed both myoclonic responses and paroxysmal EEG discharges induced by photic stimulation in a dose-related manner. Photically-induced seizures were completely blocked 1.5-2 h after injection of 20 mg/kg 5-HTP. 5-HTP was also effective in reducing the afterdischarge duration and behavioral seizure stage in LGN-kindled seizures; following 40 mg/kg administration, no electroclinical seizures were elicited in the LGN-kindled cats. Serotonergic mechanisms may play an important role in epileptic photosensitivity; the 5-HTP suppressive effect on photosensitivity is at least partly due to reduced neuronal activity at the level of the LGN via serotonergic inhibition.",
