     "AB": "Attenuating amyloid-beta mediated neurodegeneration is of major therapeutic consideration in the potential treatment of Alzheimer disease. Previously, we found that a high dietary consumption of retinoic acid was associated with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer disease. Therefore, in this study, we investigated whether amyloid-beta mediated cell death in primary hippocampal neurons could be prevented by retinoic acid isomers. Our results suggest that retinoic acid isomers, including all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis retinoic acid, and 13-cis retinoic acid, may play an important role in protecting neurons from amyloid-beta -induced cell death. Retinoic acid may therefore afford a novel therapeutic mechanism for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer disease.",
