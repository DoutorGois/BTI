     "AB": "Intracellular recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal neurones of hippocampus maintained in organotypic culture. Both spontaneous interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was observed. CNQX, an antagonist at kainate/quisqualate but not at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive excitatory amino acid receptors depressed but did not abolish spontaneous epileptiform activity. Addition of the specific NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV) abolished the remaining activity. Similar effects were observed on electrically evoked excitatory post synaptic potentials (EPSPs). This suggests a role for endogenous excitatory amino acids acting at both kainate/quisqualate and NMDA sensitive excitatory amino acid receptors in the generation and maintainance of epileptiform activity within these organotypic cultures.",
