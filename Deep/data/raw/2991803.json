     "AB": "The activity of three forms of ATPase were examined in fractions of the brain of the gerbil treated with ethylene glycol-N-N-tetra-acetic acid (EGTA) under a variety of conditions of primary and secondary (reflow) ischemia. In animals which were unilateral ischemic (ligation of the right common carotid), damage to Na+, K+-ATPase alone was observed only after at least 6 hr of ischemia had elapsed. The phenomenon occurred in only symptomatic gerbils and was absent in animals which were either asymptomatic or only displayed partial neurological symptoms. Under conditions of bilateral cerebral ischemia, in which both carotid arteries were clamped, only irreversible ischemia (60 min) followed by reflow, was associated with highly significant damage to cerebral Na+, K+-ATPase. In regional studies of the forebrain involving ischemia for 60 min plus 30 min reflow, damage to Na+, K+-ATPase was evident in the cerebrum, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus, while the hypothalamus and olfactory bulb were spared. Pretreatment of gerbils with allopurinol, clonazepam or combinations of thiopental plus either indomethacin or methylprednisolone offered protection to cerebral Na+, K+-ATPase subsequent to secondary ischemia. With only minor exceptions (striatum) neither Ca2+, Mg2+- nor Mn2+-ATPase were altered by stroke or treatment with drugs.",
