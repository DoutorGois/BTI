     "AB": "Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone-I (GnRH) has been implicated in an array of functions outside the neuroendocrine reproductive axis. Previous investigations have reported extensive GnRH binding in numerous sites and this has been supported by in situ hybridization studies reporting GnRH receptor mRNA distribution. The present study on mice and sheep supports and extends these earlier investigations by revealing the distribution of cells immunoreactive for the GnRH receptor. In addition to sites previously shown to express GnRH receptors such as the hippocampus, amygdala and the arcuate nucleus, the improved resolution afforded by immunocytochemistry detected cells in the mitral cell lay of the olfactory bulb as well as the central grey of the mesencephalon. In addition, GnRH receptor immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus and mesencephalon of the sheep were shown to colocalize with estrogen receptor beta. Although GnRH may act at some of these sites to regulate reproductive processes, evidence is accumulating to support an extra-reproductive role for this hypothalamic decapeptide.",
