     "AB": "Because heterozygous reeler (HR) mice share some abnormal traits with schizophrenic patients, and schizophrenia is often accompanied by impairment of olfactory function, this study examines reelin in the olfactory bulb of the HR mouse. In the WT mouse, reelin immunoreactivity is found in the extracellular matrix, and in the cytoplasm of olfactory nerve fibers, GABAergic interneurons, and glutamatergic mitral cells. Western blot analysis reveals that reelin immunoreactivity in the HR mouse is reduced by 45% compared to WT mouse. This is especially evident in the glomerular GABAergic interneurons. In WT mitral cells, reelin is found in discrete clumps near the axon hillock and within the axon. In the HR mouse, reelin axonal staining is diffuse and densely packed. In the rostral migratory stream of the HR mouse, immunolabeling shows an accumulation of reelin-containing neuronal precursors, apparently unable to shift from tangential to radial migration. These observations indicate that there is a downregulation of reelin in the HR mouse and suggest that secretion of reelin may be compromised. Further studies of the HR mouse may provide a new basis for understanding the role of reelin in the adult CNS, especially as it may relate to schizophrenia.",
