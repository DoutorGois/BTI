     "AB": "The activity of methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) was investigated in erythrocytes and postmortem brain specimens (cortex gyrus frontalis, hippocampus and thalamus) of patients with schizophrenia treated with neuroleptics. In comparison with the control group, abnormally low values of MAT Vmax and an increased MAT affinity towards methionine (lower Km values) were found in erythrocytes. In the brain, a regionally selective decrease of MAT Km was found in cortex gyrus frontalis but the Vmax values were however, unchanged. In the regions of cortex gyrus frontalis and hippocampus, but not in thalamus, the values of Vmax and Km were inversely correlated with the duration of schizophrenia. In rats treated for 28 days with the typical neuroleptic haloperidol and the atypical clozapine, a significant increase of MAT activity was found in the corpus striatum. There is the possibility that the changes observed in MAT activity in patients with schizophrenia are attributed to the neuroleptic medication.",
