     "AB": "Colchicine injections in the supracommissural septum of the rat caused degeneration of several neurons in the nucleus triangularis septi and the nucleus septofimbrialis. The lesions resulted in significant decreases of choline acetyltransferase in the habenula (-34%) and in the nucleus interpeduncularis (-36%), thus demonstrating the existence of a major cholinergic projection to these nuclei from the supracommissural septum. A large fall in choline acetyltransferase was also noticed in the dorsal hippocampus as a consequence of colchicine damage to the fimbria-fornix fibers crossing the injected area.",
