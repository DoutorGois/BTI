     "AB": "The occurrence and topographic analysis of granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) in the hippocampal cortex of mentally normal controls (75 cases) and patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD; 17 cases which included Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of Alzheimer type), multi-infarct dementia (MID; 16 cases), Pick's disease (PD; 5 cases) and atypical dementia [5 cases; non-Alzheimer, non-Pick dementia with Fahr's syndrome (NANPDF)] were investigated. GVD was rarely found in control cases below the age of 60 years. In elderly normal brains, the statistically most representative ranking order of predilection for GVD (in decreasing severity) was: in the 60 s, CA1 > prosubiculum > CA2 (no GVD was found in the CA3 and CA4); in the 70 s, CA1 > prosubiculum > CA2 > CA3 > CA4; in the 80 s, CA1 > prosubiculum > CA2 > CA3 > CA4; in the 90 s, CA1 > prosubiculum > CA2 > CA3 > CA4. In the brains of demented patients, the rank order for GVD was: for AD, CA1 > CA2 > CA3 > prosubiculum > CA4; for MID, CA1 > prosubiculum > CA2 > CA3 > CA4; for PD, CA1 > CA2 > CA3 > prosubiculum > CA4; and for atypical dementia (NANPDF), CA1 > CA2 > prosubiculum > CA3 > CA4. The similarity of the predilection to ranking order was noted both in normal aged subjects and in MID as well as both in AD and in PD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
