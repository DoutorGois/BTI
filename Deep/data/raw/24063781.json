     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: Flavonoids are present in foods such as fruits and vegetables. Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods and prevention of human disease, including neurodegenerative disorders. We assessed the effect of rutin (quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) on oxidative stress in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure. METHODS: Thirty-six BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups. In the control group, saline (intra-peritoneal, i.p.) was administered for 7 d, and on the last day, KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 30 min after administration of saline. In rutin groups, mice were pretreated with rutin (100 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.) for 7 d, and on the last day, KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 30 min after administration of rutin. Subsequently, behavioural changes were observed in mice. Lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress were measured respectively in the early and late phases after KA-induced seizures. RESULTS: Seizure scores in the rutin groups were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, rutin dose-dependently inhibited the number of wet-dog shakes (WDS) (P < 0.05). Malondialdehyde level in the hippocampus of the rutin groups was significantly lower than that in the hippocampus of the control group on days 1 and 21 after KA administration. In the rutin groups, the thiol levels observed on day 1 after KA administration were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that rutin has potential anticonvulsant and antioxidative activities against oxidative stress in KA-induced seizure in mice.",
