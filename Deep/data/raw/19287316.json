     "AB": "Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is the most common lesion in chronic, intractable temporal lobe epilepsies (TLE) and characterized by segmental neuronal cell loss in major hippocampal segments. Another histopathological hallmark includes granule cell dispersion (GCD), an architectural disturbance of the dentate gyrus encountered in approximately 50% of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis. Reelin, which plays a key role during hippocampal development and maintenance of laminar organization, is synthesized and released by Cajal-Retzius cells of the dentate molecular layer, and previous studies have shown that Reelin transcript levels are downregulated in human temporal lobe epilepsies specimens. To investigate whether epigenetic silencing by Reelin promoter methylation may be an underlying pathogenetic mechanism of GCD, DNA was harvested from 3 microdissected hippocampal subregions (i.e. molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus and presubiculum) from 8 MTS specimens with GCD, 5 TLE samples without GCD, and 3 autopsy controls. Promoter methylation was analyzed after bisulfite treatment, cloning, and direct sequencing; immunohistochemistry was performed to identify Cajal-Retzius cells. Reelin promoter methylation was found to be greater in TLE specimens than in controls; promoter methylation correlated with GCD among TLE specimens (p < 0.0002). No other clinical or histopathological parameter (i.e. sex, age, seizure duration, medication or extent, of MTS) correlated with promoter methylation. These data support a compromised Reelin-signaling pathway and identify promoter methylation as an epigenetic mechanism in the pathogenesis of TLE.",
