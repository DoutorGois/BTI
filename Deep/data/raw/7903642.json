     "AB": "Fluorocitrate inhibits the glial tricarboxylic acid cycle and thereby the synthesis of glutamine, which is the main precursor for transmitter glutamate. We investigated the possibility that there is a functional correlate to fluorocitrate action by recording evoked field potentials in rat hippocampal slices. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (field-EPSP) was markedly depressed after 7-8 h of fluorocitrate action. The population spike was also reduced, but a major part of the reduction may be the result of weaker synaptic activation rather than reduced excitability of the postsynaptic cells. The activity of thin unmyelinated fibres was only slightly affected. Preceding the changes in the field-EPSP there was a decrease in the glutamine content in the fluorocitrate treated slices relative to controls. Only a small decrease in tissue glutamate was seen concomitantly with the synaptic failure, probably because the transmitter pool of glutamate in those fibres stimulated makes little contribution to the total tissue glutamate.",
