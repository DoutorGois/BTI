     "AB": "Calcineurin (CaN) immunoreactivity and content increased markedly in kindled rat brain, and this increment was due to CaN in the membrane fraction. Investigation of the effects of cyclosporin A and FK506 (immunosuppressants which inhibit CaN activity in T lymphocytes) in the kindling phenomena showed that the kindling stage progression was reversibly blocked by these drugs. These findings suggest that calcineurin may play an essential role in acquiring epileptogenesis in kindling.",
