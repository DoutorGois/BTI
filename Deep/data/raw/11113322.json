     "AB": "Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is a chemokine with potent monocyte activating and chemotactic effects. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 gene and protein expression is rapidly up-regulated in response to a variety of acute and chronic central nervous system disorders. The activation and recruitment of microglia and monocytes into areas of inflammation may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute brain injury. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 could be a pathophysiologically important mediator of the microglial and monocyte responses in the brain. Using a well-characterized model of acute excitotoxic brain injury in neonatal rats, experiments were designed to evaluate whether monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 plays a role in the progression of tissue damage. Direct co-administration of recombinant monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 with the excitotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate exacerbated injury, both in the striatum and in the hippocampus, by 55% and 167%, respectively. Complementary experiments to determine the effect of functional inhibition of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, using an anti-monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-neutralizing antibody, revealed that co-administration of the antibody with N-methyl-D-aspartate attenuated tissue injury in the striatum and hippocampus by 57% and 39%, respectively.Together, these data suggest that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is a mediator of acute excitotoxic brain injury in neonatal rats and that inflammatory mechanisms contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of acute neonatal brain injury. Whether chemokines are pathophysiologically relevant mediators of neuronal injury in human neonates remains to be determined.",
