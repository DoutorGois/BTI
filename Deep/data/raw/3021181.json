     "AB": "The hippocampal formation undergoes major anatomical and physiological changes postnatally, and thus might be expected to be particularly sensitive to early handling effects. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal formation, a form of brain plasticity thought to be important in learning and memory, was examined in young rats following early handling or control treatments. The amplitude of LTP was reliably greater in rats receiving the early handling regime. Possible mechanisms and consequences of enhanced LTP were discussed.",
