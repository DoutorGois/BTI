     "AB": "The effects of dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNB) lesions on plasma corticosterone levels were determined in male albino rats. DNB lesions did not affect baseline plasma corticosterone levels. Furthermore, the increased corticosterone levels produced by various environmental manipulations did not differ between control and DNB lesioned groups. However, the lesioned group did exhibit longer latencies to eat familiar food in novel environments, as well as to eat novel foods in a familiar environment. Latencies to eat novel food in novel environments did not differ between the two groups and this was attributed to a \"ceiling\" effect. These endocrinological data fail to support the hypothesis that the enhanced \"neophobia\" observed in DNB lesioned rats is due to an increase in the intensity of the emotional reaction to novel stimuli. The data do not preclude the possibility, however, that the enhanced neophobic reactions reflect impaired habituation to these stimuli.",
