     "AB": "Cornichon2 (CNIH2), an integral component of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) complexes in the mammalian brain, slows deactivation and desensitization of heterologously reconstituted receptor channels. Its significance in neuronal signal transduction, however, has remained elusive. Here we show by paired recordings that CNIH2-containing AMPARs dictate the slow decay of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) elicited in hilar mossy cells of the hippocampus by single action potentials in mossy fiber boutons (MFB). Selective knockdown of CNIH2 markedly accelerated EPSCs in individual MFB-mossy cell synapses without altering the EPSC amplitude. In contrast, the rapidly decaying EPSCs in synapses between MFBs and aspiny interneurons that lack expression of CNIH2 were unaffected by the protein knockdown but were slowed by virus-directed expression of CNIH2. These results identify CNIH2 as the molecular distinction between slow and fast EPSC phenotypes and show that CNIH2 influences the time course and, hence, the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission.",
