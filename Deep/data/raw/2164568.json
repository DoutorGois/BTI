     "AB": "The CA1 pyramidal cells appear damaged in micrographs of guinea pig hippocampal slices incubated in normal physiological buffer at 36-37 degrees C. This is remedied if slices are incubated in modified buffers for the first 45 min. Cell morphology is improved if this buffer is devoid of added Ca2+ and much improved if it contains N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists or 0 mM Ca2+ and 10 mM Mg2+. The cells then appear similar to CA1 pyramidal cells in situ. These findings support the notion that NMDA receptor activation and Ca2+, acting in the period immediately after slice preparation, permanently damage CA1 pyramidal cells in vitro.",
