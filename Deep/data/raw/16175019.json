     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To correlate cognitive dysfunction with structural and neurometabolic brain findings in patients with non-neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (non-NPSLE). BACKGROUND: Over 25% of non-NPSLE patients have cognitive dysfunction, but the cerebral basis of this observation is not well understood. METHOD: Seven patients with non-NPSLE and seven control subjects were given a series of neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Analyses of cognitive function and structural and neurometabolic measures of the brain were performed. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the non-NPSLE patients were significantly impaired on a global cognitive impairment index (CII). No significant differences between the groups were found in choline/creatine (Ch/Cr), N-acetylaspartic acid/Cr, or hippocampal volumes. Ch/Cr was highly associated with CII across the sample. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to correlate cognitive impairment with an increase in Ch/Cr ratio among patients with SLE. These results, although preliminary, suggest that changes in cerebral white matter may be important in determining the subtle cognitive impairment that may occur in patients with SLE, even in the absence of neuropsychiatric symptoms.",
