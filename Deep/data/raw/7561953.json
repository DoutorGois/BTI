     "PG": "8-14",
     "AB": "Spreading depression, which can be evoked by a variety of stimuli both in vitro and in vivo, is associated with profound changes in extracellular ion concentrations and enhanced release of neurotransmitter amino acids. We have observed a transient spontaneous release of amino acids in slice preparations obtained from rat cerebellum, striatum and hippocampus; this phenomenon has similar properties to stimulus-evoked spreading depression. Aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, serine, glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release were potentiated during these episodes in all three brain regions, with a variable effect upon taurine release. When compared to glutamate release, a consistently high release of aspartate, glycine and serine was observed. Amino acid release, evoked by whole slice depolarization using veratridine (10-25 microM) or elevated potassium (35-60 mM) consistently enhanced glutamate release, and to a lesser extent aspartate release, but had negligible effect upon the other amino acids. Thus, the release profiles for spontaneous and depolarization-evoked release are markedly different. We suggest that the spontaneous release observed in brain slices represents a spreading depression-like phenomenon; the putative roles of the amino acids are discussed.",
