     "AB": "Members of the phospholipase D (PLD) superfamily are defined by the conserved HXKXXXXD motif, which is essential for the catalytic function of mammalian PLD. PLD enzymes are thought to play roles in signal transduction and membrane vesicular trafficking in mammalian cells. Here we describe a 54-kDa novel murine polypeptide (designated SAM-9) that is predicted to be a membrane-associated member of the PLD superfamily. SAM-9 shares 40, 30, and 29% amino acid identity with potential orthologs, in vaccinia virus, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Dictyostelium discoideum, respectively, and belongs to a subclass of PLD homologs in which the second HXKXXXXD motif is imperfect and harbors a conserved Asp to Glu substitution. The sam-9 gene has more than eight exons, and the two HXKXXXXD motifs are encoded by two highly conserved exons. The expression of the sam-9 gene is greater in the brain than in non-nervous tissue and appears to be predominantly of neuronal origin. sam-9 expression is pronounced in mature neurons of the forebrain and appears to be turned on at late stages of neurogenesis as revealed by in situ hybridization analysis of sam-9 expression during postnatal development of the hippocampal formation and the primary somatosensory cortex.",
