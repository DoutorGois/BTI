     "AB": "We have been examining the role of protein synthesis in the development and maintenance of spontaneous bursting in the rat hippocampal slice. We used stimulus train induced bursting (STIB) as an in vitro model for epileptogenesis, to study the effects of 3 different protein synthesis inhibitors (cycloheximide, anisomycin, puromycin) on the development of bursting. We report here that none of these inhibitors blocked the induction of bursting, suggesting that protein synthesis is not essential for the development of electrically induced bursting. However, when established spontaneous bursting was examined in the presence of cycloheximide, the duration of the bursting phase was markedly reduced, suggesting that the maintenance of spontaneous bursting in the early hours requires ongoing protein synthesis.",
