     "AB": "Unit activity of the dorsal hippocampus was recorded in partially restrained but awake and undrugged rats during a \"conditioning to time\". In this type of conditioning, only one stimulus, the equivalent of the unconditioned stimulus of the usual procedures, is used. It is delivered at a constant interval which, in principle, is the conditioned stimulus. In our experiments, the unconditioned stimulus was a mechanical stimulation of a vibrissa; two successive unconditioned stimuli were separated by a 24-s interval. In 11/18 rats, anticipatory movements of a \"trained\" vibrissa developed at the end of the interstimulus interval. In a number of cases, in parallel to this conditioned behavior, there was a significant change in unit activity, either an increase or a decrease, during the last third of the interstimulus interval. Controls showed that these changes in unit activity did not merely reflect modifications of arousal state or of vibrissa and body movements. From autocorrelograms, it appeared that anticipatory increases in unit activity were associated with the development of a bursting mode of discharge. These data constitute one of the rare examples of a neurophysiological correlate of a \"conditioning to time\" at the unit level and the first recorded from the dorsal hippocampus of rats.",
