     "AB": "The hippocampal EEG recording electrodes were implanted bilaterally in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) and the stratum radiatum layer of the CA1 area in young (2-3-month-old) and aged (17-20-month-old) rats. In the subgroups of rats, brain noradrenaline (NA) was depleted by DSP-4 neurotoxin (50 mg/kg, IP). The aged animals were included in DSP-4-lesioned group in order to diminish the plastic regeneration of the noradrenergic system which may be more effective in young subjects. All the EEG recordings, after the administration of different agents or vehicle, were made while rats were awake and immobile. Approximately 40% decrease of brain NA had no noticeable effects on the nonrhythmical hippocampal EEG in either age group. In all the rats, compared to the baseline recordings, scopolamine hydrobromide (2 mg/kg, IP, a muscarinic antagonist) increased the incidence of spontaneous EEG spikes, while tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA, 12.5 mg/kg, IP, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor) decreased the spike activity and induced theta rhythm. Atipamezole (3 mg/kg, SC), a noradrenergic alpha 2-antagonist, increased the baseline amplitude of the nonrhythmical EEG in the DG and increased slightly the spike activity in the CA1 area. The combined blockade of muscarinic receptors by scopolamine (2 mg/kg) and noradrenergic alpha 2-receptors by atipamezole (3 mg/kg) resulted in irregular EEG pattern and corresponding power spectra differed from the scopolamine spectra. The last combination treatment suggests that the effect of atipamezole was not mediated by the secondary cholinergic activation. In the DG, the spectral power increase caused by atipamezole may be related to the increased excitability/bursting liability of granular cells because NA turnover is increased by this agent and NA increases the excitability of granular cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
