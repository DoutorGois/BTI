     "AB": "Calbindin-D28K is a constitutive Ca2(+)-binding protein expressed in hippocampal neurons that are resistant to various forms of excitotoxic injury. However, the local factors controlling calbindin-D28K expression within the central nervous system are unknown. We report that neuronal excitation via the perforant path leads to an increased expression of calbindin-D28K mRNA within dentate granule cells. This response is related specifically to stimulation that induces prolonged periods of bursting afterdischarges and precedes cellular injury. The up regulation of calbindin-D28K mRNA occurs during the type of neuronal activation associated with elevated cytosolic Ca2+ and suggests that the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis includes a system of feedback control at the level of gene expression.",
