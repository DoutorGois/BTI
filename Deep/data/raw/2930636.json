     "AB": "As a first step towards a multivariate quantitative-genetic analysis of covariations between heritable variation in hippocampal structure and mouse behavior, a univariate analysis of the genetic architecture of behavioral responses to novelty is presented. For several components of exploratory behavior considerable amounts of genetic variation were found and an evolutionary history of stabilizing selection for intermediate levels of exploration was inferred. Comparison of these results with those from a previous study indicated that even a relatively small diallel cross, involving 4-5 inbred strains, may provide useful genetic information on a specific sample of animals. Larger numbers of strains are needed to provide precise estimates of genetic parameters in a population.",
