     "AB": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is an integral component of cellular signaling during mitogenesis and differentiation of mitotic cells. Recently MAPK activation in post-mitotic cells has been implicated in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a potential cellular mechanism of learning and memory. Here we investigate the involvement of MAPK in learning and memory in behaving animals. MAPK activation increased in the rat hippocampus after an associative learning task, contextual fear conditioning. Two other protein kinases known to be activated during hippocampal LTP, protein kinase C and alpha-calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II, also were activated in the hippocampus after learning. Inhibition of the specific upstream activator of MAPK, MAPK kinase (MEK), blocked fear conditioning. Thus, classical conditioning in mammals activates MAPK, which is necessary for consolidation of the resultant learning.",
