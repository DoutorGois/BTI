     "AB": "Monoclonal antibody probes were used to identify antigenic cross reactivities among neuronal subpopulations and to dissect the human nervous system at several levels of organization. Six monoclonal antibodies, prepared with immunogens from Drosophila melanogaster or human nervous tissue, were used to localize antigens immunocytochemically in normal adult human neocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord, and retina. Four of the six antibodies were neural specific in their reactivity and each stained a unique combination of neurons. The antibodies reacted with at least three subpopulations of cerebral cortical neurons, including discrete populations of pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells. Components of a widely distributed functional system within the spinal cord and cerebellum were labelled by one antibody, which reacted with neurons in the nucleus dorsalis of Clarke, deep cerebellar nuclei, and Purkinje cells. At the single-cell level, three of the monoclonals differentially labelled the photoreceptor cell outer segment, inner segment, and perikaryon. Three of the six antibodies were reactive with specific protein bands on immunoblots of tissue homogenates. This monoclonal antibody panel provides a novel and potentially useful method of analysis of the organization of the normal and diseased human nervous system.",
