     "AB": "Previous studies have shown in the rat that long-term diazepam treatment induces a desensitization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptors which modulate serotonergic (5-HT) neuron firing activity in the dorsal raphe. We have examined the effect of a 21-day treatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) on the benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) which modulate the efficacy of the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway in suppressing the firing activity of rat dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons. The efficacy of the stimulation was not modified 24 h after the last dose of diazepam. Moreover, the potentiating effect of acute diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.v.) on the efficacy of the stimulation was similar in diazepam- and vehicle-treated rats. These results indicate that GABA-benzodiazepine receptors that modulate the release of 5-HT in the rat dorsal hippocampus are not desensitized by long-term diazepam treatment.",
