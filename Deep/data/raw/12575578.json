     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of Huadai Xingshen Decoction (HDXSD) in treating vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: Rat model of VD was established by repeated ischemia/reperfusion and treated with HDXSD. Hydergine was taken for positive control. The content of somatostatin (SS), arginine vasopressin (AVP) and SS mRNA expression model rat's cortex and hippocampus were observed. RESULTS: The SS and AVP contents of cortex and hippocampus in model rats were decreased significantly, and the SSmRNA expression in cortex of frontal lobe reduced, too. HDXSD showed an up-regulation on the above-mentioned parameters, and the effect on SS cortex and SS mRNA expression was higher than that of hydergine. CONCLUSION: HDXSD improves intellectual impairment of VD rats by increasing the synthetic ability of SSmRNA and content of AVP, which in turn improve the neurotrophic effect and promote the restoring function of injured neuron.",
