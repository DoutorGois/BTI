     "AB": "The localization of the receptor for apamin, a specific toxin for one class of sensitive Ca2+-dependent K+ channel, was studied in rat brain using an in vitro autoradiographic technique. Radiolabeled monoiodoapamin binds specifically to rat brain sections with a high affinity (Kd = 25 pM) to a single class of sites. Autoradiograms demonstrated a very heterogeneous distribution of the apamin receptor throughout the brain. Very high grain densities were localized on the habenula, lateral septum, supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Areas containing high levels of apamin binding sites included anterior olfactory nucleus, stratum oriens of hippocampus, pontine nuclei and granular layer of the cerebellar cortex and inferior olive. The thalamus, some nuclei of hypothalamus, hippocampus, tegmental area, red and oculomotor nuclei, vestibular nuclei and superior olive, among others, presented intermediate grain densities. In the other main areas, in particular basal ganglia, raphe, low to very low levels of apamin binding sites have been observed.",
