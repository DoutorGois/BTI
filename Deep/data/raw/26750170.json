     "AB": "A potentially vital pathway in the processing of spatial memory is the pathway from ventral hippocampus to medial prefrontal cortex (vHPC-mPFC). To assess long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and maintenance across days in this pathway, the effects of several induction paradigms were compared in awake, freely moving rats. Two different high-frequency stimulation (HFS) protocols generated LTP lasting no longer than 1 week. However, after delivering HFS on three consecutive days, LTP lasted an average of 20 days, due mainly to the greater initial induction. Thus the pathway does not require extensive multi-day stimulation to induce LTP, as for other intra-neocortical pathways, but also it does not exhibit the extremely long-lasting and stable LTP previously observed in area CA1 and the dentate gyrus. By using bilaterally placed stimulating and recording electrodes, we found that HFS in one vHPC generated responses and LTP in the contralateral mPFC, even when the ipsilateral mPFC was inactivated by CNQX. We attribute this crossed response to a polysynaptic pathway from the vHPC to the contralateral mPFC. Finally, we found that repeated overnight exposure to an enriched environment also potentiated the vHPC-mPFC response, but this too was a transient effect lasting < 9 days, declining to baseline even before the enriched environment treatment was completed. Overall, these findings are consistent with the view that potentiation of vHPC-mPFC pathway may play a key role in promoting the hippocampus-mPFC interplay that, over days, leads to long-term storage in the frontal cortex of memories that are independent of the hippocampus.",
