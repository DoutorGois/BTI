     "AB": "The action of diadenosine polyphosphates on Ca2+ channels was studied in two preparations: isolated hippocampal neurons and synaptosomes, both from the rat brain. High-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels were recorded in freshly isolated CA3 neurons using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Current-voltage relationships were measured in the control and after incubation in 5 microM diadenosine pentaphosphate. In the majority of tested pyramidal neurons, the latter procedure led to a reversible increase in the high-voltage-activated current through Ca2+ channels when measured at the holding potential of -100 mV but not at -40 mV. In experiments on synaptosomes from the whole brain, diadenosine pentaphosphate taken at a concentration of 100 microM increased the intrasynaptosomal calcium level measured by means of spectrofluorimetry for 26 +/- 1.8 nM (by 24 +/- 2%). Nifedipine failed to block this effect both in synaptosomes and hippocampal neurons. Potentiation of the current through Ca2+ channels in hippocampal neurons as well as the increase in intrasynaptosomal Ca2+ were irreversibly blocked by 5 microM omega-conotoxin, but not by 200 nM omega-Agatoxin-IVA. These data indicate that diadenosine polyphosphates enhance the activity of N-type Ca2+ channels in many central neurons of the rat brain.",
