     "AB": "Blood flow, determined by the radioactive microsphere technique during epileptiform seizures induced by [D-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalyl-Thr (DSLET), a specific delta-opioid receptor agonist, was examined in different areas of the brain of the rat at various time intervals. An increase in blood flow to the hippocampus and brain stem was observed 2.5 min after administration of DSLET into the left lateral ventricle. An additional increase in flow occurred in the striatum and cerebellum 2.5 min later (5 min after the injection), at which time both the neural and vascular effects of the drug were most marked. Ten minutes after the administration of the drug, cerebral blood flow in all regions except the hippocampus, returned to the respective baseline values. Since the time-course and the magnitude of functional activity and blood flow in the hippocampus showed a good correlation, it is suggested that this region of the brain may play an essential role in triggering and maintaining the seizure phenomena induced by enkephalin.",
