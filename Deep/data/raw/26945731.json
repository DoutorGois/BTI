     "AB": "Although numerous studies have reported the influence of extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) exposure on human health, its effects on cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have remained under debate. Moreover, the influence of ELF-MF on hyperphosphorylated tau, which is one of the most common pathological hallmarks of AD, has not been reported to date. Therefore, transgenic mice (3xTg) were used in the present study. 3xTg mice, which express an APP/PS1 mutation combined with a tau (P301L) mutation and that develop cognitive deficits at 6 months of age, were subjected to ELF-MF (50Hz, 500muT) exposure or sham exposure daily for 3 months. We discovered that ELF-MF exposure ameliorated cognitive deficits and increased synaptic proteins in 3xTg mice. The protective effects of ELF-MF exposure may have also been caused by the inhibition of apoptosis and/or decreased oxidative stress levels that were observed in the hippocampus tissues of treated mice. Furthermore, tau hyperphosphorylation was decreased in vivo because of ELF-MF exposure, and this decrease was induced by the inhibition of GSK3beta and CDK5 activities and activation of PP2Ac. We are the first to report that exposure to ELF-MF can attenuate tau phosphorylation. These findings suggest that ELF-MF exposure could act as a valid therapeutic strategy for ameliorating cognitive deficits and attenuating tau hyperphosphorylation in AD.",
