     "AB": "Restricted and regulated expression in mice of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal CA1 neurons lowers the threshold for eliciting a persistent late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This L-LTP has unusual properties in that its induction is not dependent on transcription. Pharmacological and two-pathway experiments suggest a model in which VP16-CREB activates the transcription of CRE-driven genes and leads to a cell-wide distribution of proteins that prime the synapses for subsequent synapse-specific capture of L-LTP by a weak stimulus. Our analysis indicates that synaptic capture of CRE-driven gene products may be sufficient for consolidation of LTP and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic tagging and synapse-specific potentiation.",
