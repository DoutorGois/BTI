     "AB": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is an activity-dependent strengthening of synaptic efficacy that is considered to be a model of learning and memory. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary to induce LTP. Here, induction of LTP in CA1 pyramidal cells of rats was prevented by blocking the tyrosine kinase Src, and Src activity was increased by stimulation producing LTP. Directly activating Src in the postsynaptic neuron enhanced excitatory synaptic responses, occluding LTP. Src-induced enhancement of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated synaptic responses required raised intracellular Ca2+ and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Thus, Src activation is necessary and sufficient for inducing LTP and may function by up-regulating NMDA receptors.",
