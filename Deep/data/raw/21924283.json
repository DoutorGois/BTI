     "AB": "Previous studies showed the role of basolateral amygdala (BLA) in cannabinoid-induced antinociception. Several lines of evidence indicated that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) receives excitatory glutamatergic inputs primarily from limbic-related structures, including the hippocampus, BLA, and various thalamic nuclei. Additionally, it has been shown that the NAc plays an important role in mediating the suppression of animal models of pain. In the present study, we examined the role of NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors within the NAc in antinociception induced by intra-BLA cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 in rats. 126 adult male albino Wistar rats weighing 230-280 g were unilaterally implanted by two separate cannulae into the BLA and NAc. Dose-response antinociceptive effects of different doses of intra-BLA WIN55,212-2 (5, 10 and 15 mug/0.3 mul/rat) were evaluated in this study. Moreover, animals received intra-accumbal infusions of either NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5 (0.5, 2.5 and 5 mug/0.5 mul saline) or AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, CNQX (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 mug/0.5 mul DMSO), just 2 min before microinjection of WIN55,212-2 into the BLA. Antinociceptive responses of drugs were obtained by tail-flick analgesiometer and represented as maximal possible effect (%MPE) at 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min after their administrations. Results showed that intra-accumbal AP5 dose-dependently prevented antinociception induced by intra-BLA administration of WIN55,212-2 (15 mug/rat) in time set intervals. Nonetheless, administration of AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, CNQX, could not affect WIN-induced analgesia. Additionally, solely administration of intra-accumbal injection of CNQX (2.5 mug/0.5 mul DMSO), but not AP5 (5 mug/0.5 mul saline), could significantly change the baseline tail-flick latencies in the rats. It seems that NMDA receptors located in the NAc, in part, mediate the antinociceptive responses of cannabinoid within the BLA in acute model of pain.",
