     "AB": "Temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) involves seizures that typically originate in the hippocampus. There is evidence that seizures involve anatomically and functionally connected brain networks within and beyond the temporal lobe. Many studies have explored the effect of TLE on gray matter and resting-state functional connectivity in the brain. However, the relationship between structural and functional changes has not been fully explored. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between gray matter concentration (GMC) and functional connectivity in TLE at the voxel level. A voxel-wise linear regression analysis was performed between GMC maps and whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity maps to both the left thalamus (Lthal) and the left hippocampus (LH) in a group of 15 patients with left TLE. Twenty regions were found that exhibited GMC decreases linearly correlated with resting-state functional connectivity to either the LH or the Lthal in the patient group only. A subset of these regions had significantly reduced GMC, and one of these regions also had reduced functional connectivity to the LH in TLE compared to the controls. These results suggest a network of impairment in left TLE where more severe reductions in GMC accompany decreases (LH, Lthal, right midcingulate gyrus, left precuneus, and left postcentral gyrus) or increases (LH to right thalamus) in resting functional connectivity. However, direct relationships between these imaging parameters and disease characteristics in these regions have yet to be established.",
