     "AB": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with dementia were found to have ubiquitin-immunoreactive (IR) inclusions in the dentate granule cells of the hippocampus. These inclusions were also present in some patients with minor cognitive changes but otherwise typical ALS. Ubiquitin-IR inclusions were also found in neurons of superficial layers of the frontal and temporal cortex and in the entorhinal cortex in patients with ALS and dementia. These ubiquitin-IR inclusions were non-argyrophilic, and were not labelled by antibodies which identify Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles and Pick bodies, nor were they typical of cortical Lewy bodies. Our findings indicate that ubiquitin-IR inclusions in small neurons of the hippocampus, entorhinal area and neocortex are a characteristic feature of degeneration of non-motor cortex in ALS, and are particularly associated with cognitive impairment and dementia of frontal lobe type.",
