     "AB": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors were measured in discrete areas of brain and in anterior pituitary of 4-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old male Fischer rats. No significant age-related alterations in [125I]ovine CRF binding were observed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum; there was a trend for CRF binding to decrease in the striatum as a consequence of aging. Significant age-related decreases were observed in 125I-ovine CRF binding in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus with maximal reductions of 60 and 27%, respectively. Saturation analysis in the anterior pituitary indicated an age-related reduction in the density of CRF receptors (i.e. Bmax) without an alteration in the affinity (i.e. Kd) of CRF for its binding site. Northern analysis of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA in the anterior pituitary indicated no significant differences in the levels of POMC mRNA between 4- and 24-month-old rats. These and other data suggest that the age-related decrease in anterior pituitary CRF receptors may be due to hypersecretion of hypothalamic CRF rather than a loss of corticotropes in the anterior pituitary.",
