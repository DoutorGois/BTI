     "AB": "The effect of 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (AP-3), a metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist on behavioral and histological changes following global ischaemia was investigated on the Mongolian gerbil. Ischaemia was induced by bilateral carotid occlusion for 5 min. AP-3 was administered i.p. (25 or 250 mg/kg) 30 min before and 24 h after surgery. Significant neuroprotection was observed 96 h after surgery to cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in drug treated animals. AP-3 (250 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increase in locomotor activity measured 72 h after surgery. These results suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors play a role in the neurodegeneration seen following ischaemia.",
