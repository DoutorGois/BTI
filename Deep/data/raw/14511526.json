     "AB": "Recent experimental evidence on spike-timing-dependent plasticity and on phase precession (i.e., the theta rhythm dependent firing of rat hippocampal cells) associates the contribution of phase precession to episodic memory. This article aims at clarifying the role of phase precession in memory storage. Computer simulations show that the memory storage in the behavioral timescale varies in timescale of the temporal sequence from half a second to several seconds. In contrast, the memory storage caused by traditional rate coding is restricted to the temporal sequence within 40 ms. During phase precession, memory storage of a single trial experience is possible, even in the presence of noise. It is therefore concluded that encoding by phase precession is appropriate for memory storage of the temporal sequence in the behavioral timescale.",
