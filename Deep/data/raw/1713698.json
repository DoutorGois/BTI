     "AB": "1. This study examines the effect of subchronic parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) treatment upon serotonin (5-HT)-stimulated inositol monophosphate (IP-1) accumulation in rat hippocampal slices and also the effect of antidepressants upon this 5-HT response in the hippocampus from rats treated with or without concurrent administration of PCPA. 2. For high dose PCPA treatment, animals were injected intraperitoneally with 300 mg/kg daily for the first 5 days and then 100 mg/kg for 5 days, while for low dose PCPA treatment animals were injected for 10 days at a dose of 100 mg/kg. Imipramine or iprindole (15 mg/kg i.p.) was given once daily for 10 consecutive days. 3. 10-Day treatment with high dose of PCPA resulted in a significant increase in 5-HT-stimulated IP-1 accumulation, whereas low dose of PCPA had no significant effect upon the 5-HT response as compared to vehicle. 5-HT-stimulated IP-1 accumulation in rat hippocampus was not affected by subchronic treatment with imipramine or iprindole. The enhancement of the 5-HT response induced by high dose of PCPA was not attenuated by repeated antidepressants treatment.",
