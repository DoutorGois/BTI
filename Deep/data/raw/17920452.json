     "AB": "Movement of glutamate receptors in neurons likely involves direct and indirect association of receptor subunits with microtubule- and actin-based motor proteins. We have previously shown that myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC) binds directly to subunits of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NR), suggesting that NMDA receptors are closely associated with a myosin II motor complex. Using a polyclonal antibody predicted to recognize all RLC isoforms previously described in rodent brain, we report the expression of RLC and the NR1 subunit in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of postnatal day 0 (P0) and adult mouse. Although myosin RLC was not exclusively localized with NR1 by immunohistochemistry, co-staining was striking in the neuronal soma of deep cortical neurons and Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum which showed a punctate, perinuclear pattern of immunoreactivity. These neuronal populations were identified using a monoclonal antibody directed against a nuclear-specific, transcriptional repressor, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF)-interacting protein 2 (CTIP2). Co-expression of NR1 and a myosin II motor was validated using an isoform specific anti-nonmuscle myosin II-B heavy chain (NMHC II-B) antibody. Our findings support the idea that there is regional heterogeneity in the molecular composition of the NMDA receptor-associated cytoskeleton, and suggest that NR subunits may be associated with an actin-based, myosin II-B motor within the endomembrane system of some neuronal populations. Differential staining patterns observed with light and heavy chain antibodies, however, suggest that there is also heterogeneity in the composition of myosin II complexes in brain.",
