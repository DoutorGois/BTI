     "AB": "Ten mumoles of intraventricularly injected D-galactosamine (GalN) inhibited the incorporation of [(3)H]-guanosine and [(3)H]-leucine into RNA and protein of the rat hippocampus, respectively. The inhibition of guanosine incorporation of appr. 80% occurred during the first 30 min after GalN treatment and lasted at least 4 h. The incorporation of leucine was inhibited by appr. 30% only; this effect occurred not earlier than 90 min after GalN injection. The results demonstrate a similar effect of GalN on brain macromolecular syntheses as already observed in the liver suggesting the same mechanism of action, namely trapping of uridine phosphates. The results are discussed with regard to the amnesic effect of GalN observed on the retention of a brightness discrimination in rats.",
