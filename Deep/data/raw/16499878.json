     "AB": "BACKGROUND: Major depression is often associated with disturbances in basal biological functions regulated by the hypothalamus. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an efficient anti-depressant treatment, alters the activity of hypothalamic neurons. We have previously shown an increased proliferation of endothelial cells in specific areas of the rat hippocampus in response to electroconvulsive seizure (ECS) treatment, an animal model for ECT. Here we examine the effect of ECS treatment on neuronal activation and endothelial cell proliferation in mid-hypothalamus. METHODS: Rats received one daily ECS treatment for 5 days and cell proliferation was detected by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). The number of cells double-labeled for BrdU and the endothelial cell marker rat endothelial cell antigen-1 was determined. Neuronal activation in response to acute ECS treatment was detected as c-Fos immunoreactivity in an additional experiment. RESULTS: We demonstrate a correlating pattern of increases in neuronal activation and increased endothelial cell proliferation in the paraventricular nucleus, the supraoptic nucleus, and the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus after ECS treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothalamic areas with the largest increase in neuronal activation after ECS treatment exhibit increased endothelial cell proliferation. We suggest that similar angiogenic responses to ECT might counteract hypothalamic dysfunction in depressive disorder.",
