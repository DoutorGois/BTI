     "AB": "The regional concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid were measured in mouse brain following administration of the dihydropyridine calcium channel activator BAY K 8644, and antagonist, nifedipine. BAY K 8644 (1-8 mg/kg) produced dose- and time-dependent increases in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in the caudate, without altering dopamine and serotonin levels. No changes in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration were observed in the raphe nuclei, hypothalamus, hippocampus and frontal cortex. Nifedipine (4 mg/kg) blocked BAY K 8644- (2 mg/kg) elicited increases in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the caudate. Furthermore, a higher dose of nifedipine (8 mg/kg) decreased dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, but did not affect dopamine, serotonin or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations, while a lower dose of nifedipine (2 mg/kg) significantly increased serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and homovanillic acid, but did not affect dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations. The findings that both BAY K 8644 and nifedipine affect neurotransmitter metabolism in vivo in a dose-, time- and brain region-dependent manner, suggest that high-affinity dihydropyridine calcium channel binding sites play an important role in regulating neurotransmitter turnover in the central nervous system.",
