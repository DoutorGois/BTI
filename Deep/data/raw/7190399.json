     "AB": "Effects of 3-sulfamoylmethyl-1,2-benzisoxazole (AD-180) were examined electroencephalographically (EEG) on seizure activities induced by several means in rats and cats. AD-810 depressed the cortical focal seizure induced by electrical stimulation of the visual cortex at doses ineffective against the thalamic and hippocampal after-discharges in cats. AD-810 suppressed both interictal spikes and secondary generalized seizures (SGS), induced by cortical application of tungstic acid gel, in intact and decerebrated rats. Suppression of the spikes and SGS by AD-810 was also observed in cats with the epileptogenic foci produced by cortical freezing. Neither spontaneous EEG pattern nor EEG arousal response was modified with AD-810. It is suggested that AD-810 supresses the epileptogenic focus activity in the cortex and blocks the seizure propagation from the cortex to the subcortical structures through the effects on the cortex.",
