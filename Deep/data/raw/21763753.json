     "AB": "Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) play important roles in maintaining the excitability of hippocampal neurons. The present study investigated the effects of resibufogenin (RBG, a main component of bufadienolides) on voltage-gated sodium channel currents (I(Na)) in rat hippocampal neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recording. According to the results, RBG activated I(Na) in a concentration-dependent manner. RBG at 1 muM concentration could alter some channel kinetics of I(Na), such as activation thresholds, steady-state activation and inactivation curves, time constant of recovery, and activity-dependent attenuation of I(Na). RBG influenced peak amplitude, overshoot and half-width of the evoked single action potential, and simultaneously lessened the firing rate of evoked repetitive firing. These findings suggested that I(Na) is probably a target of RBG, which may explain the mechanisms for the pathological effects of RBG on central nervous system.",
