     "AB": "OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the effects of rapamycin on Abeta1-42-induced deficits in working memory and synaptic plasticity. METHODS: After bilateral hippocampal injection of Abeta1-42 and rapamycinin rats, spontaneous alternation in Y-maze and in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of rats were recorded. All data were analized by two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: (Hippocampal injection of Abeta1-42 alone impaired working memory of rats; (2) Rapamycin did not affect working memory of rats, but alleviated Abeta1-42-induced working memory deficits, compared with Abeta1-42 alone group; (Abeta1-42 remarkably suppressed in vivo hippocampal LTP of fEPSPs in the CA1 region; (4) Pretreatment with rapamycin prevented Abeta1-42-induced suppression of LTP. CONCLUSION: These data indicates that rapamycin could protect against Abeta1-42-induced impairments in working memory and synaptic plasticity in rats.",
