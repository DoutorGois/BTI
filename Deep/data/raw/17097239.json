     "AB": "Environmental enrichment promotes structural and behavioral plasticity in the adult brain. We have evaluated the efficacy of enriched environment on the dendritic morphology and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus of ventral subicular-lesioned rats. Bilateral ventral subicular lesion has significantly reduced the dendritic architecture and spine density of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The lesioned rats exposed to enriched housing for 10 days showed a significant degree of morphological plasticity in terms of enhanced dendritic branching and spine density. However, the BDNF expression in the hippocampus remained unchanged following subicular lesion and following environmental enrichment. We suggest the participation of other neurotrophic factors in mediating the synaptic plasticity events following exposure to environmental enrichment in ventral subicular-lesioned rats.",
