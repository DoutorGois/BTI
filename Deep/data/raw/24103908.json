     "AB": "Schizophrenia is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder with a multifactorial pathogenesis where autoimmune factors may play a significant role. The aim of this study was to verify the presence of anti-brain autoantibodies in the serum of schizophrenic patients compared to healthy controls. Autoantibodies against brain were detected by the immunofluorescence method, utilizing sections of rat hippocampus and hypothalamus and of monkey cerebellum. Three different fluorescence patterns were observed, staining the nucleus-cytoplasm of neurons, the neuroendothelial of blood vessel and the neurofilaments. Search for other organ-specific and non organ-specific autoantibodies was performed in all sera by indirect immunofluorescence method, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and chemiluminescence immunoassay. Results showed a significant association between schizophrenia and anti-brain autoantibodies against the neuroendothelium of blood vessel in hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum; a significant nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of neurons was assessed only for the hippocampus. No other significant association was found, except between schizophrenia and anti-nuclear autoantibodies on HEp-2 cells. In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis of a significant association between schizophrenia and circulating anti-brain autoantibodies, suggesting a diffuse reactivity against the neuroendothelium of blood vessel and highlighting a nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of the neurons of hippocampus.",
