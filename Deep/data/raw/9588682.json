     "AB": "Subcortical damage at birth often produces more severe deficits than similar lesions in an adult. In the present study, effects of unilateral electrolytic hippocampal ablations made on postnatal day 1 or in 3-month-old adult rats, were compared. Exploratory behavior and spatial navigation in the Morris water maze (MWM) were assessed 8 and 20 weeks after hippocampal damage. Rats with neonatal damage did not respond to novelty in the environment and did not learn to find the hidden platform in the MWM. Rats lesioned as adults did learn the water maze task, but slower than controls. We hypothesized that behavioral deficits observed in rats lesioned at birth, may be due, in part, to neurochemical dysfunction of the contralateral hippocampus. Specifically, cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmission were assessed by measuring choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) and GABAdecarboxylase (GAD) activity. In addition, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels were assayed in the remaining (contralateral) hippocampus. Of these molecules, only BDNF gene expression was significantly reduced (by 30%) at 8 and 20 weeks after neonatal and adult unilateral ablation. The similar reduction in BDNF mRNA in both treatment groups does not correspond with the lesion's differential effect on memory function. However, the more severe learning impairment after neonatal lesion may reflect increased dependence on trophins during development.",
