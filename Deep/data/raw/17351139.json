     "AB": "Recently it was shown that holeboard training can reinforce, i.e., transform early-LTP into late-LTP in the dentate gyrus during the initial formation of a long-term spatial reference memory in rats. The consolidation of LTP as well as of the reference memory was dependent on protein synthesis. We have now investigated the transmitter systems involved in this reinforcement and found that LTP-consolidation and memory retrieval were dependent on beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation, whereas glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) were not involved. Blockade of the beta-adrenergic signaling pathway significantly increased the number of reference memory errors compared with MR and dopamine receptor inhibition. In addition, beta-adrenergic blockade impaired the working memory. Therefore, we suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor activation is the main signaling system required for the retrieval of spatial memory. In addition, other modulatory interactions such as dopaminergic as well as MR systems are involved. This result points to specific roles of different modulatory systems during the retrieval of specific components of spatial memory. The data provide evidence for similar integrative interactions between different signaling systems during cellular memory processes.",
