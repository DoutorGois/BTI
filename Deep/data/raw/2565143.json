     "AB": "The specific binding of L-[3H]glutamate to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in brain regions of kindled rats was visualized autoradiographically and quantitated. When assayed 28 days after the last evoked seizure, NMDA receptor binding had declined by 7-11% in stratum radiatum of the dorsal hippocampal area CA1, in both deep and superficial layers of the motor cortex and in layers I-IV of the somatosensory cortex. No significant changes were detected in any other brain region nor in any region examined 1 day after the last evoked seizure. These findings suggest that the enhanced activation of NMDA receptors in kindled rats cannot be explained by an increased expression of these receptors. Rather, kindling leads to a regionally-selective down regulation of NMDA receptor binding.",
