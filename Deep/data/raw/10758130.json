     "AB": "Unilateral intrahippocampal injection of tetanus toxin results in a chronic syndrome of intermittent epileptic seizures. During some of these seizures, rats develop a stereotypic, pathological motor behavior that indicates secondary generalization of epileptic activity. We report that secondary generalization was preceded by a 9-16 Hz oscillation of field potentials which was synchronized between the right and left dorsal hippocampi. The oscillation was associated with increased synchrony of population spike firing in right and left CA1 subregions which form the major output of the hippocampi. Cutting the ventral commissure abolished synchrony across the hippocampi and reduced the probability that the 9-16 Hz activity would be followed by secondary generalization. We concluded that a bilaterally synchronous 9-16 Hz hippocampal oscillation played a role in the secondary generalization of focal seizures in this chronic model of limbic epilepsy.",
