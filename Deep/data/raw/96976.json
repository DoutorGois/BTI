     "AB": "A good correlation exists between the learning capacity and norepinephrine metabolism in the neocortex of C57 and Balb inbred Mice strains, as well as their F1 hybrids and seven recombinant inbred strains derived from their cross. The animals with a better learning performance are characterised by low levels of norepinephrine, as well as a slow metabolic rate of this neurotransmitter in the cortex. Such a correlation has not been found to exist in the other cerebral regions studied.",
