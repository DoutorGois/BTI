     "AB": "The change of extracellular insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) level following electrolytical lesion in rat hippocampus was studied by intracerebral microdialysis technique. The microdialysis probes were inserted into the lesioned and normal side of hippocampus on the day and each week after making the lesion for a period of four weeks. The content of IGF-I in the dialysis perfusate was measured by a radioimmunoassay. One week after surgery, IGF-I level (mean +/- S.E.M.) increased from 235.6 +/- 25.4 pg/100 microliters perfusate (day 0) to 305.5 +/- 15.6 pg/100 microliters perfusate (day 7), and then decreased gradually. This suggests that there is accumulation or increase in secretion of IGF-I at the lesioned site, and that IGF-I might have an important role in vivo in the brain tissue recovery from damage.",
