     "AB": "Transient global amnesia (TGA) is characterized by the abrupt onset of severe amnesia without concomitant focal neurological symptoms. Recent studies revealed that small and punctate MR-signal diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesions can be found within the hippocampus of TGA patients during the post-acute phase. On the basis of dual-process models of recognition memory, the present study examined the hypothesis that hippocampal dysfunction as suggested by these DWI lesions disrupts hippocampus-mediated recollection in patients with TGA, whereas familiarity-based recognition memory that is assumed to be supported by extra-hippocampal brain regions should be unaffected. We administered a recognition memory task for faces and words to eleven TGA patients during the post-acute phase and to eleven matched controls. Receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) were obtained in order to derive estimates of familiarity and recollection by applying a formal dual-process model of recognition memory. Analyses of ROC curves revealed a disruption of recollection in TGA patients' memory for words [t(20)=2.70, p<.05], but no difference in familiarity-based recognition memory between patients and controls [t(20)=-1.10, p=.284]. Post hoc analyses indicated that the deficit in recollection is more pronounced in TGA patients who show visible hippocampal lesions on diffusion-weighted MR imaging compared to those without detectable hippocampal lesions. In conclusion, consistent with recent neuroanatomical dual-process models of recognition memory, hippocampal dysfunction in patients with TGA is associated with a selective effect on specific recognition memory subprocesses.",
