     "AB": "Neuroligins (NLGs) and Neurexins (NRXs) are important adhesion molecules that promote synapse formation. Multiple splice variants of NLG and NRX exist, but their specific functions are unclear. Here we report that a surrogate postsynaptic cell expressing full-length NLG-1 triggers slow presynaptic differentiation in a contacting axon. In contrast, a version of NLG-1, which lacks insert B (NLG-1DeltaB), induces rapid presynaptic differentiation, reaching the rate seen at native neuronal synapses. We show that this acceleration is attributed to the removal of the N-linked glycosylation site within insert B. NLG-1DeltaB also increases synaptic density at neuro-neuronal synapses more than does full-length NLG-1. Other postsynaptic adhesion proteins, such as N-cadherin, EphB2, and SynCAM-1, alone or in combination with full-length NLG-1, do not trigger fast differentiation, suggesting that rapid presynaptic differentiation depends on a unique interaction of NLG-1DeltaB with axonal proteins. Indeed, we find that NLG-1DeltaB recruits more axonal alpha-NRX. Our results suggest that the engagement of alpha-NRX is a key to rapid induction of synapses at new sites of axo-dendritic contact.",
