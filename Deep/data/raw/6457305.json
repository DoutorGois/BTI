     "AB": "Experiments were performed to study the involvement of brain 5-HT in an experimental model of epilepsy induced by repeated electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus of rats. The experiments included: (1) systemic injections of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) and (2) electrolytic lesions of the midbrain raphe nuclei. The pCPA group showed a significant increase while animals which received systemic injections of 5-HTP showed a great reduction in the electrographic seizure activity. Although several reports have shown that midbrain raphe lesions do not modify the epileptic susceptibility, we observed a clear enhancement in the epileptiform activity in lesioned animals. The results presented here support the view that serotonergic systems may exert a tonic inhibitory effect on hippocampal epileptic activity.",
