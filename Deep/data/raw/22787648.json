     "AB": "Neural stem cells (NSCs) are one of the cell types considered for grafting in the realm of cell-based therapy for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The promise of NSC grafting therapy for restraining spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in TLE stems from their ability for giving rise to neurons synthesizing the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid and producing astrocytes secreting anticonvulsant factors such as the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor following their grafting into the epileptic hippocampus. Moreover, NSC grafting approach is also expected to ease the cognitive and mood dysfunction observed in TLE, as these cells can secrete a multitude of neurotrophic factors that are known to enhance the hippocampal neurogenesis, one of the substrates important for hippocampal-dependent cognitive function and mood. The purpose of this chapter is to review the present knowledge and offer viewpoints pertaining to NSC-based therapies for TLE. The first section discusses studies that are focused on diminishing the TLE development and cognitive dysfunction using NSC grafting performed into the hippocampus shortly after the initial precipitating injury. The second segment confers efficacy studies of NSC grafts for restraining SRS and cognitive dysfunction when applied after the onset of TLE. Additionally, several other issues that need to be resolved before initiating the clinical application of NSC grafting therapy for TLE are discussed.",
