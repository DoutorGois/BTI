     "AB": "Although NGF gene therapy has been proposed to treat age- or disease-related brain cholinergic decline, little is known about the ectopic expression or function of this trophic factor after transduction in the brain especially over long intervals. The neuron-targeting, recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (rAAV2) vector was used to express mouse NGF with C-terminal myc-tag in septum using a full-length preproNGF sequence. While the predominant form of endogenous NGF immunoreactivity in septum was 31 kd of proNGF, almost all of the ectopic NGF-immunoreactivity attributable to the rAAV2-mediated transduction in this region was recovered as mature NGF. Transgene expression was found in both cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, with the number of transduced neurons dependent on vector dose. To determine the long-term effects of this NGF-expression on neuron function, fimbria-fornix (FF) lesions were conducted 6 months after NGF gene transfer. NGF gene transfer attenuated the lesion-induced loss of septal cholinergic but not GABAergic neurons, indicating that long-term expression did not eliminate this response, which has been noted over short intervals. The effects and dose dependency of NGF gene delivery on neuroprotection and neurotrophism were also examined. NGF transduction increased cholinergic cell size in the septum, but required a higher vector dose than neuroprotection. These results reveal potential long-term benefits as well as concerns for genetically modifying septal NGF gene expression to preserve neuronal viability and function.",
