     "AB": "Two subtypes of the high affinity endothelin-1 (ET-1) receptor were identified in human tissue, and were distinguished by their differential affinities for sarafotoxin S6c (S6c). Uterus contains mostly the ETA subtype, with low affinity for S6c (Ki greater than 7300 nM), while the predominant subtype in hippocampus is ETB, with high affinity for S6c (Ki = 0.25 nM). These subtypes also have different affinities for [Ala1,3,11,15]-ET-1, which was found to be ETB selective. The two subtypes distinguished by these ligands in human tissue correspond to the subtypes previously identified in rat. Differential stimulation of phosphatidyl inositol turnover in rat tissue slices by ET-1 and S6c indicates that both ETA and ETB subtypes represent functional receptors.",
