We assayed N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [3H]3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid ([3H]CPP) bindings) and evaluated their distribution in the brain by quantitative autoradiography in young adult and aged rats. In the young adult rats, NMDA receptors were present at relatively high concentrations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the aged rats, NMDA receptors were decreased in the nealy all areas of the brain, especially in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic administration of bifemelane hydrochloride, a drug for sequela of cerebrovascular diseased, at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day for 14 days, markedly attenuated these decrease in NMDA receptors. Since NMDA receptors are considered to be involved in memory and learning processes, our results suggest that bifemelane hydrochloride may be applicable to the treatment of disturbed memory and learning.
