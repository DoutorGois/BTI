As revealed in earlier studies, the antinocifensive effect of morphine is brought about, among other things, with involvement of serotoninergic transmission mechanisms. In this context the role of the serotoninergic raphe-hippocampus system has been studied in this paper. Topical microinjections of serotonin into the dorsal hippocampus increased morphine analgesia in a dose-dependent fashion, while application into the striatum had no effect. Morphine injections into the median raphe nucleus in relatively low doses exert an antinocifensive effect which is inhibitable by methysergide. Lysergic acid diethylamide administered into the median raphe nucleus also abolished the effect of morphine in a dose-dependent manner. The results in connection with literature data lend support to the presumed integrative function of the serotoninergic raphe-hippocampus system in the mechanism of antinocifensive action of morphine.
