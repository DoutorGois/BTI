Both the 5-HT1C receptor and the 5-HT uptake binding sites were measured in Fawn-Hooded, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats. Five brain regions were examined: frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem. We found significant differences in the Bmax and Kd values in various brain regions comparing Fawn-Hooded rats, with Sprague-Dawley and Wistar animals. The regional differences in receptor number and affinity in both the 5-HT1C receptor and the 5-HT uptake site in the Fawn-Hooded strain, relative to Wistar and Sprague-Dawley animals, provide support for the use of the Fawn-Hooded rat in serotonin dysfunction studies.
