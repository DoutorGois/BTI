Proceeding from the standpoint of a systemic organization of nervous processes which determine the central mechanism of hyperkinesis, the authors modeled hyperkineses by a simultaneous or successional electric stimulation of the brain limbic system in dogs. It was established that there was a correlation between the external expression of hyperkineses, their stability and reproduction and the ordinal succession in which the structures are irritated. In such conditions it is possible to create a functional system where the activation of separate structures appears to be a link in the system while the separate links are inter-related on the basis of inborn and developed mechanisms.
