Myoclonus is defined as large-amplitude rhythmic movements. Brain regions underlying myoclonic jerks include brainstem, cerebellum, and cortex. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) appears to be the main neurotransmitter involved in myoclonus, possibly interacting with biogenic amines, opiates, acetylcholine, and glycine. Myoclonic jumping is a specific subtype seen in rodents, comprising rearing and hopping continuously against a wall. Myoclonic jumping can be seen in normal mouse strains, possibly as a result of simply being put inside a cage. Like other types, it is also triggered by changes in GABA, 5HT, and dopamine neurotransmission. Implicated brain regions include hippocampus and dorsal striatum, possibly with respect to D(1) dopamine, NMDA, and delta opioid receptors. There is reason to suspect that myoclonic jumping is underreported due to insufficient observations into mouse cages.
