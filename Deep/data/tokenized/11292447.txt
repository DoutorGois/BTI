Ihara's epileptic rats (IER) is an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy with mycrodysgenesis, that exhibit abnormal migration of hippocampal neurons and recurrent spontaneous seizures. As an attempt to elucidate the roles of extracellular matrix molecules in the epileptogenecity and mossy fiber sprouting, immunohistochemical localization of brain specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), neurocan and phosphacan, was examined in the hippocampus of postnatal IER and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using monoclonal antibodies 1G2 against neurocan and 6B4 against phosphacan. There was no difference in the expression of these two CSPGs between IER and SD rats in the 1st postnatal week. However, the expression of neurocan was poor in the hippocampus of IER in the 2nd and 3rd weeks whereas intense labeling of neurocan was present throughout the hippocampus of SD rats. Labeling of neurocan was almost absent in the hippocampus, while phosphacan was diffusely expressed in the stratum oriens and radiatum of Ammon's horn, and in the hilus and inner one-third molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at the 2nd month after birth. There was no difference in the expression of neurocan and phosphacan between IER and SD rats at the 2nd month after birth. By contrast, phosphacan was reduced in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in 8-month-old IER, while neurocan was reexpressed in the outer molecular layer and hilus in 3- and 8-month-old IER. It was suggested that the insufficient expression of neurocan may affect the development of neuronal organization in the hippocampus, and that the remodeling of extracellular matrix in the dentate gyrus may contribute to the mossy fiber sprouting into the inner molecular layer.
