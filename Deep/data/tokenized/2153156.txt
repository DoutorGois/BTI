Benzodiazepine binding was measured in amygdala and hippocampus from 19 suicides in whom a firm diagnosis of depression was established retrospectively, and 19 well-matched controls. The number and affinity of benzodiazepine binding sites did not differ significantly between the drug-free or drug-treated suicides and controls.
