Adenosine is considered an important neuromodulator of the nervous system acting at pre-, post- and non-synaptic levels. In the present review we describe how adenosine modifies paired-pulse facilitation (PPF), posttetanic depression (PTD), long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) and depotentiation at the hippocampus, and therefore how this nucleoside modulates synaptic plasticity.
