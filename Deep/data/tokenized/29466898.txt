AIMS: The genus Buxus grows up widespread in Europe and Western Asia. It is an important traditional plant has been used in the treatment of many illnesses. In the present study, the effect of hydroethanolic extract of Buxus hyrcana Pojark (BHP) on the animal model of seizure was studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, forty-two male Wistar rats weighing 220-250 g were randomly selected and were divided into experimental and control groups (6 rats per group). The experimental groups were treated by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) single injection of 150, 300, 450,600 and 750 mg kg(-1) of hydroalcoholic extracts of BHP. The control negative group received normal saline (0.9%) and the control positive group received phenobarbital (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.) pretreatment. 30 min after the treatments, the seizure behaviors were evaluated by the penthylenetetrazole (PTZ) (70 mg kg(-1), i.p.) challenge. In addition, after the experiment, the rats were put to death and their brains were removed for the histological study. RESULTS: The ANOVA demonstrated that compared to the control group, all the BHP doses delayed the initiation and duration of the tonic, colonic and tonic-colonic seizures and significantly reduced the tonic and colonic seizures (p<0.001). Furthermore, the administration of all five doses of the extract significantly prevented the production of the dark neurons (p<0.001) in different areas of the hippocampus compared to PTZ group. CONCLUSION: We can conclude that the BHP extract has beneficial effects for the prevention of the PTZ induced seizure.
