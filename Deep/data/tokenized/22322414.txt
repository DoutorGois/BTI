PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epilepsy research has extended from studies at the cellular level to the investigation of interactions of large neuronal populations distant from one another: 'epileptic networks'. This article underlines the concept of epilepsies as network disorders, adding empirical evidence from electroencephalography-combined functional MRI (EEG-fMRI) studies. RECENT FINDINGS: These noninvasive in-vivo EEG-fMRI epilepsy studies have characterized the ictal temporal-spatial evolution and the interictal persistence of altered activity in typical sets of (sub)cortical brain regions responsible for the clinical manifestation of the disease and its underlying encephalopathy, for example, thalamus vs. cortex in generalized; hippocampus vs. cortex in temporal lobe; a frontal near-piriform region universally in focal epilepsies. Models exist validated against intracranial EEG that can explain interictal and ictal activity based on statistical coupling between different brain regions, and if extended could guide the design of new treatments. SUMMARY: The appreciation of epileptic processes at the network level will foster the development of both anticonvulsive as well as true antiepileptic treatment strategies locally modulating hub regions within the epileptic network architecture as well as entire networks by targeting their characteristic properties such as neurotransmitter or neuronal firing profiles. Treatment should reach beyond seizure control and include the improvement of cognitive function.
