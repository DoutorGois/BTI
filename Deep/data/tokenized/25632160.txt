Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity by activating the receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB, also known as NTRK2). TrkB has been shown to undergo recycling after BDNF stimulation. We have previously reported that full-length TrkB (TrkB-FL) are recycled through a Rab11-dependent pathway upon BDNF stimuli, which is important for the translocation of TrkB-FL into dendritic spines and for the maintenance of prolonged BDNF downstream signaling during long-term potentiation (LTP). However, the identity of the motor protein that mediates the local transfer of recycled TrkB-FL back to the plasma membrane remains unclear. Here, we report that the F-actin-based motor protein myosin Va (Myo5a) mediates the postendocytic recycling of TrkB-FL. Blocking the interaction between Rab11 and Myo5a by use of a TAT-tagged peptide consisting of amino acids 55-66 of the Myo5a ExonE domain weakened the association between TrkB-FL and Myo5a and thus impaired TrkB-FL recycling and BDNF-induced TrkB-FL translocation into dendritic spines. Finally, inhibiting Myo5a-mediated TrkB-FL recycling led to a significant reduction in prolonged BDNF downstream signaling. Taken together, these results show that Myo5a mediates BDNF-dependent TrkB-FL recycling and contributes to BDNF-induced TrkB spine translocation and prolonged downstream signaling.
