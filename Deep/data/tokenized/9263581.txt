In the current investigation, we have examined the developmental profile of nerve growth factor immunoreactivity (NGF-ir) in the postnatal rat. During the first 3 weeks after birth, NGF-ir was observed within the hippocampal mossy fiber region, where it persists throughout adulthood and appeared transiently within three additional zones-the dentate gyrus supragranular zone, the tenia tecta/intermediate lateral septum, and the cingulate/retrosplenial cortex. In all cases, the appearance of NGF-ir progressed in a rostrocaudal pattern over time. A strong correlation was seen between the pattern of NGF-ir and cholinergic innervation in the dentate gyrus supragranular zone, both spatially and temporally, suggesting that NGF may direct the innervation of cholinergic afferents to this region. A spatial correlation was also observed between NGF-ir and cholinergic innervation within the retrosplenial cortex and tenia tecta. With our current techniques, however, we were unable to determine at what point during development the adult-like pattern of cholinergic terminal innervation in these regions occurred and, thus, were not able establish a temporal correlation in these regions. Within the cingulate cortex, there was no evidence suggesting that the developmental appearance of NGF-ir in this region was associated with a specific enhancement of cholinergic innervation. Thus, the results of the current investigation clearly identify the presence of transiently occurring zones of NGF-ir during postnatal CNS development, although defining their exact functional role will require additional investigation.
