We investigated the neuronal activation associated with reexposure to a discrete cocaine-associated stimulus using in situ hybridization to quantify the expression of the plasticity-regulated gene, gamma protein kinase C (gamma PKC), in the limbic-cortical-ventral striatal system. Groups of rats were trained to self-administer cocaine paired with a light stimulus (Paired) or paired with an auditory stimulus but also receiving light presentations yoked to those in the Paired group (Unpaired). Additional groups received noncontingent cocaine-light pairings (Pavlovian) or saline-light pairings (Saline) that were yoked to the Paired group. After acquisition of self-administration by the Paired and Unpaired groups, all groups had a 3 d drug- and training-free period before being reexposed to noncontingent presentations of the light conditioning stimulus during a 5 min test session in the training context. There were four major patterns of results for regional gamma PKC expression 2 hr later. (1) Changes occurred only in groups in which the light was predictive of cocaine. (2) Increases were seen in the amygdala, but decreases were seen in the medial prefrontal cortex. (3) No changes were seen in the hippocampus. (4) Although changes were observed in the basal and central nuclei of the amygdala and the prelimbic cortex in both the Paired and Pavlovian groups, additional changes were observed in the nucleus accumbens core, lateral amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex in the Pavlovian group. These results suggest not only that regionally selective alterations in gamma PKC expression are an index of the retrieval of Pavlovian associations formed between a drug and a discrete stimulus, but also that a distinct neural circuitry may underlie Pavlovian stimulus-reward associations in cocaine-experienced rats.
