Pharmacologic studies suggest that endothelin (ET) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. In the gerbil, transient forebrain ischemia (10 min) resulted in profound motor deficits and a 15% reduction in ET receptor density in the hippocampus at 60 min post-reperfusion. A significant 2-fold increase in forebrain immunoreactive ET accompanied the maximum post-ischemic decrease in ET receptor density. These results suggest that the synthesis and availability of ET are increased acutely in the forebrain following transient cerebral ischemia.
