The functional relationship between the area tempestas (AT), an epileptogenic site within the deep prepiriform cortex, and the regions in the posterior piriform cortex which are innervated by AT, were studied in the rat. The GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol (390 pmol) was microinjected unilaterally into the posterior piriform cortex and adjacent regions in the same hemisphere from which seizures were evoked by focal application of bicuculline into AT. Pretreatment with muscimol into either the ventral posterior piriform cortex or perirhinal cortex, protected against the bilateral clonic seizures evoked from the ipsilateral AT. No seizure protection was obtained when muscimol was placed into adjacent areas of amygdala, entorhinal cortex, neocortex and ventral hippocampus. Seizure protection was also obtained when kynurenic acid, but not 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, was microinjected into the ventral posterior piriform cortex, suggesting that glutamate transmission mediated via non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors is required for the relay of seizure discharge through this region. Our data indicate that a specific region of the temporal cortex, the posterior piriform and perirhinal area, functions as a critical link in the propagation of limbic seizures evoked from AT.
