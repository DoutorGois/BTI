Chronic nicotine treatment reverses hypothyroidism-induced impairment of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and long-term potentiation (LTP). We investigated the effect of hypothyroidism on long-term depression (LTD) and possible protection by nicotine. Following paired pulse stimulation, LTD was expressed in hippocampal area CA1 of anesthetized thyroidectomized, euthyroid (sham control), nicotine-treated and nicotine-treated thyroidectomized (hypothyroid) rats. In hypothyroid rats, a significantly higher LTD magnitude was seen compared with that in control rats. A brief train of stimuli (5 pulses at 100 Hz), which did not affect synaptic transmission in control rats, induced a robust LTD in hypothyroid rats suggesting facilitation of LTD expression in these rats. Chronic nicotine treatment (1 mg/kg, 2x day) of hypothyroid rats reversed hypothyroidism-induced enhancement and facilitation of LTD. Western blot analysis of the NMDA receptor subunits in the membranous fractions of hippocampal area CA1 neurons revealed that hypothyroidism reduced NR1 and increased NR2B without affecting NR2A protein levels. These changes in NMDA receptors in hypothyroid rats were reversed by chronic nicotine treatment. Hypothyroidism did not alter BDNF or nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) levels. However, nicotine treatment increased protein levels of these molecules in both euthyroid and hypothyroid rats. Our results suggest that alterations in the levels of NMDA receptor subunits may account for the facilitation and enhancement of LTD in hypothyroidism.
