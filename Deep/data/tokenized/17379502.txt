The discovery of theta-rhythm-dependent firing of rodent hippocampal neurons highlighted the functional significance of temporal encoding in hippocampal memory. However, earlier theoretical studies on this topic seem divergent and experimental implications are invariably complicated. To obtain a unified understanding of neural dynamics in the hippocampal memory, we here review recent developments in computational models and experimental discoveries on the 'theta-phase precession' of hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells. We identify a theoretical hypothesis that is well supported by experimental facts; this model reveals a significant contribution of theta-phase coding to the on-line real-time operation of episodic events, through highly parallel representation of spatiotemporal information.
