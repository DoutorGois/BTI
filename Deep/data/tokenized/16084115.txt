Hippocampal atrophy has been related to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer disease (AD), but the diagnostic significance of cross-sectionally determined hippocampal volumes is still ambiguous. Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging (DTI) in MCI patients revealed an association of microstructural changes in hippocampal areas with verbal memory decline. MRI volumetry and DTI were combined to investigate 18 MCI patients attending a memory clinic, and 18 carefully age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Neuropsychological testing, high resolution T1-weighted volume MRI scans, and DTI scans with regions-of-interest in hippocampal areas were applied. Left hippocampal volume was significantly lower (-11%, P = 0.02) in MCI patients than in control subjects. No significant differences were found for the right hippocampus (-4%). Mean diffusivity (MD) was significantly elevated in MCI patients vs. controls in left (+10%, P = 0.002) and right hippocampal areas (+13%, P = 0.02). Hippocampal volume and MD values were not significantly correlated. Combining left hippocampal volume and MD measures showed that lower left hippocampal volumes were associated with poor verbal memory performance particularly when co-occurring with high MD values. No comparable associations could be found regarding the right hippocampal formation and with respect to non-verbal memory function. The results demonstrate that microstructural abnormalities as revealed by DTI are very sensitive early indicators of hippocampal dysfunction. The combination of macro- and microstructural parameters in hippocampal areas could be promising in early detection of neurodegenerative processes.
