Hippocalcin is a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein family that is highly expressed in hippocampal pyramidal cells and moderately expressed in the neurons of cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum. Here we examined the physiological roles of hippocalcin using targeted gene disruption. Hippocalcin-deficient (-/-) mice displayed no obvious structural abnormalities in the brain including hippocampal formation at the light microscopic level. Deletion of hippocalcin did not result in up-regulation of the hippocalcin-related proteins; neural visinin-like Ca(2+)-binding proteins (NVP) 1, 2, and 3. The synaptic excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons appeared to be normal, as estimated by the shape of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials elicited by single- and paired-pulse stimuli, and by tetanic stimulation. However, N-methyl-d-aspartate stimulation- and depolarization-induced phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) was significantly attenuated in -/- hippocampal neurons, suggesting an impairment in an activity-dependent gene expression cascade. In the Morris water maze test, the performance of -/- mice was comparable to that of wild-type littermates except in the probe test, where -/- mice crossed the previous location of the platform significantly less often than +/+ mice. Hippocalcin-deficient mice were also impaired on a discrimination learning task in which they needed to respond to a lamp illuminated on the left or right side to obtain food reinforcement. No abnormalities were observed in motor activity, anxiety behavior, or fear learning. These results suggest that hippocalcin plays a crucial role in the Ca(2+)-signaling pathway that underlies long-lasting neural plasticity and that leads to spatial and associative memory.
