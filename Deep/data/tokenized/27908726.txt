Previous studies experimentally reveal that G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1(GPER) has neuroprotection against ischemic injury. However, its effect on traumatic brain injury (TBI) is less well-established. Cognitive impairment following human TBI is a common clinical observation, and TBI is considered as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to observe the possible protective effect of GPER on early-onset cognitive impairment after a single TBI and investigate the cellular mechanism underlying its actions. We found that selective GPER agonist G-1 significantly reduced hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss and improved cognitive impairment in TBI rats. Although previous studies have shown that AD-like tau pathology occurs many years after both repetitive and single TBI, accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau was not observed within days (detected at 24 h and 7d) after TBI. Furthermore, tau phosphorylation was not altered by G-1 treatment. It was found that G-1 administration caused an increase in p-Akt level. However, the neuroprotective effects of G-1 on spatial cognition and neuronal death were attenuated by PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. These findings indicate that GPER agonist G-1 had protection on cognitive function via activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. Early-onset cognitive impairment following a single TBI was closely associated with acute hippocampal neuronal loss rather than tau pathology. This study suggests that early activation of GPER might be a promising therapeutic strategy for improvement of TBI-induced cognitive outcomes.
