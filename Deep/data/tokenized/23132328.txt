Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of motor and cognitive deficits in young adults for which there is no effective therapy. The present study characterizes the protective effect of a new histone deacetylase inhibitor, Scriptaid (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO), against injury from controlled cortical impact (CCI). Scriptaid elicited a dose-dependent decrease in lesion size at 1.5 to 5.5 mg/kg and a concomitant attenuation in motor and cognitive deficits when delivered 30 minutes postinjury in a model of moderate TBI. Comparable protection was achieved even when treatment was delayed to 12 h postinjury. Furthermore, the protection of motor and cognitive functions was long lasting, as similar improvements were detected 35 days postinjury. The efficacy of Scriptaid (Sigma-Aldrich Corporation) was manifested as an increase in surviving neurons, as well as the number/length of their processes within the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the pericontusional cortex. Consistent with other histone deacetylase inhibitors, Scriptaid treatment prevented the decrease in phospho-AKT (p-AKT) and phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (p-PTEN) induced by TBI in cortical and CA3 hippocampal neurons. Notably, the p-AKT inhibitor LY294002 attenuated the impact of Scriptaid, providing mechanistic evidence that Scriptaid functions partly by modulating the prosurvival AKT signaling pathway. As Scriptaid offers long-lasting neuronal and behavioral protection, even when delivered 12 h after controlled cortical impact, it is an excellent new candidate for the effective clinical treatment of TBI.
