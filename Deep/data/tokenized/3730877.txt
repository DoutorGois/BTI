The present study was designed to examine the temporal changes in the theta (theta) rhythm recorded from the dorsal hippocampal formation of the chronic rat following 20 min of cerebral ischemia. Recordings were made during both wakefulness and paradoxical sleep. The experimental results show that ischemia resulted in a drastic amplitude reduction in both superficial and deep theta. Amplitude reduction occurred between days 1 and 4 postischemia and was maintained across the subsequent survival period. This EEG alteration was associated with an excessive loss of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 area, as observed by light microscopy. The above data strongly support our previous conclusions that neural components of the CA1 area may be of fundamental importance for the appearance and the maintenance of not only superficial theta but also deep theta. Moreover, they suggest that the preparation used in the present study may be a useful model for investigations on the neuroanatomophysiological effects of transient cerebral ischemia.
