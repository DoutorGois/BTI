The goal of the present study was to evaluate the contributions of various brain structures anatomically and functionally linked to the hippocampus and amygdala in a fear-based context discrimination task. The brain areas of interest included the fornix, medial prefrontal cortex, mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus, and nucleus accumbens. Damage to the MD thalamic nucleus and medial prefrontal cortex produced the largest impairment in context-specific fear responses. Damage to the fornix impaired some fear responses (freezing, ultrasonic vocalizations, defecation, and approach/avoidance) while leaving conditioned fear expression of heart rate and urination unaltered. Damage to the nucleus accumbens was also coupled with deficits in the discriminative expression of some (heart rate, urination, and ultrasonic vocalizations) but sparing of context-appropriate freezing, defecation, and approach/avoidance behaviors.
