Reduction of cerebral blood flow is an important risk factor for dementia states and other brain dysfunctions. In present study, the effects of permanent occlusion of common carotid arteries (2VO), a well established experimental model of brain ischemia, on memory function were investigated, as assessed by reference and working spatial memory protocols and the object recognition task; cell damage to the hippocampus, as measured through changes in immunoreactivity for GFAP and the neuronal marker NeuN was also studied. The working hypothesis is that metabolic impairment following hypoperfusion will affect neuron and glial function and result in functional damage. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to the modified 2VO method, with the right common carotid artery being occluded first and the left one week later, and tested seven days, three and six months after the ischemic event. A significant cognitive deficit was found in both reference and working spatial memory, as well as in the object recognition task, three and six months after surgery. Neuronal death and reactive astrogliosis were already present at 7 days and continued for up to 3 months after the occlusion; interestingly, there was no significant reduction in hippocampal volume. Present data suggests that cognitive impairment caused by brain hypoperfusion is long - lasting and persists beyond the time point of recovery from glial activation and neuronal loss.
