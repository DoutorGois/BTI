The growth arrest specific 5 (gas5) is a noncoding protein gene that hosts small nucleolar RNAs. Based on the observation that gas5 RNA level in the brain is highest in the hippocampus and remarkably enhanced in aged mice, we tested the hypothesis that gas5 is involved in functions controlled by the hippocampus and known to be affected by age, such as spatial learning and novelty-induced behaviors. We show that aged (22-month-old) C57BL/6 male mice have spatial-learning impairments, reduced novelty-induced exploration, and enhanced gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus compared to young (3-month-old) mice. At both ages, levels of gas5 RNA in the hippocampus negatively correlated with novelty-induced exploration in the open field and elevated-plus maze tests. No correlations were found between gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus and performance in the water maze test. The expression of gas5 RNA in the rest of the brain did not correlate with any behavioral parameter analyzed. Because variations in novelty-induced behaviors could be caused by stressfull experiences, we analyzed whether gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus are regulated by acute stressors. We found that gas5 RNA levels in the hippocampus were upregulated by 50% 24 h after a psychogenic stressor (60-min olfactory contact with a rat) but were unchanged after exposure to an unfamiliar environment or after acquisition of new spatial information in a one-trial learning task. The present results suggest that strong psychogenic stressors upregulate gas5 RNA in the hippocampus, which in turn affects novelty-induced responses controlled by this region. We hypothesize that long-life exposure to stressors causes an age-dependent increase in hippocampal gas5 RNA levels, which could be responsible for age-related reduced novelty-induced behaviors, thus suggesting a new mechanism by which ageing and stress affect hippocampal function.
