The possible implication of P2-purinoceptors in brain functions is reviewed. Involvement of P2-purinoceptors in memory and learning (Section 2) is suggested by ATP release from hippocampal slices [Wieraszko, A., Goldsmith, G. and Seyfried, T. N. (1989) Brain Res. 485, 244-250], induction of fast synaptic currents in cultured hippocampal neurons [Inoue, K., Nakazawa, K., Fujimori, W. and Takanaka, A. (1992a) Neurosci. Lett. 134, 294-299] and long-lasting enhancement of the population spikes [Wieraszko, A. and Seyfried, T. N. (1989) Brain Res. 491, 356-359; Nishimura, S., Mohri, M., Okada, Y. and Mori, M. (1990) Brain Res. 525, 165-169; Fujii, S., Kato, H., Furuse, H., Ito, K., Osada, H., Hamaguchi, T. and Kuroda, Y. (1995) Neurosci, Lett. 187, 130-132], as well as ATP release on glutamate stimulation to evoke an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in hippocampal cells [Inoue, K., Koizum, S. and Nakazawa, K. (1995) NeuroReport 6, 437-440]. Moreover, mRNAs for certain types of P2x-purinoceptors are present in the hippocampus [Collo, G., North, R. A., Kawashima, E., Merlo-Pich, E., Neidhart, S., Surprenant, A. and Buell, G. (1996) J. Neurosci. 16, 2495-2507]. It is likely, therefore, that ATP may be involved in modulation of synaptic efficiency in the hippocampus. The implication of ATP in schizophrenia is suggested by the fact that antipsychotic drugs inhibit ATP-evoked responses in PC12 cells [Koizumi, S., Ikeda, M., Nakazawa, K., Inoue, K., Ito, K. and Inoue, K. (1995b) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 210, 624-630] without blocking the action of dopamine D2 receptors. Involvement of P2-purinoceptors in Sections 4 ("Pain and cognition") and 5 ("Central regulation of the autonomic system") are also discussed.
