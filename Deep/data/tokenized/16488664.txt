Anti-acyl-Coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) antibodies were used to detect fatty acyl-CoAs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, in which important lipid metabolism and transport occur. Hippocampus was chosen because of his involvement in many cerebral functions and diseases. Immunofluorescence experiments showed an intense labelling within neurites and cell bodies. Labelling seems to be associated with vesicles and membrane domains. We have shown by immunoblot experiments that the labelling corresponded to acyl-CoAs which were in strong interaction with proteins, without being covalently bound to them. Immunoprecipitation experiments, followed by proteomic analysis, showed that anti-acyl-CoA antibodies were also able to immunoprecipitate multiprotein complexes, principally related to vesicle trafficking and/or to membrane rafts.
