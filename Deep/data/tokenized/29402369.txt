OBJECTIVE: To observe the protein expression related to cognitive and learning memory function, and to investigate the effect of aquaporin 4 (AQP4) silence on learning and memory function in traumatic brain injury (TBI) rats. METHODS: Ninety-six healthy adult male Wistar rats were divided into groups according to the random number table. (1) Forty-eight rats were divided into sham operation (sham) group, TBI group (by using modified Feeney method), AQP4 RNA interference (RNAi) negative group [TBI+meaningless small interfering RNA (siRNA)-AQP4 liposome solution 10 muL], and AQP4 RNAi group (TBI+siRNA-AQP4 liposome solution 10 muL). In each group, brain tissues of 4 rats were harvested at 1, 6 and 12 hours respectively. The protein expressions of hippocampus AQP4, general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2), cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) were detected by Western Blot. (2) In addition, 48 rats were divided into normal control group (control group), sham group, TBI group and AQP4 RNAi group, brain water content were measured in 6 of them after 12 hours of injury, and 6 were used in Morris water maze test. RESULTS: (1) The protein expressions of hippocampus AQP4 and GCN2 in TBI group were significantly higher than those in sham group, and increased gradually with time with statistical difference at 12 hours (AQP4 protein: 5.03+/-0.09 vs. 1, GCN2 protein: 4.01+/-0.13 vs. 1, both P < 0.01); the protein expressions of hippocampus CREB and p-CREB were significantly lower than those in sham group, and decreased gradually with time with statistical difference at 12 hours (CREB protein: 0.38+/-0.03 vs. 1, p-CREB protein: 0.38+/-0.03 vs. 1, both P < 0.01). Compared with TBI group, the protein expressions of AQP4 in AQP4 RNAi group was significantly decreased (1 hour: 1.02+/-0.04 vs. 2.23+/-0.05, 6 hours: 1.23+/-0.03 vs. 2.59+/-0.04, 12 hours: 2.20+/-0.08 vs. 5.03+/-0.09, all P < 0.01), but there were no significant difference in the expressions of GCN2, CREB or p-CREB. There was no significant difference in the expression of protein between AQP4 RNAi negative group and TBI group. (2) The brain water content in TBI group was significantly higher than that in control group and sham group [(83.7+/-0.4)% vs. (76.2+/-0.2)%, (76.2+/-0.3)%, both P < 0.01]. The brain water content in AQP4 RNAi group [(78.8+/-0.3)%] was significantly decreased as compared with that in TBI group (P < 0.01). The latency of Morris water maze test was significantly prolonged in the day 11, 13 and 15 after the injury of the TBI group and AQP4 RNAi group, and the exploration time was significantly shortened. Compared with TBI group, the incubation period of AQP4 RNAi group was significantly shortened at 15 days (s: 60.2+/-11.1 vs. 62.0+/-11.5, P < 0.05), and the exploration time was significantly prolonged (s: 37.0+/-8.5 vs. 32.7+/-9.2, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The impairment of cognitive and learning memory function in rats after TBI was significantly related to the changes in CREB and GCN2 in cognitive and learning memory function. After RNAi treatment, the cognitive and learning and memory function of rats was not improved obviously, but the brain edema could be alleviated.
