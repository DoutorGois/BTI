We studied the world's most distinguished experts in the use of mnemonic techniques: the top participants of the World Memory Championships. They neither feel the use of mnemonics to be dreamlike, nor does their REM sleep differ from mnemonic-naive control subjects. Besides these empirical data, also theoretical considerations contradict an isomorphism between features of REM sleep dreaming and mnemonic principles.
