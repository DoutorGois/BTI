We have examined how the chemokine fractalkine/CX(3)CL1 influences long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 mouse hippocampal slices. Field potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded upon electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. It was found that application of CX(3)CL1 inhibits LTP when present during the critical induction period. LTP impairment (i) failed to occur in CX(3)CR1 deficient mice (CX(3)CR1(GFP/GFP)) and in the presence of okadaic acid (OA); (ii) required the activation of adenosine receptor 3 (A(3)R), since it was prevented in A(3)R-deficient mice or by MRS1523, a selective A(3)R antagonist. Together, these findings indicate that CX(3)CL1 inhibits hippocampal LTP through A(3)R activity.
