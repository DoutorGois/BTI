The inhibitory effect of cerebellar cortex (Cb) and dentate nucleus (DN) electrical stimulation were studied on 7 cats. After kindling in right hippocampus or in right somato-sensory motor cortex the both Cb and left DN were stimulated monopolarly or bipolarly in each cat. The stimulation was 1 sec train of impulses of 1 ms duration and 60 Hz. The current intensity was 0.3-1.7 mA, 10-12 stimulations were performed in each animal in each structure and the results of stimulations were averaged. The following indices of the stimulation effect were taken into consideration: 1) Number of epileptic spontaneous discharges during 2 min of EEG records before and after stimulation. 2) sum of the epileptic discharges within the periods, 3) time between spontaneous epileptic discharges, 4) time to first paroxysmal discharge after electrical stimulation of the Cb or DN. Results showed prolonged time to the first spontaneous epileptic discharge after stimulation of both structures, thus, indicating statistically significant inhibitory effect of stimulation. The other indices showed no statistically significant inhibitory effects.
