Acute swimming stress destroyed the circadian rhythm of motility in rats. Bilateral electrolytic lesion of the dorsal hippocampus increased the night activity and resistance of animals to stress. Pinealectomy did not affect the circadian locomotion but increased rats' sensitivity to dysrhythmic stress effect.
