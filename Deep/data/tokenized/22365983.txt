Both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that neurosteroids promote learning and memory by modulating synaptic functions in the hippocampus. However, we do not know to what degree endogenously synthesized neurosteroids contribute to the hippocampal synaptic functions. Cytochrome P450scc is the enzyme that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone (PREG), which is required for the biosynthesis of all other neurosteroids. To investigate the physiological roles of endogenous neurosteroids in synaptic functions, we electrophysiologically examined the effects of aminoglutethimide (AG), a selective inhibitor of P450scc, on the synaptic transmission and plasticity in the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal slices. The application of AG (100 muM) decreased the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in granule cells by 20-30% in 20 min through the modulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, while it did not affect the presynaptic properties, including the paired-pulse ratio and the probability of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals. The AG-induced depression was nearly completely rescued by exogenously applied 500 nM PREG or by 1 nM dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), one of the neurosteroids synthesized from PREG, suggesting that the AG-induced depression was caused by the loss of DHEAS. AG also reduced NMDA receptor activity, and suppressed high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP). These findings provide novel evidence that the endogenous neurosteroids locally synthesized in the brain are required to maintain the normal excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus.
