NeuroD is required for the survival of many subtypes of developing neurons in the vertebrate central nervous system. Because NeuroD-deficient neurons in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and inner ear die prematurely in the early stage of neurogenesis, the role of NeuroD during the later stages of neurogenesis of these cell subtypes is not well understood. In addition, the mechanism of NeuroDdeficient neuronal death has not been investigated. It was hypothesized that NeuroD-dependent neuronal death occurs through a Bax-dependent apoptotic pathway. Based on this hypothesis, this study attempted to rescue neuronal cell death by deleting the Bax gene in NeuroD null mice to investigate the role of NeuroD in surviving neurons. The NeuroD and Bax double null mice displayed a decrease in the number of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and the cerebellum and the rescue of vestibulocochlear ganglion (VCG) neurons that failed to migrate and innervate. In addition, at E13.5, the NeuroD(-/-)Bax(-/-) VCG neurons failed to express TrkB and TrkC, which are known to be essential for the survival of those neurons. These data suggest that neuronal death in NeuroD null mice is mediated by Bax-dependent apoptosis and that NeuroD is required for the migration of VCG neurons. Finally, these data show that TrkB and TrkC expression in E13.5 VCG neurons requires NeuroD and that TrkB and TrkC expression may be necessary for the normal migration and innervations of those neurons.
