L7-PKCI transgenic mice, which lack parallel fiber-Purkinje cell long-term depression (LTD), were tested with two different mazes to dissociate the relative importance of declarative and procedural components of spatial navigation. We show that L7-PKCI mice are deficient in acquisition of an adapted goal-oriented behavior, part of the procedural component of the task. This supports the hypothesis that cerebellar LTD may subserve a general sensorimotor adaptation process shared by motor and spatial learning functions.
