An elevation in cerebral GABA level (65%) is observed after administration of an anticonvulsant, sodium propyl 2-pentene-2 oate, a branched chain fatty acid, comformationally restricted GABA analogue, competitive inhibitor of GABA-T in regard to GABA. The concentration of GABA increases in some regions i.e. substantia nigra, frontal and temporal cortex, cerebellum and olfactory bulbs. The GABA level remains unchanged in caudate nucleus, hippocampus and occipital cortex. Results are discussed comparatively to the effect of sodium n-dipropylacetate.
