Concanavalin A-binding glycoprotein with 250 K M(r) found in the postsynaptic density (PSD)-enriched preparation (or synaptic cytoskeleton) from rat cerebellum was identified with P400 protein from the physicochemical properties and enrichment in the cerebellum. Proteins homologous to the cerebellar 250 K M(r) protein occurred in the PSD-enriched preparations from rat cerebral cortex and from hippocampus, although the contents in the preparations were very low. The 250 K M(r) proteins in the PSD-enriched preparations from cerebellum and from cerebrum were highly phosphorylated by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II. The protein of synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) and PSD-enriched fractions prepared from cerebral cortex were not phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase endogenous to the fractions, whereas the protein from cerebellum was done in SPM and PSD-enriched fractions. The facts suggest that P400 or P400-like protein is closely associated with Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II in the PSD-enriched preparations, especially in the preparation from cerebral cortex. Phosphorylation of the protein by Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II may play an important role in the postsynaptic function in both cerebellum and at least in some areas of cerebrum.
