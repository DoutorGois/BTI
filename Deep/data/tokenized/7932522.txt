The preparation and structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-amino-alpha-thienylbenzeneethanamines are described. From this work, (+/-)-2-amino-N-methyl-alpha-(3-methyl-2-thienyl)-benzeneethanamine++ + (3a) and the homologous N-ethyl analog 3b emerged as novel noncompetitive NMDA antagonists with neuroprotective properties. Optical resolution of 3a and X-ray crystallography of (+)3a were performed. The racemate and enantiomers were evaluated for neuroprotective properties in models of ischemia-induced hippocampal damage (gerbil) and cerebral focal ischemia (rat). Pretreatment with 3a, (+)3a, or (-)3a significantly reduced ischemia-induced CA1 hippocampal damage. Posttreatment with 3a afforded a lower degree of neuroprotection. A highly significant reduction in infarct volume was observed with 3a in the cerebral focal ischemia model, with only weak positive effects being displayed by (+)3a. Dose-limiting side effects were associated with all three compounds in this model. In summary, the results demonstrate the utility of noncompetitive NMDA antagonists as neuroprotective agents for ischemia-induced neurodegeneration.
