We have analyzed the brain pattern and time-course of c-fos-like proteins expression in kainic acid-induced seizures in the rat. C-fos-like immunoreactivity increased initially in the hippocampus, notably in the dentate gyrus, at the time of the first limbic motor seizure (90 min after kainate). C-fos-like labelling progressively involved different structures of the limbic system when the rats manifested a permanent epileptic state (3-6 h). The labelling was still conspicuous 12 h after kainate treatment and progressively declined to reach control levels 48 h after kainate. This time-course is similar to that produced by kainic acid on 2-deoxyglucose consumption and correlates with the electrographic changes previously described, supporting the idea that c-fos-like immunostaining may provide a useful marker of neuronal activity, with a cellular resolution. Since anoxic-ischemic treatment produces a very slight and transient increase in c-fos-like immunostaining restricted to the fascia dentata, c-fos-like expression is seizure-related and not due to a local hypoxia or ischemia.
