Rats that had been pretrained on 2 tests of allocentric memory (water maze and T maze) received bilateral cytotoxic lesions in the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) or transection of the fimbria-fornix (FF). After surgery, both groups of rats were impaired on both tasks, although the preoperative training resulted in a rapid initial reacquisition of the water maze task. Those rats with lesions largely restricted to the ATN were impaired at a level comparable to that produced by FF lesions. This finding is consistent with a close functional relationship between the hippocampus and the ATN, necessary for the acquisition and on-line processing of allocentric spatial information but not for the maintenance/retrieval of procedural information. The rats with more extensive thalamic lesions were more impaired in both tasks and did show a loss of procedural information.
