A 52 year old woman developed a severe encephalopathy with status epilepticus of six days duration in the terminal course of an acute hepatitis associated with hyperammonaemia and hyperventilation. Acute haemorrhagic lesions were observed in the brain, involving symmetrically both amygdala and cornu Ammonis. The sequential occurrence of these lesions with status epilepticus are discussed in the light of data from the literature.
