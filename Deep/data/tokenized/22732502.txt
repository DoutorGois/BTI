Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly people. The presynaptic terminal is an important site of pathological changes in AD, leading to synaptic loss in specific brain regions, such as in the cortex and hippocampus. In this study, we investigated synaptosomal-associated protein, 25-kDa (SNAP25) mRNA levels and promoter DNA methylation in post mortem brain tissues (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus) from healthy elderly and AD subjects as well as in peripheral blood leukocytes of young, healthy elderly and AD patients. mRNA quantification was performed by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) using the DeltaDeltaC(T) method and promoter DNA methylation was quantified by mass spectrometry using the Sequenom EpiTYPER platform. We observed a significant decrease in SNAP25 expression in AD across all the three brain regions in relation to the healthy elderly subjects, suggesting impairment in synaptic function. The changes in the auditory cortex reflected those observed in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, the primary areas affected in AD. However, no AD-associated differences in SNAP25 promoter DNA methylation were observed suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in mediating the observed gene expression changes.
