The expression of the proteins (C-FOS and C-JUN) encoded by the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun was investigated in the brains of rats undergoing ethanol withdrawal. Both proteins were induced in the cerebral cortex, the piriform cortex, the olfactory bulb, the inferior colliculus, the granular cell layer of the cerebellum and in the brain stem, but only C-JUN was induced in the hippocampus of animals undergoing withdrawal without overt seizures. C-FOS was detected in the hippocampus only in animals with overt seizures. Maximal C-FOS expression occurred 15 hr after withdrawal while C-JUN was maximal at 24 hr. Gel-shift assays indicated the formation of AP-1 binding factors in nuclear extracts of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum 15 and 17 hr after withdrawal. These data reveal a complex pattern of immediate early gene expression during ethanol withdrawal, which may be associated with changes in neuronal plasticity underlying phenomena such as withdrawal kindling.
