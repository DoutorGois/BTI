Hippocalcin participates in the maintenance of neuronal calcium homeostasis. In the present study, we examined the time-course changes of neuronal degeneration and hippocalcin protein level in the mouse hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). Marked neuronal degeneration was observed in the hippocampus after SE in a time-dependent manner, although neuronal degeneration differed according to the hippocampal subregions. Almost no hippocalcin immunoreactivity was detected in the pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region from 6 h after SE. However, many pyramidal neurons in the CA2 region showed hippocalcin immunoreactivity until 24 h after SE. In the CA3 region, only a few hippocalcin immunoreactive cells were observed at 12 h after SE, and almost no hippocalcin immunoreactivity was observed in the pyramidal neurons from 24 h after SE. Hippocalcin immunoreactivity in the polymorphic cells of the dentate gyrus was markedly decreased from 6 h after SE. In addition, hippocalcin protein level in the hippocampus began to decrease from 6 h after SE, and was significantly decreased at 24 h and 48 h after pilocarpine-induced SE. These results indicate that marked reduction of hippocalcin level may be closely related to neuronal degeneration in the hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced SE.
