The neuroprotective effect of neurotrophic factors has been demonstrated in experimental cerebral ischaemia recently. These include nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and basic fibroblast growth factor (basic FGF). The neuroprotective effect of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), however, has not been studied so far. We have examined the neuroprotective effect of recombinant rat CNTF in a rat forebrain ischaemia model. A continuous infusion of CNTF was started 1 week before the induction of ischaemia and continued until 1 week after the ischaemia. Reversible forebrain ischaemia was induced by 7 minutes of bilateral carotid occlusion with hypotension. Neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 sector was evaluated 1 week after the ischaemia. For the control group artificial CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) was infused instead of CNTF. Per cent neuronal cell death was 83.4 +/- 5.9% (mean +/- SEM, n = 5) in the control group, and 71.1 +/- 10.0% (mean +/- SEM, n = 5) in the CNTF group. Although percentage of neuronal cell death was lower in the CNTF group, the difference was not statistically significant. This result suggests that the protective effect of CNTF in the rat forebrain ischaemia model may be limited compared with other neurotrophic factors. It is considered that the number of neurons protected by CNTF may be small.
