In the present study the effects of dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) lesions in rats were tested on recognition memory tasks based on the interaction between objects, features of objects, and spatial features. The results indicated that the rats with dDG lesions did not differ from controls in recognition for a change within object feature configuration and object recognition tasks. In contrast, there was a deficit for the dDG lesioned rats relative to controls in recognition for a change within object-spatial feature configuration, complex object-place feature configuration and spatial recognition tasks. It is suggested that the dDG subregion of the hippocampus supports object-place and complex object-place feature information via a conjunctive encoding process.
