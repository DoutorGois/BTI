4-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone (apocynin) is a naturally occurring methoxy-substitute catechol that is isolated from the roots of Apocynin cannabinum (Canadian hemp) and Picrorhiza kurroa (Scrophulariaceae). It has been previously shown to have antioxidant and neuroprotective properties in several models of neurodegenerative disease, including cerebral ischemia. The present study investigates the effects of apocynin on transient global cerebral ischemia (TGCI)-induced retrograde memory deficits in rats. The protective effects of apocynin on neurodegeneration and the glial response to TGCI are also evaluated. Rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of apocynin (5 mg/kg) 30 min before TGCI and were tested 7, 14, and 21 days later in the eight-arm aversive radial maze (AvRM). After behavioral testing, the hippocampi were removed for histological evaluation. The present results confirm that TGCI causes memory impairment in the AvRM and that apocynin prevents these memory deficits and attenuates hippocampal neuronal death in a sustained way. Apocynin also decreases OX-42 and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity induced by TGCI. These findings support the potential role of apocynin in preventing neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments following TGCI in rats. The long-term protective effects of apocynin may involve inhibition of the glial response.
