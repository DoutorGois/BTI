Long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal synapses is thought to involve the insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Conflicting evidence exists as to whether calcium-permeable receptors are inserted during LTP and whether synaptic activity mediated by the newly inserted AMPA receptors is required to maintain the increase in synaptic strength. Here, we rigorously test these hypotheses and conclude that calcium-permeable AMPA receptors are not inserted during LTP nor does potentiation require ongoing activity to be maintained.
