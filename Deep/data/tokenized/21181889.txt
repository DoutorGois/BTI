Adult neurogenesis occurs in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. This process is highly regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which may control the proliferation and/or maturation of neural progenitor cells. Adult-born neurons are integrated in preexisting networks and may have functional implications for adult brain. Here we attempt to summarize relevant findings concerning the physiological role of adult neurogenesis mainly focused on the subgranular zone, and to discuss the reduced neurogenesis observed during aging and the factors that have been involved in this phenomenon. Finally, we focus on hippocampal neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease, reviewing animal models of the disease used for the study of this process and the conclusions that have been drawn in this context.
