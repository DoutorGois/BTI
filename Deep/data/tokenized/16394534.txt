Geniposide from Gardenia jasminoides protected neuronal cells from damage in oxygen and glucose deprivation-exposed hippocampal slice culture. Geniposide showed a greater protective effect on the granule cell layer than on the pyramidal cell layer including CA 1 and CA 3. On the basis of the experimental results, geniposide may be a therapeutic agent for ischemia in patients.
