To establish genetic tools for conditional gene deletion in mouse neurons, we generated two independent neuron-specific enolase (Nse)-cre transgenic lines. The transgenic line termed Nse-cre(CK1) showed cre activity in most neuronal regions in the nervous system, while the Nse-cre(CK2) line exhibited a unique cre activity that has not been reported in other cre transgenic lines. Nse-cre(CK2) cre activity was detectable from embryogenesis and mostly restricted to neuronal regions. In postnatal brain, the Nse-cre(CK2) line exhibited cre activity limited to differentiated neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Cre activity was assayed in several internal organs and sporadic activity was limited to the kidney and testis. We conclude that these cre lines will be useful for studying loss of gene function in specific neuronal populations.
