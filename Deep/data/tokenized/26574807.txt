Regular physical activity affects most organs and tissues through a large number of mechanisms which in various ways contribute to improved function and health. Regular physical activity improves quality of life, cognitive functions, mood state and physical capacity, and lowers the risk of many diseases and premature death. Physical activity affects proteins and gene expression through signalling mechanisms, e.g. epigenetic changes. The biological response to physical activity can be markedly different between individuals, to a large degree due to genetic mechanisms. Regular aerobic physical activity (endurance training) improves cardiac function, partly due to an increased stroke volume, and lowers blood pressure due to e.g. improved vasodilation, lower arterial stiffness and increased capillarisation. Regular physical activity helps to maintain muscle mass and function and can improve brain health and function, e.g. executive and memory functions.
