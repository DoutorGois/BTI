The effects of ligation of both common carotid arteries in the gerbil on the levels of PGF2 alpha, TXB2, HETE and of energy metabolites in brain cortex, have been investigated. Also, in the same experimental conditions the changes of cyclic AMP in brain cortex, cerebellum, striatum and hippocampus have been monitored. ATP, glycogen, glucose and phosphocreatine decrease whereas, lactate and cyclic AMP are enhanced in the ischemic brain, as previously reported. In contrast, levels of arachidonic acid metabolites are not modified. During ischemia following decapitation, instead, PGF2 alpha, and TXB2, show considerable increase.
