Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin with low O2 -affinity (l-LEH) was shown to be protective in focal brain ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) in rats and primates. We tested l-LEH in the transient whole brain ischemia in the Tokai high-avoider rat (THA), which has been selected, mated, and bred over 77 generations for a high and consistent learning ability determined by the Sidman avoidance test (SAT). Young/naive (before SAT) and adult/parent (after SAT) THA rats underwent acute and complete four-vessel occlusion in the chest for 3 or 5 min, administration of 2 mL/kg of l-LEH, saline, or homologous washed red blood cells (RBCs), reperfusion, and resuscitation. One week later, all rats underwent SAT, open-field behavioral observation, Morris water maze tests, and morphological study. Whereas young/naive rats treated with l-LEH retained a rapid and consistent learning curve as in nonischemic controls, THA rats treated with RBCs or saline had retarded learning response on SAT as well as reduced cellularity in the amygdala. Adult/parent rats with established memory on SAT maintained perfect achievement even after I/R. In contrast, l-LEH-treated rats showed no better performance on Morris water maze (function) or cellularity of the CA1 sector of the hippocampus (morphology) compared with the rats treated with RBCs. Although task performance on SAT and Morris water maze appeared antithetical, morphological observations corresponded to the respective functions, suggesting that l-LEH was protective only for the amygdala on SAT tasks but not for the CA1 sector of the hippocampus on spatial orientation as in our previous studies on focal brain I/R, where the cortex was preserved better than basal ganglia.
