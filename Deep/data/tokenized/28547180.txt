Tyrosine levels are abnormally elevated in tissues and body fluids of patients with inborn errors of tyrosine metabolism. Tyrosinemia type II, which is caused by tyrosine aminotransferase deficiency, provokes eyes, skin, and central nervous system disturbances in affected patients. However, the mechanisms of brain damage are still poorly known. Considering that studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress may contribute, along with other mechanisms, to the neurological dysfunction characteristic of hypertyrosinemia, in the present study we investigated the effects of antioxidant treatment (NAC and DFX) on DNA damage and oxidative stress markers induced by chronic administration of L-tyrosine in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of rats. The results showed elevated levels of DNA migration, and thus DNA damage, after chronic administration of L-tyrosine in all the analyzed brain areas, and that the antioxidant treatment was able to prevent DNA damage in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, the co-administration of NAC plus DFX did not prevent the DNA damage in the striatum. Moreover, we found a significant increase in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) and DCFH oxidation in cerebral cortex, as well as an increase in nitrate/nitrite levels in the hippocampus and striatum. Additionally, the antioxidant treatment was able to prevent the increase in TBA-RS levels and in nitrate/nitrite levels, but not the DCFH oxidation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and oxidative stress can play a role in DNA damage in this disorder. Moreover, NAC/DFX supplementation to tyrosinemia type II patients may represent a new therapeutic approach and a possible adjuvant to the current treatment of this disease.
