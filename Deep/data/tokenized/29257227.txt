Neurofilaments (NFs) including neurofilament200 kDa (NFH), neurofilament165 kDa (NFM) and neurofilament68 kDa (NFL) are major protein constituents of the brain, and serve important roles in the regulation of axonal transport. NF alteration is a key feature in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders involving cognitive dysfunction. In the present study, cognitive impairments were investigated, via assessments using the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests, in mice following chronic systemic treatment with 1 mg/kg scopolamine (SCO) for 4 weeks. SCOinduced cognitive impairments were significantly observed 1 week following the SCO treatment, and these cognitive deficits were maintained for 4 weeks. However, the NF immunoreactivities and levels were altered differently according to the hippocampal subregion following SCO treatment. NFH immunoreactivity and levels were markedly altered in all hippocampal subregions, and were significantly increased 1 week following the SCO treatment; thereafter, the immunoreactivity and levels significantly decreased with time. NFM immunoreactivity and levels gradually decreased in the hippocampus and were significantly decreased 4 weeks following SCO treatment. NFL immunoreactivity and levels gradually decreased in the hippocampus, and were significantly decreased 2 and 4 weeks following SCO treatment. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that chronic systemic treatment with SCO induced cognitive impairment from 1 week following SCO treatment, and NF expression was diversely altered according to the hippocampal subregion from 1 week following SCO treatment. These results suggest that SCOinduced changes in NF expression may be associated with cognitive impairment.
