Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by chronic neuroinflammation, significant temporal lobe cell loss, and dementia. We investigated the influence of chronic neuroinflammation produced by chronic infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the fourth ventricle for 4 weeks upon the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, a well-characterized model of cellular synaptic plasticity. We also examined for pyramidal cell loss within the entorhinal cortex an area of the brain that contains the cell bodies of the perforant path. The results demonstrate that chronic neuroinflammation results in the loss of pyramidal cells within layers II and III of the entorhinal cortex and a significant attenuation of LTP within the dentate gyrus. Similar changes may underlie the temporal lobe pathology and dementia associated with AD.
