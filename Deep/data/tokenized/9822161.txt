Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), the most important regulator of various responses to stress, acts through CRF receptors (CRFR). For their characterization in brain tissue of Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6J mice, a recently described polyclonal antibody directed against the N-terminus of rat CRFR1 (rCRFR1) was used. The molecular weights of rat and mouse brain receptors were determined by Western blot analysis to be 80,000-76,000 and 83,000-79,000, respectively, whereas molecular weights of 72,000-59,000 were observed for CRFR1 from rat and mouse pituitary. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with brain sections of naive rats and mice. Strong CRFR1 staining was detected in the cortex, cerebellum, mesencephalon and pons of both species, whereas weak staining was observed in amygdala and hippocampus. The striatum did not show immunoreactivity. The density of immunostaining was significantly lower in murine than in rat cortex. In contrast, in the pons and mesencephalon of mice, higher density of immunostaining was observed than in the same brain structures of rats. On the basis of the observed differences, it is suggested that CRFR1 is differentially processed in rats and mice. In addition, the density of CRFR1 staining differed between both species.
