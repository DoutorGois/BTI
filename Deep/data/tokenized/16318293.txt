It is known that the multiple injections of ibotenic acid to the hippocampal CA1 (Cornu Ammonis 1) field of a rat cause cell loss and spatial learning impairment in the place task of Morris water maze. However, no study seems to have been conducted concerning the cue task of the maze. This study examined (1) whether cell loss in the CA1 field produced learning deficits in both the place and cue tasks; (2) whether training could remedy the deficit in spatial learning; and (3) whether the order of place training and cue training could change the performance outcome. Thirty-seven rats of Wistar strain were divided into Place-Cue (PC) group that received place training first and then cue training, and Cue-Place (CP) group that received training in the reverse order. Half rats in each group were damaged in the CA1 field by ibotenic acid injections. Results indicated that damage to CA1 pyramidal cells led to performance deficits only in the place task throughout training, regardless of the sequence of training. The results also indicated that training in the prior task affected learning in the succeeding task, only at the beginning of training, and the effect is transient.
