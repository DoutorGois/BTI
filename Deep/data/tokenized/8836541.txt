Analyzing the distribution pattern of transferrin (Tf) and ferritin, we investigated the changes in iron metabolism related proteins in the process of neuronal death induced by 5 min ischemia. In the control animals, Tf immunoreactivity was localized in the oligodendrocytes. Ferritin was distributed in both neurons and gliacytes, particularly microglia. In parallel with the delayed neuronal death, Tf-positive atrophied neurons and numerous ferritin-positive gliacytes appeared in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus 4 days after ischemia, when glia fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes also appeared throughout the hippocampal structure. A considerable number of ferritin-positive phagocytes (reactive microglia) appeared in the stratum pyramidale from the seventh day. Our data show clearly that the mobilization of Tf and ferritin-positive phagocytes are linked with the degeneration of neurons induced by cerebral ischemia. These events may suggest an activation of iron handling system under the postischemic condition.
