During the first 2 days of postnatal development, CA1 hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic transmission is based almost exclusively on NMDA receptors and is non-functional at resting potential. Within the following days an increasing number of functionally mature synapses, containing both NMDA and AMPA receptors, were observed. We found that the maturation of the NMDA receptor-mediated synapses could be induced experimentally with a pairing protocol, a process termed functional synapse induction. Our data provide evidence that a LTP-like mechanism involved in the activity-dependent formation of functional glutamergic synapses in the developing hippocampus.
