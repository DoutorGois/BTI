The electrophysiological effects of N-[1-[4-(4-fluorophenoxy)butyl]-4-piperidinyl]-N-methyl-2-benzothiazo lamine (R56865), a drug which protects heart cells from ischemia-induced arrhythmias, was studied on intracellularly-recorded CA1 neurons of the rat hippocampal slice under normal or hypoxic conditions. On normoxic cells R56865 (1 microM) reduced firing accommodation without changing passive membrane properties, spike characteristics or synaptic transmission. On hypoxic cells R56865 selectively reduced the amplitude of hypoxia-induced membrane depolarization and partly counteracted the depression of synaptic transmission evoked by Schaffers collateral stimulation. Despite its influence on repetitive firing properties, R56865 might be useful to limit the extent of cellular depolarizing responses to hypoxia.
