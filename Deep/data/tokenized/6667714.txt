[3H]Tryptamine binds with high affinity to sites on rat brain membranes. The sites have the characteristics of tryptamine receptor recognition sites. These sites are widely distributed among rat brain regions with the highest density occurring in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. The site is also found in human cerebral cortex. The binding site is localized mainly to the synaptosomal fraction. Drug competition studies indicate that the [3H]tryptamine binding site is distinct from serotonin receptors. Drugs that are potent inhibitors of [3H]tryptamine binding include tetrahydro-beta-carboline, quipazine, phenylethylamine, amphetamine, p-chloroamphetamine and methamphetamine.
