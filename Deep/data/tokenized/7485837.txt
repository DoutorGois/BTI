The present studies investigate how acutely administered ethanol (ETOH) affects the use of spatial memory. Previous electrophysiological results have shown that acutely administered ETOH alters the firing of hippocampal neurons and that prenatal or chronic exposure to ETOH produces deficits on spatial learning tasks, tasks dependent on the hippocampus. In contrast, it has also been demonstrated that acutely administered ETOH does not impair spatial localization. In the current studies, rats were trained to perform a spatial or stimulus/response task under saline. After training, rats were injected with ETOH, and the use of spatial or stimulus/response memory was tested. Acutely administered ETOH impaired the use of spatial memory, but not the use of stimulus/response memory. Because the use of spatial memory requires an intact hippocampus, the present studies suggest that acutely administered ETOH selectively impairs behaviors dependent on the hippocampus.
