Environmental enrichment enhances learning and memory in both rodents and man. We examined the effect of active manipulation of a novel object (toy) on cognitive performance and acetylcholine (ACh) efflux in the hippocampus of rats. Animals exposed to the toy showed a significant increase in hippocampal ACh efflux provided that they actively manipulated the object. Similarly, a single 1 h introduction of the novel object (toy) immediately after a training session in a radial arm maze significantly improved memory only if the animals actively manipulated the object. The data suggest that environmental enrichment during a critical period (consolidation) is sufficient to improve learning and memory. This effect is likely mediated through an enhancement of hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission.
