In order to study the influence of curare and atropine on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-evoked chloride current, we have investigated cultures of hippocampal and septal region neurons from embryonic rats (E18). The neurons were cultured under the trophic influence of spatially separated astrocytes in serum-free medium. By means of the patch clamp technique, the excitable cells displayed GABA induced chloride currents within 1-15 days in vitro. In both cultures picrotoxin or bicuculline as well as curare or atropine reversibly inhibited the chloride current in a dose dependent manner. We conclude that curare and atropine are not specifically anti-cholinergic for cultured central neurons. Our results provide evidence for common ligand binding properties shared by GABAA and acetylcholine (ACh) receptors supporting the recent concept of a receptor superfamily.
