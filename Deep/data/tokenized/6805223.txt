The presence of glucagon-like immunoreactivity in nerve cells of different parts of the human brain was demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. A bright fluorescent reaction was observed in the pyramidal cells of lamina V of the Neocortex. Less prominent concentrations of the glucagon-like material were detected in a few pyramidal cells of the Hippo-campus and in some neurons of the Presubiculum and Subiculum. Within the Corpus amygdaloideum, only a few magnocellular neurons showed a positive reaction. The Hypothalamus was evidenced by a moderate, but widely distributed, reaction in magnocellular and medium-sized nerve cells in different nuclei (especially Nuc. ventromedialis and Nuc. arcuatus). A strong immunofluorescence was localized to some neurocytes in the Nuc. amibigus, and Nuc. n. hypoglassi. The Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex were free from immunoreactive material, but fluorescence occurred in some very small nerve cells of the Cerebellum (probably granular cells). A dependence of the strength of immunofluorescence of the time delay between autopsy and death is shown.
