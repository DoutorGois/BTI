The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of paroxetine on the spatial memory and expression level of protein kinase C (PKC) in a rat model of depression. Rat models of depression were established by chronic unpredictable mild stress. The spatial learning and memory function of the rats were assessed by the Morris water maze test. The expression levels of PKC in the hippocampus were detected by western blotting. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the escape latency was prolonged and the percentage of time in the target quadrant and the number of times the rats crossed the platform were reduced in the model group; however, the impaired spatial learning and memory function in these rat models could be restored by paroxetine, almost to a level comparable with that in the normal control animals. In addition, the expression of PKC in the model group was significantly decreased compared with that in the control group, and the expression could also be elevated by paroxetine treatment. These results suggest an association between PKC levels and the pathogenesis of depression. The application of paroxetine can improve the spatial memory and reverse the changes in PKC levels in the hippocampus in the rat model of depression. The present findings have enhanced the understanding of the pathogenesis of depression, and provide experimental evidence for the treatment of depression with paroxetine.
