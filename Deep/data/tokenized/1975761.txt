Two selective modulators of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function, dithiothreitol (DTT) and glycine, each dramatically enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of the hippocampus slice. Glycine synergistically potentiated the effect of DTT. Kynurenate, but not strychnine, antagonized the modulatory effect of glycine on LTP, while 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate blocked LTP in all cases. Neither oxidation with 5-5-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid nor exposure to the oxidized form of DTT had any effect on LTP. These data suggest that in vivo the reducing potential of local environments may interact with endogenous glycine to regulate NMDA receptor function.
