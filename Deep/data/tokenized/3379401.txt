Kynurenic acid, a tryptophan metabolite able to antagonize the actions of the excitatory amino acids, has been identified and measured for the first time in the brain of mice, rats, guinea pigs, and humans by using an HPLC method. Its content was 5.8 +/- 0.9 in mouse brain, 17.8 +/- 2.0 in rat brain, 16.2 +/- 1.5 in guinea pig brain, 26.8 +/- 2.9 in rabbit brain, and 150 +/- 30 in human cortex (pmol/g wet wt. mean +/- SE). The regional distribution of this molecule was uneven. In rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits, the brainstem was the area richest in this compound. Tryptophan administration (100-300 mg/kg, i.p.) to rats resulted in a significant increase of the brain content of kynurenic acid. Similarly, 1 h after probenecid administration (200 mg/kg, i.p.), the brain content of kynurenate increased by fourfold, thus suggesting that its turnover rate is relatively fast.
