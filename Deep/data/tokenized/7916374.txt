Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose of 2 Gy X-rays when 1 or 3 days of age. Dying cells in the germinal layer of the telencephalon reached peak values 6 h after irradiation; dead cells were cleared 48 h later. These effects were almost abolished with the injection of cycloheximide (1 microgram/g body weight) given at the time of irradiation. PCNA-immunoreactive cells (cells in late G1 and S phases of the cell cycle) and PCNA-negative cells were sensitive to X-rays. Long-term effects on glial cell populations in the subcortical white matter of the cingulum were examined in irradiated rats, killed at postnatal day 30 (P30), by means of glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin and S-100 immunohistochemistry, as well as with anti-TGF-alpha (transformerly growth factor) antibodies that are used as putative oligodendroglial cell markers in the white matter of rat. The subcortical white matter was reduced in irradiated animals, mainly in rat irradiated at P3, as revealed with myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry. Quantitative studies showed no significant differences in the number of glial cells in animals irradiated at P1 when compared with age-matched controls. However, reduced numbers of vimentin-, S-100-, and TGF-alpha-immunoreactive cells were found in animals irradiated at P3. These features indicate a limited capacity of surviving germinal cells, in animals irradiated at P3, to give rise to normal values of glial cells in the white matter in rat aged 30 days. This limitation mainly affects putative oligodendrocytes and glial cell precursors.
