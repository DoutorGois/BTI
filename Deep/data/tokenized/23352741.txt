PURPOSE: EphA family receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrinA ligands are involved in patterning axonal connections during brain development. Although it has been evidenced that these molecules continue to play a key role in synaptic reorganization and plasticity in normal and injured adult brains, their effect still remains unclear during epileptogenesis. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of adult focal epilepsy and often associates with sclerosis of the hippocampus and mossy fiber sprouting (MFS). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between EphA/ephrinA molecules and epileptogenesis after status epilepticus (SE). METHOD: A mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy was prepared by intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine. EphAs/ephrinAs expression levels of the mouse hippocampus areas were detected at different time points after SE by PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Mossy fiber sprouting was estimated by Neo-Timm staining. RESULT: EphAs/ephrinAs were widely distributed in the hippocampus area. EphA10 and ephrinA4 were increased significantly following epileptogenesis, and mossy fiber sprouting appeared after SE. CONCLUSION: The up-regulation of EphA/ephrinA expression after SE suggests that they are involved in the pilocarpine-induced epileptogenesis.
