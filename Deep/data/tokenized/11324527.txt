In situ hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled oligonucleotide probe was used to investigate the expression of opioid-receptor-like receptor (ORL1) gene in rat brain. It was observed that ORL1 mRNA is widely expressed in many regions of rat brain, particularly in cerebral cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, septum, habenula, periaqueducted gray, raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus structure. These findings suggest that ORL1 receptor may participate in modulating a number of physiological functions in the brain in addition to pain.
