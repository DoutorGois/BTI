Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine has been recognized as one of the major regulators of stress responses after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Repeated blast exposure induces TBI (blast TBI) with a variable neuropathology at different brain regions. Since AChE inhibitors are being used as a line of treatment for TBI, we sought to determine the time course of AChE activity in the blood and different brain regions after repeated blast exposures using modified Ellman assay. Our data showed that repeated blast exposures significantly reduced AChE activity in the whole-blood and erythrocytes by 3-6h, while plasma AChE activity was significantly increased by 3h post-blast. In the brain, significant increase in AChE activity was observed at 6h in the frontal cortex, while hind cortex and hippocampus showed a significant decrease at 6h post-blast, which returned to normal levels by 7 days. AChE activity in the cerebellum and mid brain showed a decrease at 6h, followed by significant increase at 3 days and that was decreased significantly at 14 days post-blast. Medulla region showed decreased AChE activity at 24h post-blast, which was significantly increased at 14 days. These results suggest that there are brain regional and time-related changes in AChE activity after tightly coupled repeated blast exposures in mice. In summary, acute and chronic regional specific changes in the AChE activity after repeated blast exposures warrant systematic evaluation of the possibility of AChE inhibitor therapeutics against blast TBI.
