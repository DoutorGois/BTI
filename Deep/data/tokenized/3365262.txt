The effect of intraperitoneal administration of L-methionine-DL-sulphoximine (MSI) was studied on branched-chain amino acid transaminases (BCAA-T) in different regions of rat brain and in liver. Administration of an acute dose of MSI (300 mg/kg body weight) resulted in a significant decrease in leucine aminotransferase activity in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and brain-stem, while the activity of isoleucine aminotransferase was enhanced in hippocampus, corpus striatum, brain stem, and midbrain. Activities of both these enzymes changed marginally or remained unaltered in other regions of the brain. Valine aminotransferase showed a significant decrease in all the regions of the brain except in cerebellum. Following the administration of a sub-acute dose of MSI (150 mg/kg body wt.), the activities of the three BCAA aminotransferases were found to be enhanced in all regions of the brain. The results are discussed in relation to the utilization of BCAA for the production of glutamate and glutamine in hyperammonemia.
