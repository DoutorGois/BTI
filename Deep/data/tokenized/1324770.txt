Using quantitative receptor radioautography, binding sites for the 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptor ligand [3H]PK 11195 were studied in rats 4 week after end-to-side portacaval anastomosis and in sham-operated controls. Portacaval anastomosis resulted in region-selective increases in density of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites in cerebellum, pons greater than thalamus, cerebral cortex greater than hippocampus greater than striatum. Possible mechanisms implicated in these changes include (i) the action of endogenous ligands for the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor such as octadecaneuropeptide and (ii) neurotoxic actions of ammonia. In view of the proposed role of these receptors as modulators of intermediary metabolism and neurosteroid biosynthesis, such changes could contribute to the neurochemical mechanisms responsible for portal-systemic encephalopathy.
