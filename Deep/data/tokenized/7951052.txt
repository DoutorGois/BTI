This paper reports the influence of ketamine on HSP70 expression, during an ischemic/reperfusion episode, in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The results indicate that ketamine, injected 1h before the surgical treatment, increases HSP70 cellular concentration in both ischemic and sham-operated animals. The HSP70 levels, after the transient ischemic episode, are higher in ketamine treated than in urethane-treated animals respect to the control levels. After reperfusion an increase of HSP70 levels is observed; this induction is maintained for at least 22h, irrespective of the anaesthetic drug treatment. Comparing the cerebral areas examined, the hippocampus exhibits higher protein levels than those of the cerebral cortex.
