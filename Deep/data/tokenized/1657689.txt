1. The effects of enkephalins and enkephalinase inhibitors were studied in CA1 area in rat hippocampal slices. 2. The data demonstrate a prevalent involvement of mu opiate receptors in the epileptogenic properties of enkephalins. 3. A potentiation of the mu opiate receptor-mediated epileptogenic response by enkephalinase inhibitors has been shown. 4. The results also show an inability to affect basal CA1 field potentials by inhibition of endogenous endopeptidase.
