Peptide YY derivatives were evaluated for their respective ability to bind and activate the NPY/PYY receptor sub-types (Y1, Y2 and Y3) present in various preparations. The analogue [Leu31,Pro34]PYY demonstrated high (nM) affinity in rat frontoparietal cortical membrane preparations (Y1-enriched tissue) and the rabbit saphenous vein (Y1 in vitro bioassay) but only low affinity in a Y2-enriched preparation (rat hippocampus). In contrast, PYY C-terminal fragments such as PYY3-36 and PYY13-36 were more potent in Y2 than Y1 assays. Interestingly, and in contrast to [Leu31,Pro34]NPY and NPY13-36, the PYY derivatives [Leu31,Pro34]PYY and PYY3-36 were inactive in a purported Y3 bioassay (rat colon). These results suggest that [Leu31,Pro34]PYY and PYY3-36 respectively represent the first selective and potent Y1 and Y2 agonists, devoided of significant affinity/activity for the Y3 receptor class.
