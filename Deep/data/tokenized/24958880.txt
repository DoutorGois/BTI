Alzheimer's disease (AD), characterized by cognitive decline, has emerged as a disease of synaptic failure. The present study reveals an unanticipated role of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular A4 (EphA4) in mediating hippocampal synaptic dysfunctions in AD and demonstrates that blockade of the ligand-binding domain of EphA4 reverses synaptic impairment in AD mouse models. Enhanced EphA4 signaling was observed in the hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mouse model of AD, whereas soluble amyloid-beta oligomers (Abeta), which contribute to synaptic loss in AD, induced EphA4 activation in rat hippocampal slices. EphA4 depletion in the CA1 region or interference with EphA4 function reversed the suppression of hippocampal long-term potentiation in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, suggesting that the postsynaptic EphA4 is responsible for mediating synaptic plasticity impairment in AD. Importantly, we identified a small-molecule rhynchophylline as a novel EphA4 inhibitor based on molecular docking studies. Rhynchophylline effectively blocked the EphA4-dependent signaling in hippocampal neurons, and oral administration of rhynchophylline reduced the EphA4 activity effectively in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. More importantly, rhynchophylline administration restored the impaired long-term potentiation in transgenic mouse models of AD. These findings reveal a previously unidentified role of EphA4 in mediating AD-associated synaptic dysfunctions, suggesting that it is a new therapeutic target for this disease.
