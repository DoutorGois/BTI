Progesterone has been shown to exert pleiotropic actions in the brain of both male and females. In particular, after traumatic brain injury (TBI), progesterone has important neuroprotective effects. In addition to intracellular progesterone receptors, membrane receptors of the hormone such as membrane progesterone receptor (mPR) may also be involved in neuroprotection. Three mPR subtypes (mPRalpha, mPRbeta, and mPRgamma) have been described and mPRalpha is best characterized pharmacologically. In the present study we investigated the distribution, cellular localization and the regulation of mPRalpha in male mouse and rat brain. We showed by reverse transcription-PCR that mPRalpha is expressed at similar levels in the male and female mouse brain suggesting that its expression may not be influenced by steroid levels. Treatment of males by estradiol or progesterone did not modify the level of expression of mPRalpha as shown by Western blot analysis. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis showed a wide expression of mPRalpha in particular in the olfactory bulb, striatum, cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, septum, hippocampus and cerebellum. Double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis showed that mPRalpha is expressed by neurons but not by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In the rat brain, the distribution of mPRalpha was similar to that observed in mouse brain; and after TBI, mPRalpha expression was induced in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and reactive microglia. The wide neuroanatomical distribution of mPRalpha suggests that this receptor may play a role beyond neuroendocrine and reproductive functions. However, in the absence of injury its role might be restricted to neurons. The induction of mPRalpha after TBI in microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, points to a potential role in mediating the modulatory effects of progesterone in inflammation, ion and water homeostasis and myelin repair in the injured brain.
