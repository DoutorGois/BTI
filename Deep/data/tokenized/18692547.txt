Previous investigations have demonstrated that electroacupunctural stimulation can ameliorate primary and secondary symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy and diabetic encephalopathy in diabetic rats. In this study, we investigated whether electroacupuncture could improve learning and memory which was typically impaired in diabetic rats with cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanisms underlying its effects using passive avoidance test, active avoidance test, Morris water maze and electrophysiology. Electroacupuncture increased the step-down latency in passive avoidance test and accurate rate in active avoidance test, decreased the escape latency in Morris water maze. After electroacupuncture treatment, the long-term potentiation (LTP) impaired by both diabetes and cerebral ischemia was restored significantly. These results suggest that electroacupuncture can ameliorate learning and memory capacity impaired by hyperglycemia and ischemia. LTP plays a very important role in this beneficial effect.
