5-CT (5-carboxamidotryptamine)-insensitive (5-HT1E/5-HT1F) 5-HT1-like recognition sites have been mapped autoradiographically in rat and guinea pig brain using [3H]5-HT in the presence of 5-CT and mesulergine to mask 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT2C binding sites. Binding was more dense in the guinea pig but in both species 5-CT-insensitive 5-HT1-like sites were located in the olfactory tubercle, interpeduncular nucleus, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, frontal cortex and hippocampus. These receptors were particularly marked in the claustrum of the guinea pig but not the rat.
