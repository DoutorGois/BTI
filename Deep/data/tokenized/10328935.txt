Reelin is a large, extracellular matrix protein involved in neuronal migration and axonal growth. To analyze the contribution of Reelin to the development of the commissural projection in the hippocampus, we analyzed the ontogeny of this projection in the reeler mutant mouse. Injections of the lipophilic tracer DiI revealed many commissural fibers in the hippocampus of both reeler and control mice at P1-P2. At P5, at P12, and in the adult, the topography of commissural connections was normal in the CA1 region of reeler mice, with axons innervating the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. In contrast, in the CA3/CA2 region, commissural fibers abnormally innervated the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and, in the dentate gyrus, some fibers were observed in the outer molecular layer. Next, we monitored the distribution of Cajal-Retzius cells in the hippocampus of reeler mutant mice and noted that the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA3/CA2 region was largely devoid of Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells. Taken together, the above results indicate that in the absence of CR cells in the CA3/CA2, commissural axons abnormally grow to the stratum lacunosum-moleculare. To test this hypothesis a series of coculture experiments was performed in collagen gels, in which the CA3 axonal growth was monitored when confronted to the marginal zone. These experiments showed that the marginal zone containing CR cells exerts short-range inhibitory influences for commissural axonal growth.
