Preconditioning the brain with sublethal ischemia protects against neuronal damage following subsequent ischemic insult. Using [3H]inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), [3H]cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and [3H]rolipram, we performed quantitative autoradiography to determine postischemic alterations in second-messenger systems in the gerbil hippocampus following preconditioning the brain with sublethal ischemia. At 7 days of reperfusion, no alterations were observed in brains subjected to 2 min of forebrain ischemia which produced no neuronal damage. However, 3-min ischemia caused a 75% reduction in [3H]IP3 binding (p < 0.01 vs. control) and 15-25% reductions in [3H]forskolin (p < 0.01 vs. control), [3H]cAMP (p < 0.05 vs. control), and [3H]rolipram (p < 0.01 vs. control) binding in the CA1 subfield coincident with histopathological CA1 pyramidal cell destruction, but no significant alterations in [3H]PDBu binding. Preconditioning the brain with 2 min of ischemia followed by 4 days of reperfusion prevented both histopathological cell death and the reductions in binding following subsequent 3 min of ischemia. Interestingly, [3H]IP3 and [3H]rolipram binding in CA1 showed a transient reduction, by 30% and 20% (both p < 0.01 vs. control), respectively, in the early reperfusion period. This downregulation of the IP3 system may play a role in the protection against cell death.
