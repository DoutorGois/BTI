This article describes methods and experimental paradigms used in combination with the rat hippocampal slice preparation in an attempt to better understand cerebral energy metabolism under the following conditions: normal resting conditions, conditions of oxygen and/or glucose deprivation, and conditions of activation (excitation). The outcome of this attempt, as described herewith, demonstrates the unmatched usefulness of the brain slice preparation as an in vitro tool in the field of neuroscience.
