Cyclosporine A (CsA) is the major immunosuppressive drug used for organ and neural transplantation and the therapy of selected autoimmune diseases. We investigated the effect of CsA on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, septum, and basal ganglia. AChE was determined spectrophotometrically with acetylthiocholine as substrate and 5,5-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid as chromogen. CsA was administered in single doses of 20 or 45 mg/kg perorally; in the case of the higher dose we also performed a repeated administration of CsA in three consecutive doses separated by 24 h intervals. Both lower and higher doses of CsA decreased AChE activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus to practically the same extent. On the contrary, AChE activity was more diminished in the case of the higher dose of CsA used in the septum and basal ganglia. Repeated administration of the higher dose of CsA did not lead, with the exception of the hippocampus, to a further decrease in AChE activity in the brain structures observed. These findings contribute to rare evidence concerning the interaction of CsA and the cholinergic system in the brain.
