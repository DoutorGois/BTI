Light microscopic observations were carried out on Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) subjected to a partial cerebral ischemia by occlusion of the left common carotid artery at the neck. About 30% of gerbils developed an ischemic injury in the ipsilateral hemisphere and their brains revealed the following histopathologic features: 1. the changes were related to the intensity (duration) of the ischemic insult and to the time elapsed following release of the occlusion. The ischemic lesions appear to progress after re-establishment of the circulation and this presents one facet of a "maturation" phenomenon which seems to be a general principle applicable to various parameters of ischemic injury. The rate of "maturation" of the lesions is related to the intensity of the ischemic insult, a lesser intensity resulting in longer development of lesions. 2. The changes were either focal or diffuse in character. The former were assumed to be directly related to a vascular involvement; among the latter the topistic distribution of the hippocampal changes suggested a feature of selective vulnerability. 3. An indirect indication of neuronal recovery was surmised from observations on animals sacrificed after different periods following occlusions of the same duration. Also capable of recovery was a "reactive change" observed in the H3 neurons of the hippocampus. This change was characterized by central chromatolysis and resembled the "rimare Reizung" of Nissl.
