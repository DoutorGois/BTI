The levels of mRNAs for the subunits of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-selective glutamate receptors (GluR-1, -2, -3, -4) in the rat hippocampus during aging were measured by Northern blotting. The distribution of these receptors was also examined at the protein level by immunoblotting using antibodies to GluR-1 and to an epitope common to GluR-2 and GluR-3 (denoted GluR-2/3). During aging a significant decrease of GluR-1 protein, but no change in the corresponding mRNA level, was observed. No differences in the level of GluR-2/3 protein and GluR-2, -3, and -4 mRNAs at the various ages examined (4, 12, and 24 months) were detected. Our results show that AMPA receptors are only slightly influenced by the aging process in the rat hippocampus. The slight decrease in GluR-1 protein content, not accompanied by a parallel decrease in the GluR-1 mRNA level, might be explained by a decreased translational efficiency or an increased protein degradation of the GluR-1 subunit.
