Using in vitro autoradiography, we investigated the effects of Kamikihito (KKT), a traditional Chinese medicine, on specific [3H]SCH23390 binding to dopamine D1 receptors and [3H]ketanserine binding to serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the rat brain. Specific binding of both compounds was affected by aging. Long-term administration of KKT resulted in decreases in [3H]SCH23390 binding to the cortex and hippocampus in aged rats, and in decreases in [3H]ketanserine binding to the caudate/putamen in young rats. These results suggest that the changes in dopamine Di and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor binding may be involved in the central effects of KKT.
