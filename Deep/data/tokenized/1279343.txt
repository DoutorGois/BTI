Quantitative solution hybridization assays were used to determine the picogram amounts of preproenkephalin mRNA (PPenk mRNA) and the microgram quanities of total rat RNA in extracts of eight brain regions from rats which had received three daily intraperitoneal injections of cocaine (10 or 30 mg/kg/day) or saline for 14 days. The young adult male Fischer rats were sacrificed 30 min after the final injection. The highest density of PPenk mRNA (pg PPenk mRNA/micrograms total cellular RNA) was found in extracts of striatum (34.08 +/- 1.79 pg/micrograms for 11 saline-treated rats), followed by extracts of nucleus accumbens (10.08 +/- 0.81 pg/micrograms), and extracts of hypothalamus (2.99 +/- 0.31 pg/micrograms). Extracts of frontal cortex (1.78 +/- 0.24 pg/micrograms), pituitary (1.39 +/- 0.08 pg/micrograms), central grey (1.31 +/- 0.16 pg/micrograms), and cerebellum (1.24 +/- 0.09 pg/micrograms) had intermediate values. Extracts of hippocampus (0.53 +/- 0.03 pg/micrograms) had the lowest density. No significant differences were found among the treatment groups in any brain area investigated. Therefore, chronic cocaine treatment as administered in this protocol did not alter expression of the gene encoding proenkephalin.
