Effects of long-term feeding with tryptophan (TRP)-free diet on the free running periods of wheel-running rhythm and the central serotonergic neurotransmission were examined in male blinded rats. Long-term feeding with TRP-free diet did not change the periods of wheel-running rhythm calculated from chi 2 periodogram but disordered its pattern, which seemed to be due to masking or entrainment effects. On the other hand, long-term TRP-free diet decreased the concentrations of TRP, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in all brain regions tested; frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and pons. The density of 5-HT1A receptor (3H-8-OH-DPAT) binding was significantly decreased in only frontal cortex, while no significant change was observed in the density of 5-HT2 receptor (3H-ketanserin) binding in all regions. Although the mechanism of down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptor in frontal cortex is obscure, it was confirmed that TRP-free diet decreased central 5-HT synthesis and 5-HT neurotransmission. This dysfunction of 5-HT neurotransmission by TRP-free diet is suggested to make the circadian rhythm pacemaker susceptible to subtle environmental factors by lowering its intensity.
