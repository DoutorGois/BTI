We analyzed the long-term consequences of asphyxial cardiac arrest for hippocampal cell proliferation in rats to evaluate if the ischaemia-induced degenerated CA1 region may be repopulated by endogenous (stem) cells. Studies were performed in an asphyxial cardiac arrest model with 5 minutes of asphyxiation and three different survival times: 7, 21, and 90 days. Sham-operated non-asphyxiated rats served as control. Cell proliferation was studied by labeling dividing cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). The neurodegenerative/regenerative pattern at single cell levels was monitored by immunohistochemistry. Alterations of gene expression were analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Analysis of BrdU-incorporation demonstrated an increase at 7, 21 as well as 90 days after global ischaemia in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Similar results were found in the dentate gyrus. Differentiation of BrdU-positive cells, investigated by cell phenotype-specific double fluorescent labeling, showed increased neurogenesis only in the dentate gyrus of animals surviving the cardiac arrest for 7 days. The majority of newcomers, especially in the damaged CA1 region, consisted of glial cells. Moreover, asphyxia seemed to be able to induce the migration of microglia and astroglia from adjacent areas into the damaged area and/or the activation of resident cells. In addition, we show microglia proliferation/activation even 90 days after cardiac arrest. This morphological finding was confirmed by PCR analysis. The results indicate that asphyxia triggers cell proliferation in general and gliogenesis in particular - a possible pro-reparative event. Furthermore, from the finding of microglia proliferation up to 90 days after insult we conclude that delayed cell death processes take place which should be considered for further therapy strategies.
