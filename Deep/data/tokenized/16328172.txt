The formation of conditioned reflex fear, escape responses, and conditioned avoidance responses during acquisition of a conditioned two-way avoidance reflex was studied in rats of different ages. Rats aged 16-17 days acquired the conditioned reflex but not the escape reaction or the conditioned avoidance response; acquisition efficiency was higher than in adult rats. Escape responses appeared from postnatal day 18. The ability to acquire this type of learning was complete by age 3-4 weeks. Maturation of the mechanisms of the "classical" (the fear phase) and operant (transfer to another sector in response to the unconditioned stimulus) components did not facilitate acquisition of the conditioned two-way avoidance reflex until the middle of postnatal week 4. Learning efficiency in four-week-old rats was lower than in adults. It is suggested that the maturation of different types of memory may be associated with the periods at which plastic processes develop in the hippocampus.
