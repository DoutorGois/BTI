The endocannabinoid system participates in the regulation of physical activity, although its role is not yet fully understood. Here, we highlight the impact of endocannabinoid signalling on voluntary wheel running in mice and discuss potential mechanisms involved such as hippocampal neurogenesis. Running-induced short-term and long-term alterations of emotional behaviors are scrutinized with regard to the question how endocannabinoids might be involved. While endocannabinoids seem to contribute to the motivational aspects of voluntary running in rodents, influencing the total distance covered most likely via CB1 receptors, they are less involved in the long-term changes of emotional behavior induced by voluntary exercise.
