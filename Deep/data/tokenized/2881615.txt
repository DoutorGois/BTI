Somatostatin has been localized in several hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain regions where it may function as a classical neurotransmitter or as a modulator of neural activity. In the present study, somatostatin binding sites were studied by incubation of coronal sections of rat forebrain with 125I-Tyr1-somatostatin, Ultrofilm autoradiography, computerized microdensitometry and comparison with 125I standards. Highest concentrations of somatostatin binding sites (fmol/mg protein) were found in the claustrum (151), basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (90), deep layers of the cerebral cortex (61), lateral olfactory nuclei (58), CA1 and CA2 areas of hippocampus (57), medial and lateral septal nuclei (54), and the medial habenula (44). Scatchard analysis of individual forebrain areas with high densities of somatostatin binding sites was also performed. Regulation of brain somatostatin binding sites may be studied as one approach to examining the involvement of central somatostatin pathways in various physiological and behavioral states.
