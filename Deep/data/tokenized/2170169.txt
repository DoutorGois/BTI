The rate of kindling development was studied in rabbits with chronic electrodes (neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus) in respect to distribution of epileptic activity over the brain structures. The differences of individual kindling development depended on the distribution of interictal spikes over the brain structures and the degree of their subordination to the primary hippocampal focus. The kindling effects seem to develop rapidly in those cases when primary hippocampal epileptic focus plays a role of pathological determiner which subordinates and synchronizes the activity in other structures. When competitive inhibitory influences prevail in the interrelationships between primary and secondary hippocampal foci, neither pathological hippocampal determiner nor kindling effects occur.
