The effect of four KATP channel openers (KCOs) on the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells and A10 dopaminergic neurons was investigated using extracellular recording techniques in rat brain slices. Pinacidil, lemakalim, diazoxide and a new compound, BPDZ44, had an inhibitory effect on the electrical activity of CA1 pyramidal cells. They all had a similar potency. Only BPDZ44 and diazoxide inhibited the firing rate of A10 dopamine neurons. The sulfonylurea glipizide (1 microM) antagonized the effect of BPDZ44 and diazoxide on A10 neurons but failed to antagonize the effect of KCOs on CA1 pyramidal cells. These results show that differences exist among KCOs in their ability to decrease the electrical activity of various populations of central neurons.
