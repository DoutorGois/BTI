Treatment of the adult rats with selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor: fluoxetine and its complexes with glycyrrizhinic acid during 2 weeks (25 mg/kg/day) significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels that were measured after 5-min plus-maze. All the drugs decreased the content of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the striatum as well as 5-HT in the hippocampus. There was a significant negative correlation between 5-HT in the striatum and corticosterone levels. These data suggest that fluoxetine induces serotoninergic changes in the striatum that might be related to neuroendocrine and behavioural effects of the drug.
