In a recent breakthrough, a methodology has been developed for studying persistent enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in primary cultures of hippocampus. Results from the use of this method have already pointed to a previously unsuspected differential role for synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in lasting synaptic potentiation.
