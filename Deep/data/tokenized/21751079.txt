Amyloid-beta plays a causative role in Alzheimer's disease. Occlusal disharmony causes chronic psychological stress, and psychological stress increases amyloid-beta accumulation. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether occlusal disharmony-induced psychological stress affects the accumulation of amyloid-beta and its related gene expressions in the rat hippocampus. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats (n = 18) were divided into three groups of six rats each: (1) a control group that received no treatment for 8 weeks; (2) an occlusal disharmony group that underwent cutoff maxillary molar cusps for 8 weeks; and (3) a recovered group that underwent cutoff maxillary molar cusps for 4 weeks followed by recovery for 4 weeks. Occlusal disharmony increased plasma corticosterone levels in a time-dependent manner. Levels of amyloid-beta 40 and 42, glucocorticoid receptor (Gr) protein, and cleaved caspase 3 (Casp3) as well as gene expressions of amyloid precursor protein, beta-secretase, Casp3, and Gr in the hippocampus in the occlusal disharmony group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.016). These findings were significantly improved by recovery of occlusion (P < 0.016). These results indicate that psychological stress induced by occlusal disharmony reversibly induces amyloid-beta 40 and 42 in the rat hippocampus through the glucocorticoid signal.
