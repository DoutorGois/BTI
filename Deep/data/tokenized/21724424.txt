RATIONALE: The rationale for using a non-linear (proportional) paradigm for determining the extent of the neocortex to be removed in temporal lobe resection was based on anatomical and intra-operative cortical mapping findings. We present our results regarding speech preservation in patients submitted to CAH using the central artery as an anatomical landmark for determining the posterior border of neocortical resection. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty consecutive right-handed patients with left unilateral mesial sclerosis were studied. All patients were submitted to CAH under general anesthesia and without intraoperative electrocorticography. The posterior border of the lateral neocortical resection was defined by a line perpendicular to the temporal axis at the level of the central artery. RESULTS: Seven patients had transient (1-3 weeks; mean=9 days) receptive speech disturbance. There was no permanent speech deficit. Imaging documented edema or contusion at the posterior temporal cortical border in all patients who had transient speech deficits. The mean extent of cortical resection was 3.9 cm in adults and 3.1cm in kids. DISCUSSION: This is the first report in the literature discussing the use of a non-linear paradigm to determine the extent of lateral neocortical removal in this patient population. We found no permanent speech disturbances in this series. The non-linear approach used in this series proved to be safe and effective to avoid post-operative speech disorders. It was able to compensate for different brain and head sizes, and allowed smaller neocortical removal when compared to traditional linear approaches.
