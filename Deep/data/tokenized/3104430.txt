Extracorporeal CO2-removal (EC-CO2-R) using a membrane lung system was applied for 12 and 20 days respectively in two young men with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neuropathological examination revealed only moderate hypoxic changes of unusual distribution. In the first case nerve cell loss in Sommer's sector of the hippocampus and focal incomplete necroses in both putamina were interpreted as the result of cardiac arrest at the onset of the disease rather than of chronic hypoxia. Findings in the second case were confined to nerve cell necroses of a minor degree in the cerebral cortex. Remarkably, the cerebellum was spared in both cases. Our observations suggest that EC-CO2-R was not associated with neuropathological findings which could be attributed specifically to this procedure.
