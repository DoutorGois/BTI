The role of calcium channels blockers in ischemic condition has been well documented. The PhTx3 neurotoxic fraction of the spider Phoneutria nigriventer venom is a broad-spectrum calcium channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release, calcium uptake and also glutamate uptake in synaptosomes. In the present study we describe the effect of PhTx3 (1.0 microg/mL), omega-conotoxin GVIA (1.0 micromol/L) and omega-conotoxin MVIIC (100 nmol/L) on neuroprotection of hippocampal slices and SN56 cells subjected to ischemia by oxygen deprivation and low glucose insult (ODLG). After the insult, cell viability in the slices and SN56 cells was assessed by confocal microscopy and epifluorescence, using live/dead kit containing calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer. Confocal images of CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slices subjected to ischemia insult and treated with omega-conotoxin GVIA, omega-conotoxin MVIIC and PhTx3 showed a percentage of dead cells of 68%, 54% and 18%, respectively. The SN56 cells subjected to ischemia were almost completely protected from damage by PhTx3 while with omega-conotoxin GVIA or omega-conotoxin MVIIC the cell protection was only partial. Thus, PhTx3 provided robust ischemic neuroprotection showing potential as a novel class of agents that targets multiple components and exerts neuroprotection in in vitro model of brain ischemia.
