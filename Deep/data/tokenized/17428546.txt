Microglia participate in immune responses in the brain. However, little is known about the contact-mediated interaction between microglia and neurons. We report here that the cell-to-cell contacts between microglial processes and dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons were dramatically increased in density and area following local injection of kainic acid (KA). A similar KA-induced increase in the degree of intercellular contacts was observed in mice lacking telencephalin (TLCN), a neuronal dendritic adhesion molecule of ICAM family. The results suggest that adhesive contacts independent of TLCN and contact-mediated interactions between microglia and dendrites were promoted by excitotoxic brain injury.
