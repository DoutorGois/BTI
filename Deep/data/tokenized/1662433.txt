Behavioral manifestations of spreading depression (SD) were compared with SD electrophysiological characteristics in these structures. Carbon electrodes were suitable for recording DC slow potential changes in freely moving animal. It was shown that short (0.1 s) high-frequency (200 Hz) electrical stimulation of thalamus and hippocampus with intensity 50-300 microA easily triggered SD wave in these structures in narcotized and awake rats. The threshold of SD occurrence in dorsal hippocampus was the same or sometimes lower than that of the primary afterdischarge. Penetrating SD into ventral hippocampus provoked long latency seizure discharge and wet-dog shakings in awake rats. Intensity of locomotor activity accompanying bilateral hippocampal SD exceeded orienting response significantly. Contrary to hippocampus, thalamic SD was usually subseizure and unilateral phenomenon and had a clear tranquil effect on the rat locomotor activity. It was found that the rats didn't change the compartment preference after 20-45 SD waves in the thalamus or in the hippocampus.
