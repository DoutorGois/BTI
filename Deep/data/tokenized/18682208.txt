Regeneration was once thought to be exclusive to young neurons. Now, a new study shows that functional and interconnected hippocampal neurons have the potential to quickly recover from losing an axon. They do so by signaling a dendrite to change its specification and replace the missing axon by rearranging the microtubule cytoskeleton.
