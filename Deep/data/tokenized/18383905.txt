A review of neuroimaging findings in diverse pathologies involving the temporal lobe in children is undertaken. Illustrative images of the developmental disorders that may cause temporal epilepsy in the pediatric context are provided. Brain malformations associated with hippocampal dysgenesis and related conditions such as epilepsy-associated tumors will be discussed with representative examples. Neurocutaneous syndromes that can involve the temporal lobe producing epilepsy or learning defects will be also discussed. Some other miscellaneous disorders occurring preferentially in the pediatric age such as hippocampal damage secondary to hypoxia or radiotherapy will be briefly exposed at the end of the article.
