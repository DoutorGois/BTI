The problem of generating uniform deterministic samples over the rotation group, SO(3), is fundamental to computational biology, chemistry, physics, and numerous branches of computer science. We present the best-known method to date for constructing incremental, deterministic grids on SO(3); it provides: 1) the lowest metric distortion for grid neighbor edges, 2) optimal dispersion-reduction with each additional sample, 3) explicit neighborhood structure, and 4) equivolumetric partition of SO(3) by the grid cells. We also demonstrate the use of the sequence on motion planning problems.
