Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NGF are both expressed by neurons in the hippocampus. In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that both BDNF and NGF mRNA levels are regulated by neuronal activity. Upregulation is predominantly regulated by the glutamate (NMDA and non-NMDA receptors); downregulation, predominantly by the GABA system (Zafra et al., 1990, 1991). In neuronal cultures of the rat hippocampus, potassium depolarization and kainic acid-mediated increases in BDNF and NGF mRNA were eliminated in a dose-dependent manner by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine. Conversely, calcium ionophores (Bay-K8644 and ionomycin) augmented BDNF and NGF mRNA levels by a calmodulin-mediated mechanism. In view of the fact that many potential modulators (conventional transmitters and neuropeptides) of neuronal and astrocytic BDNF and NGF mRNA synthesis may act via the adenylate cyclase system, we studied the effect of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Indeed, forskolin enhanced the effects of calcium ionophores and kainic acid on BDNF and NGF mRNA levels. Cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and transforming growth factor-beta 1, which have previously been shown to increase NGF mRNA markedly in astrocytes, were without effect on neuronal BDNF and NGF mRNA levels. In contrast to neuronal cultures, where the regulation of BDNF and NGF mRNA was generally very similar, the regulation in astrocytes was distinctly different. All the cytokines that produce a marked increase in NGF mRNA were without effect on astrocyte BDNF mRNA levels, which under basic conditions were below the detection limit. However, norepinephrine produced a marked elevation of BDNF mRNA in astrocytes, an effect that was further enhanced by glutamate receptor agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
