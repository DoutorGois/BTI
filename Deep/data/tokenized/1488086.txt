Seven brains of individuals who had suffered from Huntington's disease and seven control brains were examined. Preparations stained for Nissl material and lipofuscin pigment revealed a characteristic layer-specific loss of nerve cells in two allocortical areas, the entorhinal region and the subiculum. The most severe changes occurred in the entorhinal layer Pri-gamma while layer Pre-alpha, layer Pre-gamma and the subiculum showed less severe alterations.
