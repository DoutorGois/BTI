The perforant path is the major excitatory cortical projection to the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Field potentials from the medial perforant path exhibit paired-pulse depression when evoked at interstimulus intervals of 40 to 800 msec. We found that an early component of paired-pulse depression recorded at interstimulus intervals of 40 to 100 msec from slices of rat hippocampus was reduced by L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (L-AP4) (20 microM) without a change in the size of the first field potential in the pair. Paired-pulse depression evoked at intervals of 200 to 800 msec was not reduced. 1S,3R-1-Aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), DL-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid and carbachol also reduced paired-pulse depression in a manner similar to L-AP4. Picrotoxin, phaclofen, theophylline or atropine did not reduce paired-pulse depression. Furthermore, paired-pulse depression (40-100 msec) does not appear to involve glutamate uptake or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors as L-alpha-aminoadipate did not alter paired-pulse depression and neither trans-L-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate and L-alpha-aminoadipate nor D-2-amino-5-phosphonopropionic acid blocked the effect of L-AP4 on paired-pulse depression. 4-Aminopyridine inhibits a potassium current that has a similar time course to the L-AP4-induced reduction of paired-pulse depression, however, paired-pulse depression was increased with exposure to 4-aminopyridine. These results indicate that the mechanism underlying paired-pulse depression consists of two components, the early component being reduced by L-AP4, 1S,3R-ACPD, DL-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid and carbachol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
