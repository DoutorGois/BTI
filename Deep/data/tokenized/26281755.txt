BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive shock (ECS), also known as an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is an effective and safe treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders including pharmacoresistant major depressive disorder. Previous research in animal models suggests ECS efficacy is achieved by Gadd45b-mediated increases in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The present study aims to delineate the role of Gadd45b in mediating proliferation of neural stem cell types including quiescent radial glia-like (RGL) and amplifying non-radial glia-like (non-RGL) neural precursors following ECS. METHODS: RGL and non-RGL neural stem cell populations defined by co-localization of MCM2+ and nestin+ cells and morphologically by the presence of radial processes were stereologically analyzed. RESULTS: ECS increased hippocampal density of both quiescent RGLs and amplifying non-RGLs. CONCLUSIONS: Gadd45b mediates the action of ECS-induced proliferation through activation of quiescent neural stem cells.
