OBJECTIVE: To study brain networks of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to investigate whether TLE brain dysfunction have an impact on depression, using resting state functional magnetic resonance (RS-fMRI) detection technology. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with TLE were included in this study. According to Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton's Depression Scale (HAMD)-17 score, we divided them into two groups: depression group 9 cases, non-depression group 9 cases. All patients underwent 3.0T MRI , RS-fMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examinations and then the results were analyzed. RESULTS: Disease course of depression group was longer than non-depression group and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). RS-fMRI examination showed that depression group had more active brain areas and more extral temporal active areas than non-depression group (P<0.05). By compared with the non-depression group, we found more strong active brain areas including thalamus, and the default-mode network which involved in prefrontal cortex, precuneus, ventral anterior cingulate and hippocampus. We found the NAA and NAA/Cho+ Cr of the hippocampus which were ipsilateral to the advantage discharge side were decreased in 5/9 cases with depression in MRS and 3/5 cases had hippocampal atrophy, while the non-depression group had no obvious abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The brain default-mode network activity in TLE patients with depression is increased and there is more extral temporal activation than the non-depression group; furthermore abnormal hippocampus structure is more common in depression group, which suggests that epileptic brain dysfunction may affect the development of depression.
