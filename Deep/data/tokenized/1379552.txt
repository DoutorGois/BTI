The complete amino acid sequence of a novel calcium channel (designated BII) from rabbit brain has been deduced by cloning and sequencing the cDNA. The BII calcium channel is structurally more closely related to the BI calcium channel than to the cardiac and skeletal muscle L-type calcium channels. Blot hybridization analysis of RNA from different tissues and from different regions of the brain shows that the BII calcium channel is distributed predominantly in the brain, being abundant in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and corpus striatum.
