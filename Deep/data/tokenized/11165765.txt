The mossy fiber pathway of the hippocampal formation and type 1 adenylyl cyclase (AC1) have been implicated in long-term potentiation and memory function. Using immunohistochemical labeling and light microscopy we demonstrated intense labeling of AC1 in the mossy fibers and less intense labeling in the molecular layers of both the dentate gyrus and fields CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus, i.e. in terminal fields of the perforant pathway. These findings indicate that, in the non-human primate, AC1 is found in the mossy fibers and in terminal fields of the perforant pathway where it may play a role in long term potentiation similar to that demonstrated in the rodent.
