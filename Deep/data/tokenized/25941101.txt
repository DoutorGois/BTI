Valproic acid (VPA) mouse model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been characterized mostly by impaired ultrasonic vocalization, poor sociability and increased repetitive self-grooming behavior. However, its neural signaling remained unknown. This study investigated the local field potentials (LFPs) in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 and the olfactory bulb while animals exploring a novel open field. VPA was administered at gestational day 13. The results demonstrated three core features of ASD in male offspring. However, there was no difference in Y-maze performance and locomotor activity. Analysis of hippocampal LFP power revealed significantly increased slow wave (1-4 Hz) and high gamma (80-140 Hz) oscillations and decreased theta (4-12 Hz) activity in VPA mice. In the olfactory bulb, VPA animals showed greater slow wave (1-4 Hz) and beta (25-40 Hz) activity and lower activity of low gamma (55-80 Hz) wave. Regression analysis revealed positive correlations between hippocampal theta power and locomotor speed for both control and VPA-exposed mice. There was no significant difference between groups for modulation index of theta (4-12 Hz) phase modulated gamma (30-200 Hz) amplitude. These findings characterized VPA mouse model with LFP oscillations that might provide better understanding of neural processing in ASD.
