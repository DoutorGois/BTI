This study describes the pharmacological properties of two novel cyclopyrrolone derivatives, RP 59037 [2-(7-chloro-2-naphthyridin-1,8-yl)-3-(5- methyl-2-oxohexyl)isoindolin-1-one] and RP 60503 [2-(7-chloro-2-naphthyridin-1,8-yl)isoindolin-1-yl-4- acetamidobutyrate], in the rodent. These compounds possess high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor in rat cerebrocortical membranes with Ki values of 0.98 nM (RP 59037) and 1.16 nM (RP 60503). Neither compound discriminates between the putative benzodiazepine BZ1 and BZ2 binding site subtypes present in the rat cerebellum and hippocampus, respectively. Both compounds protect mice against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures with ID50 values of 0.21 mg.kg-1 p.o. (RP 59037) and 5.96 mg.kg-1 p.o. (RP 60503). The two compounds displayed a restricted anticonvulsant profile compared to diazepam and, in this respect, resembled the pyrazoloquinoline partial agonist, CGS 9896. RP 59037 and RP 60503 were active in two rat models predictive of anxiolytic drug action, a modified Geller-Seifter conflict paradigm (minimal effective dose, 0.33 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 59037 and 5 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 60503) and the elevated plus maze (minimal effective dose, 0.33 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 59037 and 5 mg.kg-1 p.o. for RP 60503). Only very low activities were observed in tests of sedative or myorelaxant effects (ED50 > 50 mg.kg-1 p.o.). It is concluded that the two cyclopyrrolones possess a dissociated behavioral profile, displaying potent anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties with little or no sedative or myorelaxant effects. Although both compounds appear to be partial agonists at their allosteric recognition site on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor, RP 60503 seems to be more dissociated than RP 59037, which would be compatible with it having lower intrinsic activity. This difference is reflected in a higher receptor occupancy requirement for activity, and a smaller modulatory effect on the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphothionate.
