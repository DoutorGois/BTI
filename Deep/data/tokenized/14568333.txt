Estrogen-related changes in serotonergic neuronal transmission, including changes in the number of serotonin transporter (SERT) binding sites, have been cited as a possible cause for changes in mood, memory and sleep that occur during the menopausal transition. However, both aging and estradiol regulate SERT binding sites in the brain. The goal of this experiment was to determine how aging and estrogen interact to regulate SERT levels in the forebrain of young and reproductively senescent female Sprague-Dawley rats using [3H]paroxetine. The density of specific [3H]paroxetine binding in various brain regions was compared in young (2-4 months) and reproductively senescent (10-12 months) female rats at three times of day. In most brain regions examined, estrogen and aging independently increased the number of [3H]paroxetine binding sites. The only region that displayed a reduction in [3H]paroxetine binding with age was the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Time of day influenced [3H]paroxetine binding in the SCN and the paraventricular thalamus (PVT), two regions known to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Aging and/or estrogen also altered the pattern of binding in these regions. Thus, based on the results of this study, we conclude that aging and estrogen both act to regulate SERT binding sites in the forebrain of female rats, and that this regulation is region specific.
