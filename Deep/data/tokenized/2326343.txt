Two experiments were performed to investigate the effect of cortical lesions on the acquisition and reversal of simultaneous discriminations in turtles. The first experiment examined the effect of cortical lesions on the acquisition and reversal of a spatial discrimination. The results of the first experiment revealed that lesions of the dorsal cortex produced a deficit in spatial learning. The results of the first experiment also revealed that when damage to the dorsal cortex was accompanied by substantial damage to the medial cortex, no deficit was manifest. The second experiment examined the effects of cortical lesions on the acquisition and reversal of a brightness discrimination. The results of the second experiment revealed that damage to neither the dorsal cortex nor the medial cortex produced a deficit. It was suggested that brightness is not represented in the thalamofugal visual pathway but is instead represented in the tectofugal visual pathway in reptiles. It was also suggested that the medial cortex, which is the evolutionary precursor to the mammalian hippocampal formation, functions differently from the mammalian hippocampus.
