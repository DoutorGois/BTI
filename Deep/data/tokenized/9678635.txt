The effects of FK506, an immunosuppressant and protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin) inhibitor, on the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated in the CA1 region of mice hippocampal slices. VGCC-dependent LTP was induced either by a brief application of a potassium channel blocker tetraethyleneanmonium (TEA), or by a strong tetanic stimulation under the blockade of NMDA-receptors. FK506 (1-50 microM) produced dose-dependent inhibition on TEA-induced LTP. Cyclosporin A (CysA 50 microM), another calcineurin inhibitor, showed a similar inhibitory effect on TEA-induced LTP. FK506 (10 microM) also blocked the strong tetanus-induced LTP, but had no effect on the post-tetanic potentiation. By using a subthreshold weak tetanic stimulation protocol, we also found that low concentration of FK506 (1 microM) produced neither inhibition nor potentiation on VGCC-dependent LTP. These results showed FK506 and CysA exerted inhibitory effects on VGCC-dependent LTP, and suggest that calcineurin is involved in the processes of this kind of synaptic plasticity.
