AIM: To investigate the comparative effects of prenatal exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) functionalized with citrate and polyphenols on spatial cognition and also on nitro-oxidative stress and apoptosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum of offsprings. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pregnant Wistar rats were orally administered substances from day 10 of gestation until day 21. Six weeks postpartum, six male offsprings from each group were used for behavioral evaluation and determination of oxidative stress and apoptosis. RESULTS: Both groups exhibited hyperactivity and anxiety especially after AgNPs-Sambucus nigra L. administration. AgNPs-S. nigra L. group showed increase in induced nitric oxide synthase activity and decrease in superoxide dismutase activity and apoptosis in the hippocampus, while AgNPs-citrate coated administration exerted a moderate toxicity and induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: AgNPs functionalized with natural extracts had a lower toxicity than citrate-coated silver particles.
