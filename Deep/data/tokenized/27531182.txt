The adolescent hippocampus produces thousands more new neurons daily than the adult, yet many die within weeks of their generation (Cameron and McCay, 2001; Curlik, DiFeo & Shors, 2014; Shors et al., 2016). Learning new skills can increase their survival. The present study tested the effects of physical skill training on the survival of these newly generated cells in males and female rodents during puberty. Newly generated cells were labeled with BrdU, a marker of cell mitosis, and training began one week later, just as the new cells begin to die. Significantly more BrdU-labeled cells were present in the hippocampus of both sexes after engaging in the physical training experiences. The young animals were able to maintain their balance on a modified rotarod task throughout most trials of training and as a consequence expended considerable energy and endurance during each training trial. These data suggest that a combination of both exercise and skill training can increase brain plasticity through increases in neurogenesis in the adolescent hippocampus. This finding supports the premise behind a clinical intervention known as MAP Training, which combines mental and physical training to enhance brain health in humans (Shors et al., 2014; Alderman et al., 2016). Although theoretical at this stage, the positive consequences of MAP Training for brain function may be mediated through neurogenesis.
