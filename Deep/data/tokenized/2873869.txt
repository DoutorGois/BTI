Hippocampal CA-1 pyramidal cell damage was produced by 20 min of cerebral ischemia. Colchicine destruction of the dentate gyrus granule cells 11 days before ischemia prevented the CA-1 cell loss. It is suggested that the protective effect of degranulation on ischemic CA-1 pyramidal cell damage is due to reduction of glutamate release in CA-1 during and after ischemia.
