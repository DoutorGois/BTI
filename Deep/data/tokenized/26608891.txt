Acute leucine intoxication and neurologic deterioration can develop rapidly at any age as a result of net protein degradation precipitated by infection or psychological stress in patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). Here, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic Hyper-BCAA (H-BCAA) administration on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brains of rats. For acute administration, Wistar rats (10 and 30 days) received three injections of BCAA pool (15.8 muL/g at 1-h intervals) or saline, subcutaneously. For chronic administration, Wistar rats (7 days) received of BCAA pool or saline twice a day for 21 days, subcutaneously. Our results showed that acute administration of H-BCAA increased IL-1beta ( approximately 78%; p </= 0.009) and TNF-alpha ( approximately 155%; p </= 0.026) levels in the cerebral cortex but not in the hippocampus of infant rats. Moreover, IL-6 levels were increased in the hippocampus ( approximately 135%; p </= 0.009) and cerebral cortex ( approximately 417%; p </= 0.008), whereas IL-10 levels were decreased only in the hippocampus ( approximately 42%; p </= 0.009). However, repeated administration of H-BCAA decreased IL-1beta ( approximately 59%; p </= 0.047), IL-6 ( approximately 70%; p </= 0.009) and IFN-gamma ( approximately 70%; p </= 0.008) levels in the cerebral cortex, whereas the IL-6 ( approximately 67%; p </= 0.009), IL-10 ( approximately 58%; p </= 0.01) and IFN-gamma ( approximately 67%; p </= 0.009) levels were decreased in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that a better understanding of the inflammatory response in MSUD patients may be useful to develop therapeutic strategies to modulate the hyperinflammatory/hypoinflammatory axis.
