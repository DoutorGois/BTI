We investigated the long-term changes that occur in the gerbil brain following transient cerebral ischemia using histology and receptor autoradiography. Transient ischemia was induced for 3 and 10 min, and animals were allowed to survive for 8 months. A histological study showed that 3-min ischemia caused neuronal damage and mild atrophy only in the hippocampal CA1 sector, and that 10-min ischemia produced severe neuronal damage and marked shrinkage in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 sectors. Furthermore, severe neuronal damage was seen in the striatum after 10-min ischemia. Autoradiography study revealed that 3-min ischemia caused a significant reduction in [3H] naloxone binding in the frontal cortex, striatum, dentate gyrus, and thalamus, whereas [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H] forskolin binding was not significantly altered in all regions. In contrast, 10-min ischemia produced marked alteration in these binding sites in the striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, and substantia nigra. The alteration was especially notable in the hippocampal region and substantia nigra. These results indicate that hippocampal damage after transient ischemia, compared with that in other regions, is not static, but particularly progressive. Furthermore, they demonstrate a reduction in adenylate cyclase system in the striatum and substantia nigra after transient ischemia. Moreover, our results suggest that long-term survival after ischemia may induce synaptic modification of neurotransmitter and adenylate cyclase system in the hippocampus.
