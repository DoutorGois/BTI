Pre-aggregated non-amyloid component of alpha-synuclein, NAC(61-95), was injected bilaterally into the CA3 area of rat hippocampus and behaviour was assessed using an alternating-lever cyclic-ratio (ALCR) schedule of operant responding. Four groups of rats were used (n=6 per group), subgroups were treated orally with either ibuprofen (40mg/kg) or vehicle (10% sucrose) twice daily. Intrahippocampal injection of NAC(61-95) increased lever switching errors and numbers of activated astrocytes, and ibuprofen treatment alleviated these effects.
