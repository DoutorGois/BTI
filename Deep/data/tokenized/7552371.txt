We investigated the long-term changes in the gerbil brain following three episodes of 2-min forebrain ischemia at 1-h intervals in comparison with a 6-min period of ischemia. The animals were sacrificed after 1 month and 6 months. Following either ischemic insult, the hippocampal CA1 region showed a loss of pyramidal neurons together with a diffuse calcium accumulation as shown by alizarin red S staining. Three 2-min ischemic insults additionally produced neuronal damage in the striatum and thalamus. The thalamic damage was accompanied by an accumulation of small calcium granules after 1 month and large calcium concretions after 6 months. Calcium staining in the striatum was weak. Thus, the thalamic neuronal damage was accompanied by an active process of calcification, which has not been described in experimental cerebral ischemia models. The observations show that repeated ischemic insults produce different long-term effects in different brain regions.
