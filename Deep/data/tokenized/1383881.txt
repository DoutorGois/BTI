Previous studies have indicated that interruption of the connections between the medial septum and hippocampus by cutting the axons results in degeneration and death of the projecting septal neurons. However, in these studies cell death has been inferred primarily from the loss of immunoreactivity for transmitter-specific enzymes. In the present study, we labeled septohippocampal projection neurons by retrograde tracing and then cut their axons. Subsequent intracellular injection of prelabeled cells revealed the morphology of the soma and dendrites and allowed us to examine the ultrastructure of these neurons. A large number of septohippocampal neurons survived even 10 weeks after axotomy, suggesting that axotomized septohippocampal neurons survive for considerable periods beyond the time at which they stop expressing transmitter-specific immunoreactivity. Survival of axotomized neurons is a prerequisite for pharmacological interference aimed at reactivating transmitter expression, axonal re-growth, and the eventual reintegration into functionally relevant circuitries.
