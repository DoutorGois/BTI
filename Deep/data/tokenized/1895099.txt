The objective of these experiments was to determine whether preincubating hippocampal slices with choline provides precursor that can be used during a subsequent incubation to support or enhance the synthesis of acetylcholine (ACh). Slices were preincubated for 60 min with 0, 10, 25, or 50 microM choline, washed, resuspended, and then incubated for 10 min in choline-free buffer containing 4.74 (Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate, KRB) or 25 mM KCl. The tissue contents of ACh and choline were determined prior to and after the preincubation, as well as after the incubation; the amounts of ACh and choline released were measured, and ACh synthesis was calculated. Preincubation in the absence of choline increased the tissue content of ACh to 242% of original levels; preincubation with 10 microM choline did not lead to a further increase, but preincubation with 25 or 50 microM choline increased the ACh content to 272% of original levels, significantly greater than that of slices preincubated with either 0 or 10 microM choline. When tissues were subsequently incubated for 10 min with either KRB or 25 mM KCl, ACh release from slices preincubated with 50 microM choline was greater than from slices preincubated with 0, 10, or 25 microM choline. Incubation of slices with KRB did not alter the tissue content of ACh, but when tissues were incubated with 25 mM KCl, the ACh content of slices preincubated with 0 or 10 microM choline decreased significantly, whereas that of slices preincubated with 25 or 50 microM choline did not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
