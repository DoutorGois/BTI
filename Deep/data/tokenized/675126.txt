The effect of i.v. administration of a 10 gamma/kg b.w. and 20 gamma/kg b.w. dose of adrenaline solution and/or 5 mg/kg G. F. hydrocortisone hemisuccinate dose was studied on New Zealand, rabbits with pairs of electrode chronically implanted the LSN, AN, MSN, NDBB, dorsal hippocampus and RFM. The 10 gamma and the 20 gamma/kg b.w. dose of adrenaline cause changes in the EEG traces of the septal nuclei and the dorsal hippocampus expressed by a directly proportional increase in the frequency, and by a decrease in the mean amplitude of the background acticity inversely proportional with the adrenaline dose. Administration of the 5 mg/kg hydrocortisone hemisuccinate dose lead to similar modifications, but with lower values as compared to those obtained by administration of the 20 gamma/kg dose of adrenaline.
