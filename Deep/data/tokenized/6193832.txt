Suction lesions were made in the anterior, posterior or both halves of the right ventrolateral cortex in rats. Six days later, levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters, norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were measured in cortical and subcortical regions of lesioned rats and compared to values in sham-operated animals. NE and 5-HT were decreased in sections of ipsilateral (right) cortex including, and posterior to lesions, while 5-HIAA was increased throughout the ipsilateral cortex. Decreases in monoamines and increases in metabolites and metabolite:monoamine ratios (especially 5-HIAA:5-HT) were found in ipsilateral subcortical structures, including striatum, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain and brainstem, depending on the type of lesion. Subacutely, focal ventrolateral cortical lesions may profoundly alter the levels and utilization rates of monoamine neurotransmitters in widespread regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere.
