Orexin containing neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) produce orexin-A (hypocretin-1) and orexin-B (hypocretin-2) and send their axons to the hippocampus, which predominantly expresses orexin 1 receptors (OX1Rs) showing a higher affinity to orexin-A. Recent studies have shown that central administration of orexin-A has an effect on learning and memory but literature concerning the role of orexinergic system in cognition remains controversial. Therefore, we examined the effect of pre-training, post-training and pre-probe trial intrahippocampal CA1 administration of a selective OX1R the orexin 1 receptor antagonist SB-334867-A (1.5, 3, 6 microg/0.5 microl) on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in a single-day testing version of Morris water maze (MWM) task. Our results show that, SB-334867-A impaired acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of MWM task as compared with the control group. This drug had no effect on escape latency of a non-spatial visual discrimination task. Therefore, it seems that endogenous orexins, especially orexin-A, play an important role in spatial learning and memory in the rat.
