Localization of Na+ channel beta 1 subunit (Na beta 1) mRNA was examined in adult rat hippocampus, cerebellum and spinal cord by in situ hybridization histochemistry. In hippocampus, Na beta 1 mRNA was strongly expressed by CA3 followed by CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells. In cerebellum, strong Na beta 1 mRNA expression was observed in Purkinje cells and moderate expression in granule cells and scattered cells of the molecular layer. In spinal cord, neurons in gray matter exhibited moderate to strong expression of Na beta 1 mRNA. These results provide the first localization study of Na beta 1 mRNA in the CNS, demonstrating a differential expression in different neurons.
