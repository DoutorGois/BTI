Bath application of 10(-5) M myelin basic protein (MBP) to various types of cultured nerve cells resulted in a membrane depolarization amounting to a change of 41 +/- 15 mV. Excitability could be restored by repolarizing the membrane by means of current injection through the recording electrode. The action of MBP persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), Co2+ or D-600 as well as in low Na+ and low Cl- solutions, whereas it was abolished by increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The action MBP was mimicked by ouabain. We propose that the effect of the protein might be generated by blockade of an ion pump. It is speculated that MBP may exert a direct effect on neuronal membranes in demyelinating diseases.
