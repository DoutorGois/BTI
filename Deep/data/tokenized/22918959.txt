Methylmercury (MeHg) is an environmental contaminant with recognized neurotoxic effects, particularly to the developing nervous system. In the present study, we show that nanomolar concentrations of MeHg can induce long-lasting effects in neural stem cells (NSCs). We investigated short-term direct and long-term inherited effects of exposure to MeHg (2.5 or 5.0 nM) using primary cultures of rat embryonic cortical NSCs. We found that MeHg had no adverse effect on cell viability but reduced NSC proliferation and altered the expression of cell cycle regulators (p16 and p21) and senescence-associated markers. In addition, we demonstrated a decrease in global DNA methylation in the exposed cells, indicating that epigenetic changes may be involved in the mechanisms underlying the MeHg-induced effects. These changes were observed in cells directly exposed to MeHg (parent cells) and in their daughter cells cultured under MeHg-free conditions. In agreement with our in vitro data, a trend was found for decreased cell proliferation in the subgranular zone in the hippocampi of adult mice exposed to low doses of MeHg during the perinatal period. Interestingly, this impaired proliferation had a measurable impact on the total number of neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Importantly, this effect could be reversed by chronic antidepressant treatment. Our study provides novel evidence for programming effects induced by MeHg in NSCs and supports the idea that developmental exposure to low levels of MeHg may result in long-term consequences predisposing to neurodevelopmental disorders and/or neurodegeneration.
