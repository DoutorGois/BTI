A regulatable retroviral vector in which the v-myc oncogene is driven by a tetracycline-controlled transactivator and a human cytomegalovirus minimal promoter fused to a tet operator sequence was used for conditional immortalization of adult rat neuronal progenitor cells. A single clone, HC2S2, was isolated and characterized. Two days after the addition of tetracycline, the HC2S2 cells stopped proliferating, began to extend neurites, and expressed the neuronal markers tau, NeuN, neurofilament 200 kDa, and glutamic acid decarboxylase in accordance with the reduced production of the v-myc oncoprotein. Differentiated HC2S2 cells expressed large sodium and calcium currents and could fire regenerative action potentials. These results suggest that the suppression of the v-myc oncogene may be sufficient to make proliferating cells exit from cell cycles and induce terminal differentiation. The HC2S2 cells will be valuable for studying the differentiation process of neurons.
