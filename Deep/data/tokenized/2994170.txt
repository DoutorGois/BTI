X-Irradiation of rat hippocampus in vitro with low doses accelerated spontaneous impulse passage without concomitant changes in synaptic activity. There was a negative correlation between the original frequency of neuron discharges and the degree of quickening the impulses in response to the effect of radiation. Perfusion of slices by a noncalcium solution blocked the synaptic transmission but did not influence the response to the effect of ionizing radiation.
