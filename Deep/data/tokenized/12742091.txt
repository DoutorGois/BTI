The major part of hippocampal innervation is glutamatergic, regulated by inhibitory GABA-releasing interneurons. The modulation of [(3)H]GABA release by ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors and by nitric oxide was here characterized in superfused mouse hippocampal slices. The ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate potentiated the basal GABA release. These effects were blocked by their respective antagonists 6-nitro-7-cyanoquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), dizocilpine and 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo(f)quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX), indicating receptor-mediated mechanisms. The NO-generating compounds S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), sodiumnitroprusside and hydroxylamine enhanced the basal GABA release. Particularly the sodiumnitroprusside-evoked release was attenuated by the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) and the inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), indicating the involvement of the NO/cGMP pathway. This inference is corroborated by the enhancing effect of zaprinast, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, which is known to increase cGMP levels. The K(+)-stimulated hippocampal GABA release was reduced by the groups I and III agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylate (t-ACPD) and L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (L-AP4), which effects were abolished by their respective antagonists (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylate (AIDA) and (RS)-2-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG), again indicating modification by receptor-mediated mechanisms.
