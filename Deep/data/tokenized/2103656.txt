Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia are the two main diseases entirely different from each other producing almost the same abnormalities as dementia syndrome. With magnetic resonance imaging, severe atrophy of amygdala and hippocampus in both Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia was observed. There was no essential difference on the atrophic findings between Alzheimer's disease and multi-infarct dementia. This result therefore suggest that the quantitative measurement of amygdaloid and hippocampal atrophy predicts dementia.
