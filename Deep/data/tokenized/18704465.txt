We investigated the changes in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and its receptor, VEGFR-3, in the rat hippocampus following transient forebrain ischemia. The expression profiles of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were very similar in the control hippocampi, where both genes were constitutively expressed in neurons in the pyramidal cell and granule cell layers. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of VEGF-C was similar to that of VEGFR-3 in the ischemic hippocampus, and in the CA1 and dentate hilar regions both VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 were strongly expressed in activated glial cells rather than in neurons. Most of the activated glial cells expressing both genes were reactive astrocytes, although some were a subpopulation of brain macrophages. In the dentate gyrus, however, VEGFR-3 expression was transiently increased in the innermost layer of granule cells on days 7-10 after reperfusion, coinciding with an increase in polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule staining--a marker for immature neurons. These data suggest that VEGF-C may be involved in glial reaction via paracrine or autocrine mechanisms in the ischemic brain and may carry out specific roles in adult hippocampal neurogenesis during ischemic insults.
