Recent advances in electrophysiological techniques have created new tools for the acquisition and storage of neuronal activity recorded simultaneously with numerous electrodes. These techniques support the analysis of the function as well as the structure of individual electrogenic cells in the context of surrounding neuronal or cardiac network. Commercially available tools for the analysis of such data, however, cannot be easily adapted to newly emerging requirements for data analysis and visualization, and cross compatibility between them is limited. In this report we introduce a free open source toolbox called microelectrode array tools (MEA-Tools) for the analysis of multi-electrode data based on the common data analysis environment MATLAB (version 5.3-6.1, The Mathworks, Natick, MA). The toolbox itself is platform independent. The file interface currently supports files recorded with MCRack (Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) under Microsoft Windows 95, 98, NT, and 2000, but can be adapted to other data acquisition systems. Functions are controlled via command line input and graphical user interfaces, and support common requirements for the analysis of local field potentials, extracellular spike activity, and continuous recordings, in addition to supplementary data acquired by additional instruments, e.g. intracellular amplifiers. Data may be processed as continuous recordings or time windows triggered to some event.
