The advance of neuroimaging techniques has resulted in a burgeoning of studies reporting abnormalities in brain structure and function in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Measurement of hippocampal volume has developed as a useful tool in the study of neuropsychiatric disorders. We reviewed the literature and selected all English-language, human subject, data-driven papers on hippocampal volumetry, yielding a database of 423 records. From this database, the methodology of all original manual tracing protocols were studied. These protocols differed in a number of important factors for accurate hippocampal volume determination including magnetic field strength, the number of slices assessed and the thickness of slices, hippocampal orientation correction, volumetric correction, software used, inter-rater reliability, and anatomical boundaries of the hippocampus. The findings are discussed in relation to optimizing determination of hippocampal volume.
