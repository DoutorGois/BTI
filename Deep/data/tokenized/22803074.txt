We studied the effects of single treatment with ladasten (50 mg/kg) on the content of effector kinases of the mitogen-activated cascade (ERK1/ERK2), pERK1/ERK2 activity (Thr202/Tyr204), and expression of genes for neurotrophic factors BDND and NGF in the striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus of rats.
