With the goal of better understanding the function and regulation of the different members of the VEGF family this study reports mapping of vegf, vegf-b and vegf-c mRNA expression in developing and adult mice. On embryonic day 14 (E14) there is a high expression of vegf and vegf-b, vegf-b being exceptionally high in heart and CNS. The vegf-c expression is lower with distinct signals in CNS and heart. Prior to birth (E17), vegf and vegf-b expression is moderately downregulated. Overlapping expression is present in intrascapular fat and heart. vegf dominates in thyroid and lung, while vegf-b appears to be the only VEGF member expressed at detectable levels in the CNS. In young adult mouse vegf and vegf-b show partly overlapping expression patterns particularly in kidney, heart and in the thymus, vegf displays higher levels in lung and liver, vegf-b appears to be dominating in brain, heart, testis and kidney. In brain the highest levels of vegf-b is present in the hippocampus. No vegf-c mRNA expression could be detected in the adult. Taken together, these results illustrate, in detail, the different regulations of the members of the VEGF gene family. There are at present at least three specific effectors of vascular proliferation with clear differences in their expression.
