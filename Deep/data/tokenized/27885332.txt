The longevity gene klotho has numerous physiological functions, such as regulating calcium and phosphorus levels, delaying senescence, improving cognition, reducing oxidative stress, and protecting vascular endothelial cells. This study tested whether 2,3,5,4'-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (THSG), a small molecule with antiaging effects, regulates the expression and physiological effects of klotho. Our results showed that THSG dose-dependently increased the luciferase reporter activity of the klotho gene, reversed the decrease in mRNA and protein expression of klotho which was induced by angiotensin II in NRK-52E renal tubular epithelial cells, and increased klotho mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, testis, and kidney medulla of spontaneously hypertensive rats. THSG also reduced the number of senescent cells induced by angiotensin II and improved the antioxidant capacity and enhanced the bone strength in vivo. Based on klotho's role in promoting cognition, regulating bone metabolism, and improving renal function, the effect of THSG on klotho expression will be beneficial to the functional improvement or enhancement of the expressed organs or tissues.
