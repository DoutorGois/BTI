Microregional oxygenation and blood flow were measured in rat cerebral cortical lamina, subcortical white matter and hippocampus. This was done to examine relationships between oxygenation and blood flow at a local level, to determine effects of craniotomy, and to consider whether flow/oxygenation relationships might be predictive of selective vulnerability known to accompany anoxia or ischemia. Blood flow and oxygen tension were measured with closely apposed polarographic microelectrodes. Oxygen tension was highest in white matter, lower in the region of cortical laminae IV-V and lowest in the hippocampus. Blood flow in the hippocampus was higher than that in white matter or laminae IV-V of cerebral cortex. Ratios of blood flow to oxygenation were similar throughout the cortex, higher in white matter but oxygenation in hippocampus was significantly less than expected from measurement of hippocampal blood flow reflecting increased oxygen consumption or relative hypoxia due to increased diffusion distances for oxygen in hippocampus. Comparison of data from closed vs opened skull animals indicated that diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen influenced data to approximately 1000 micron below the cerebral surface.
