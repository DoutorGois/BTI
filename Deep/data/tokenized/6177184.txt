Electroconvulsive shock was evoked by transcorneal electric current (50 Hz, 50 mA; 3 times by 0.2s with 10-min pauses) in 10-day and 20-day old rats. 2 hours after the end of the convulsions, the total cytoplasmic RNA and protein content per cell in CA3 hippocampal neurons has been shown cytospectrophotometrically to increase markedly in 10-day old rats without statistically significant changes in 20-day old animals. No changes in the RNA and protein content were found in perineuronal neuroglia cells in the CA3 hippocampus in both age groups of rats. Morphometric determinations revealed a pronounced augmentation of volumes of the hippocampal neuronal bodies, nuclei, and cytoplasm as well as of nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio in 10-day old rats under effect of electroconvulsive shock. In 20-day old rats, the shock led to less marked increase in volumes of the hippocampal neurons, with no changes in nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio.
