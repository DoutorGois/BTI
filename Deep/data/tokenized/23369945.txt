Aggregation and neurotoxicity of misfolded alpha-synuclein (alphaSyn) are crucial mechanisms for progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of alphaSyn caused by oxidative stress, including modification by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE-alphaSyn), nitration (n-alphaSyn), and oxidation (o-alphaSyn), have been implicated to promote oligomerization of alphaSyn. However, it is yet unclear if these PTMs lead to different types of oligomeric intermediates. Moreover, little is known about which PTM-derived alphaSyn species exerts toxicity to dopaminergic cells. In this study, we directly compared aggregation characteristics of HNE-alphaSyn, n-alphaSyn, and o-alphaSyn. Generally, all of them promoted alphaSyn oligomerization. Particularly, HNE-alphaSyn and n-alphaSyn were more prone to forming oligomers than unmodified alphaSyn. Moreover, these PTMs prevented the formation of amyloid-like fibrils, although HNE-alphaSyn and o-alphaSyn were able to generate protofibrillar structures. The cellular effects associated with distinct PTMs were studied by exposing modified alphaSyn to dopaminergic Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) neurons. The cellular toxicity of HNE-alphaSyn was significantly higher than other PTM species. Furthermore, we tested the toxicity of HNE-alphaSyn in dopaminergic LUHMES cells and other cell types with low tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, and additionally analyzed the loss of TH-immunoreactive cells in HNE-alphaSyn-treated LUHMES cells. We observed a selective toxicity of HNE-alphaSyn to neurons with higher TH expression. Further mechanistic studies showed that HNE-modification apparently increased the interaction of extracellular alphaSyn with neurons. Moreover, exposure of differentiated LUHMES cells to HNE-alphaSyn triggered the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, preceding neuronal cell death. Antioxidant treatment effectively protected cells from the damage triggered by HNE-alphaSyn. Our findings suggest a specific pathological effect of HNE-alphaSyn on dopaminergic neurons.
