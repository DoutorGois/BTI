Bilateral infusion of CNQX (0.5 microgram) into the amygdala and the dorsal hippocampus prior to a retention test blocked the expression of step-down inhibitory avoidance in rats 6, 13, or 20 days after training. Retention test performance recovered 90 min after the infusions. Pretest intrahippocampal CNQX (0.5 microgram) blocked the expression of habituation to a novel environment measured 20 days after training. The data suggest that memory expression depends on non-NMDA receptor-mediated mechanisms, perhaps the expression of LTP, up to at least 20 days after acquisition. These mechanisms operate in the hippocampus in both tasks and in the amygdala in the avoidance task.
