The development of addiction is associated with a dysregulation of glutamatergic transmission in the brain reward circuit. alpha isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (alphaCaMKII) is one of the key proteins that regulates structural and functional plasticity of glutamatergic synapses. alphaCaMKII activity can be controlled by the autophosphorylation of threonine 286. The role of this autophosphorylation in the regulation of addiction-related behaviors has been proposed but is still poorly understood. Here, using alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation-deficient mutant mice (T286A), we show that, in comparison with wild-type animals, they are less resistant to high doses of alcohol and do not show psychostimulant response neither to alcohol injections nor during voluntary alcohol drinking. T286A mutants are also less prone to develop alcohol addiction-related behaviors including an increased motivation for alcohol, persistent alcohol seeking during withdrawal and alcohol consumption on relapse. Finally, we demonstrate that alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation regulates also alcohol-induced remodeling of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and amygdala. In conclusion, our data suggest that alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation-dependent remodeling of glutamatergic synapses is a plausible mechanism for the regulation of the alcohol addiction-related behaviors.
