In rat hippocampal pyramidal cells tested in situ by iontophoresis of several neurotransmitters, ethanol significantly enhanced excitatory responses to acetylcholine and inhibitory responses to somatostatin-14 but had no statistically significant effect on excitatory responses to glutamate or inhibitory responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid or, in preliminary tests, to norepinephrine or serotonin. The effects of ethanol on responses to acetylcholine and somatostatin-14 may provide insight into synaptic mechanisms underlying the behavioral consequences of ethanol intoxication.
