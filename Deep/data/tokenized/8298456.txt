N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits were characterized with seven polyclonal antibodies. The antibodies were directed against NR1-A, NR2A-N1, and NR2C-N1, representing N-terminal sequences of the NR1, NR2A, and NR2C subunits, and against NR1-E, NR2A-C1, and NR2C-C1, derived from C-terminal sequences of these subunits. The anti-NR1-D antibody was raised against the putative internal loop of NR1. A size of 118 kDa was found in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for NR1 (from rat brain) detected by anti-NR1-D and -NR1-E, but not anti-NR1-A. With the anti-NR1-A antibody, a 125-kDa protein was discovered that may represent a glutamate receptor not yet characterized. NR2A and NR2C were identified as proteins with sizes of 175 and 140 kDa, respectively. Enzymatic N-deglycosylation generated a 97-kDa protein from NR1, a 105-kDa protein from the 125-kDa protein, a 162-kDa protein from NR2A, and a 127-kDa protein from NR2C. In contrast to the deglycosylation product of the NR2A, the 97- and 127-kDa proteins derived from NR1 and NR2C, respectively, were found significantly smaller than the molecular masses of 103 and 141 kDa, respectively, predicted on the basis of DNA data. These products may represent truncated proteins. The tissue content of the NR1 and NR2A was high in bovine hippocampus and cortex but lower in the cerebellum. In contrast, NR2C was solely found in the cerebellum. The 125-kDa protein was highest in the cerebellum and cortex.
