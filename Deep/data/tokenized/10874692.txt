We studied the temporal changes in expression of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS) mRNA in the hippocampus of rats treated with kainic acid by use of in situ hybridization technique. Intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg kg-1 kainic acid decreased expression of nNOS mRNAs in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the hippocampus at 3 h and 8 h and increased it in the dentate gyrus and CA1 at one week after treatment. Although our previous study indicated that administration of kainic acid increased NO generation in the rat hippocampus, present results suggest that the injection of kainic acid results in differential regulation of nNOS mRNA and NO formation in the rat hippocampus.
