Chronic exposure to CP55,940 produced a significant down-regulation of cannabinoid receptors in the striatum, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of rat brain. At 24 h after SR141716-precipitated withdrawal, we observed a tendency to return to basal levels in the striatum and cortex, whereas the specific binding remained lower in the hippocampus and cerebellum. When we surveyed cannabinoid receptor-activated G proteins, in chronic CP55,940-treated rats the guanosine 5'-O:-(3-[(35)S]thiotriphosphate) ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding assay revealed a decrease of activated G proteins in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus, whereas no significant changes were seen in the cerebellum. At 24 h after the SR141716-precipitated withdrawal, [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding increased compared with that of rats chronically exposed to CP55,940, attaining the control level except for cerebellum, where we observed a trend to overcome the control amounts. Concerning the cyclic AMP (cAMP) cascade, which represents the major intracellular signaling pathway activated by cannabinoid receptors, in the cerebral areas from rats chronically exposed to CP55,940 we found alteration in neither cAMP levels nor protein kinase A activity. In the brain regions taken from CP55, 940-withdrawn rats, we only observed a significant up-regulation in the cerebellum. Our findings suggest that receptor desensitization and down-regulation are strictly involved in the development of cannabinoid tolerance, whereas alterations in the cAMP cascade in the cerebellum could be relevant in the mediation of the motor component of cannabinoid abstinence.
