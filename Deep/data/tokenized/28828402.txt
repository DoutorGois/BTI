Prior studies have found that dopamine (DA), acting at D4 receptors, and neuregulin (NRG), likely acting at ErbB4 receptors, are involved in a form of depotentiation of long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses in the hippocampus. Furthermore, DA and NRG actions are intertwined in that NRG induces DA release. We previously found that low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of temperoammonic (TA) inputs to area CA1 also depotentiates previously established SC LTP through a complex signaling pathway involving endocannabinoids, GABA, adenosine, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), but not glutamate. In the present studies, we found that TA-induced SC depotentiation in hippocampal slices from Sprague-Dawley albino rats also involves activation of both D4 receptors and NRG-activated ErbB receptors, but that the roles of these two modulator systems are independent with D4 receptor antagonism failing to alter chemical depotentiation by NRG1beta. Furthermore, a selective D4 receptor agonist was unable to depotentiate SC LTP when administered alone, suggesting that D4 receptor activation is necessary but not sufficient for TA-induced SC depotentiation. Chemical depotentiation by NRG1beta was inhibited by a Pan-ErbB antagonist and by picrotoxin (PTX), an antagonist of GABA-A receptors (GABAARs), indicating that NRG likely promotes SC depotentiation via effects on GABA and interneurons. These findings have implications for understanding the role of DA and NRG in cognitive dysfunction associated with neuropsychiatric illnesses.
