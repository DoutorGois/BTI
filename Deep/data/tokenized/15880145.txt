Whole-cell currents in cultured hippocampal neurons were recorded to investigate the effects of SO-3, a new O-superfamily conopeptide derived from Conus striatus, on voltage-sensitive channels. SO-3 had no effect on voltage-sensitive sodium currents, delayed rectifier potassium currents, and transient outward potassium currents. Similar to the selective N-type calcium channel blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIA (MVIIA), SO-3 could concentration-dependently inhibit the high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents (I(Ca)). MVIIA(3 microM), 10 microM nimodipine, and 0.5 microM omega-agatoxin IVA (Aga) could selectively block the N-, L-, and P/Q-type I(Ca), which contributed approximately 32, approximately 38, and approximately 21% of the HVA currents in hippocampal neurons, respectively. About 31% of the total HVA currents were inhibited by 3 microM SO-3. SO-3 (3 microM) and 3 microM MVIIA inhibited the overlapping components of HVA currents, whereas no overlapping component was inhibited by 3 microM SO-3 and 10 microM nimodipine, or by 3 microM SO-3 and 0.5 microM Aga. Also, 3 microM SO-3 had no effect on R-type currents. SO-3 had less inhibitory effects on non-N-type HVA currents than MVIIA at higher concentrations (30 and 100 microM). The inhibitory effects of SO-3 and MVIIA on HVA currents were almost fully reversible. However, the recovery from block by MVIIA was more rapid than recovery from block by SO-3. It is concluded that SO-3 is a new omega-conotoxin selectively targeting N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Considering the significance of N-type calcium channels for pain transduction, SO-3 may have therapeutic potential as a novel analgesic agent.
