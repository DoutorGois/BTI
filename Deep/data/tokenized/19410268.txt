OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of age, sex, and b value on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in brain areas affected by neurodegenerative diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied the ADC of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum and of the hippocampus in normal patients using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) with b1,000 s/mm2 and b3,000 s/mm2. We calculated the differences between the ADC (diffusion differential [DD]) with b1,000 and with b3,000 for each region. Patients were classified into the following age groups (<or=30 years old, 31-60 years old, >60 years old). We used a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and the Bonferroni correction to analyze the differences in ADC and DD between age groups and between sexes. Pearson's chi-square test was used to correlate the ADC and DD with age. RESULTS: In the right hippocampus, we observed differences in ADC (b1,000, p=0.011; b3,000, p=0.024) and DD (p=0.006) with age. Differences in ADC were observed between the 31-60 year-old age group and the >60 year-old age group (p=0.009) for b1,000, and between the<30 year-old age group and the 31-60 year-old age group (p=0.036) for b3,000. The DD in the >60 year-old age group was different from the rest. In the corpus callosum, there were significant differences between sexes in the DD of the genu (p=0.016). The DD was correlated with age in the right hippocampus (r=0.321, p=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate greater stability in mean ADC values with b3000 during aging. It might be useful to analyze the ADC with a higher b in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.
