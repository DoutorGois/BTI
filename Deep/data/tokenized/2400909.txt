Extracellular recordings were made from isolated hippocampal slices, CA1 area, following withdrawal from chronic ethanol administration to mice of the C57 strain. The field potentials were followed for 7 h from preparation of the slices, in the absence of ethanol. Paired pulse potentiation was increased, and paired pulse inhibition decreased, in slices from ethanol-treated mice during the first four hours of the recording period. Orthodromic thresholds for elicitation of single and multiple population spikes were decreased by the ethanol treatment, in the later part of the recording period. The input/output curves for population spike area and population excitatory postsynaptic potential slope showed a shift to the left for the slices from ethanol-treated animals, but no change in the maximal response. Antidromic stimulation also demonstrated decreases in thresholds for single and multiple population spikes in tissues from ethanol-treated animals, during the later half of the recording period. The results indicate that there are several mechanisms by which neuronal excitability increases on withdrawal from chronic ethanol treatment. The changes follow different time courses and suggest multiple mechanisms underlying the behavioural signs seen during the ethanol withdrawal syndrome.
