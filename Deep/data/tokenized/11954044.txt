In a previous study, our laboratory demonstrated that the intraventricular infusion of nerve growth factor (NGF) accelerated kindling rates and enhanced mossy fiber sprouting in the absence of noticeable kindling-associated neuronal loss. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether these NGF effects were mediated via the cholinergic system. This study evaluated the effects of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine and the cholinergic antagonist scopolamine on kindling rates and kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting in adult rats. The results showed that pilocarpine accelerated kindling rates and enhanced kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, whereas scopolamine retarded kindling rates and blocked kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting in the CA3 and IML regions. These findings suggest that the cholinergic system may contribute to the long-term structural and functional alterations that are characteristic of the kindled state. Moreover, these data provide support for the hypothesis that NGF infusions may mediate kindling and kindling-induced mossy fiber sprouting via regulation of the cholinergic system.
