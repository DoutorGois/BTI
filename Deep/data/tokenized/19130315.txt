The activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is modulated by the norepinephrinergic system and, in females, also by the ovarian hormones. We investigated the role of ovarian steroids and the locus coeruleus (LC) on stress-induced corticosterone secretion in female rats. Ovariectomized rats without hormonal replacement (OVX) or treated with estradiol (OVE) or estradiol plus progesterone (OVEP) were subjected to jugular cannulation. Immediately after that, each hormonal treatment group was subjected to LC lesion or sham surgery or no brain surgery. After 24 h, blood samples of all 9 groups were collected before and after ether inhalation. Other four groups (OVX control, sham and lesioned, and OVE) were perfused for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) immunocytochemistry in hippocampal CA1 neurons and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Estradiol replacement decreased while LC lesions increased stress-induced corticosterone secretion. The effect of LC lesion was potentiated with the removal of ovarian steroids. Since GR expression of lesioned animals decreased in the hippocampus, but not in PVN, we suggest that the effect of LC lesion on corticosterone secretion could be due to a reduction in the efficiency of the negative feedback system in the CA1 neurons. However, this mechanism is not involved in the estradiol modulation on corticosteroid secretion, as no change in GR expression was observed in estradiol-treated animals.
