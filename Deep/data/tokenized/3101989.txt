Incorporation of methionine into brain proteins has been measured by quantitative autoradiography after desmethylimipramine administration in rats. Acute treatment decreased protein synthesis in three regions: hippocampus, hypothalamus and habenula. After chronic treatment the decrease extended to four other regions: substantia nigra, raphe dorsalis, trigeminal nerve and hypophysis. An opposite effect was observed in the retrosplenial cortex.
