Glycine caused a concentration-dependent evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine from rat hippocampal brain slices. Other amino acids evoked [3H]norepinephrine release with a rank order of potency: L-serine greater than or equal to glycine greater than beta-alanine greater than D-serine. Strychnine inhibited [3H]norepinephrine release evoked by both glycine and L-serine, but was less effective in inhibiting the release evoked by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and kainic acid. Inhibitors of the NMDA receptor/ionophore complex, MK-801, CPP and Mg++, as well as the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor antagonist, HA-966, caused an incomplete inhibition (maximum approximately 60%) of glycine-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release. The potencies with which MK-801, CPP and Mg++ inhibited glycine- and NMDA-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release were very similar. The combination of MK-801 plus kynurenic acid, a nonselective glutamate receptor antagonist, caused no greater inhibition of glycine-evoked release than MK-801, alone. omega-Conotoxin GVIA, an inhibitor of neuronal L- and N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, inhibited glycine-evoked [3H]norepinephrine release by approximately 50%, whereas the L-channel inhibitor PN 200-110 had no significant effect. The combination of MK-801 plus omega-conotoxin GVIA caused only a slightly greater inhibition (P greater than .05) of glycine-evoked release than MK-801 alone. Tetrodotoxin inhibited glycine-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine by approximately 75%. The inhibitory effects of tetrodotoxin and omega-conotoxin GVIA suggest that voltage-sensitive sodium channels and N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels are important mediators of glycine-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
