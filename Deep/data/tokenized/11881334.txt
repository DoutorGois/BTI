The unitary postsynaptic mechanism underlying the influence of diverse neuromodulators on modification of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to granule, pyramidal and inhibitory hippocampal cells is suggested. According to this mechanism, the effect of dopamine, adenosine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin, somatostatin, galanin, opioids, cannabinoids, neuropeptide Y on postsynaptic receptors, bound to Gi/0 proteins, should promote LTD of excitatory inputs and LTP of inhibitory inputs. The effect of dopamine, adenosine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, serotonin, vasopressin, tachykinin, histamine on postsynaptic receptors, bound to Gs and Gq/11 proteins, should oppositively modulate the same inputs. Only synaptically activated excitatory and inhibitory inputs can by influenced by neuromodulators. The character of neuromodulatory influence on modification of hippocampal synaptic efficacy, implying from the suggested mechanism is in accordance with known experimental data.
