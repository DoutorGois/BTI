PURPOSE: When central nervous system axons are injured, regeneration is partly inhibited by myelin-associated inhibitors (MAIs). Following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the rat, pharmacological neutralisation of the MAIs Nogo-A and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) resulted in improved functional outcome. In contrast, genetic or pharmacological neutralization of the MAI receptors Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NgR1) or paired-immunoglobulin like receptor-B (PirB) showed an unaltered or impaired outcome following TBI in mice. The aim of the present study was thus to evaluate the MAI expression levels following TBI in mice. METHODS: Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure total RNA isolated from brains of young adult male C57BL/6 mice at one, three or seven days following controlled cortical impact TBI or sham injury. Hippocampal and neocortical tissue ipsi- and contralateral to the injury was analyzed for Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), MAG, and the MAI receptors PirB and NgR1, including its co-receptor Lingo1. RESULTS: Compared to sham-injured controls, PirB neocortical expression was significantly upregulated at one day and NgR1 expression downregulated at seven days post-TBI. In the hippocampus, transcriptional upregulation was observed in Nogo-A (one day post-injury), MAG and PirB at seven days post-injury. In contrast, the hippocampal transcripts of NgR1 and Lingo1 were decreased at seven days post-injury. The expression of OMgp was unaltered at all time points post-injury. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that early dynamic changes in MAI gene expression occur following TBI in the mouse, particularly in the hippocampus, which may play an inhibitory role for post-injury regeneration and plasticity.
