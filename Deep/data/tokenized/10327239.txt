Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have been implicated in long-term potentiation and in learning and memory formation. In this study, we tested the effects of group I mGluR inhibition on synaptic plasticity and learning of rats at different levels of organization (1) in the hippocampal slice preparation; (2) in freely moving animals implanted with chronic hippocampal electrodes; and (3) in different spatial learning paradigms. To allow a direct comparison of the effects obtained the same doses were used in all paradigms. Bath-application of the selective group I mGluR antagonist (S)4-carboxyphenylglycine (4-CPG) impaired a decremental long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a weak tetanization paradigm, but failed to affect a robust LTP generated by strong tetanization. In contrast, 4-CPG impaired a robust LTP in freely moving animals if applied 30 min before tetanization. The same dose of 4-CPG only impeded spatial learning mildly in the eight-arm radial maze and had no effect on a simple configuration of the Y-maze spatial alternation task. In the more difficult configuration of this task, however, 4-CPG caused complete amnesia. The lack of state-dependent 4-CPG actions and the absence of any 4-CPG effects in the open-field test classify the obtained retention deficit as a selective impairment of memory storage. Our results indicate a specific role of group I mGluRs in certain types of synaptic plasticity and of spatial learning.
