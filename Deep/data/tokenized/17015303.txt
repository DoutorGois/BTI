Iron is a central element in the metabolism of normal and malignant cells. Abnormalities in iron and ferritin expression have been observed in many types of cancer. Interest in characterizing iron compounds in the human brain has increased due to advances in determining a relationship between excess iron accumulation and neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, four different magnetic methods have been employed to characterize the iron phases and magnetic properties of brain tumour (meningiomas) tissues and non-tumour hippocampal tissues. Four main magnetic components can be distinguished: the diamagnetic matrix, nearly paramagnetic blood, antiferromagnetic ferrihydrite cores of ferritin and ferrimagnetic magnetite and/or maghemite. For the first time, open hysteresis loops have been observed on human brain tissue at room temperature. The hysteresis properties indicate the presence of magnetite and/or maghemite particles that exhibit stable single-domain (SD) behaviour at room temperature. A significantly higher concentration of magnetically ordered magnetite and/or maghemite and a higher estimated concentration of heme iron was found in the meningioma samples. First-order reversal curve diagrams on meningioma tissue further show that the stable SD particles are magnetostatically interacting, implying high-local concentrations (clustering) of these particles in brain tumours. These findings suggest that brain tumour tissue contains an elevated amount of remanent iron oxide phases.
