In partially restrained but awake and undrugged rats, excitatory unit responses of the somatic cortex barrel field to vibrissal stimulation, were recorded in two conditions: during spontaneous episodes of theta and in the absence of this rhythm. Two main variables were considered: a signal-to-noise ratio and an index of the "afferent inhibition". Both measures were extracted from peristimulus time histograms. "Theta effects" were characterized by an increase in signal-to-noise ratio and afferent inhibition. They were most important in neurons located in infragranular layers of the cortex; they went in the same direction but only approached significance in supragranular neurons; neurons of the granular layer were not affected. Spontaneous unit activity and latencies were not modified in any group. These data were obtained during a preliminary step of a sensory-sensory conditioning procedure which in some cases modified the receptive field of the neurons. Theta effects were less marked in future "conditioned" than in future non-conditioned neurons but this was probably due to the fact that conditioned neurons had significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio and afferent inhibition. The origin of these "theta effects", hippocampal versus non-hippocampal, and their functional significance, relation to selective attention, are discussed.
