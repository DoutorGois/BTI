Progesterone displays a strong potential for the treatment of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy since it has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of the central nervous system injuries in adult animals. Here, we evaluated the effects of the administration of progesterone (10 mg/kg) in seven-days-old male Wistar rats submitted to neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Progesterone was administered immediately before ischemia and/or 6 and 24 h after the onset of hypoxia. The body weight of the animals, the volume of brain lesion and the expression of p-Akt and procaspase-3 in the hippocampus were evaluated. All animals submitted to HI showed a reduction in the body weight. However, this reduction was more remarkable in those animals which received progesterone before surgery. Administration of progesterone was unable to reduce the volume of brain damage caused by HI. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the expression of p-Akt and procaspase-3 in animals submitted to HI and treated with either progesterone or vehicle. In summary, progesterone did not show a neuroprotective effect on the volume of brain lesion in neonatal rats submitted to hypoxia-ischemia. Furthermore, progesterone was unable to modulate p-Akt and procaspase-3 signaling pathways, which may explain the absence of neuroprotection. On the other hand, it seems that administration of progesterone before ischemia exerts some systemic effect, leading to a remarkable reduction in the body weight.
