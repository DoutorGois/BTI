The effects of damage to the dorsal and medial cortex of turtles were investigated in two experiments. In the first, damage to the dorsal cortex disrupted acquisition and reversal of a go-no-go discrimination but had no effect on retention of the discrimination if it had been learned preoperatively. Medial cortex damage had no effect. In the second experiment, dorsal cortex damage impaired acquisition, but not extinction or reacquisition, of a discrete-trial keypress. Again, medial cortex damage had no effect. The results suggest that the dorsal cortex is involved in learning in turtles.
