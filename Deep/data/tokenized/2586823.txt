Intracellular recording techniques were used to assess the effect of chronic estrogen treatment of ovariectomized (OVX) rats on CA1 pyramidal cell properties and serotonin (5-HT)-mediated responses in the dorsal hippocampus. The magnitude of the 5-HT1A-mediated hyperpolarization and concomitant change in membrane resistance elicited by 15 microM 5-HT was greater in pyramidal cells from OVX rats treated with estrogen (OVX + ES) than in pyramidal cells from OVX rats. Estrogen treatment did not alter the cellular membrane properties or the reduction in AHP amplitude elicited by 15 microM 5-HT. The modulation of 5-HT neurotransmission by estrogen may contribute to variations in mood which are associated with the menstrual cycle.
