The distribution of galanin mRNA-expressing cells and galanin-immunoreactive (IR) cell bodies and processes was studied in the brain of mice overexpressing galanin under the PDGF-B promoter (GalOE mice) and of wild type (WT) mice, both in colchicine-treated and non-treated animals. A widespread ectopic expression of galanin (both mRNA and peptide) was found, that is when neither transcript nor peptide could be seen in WT mice, not even after colchicine treatment. However, in some regions, such as claustrum, basolateral amygdala, thalamus, CA1 pyramidal cells, and Purkinje cells only galanin mRNA could be detected. The highest levels of galanin expression were observed in the forebrain structures (the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, throughout the cortex, granular and pyramidal cell layers of the hippocampus), in the mesencephalon (nucleus ruber), in the cerebellum (lateral cerebellar nucleus), in the pons (sensory and motor nuclei of the trigeminal nerve), within the medulla oblongata (facial, prepositus and spinal trigeminal nuclei). High densities of galanin-IR fibers were found in the axonal terminals of the lateral olfactory tract, hippocampal and presumably cerebellar mossy fiber system, in several thalamic and hypothalamic regions and the lower brain stem.
