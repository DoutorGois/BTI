2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is considered to be one of the most toxic environmental contaminants, named dioxin. Exposure to TCDD induces a plethora of intoxication symptoms, including anorexia and hypothermia, in several mammals and human. Enkephalin, an endogenous pentapeptide, is an important neuroregulator of autonomic functions, such as food intake and body temperature. In this study, we investigated the effects of TCDD gastric administration on methionine-enkephalin (MEK) immunoreactivity in the brain of the Long-Evans rat, the species strain considered to be the most TCDD-susceptible, using immunohistochemical staining. A single dose of TCDD (dissolved in olive oil, 50 microg/kg) or olive oil alone was administrated to the rats by gavage. Compared with the vehicle-treated rat, a marked increase in the density of MEK immunoreactive cell bodies, fibers and terminals was found 2 weeks after TCDD treatment in the forebrain of the TCDD-treated rat, i.e. the central amygdaloid nucleus, field CA3 of the hippocampus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, medial preoptic nucleus, interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure, lateral globus pallidus, ventral pallidum and lateral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These results demonstrated for the first time a site-specific increased enkephalinergic activity in certain brain regions of the Long-Evans rat. It is suggested that the increased MEK immunoreactivity may act as a compensatory adaptation for the pathophysiological alterations caused by TCDD exposure.
