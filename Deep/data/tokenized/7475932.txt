We investigated the roles played by three muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, and M3) in the pressor response with bradycardia that followed the injection of neostigmine (5 x 10(-8) mol) into the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. These changes were blocked by the co-administration of methylatropine (5 x 10(-8) mol). The intrahippocampal injection of pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) (5 x 10(-9) - 5 x 10(-7) mol) suppressed the neostigmine-induced pressor response dose-dependently. However injection of gallamine (M2 antagonist) (5 x 10(-8) - 5 x 10(-7) mol) and of 4-DAMP (M1 and M3 antagonist) (5 x 10(-8) - 5 x 10(-7) mol) did not suppress this hypertensive response. These findings suggest that the neostigmine-induced pressor response with bradycardia is mediated through the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype.
