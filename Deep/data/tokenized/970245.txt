Aluminum-induced temporal lobe epilepsy in 24 cats showed marked interictal intensification of somatic and EEG components of the orienting reaction and increase in their resistance to habituation. The greatest disturbances of the orienting response were noted in cases of bitemporal foci, of foci situated in the allocortex (hippocampus and amygdala) and of foci inducing generalized or generalized and partial seizures.
