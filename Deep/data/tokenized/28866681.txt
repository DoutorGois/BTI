The vertebrate hippocampal formation has been central in discussions of comparative cognition, nurturing an interest in understanding the evolution of variation in hippocampal organization among vertebrate taxa and the functional consequences of that variation. Assuming some similarity between the medial pallium of extant amphibians and the hippocampus of stem tetrapods, we propose the hypothesis that the hippocampus of modern amniotes began with a medial pallium characterized by a relatively undifferentiated cytoarchitecture, more direct thalamic and olfactory sensory inputs, and a broad role in associative learning and memory processes that nonetheless included the map-like representation of space. From this modest beginning evolved the cognitively more specialized hippocampal formation of birds and the hippocampus of mammals with its confounding dentate gyrus. Much has been made of trying to identify a dentate homologue in birds, but there are compelling reasons to believe no such structural homologue/functional equivalent exists. The uniqueness of the mammalian dentate then raises the question of what might be the functional consequences of a hippocampus with a dentate compared to one without. One might be tempted to speculate that the presence of a dentate gyrus facilitates so-called pattern separation, but birds with their suspected dentate-less hippocampus display excellent hippocampal-dependent pattern separation relying on space. Perhaps one consequence of a dentate is a hippocampus better designed to process a broader array of stimuli beyond space to more robustly support episodic memory. What is clear is that any meaningful reconstruction of hippocampal evolution and the eventual identification of any subdivisional homologies will require more data on the neurobiological and functional properties of the nonmammalian hippocampus, particularly those of amphibians and reptiles.
