The dithiocarbamates are a group of compounds that are used extensively in industry, agriculture and medicine. Exposure to these compounds has caused deleterious effects to both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Cultured rat hippocampal astroglia treated with 35 micrograms/ml diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) in media were studied for alterations to the cytoskeleton. Examination by both immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy revealed disruption of the cytoskeletal elements. This occurred in a progressive time-dependent manner. Electrophoretic patterns demonstrated two cytoskeletal protein alterations. The microtubular protein, beta-tubulin, appeared to have an altered mobility while the major intermediate filament protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), was decreased. The cytoskeleton appears to be an important cellular target for injury by DDC exposure. This study has demonstrated that DDC induces alterations in the architecture of the cytoskeleton of astroglia and suggests that these changes involve microtubular and intermediate filament proteins.
