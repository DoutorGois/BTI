Electrically induced afterdischarge (ADs) were evoked in the cats' dorsal hippocampus. The action of the conditioning prestimulation of the pallidus nucleus on AD duration was studied. A significant facilitatory influence was observed when pallidal conditioning stimulation immediately preceded hippocampal test stimulation. The time course of the phenomenon showed a decrease of the conditioning action when the interval between the two stimulations increased : complete disappearance of the effect occurred after about 800 ms. Results are discussed as far as functional relationships between basal ganglia and rhinencephalic system are concerned.
