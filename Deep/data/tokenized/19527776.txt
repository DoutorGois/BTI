Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is functionally a pleiotropic mediator involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation and migration as well as in matrix degradation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis in cancer tissue. Comparable cellular alterations occur in the brain during post-injury tissue repair. As the first step to assess the role of uPAR in brain tissue remodeling, we tested a hypothesis that uPAR expression is altered in the hippocampus during epilepsy-related circuitry reorganization. Epileptogenesis was triggered by inducing status epilepticus (SE) with electrical stimulation of the amygdala in rats. To monitor the development of SE and the occurrence of spontaneous seizures animals were continuously video-EEG monitored until sacrificed (1, 2, 4 or 14 days after SE). The hippocampal expression of uPAR was studied with real time qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Double-immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the expression of uPAR in astrocytes, microglia and neurons. We show that in the normal hippocampus the expression of uPAR was low and confined to small population of astrocytes and interneurons. In animals undergoing SE, uPAR expression increased dramatically, peaking at 1 and 4 days after SE. According to double-immunohistochemistry, uPAR was highly expressed in parvalbumin positive interneurons in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, and in a subgroup of somatostatin and neuropeptide Y positive hilar interneurons. Increased uPAR expression during post-injury phase supports its contribution to tissue remodeling in the brain. Surviving hilar interneurons that are known to be denervated due to loss of afferent inputs in post-SE brain provide a target for future studies to investigate the contribution of uPAR in reinnervation of these cells, and to identify the signaling cascades that mediate the effects of uPAR.
