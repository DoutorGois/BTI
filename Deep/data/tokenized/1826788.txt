Pretreatment with metaphit (1-[1-(3-isothiocyanotophenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine), a putative irreversible antagonist of phencyclidine (PCP) receptors, did not antagonize PCP-induced passive avoidance deficit in rats, and did not decrease [3H]MK-801 (5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzocyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate) binding to PCP recognition sites coupled to NMDA receptors. The effectiveness of the metaphit treatment was evidenced by the occurrence of audiogenic seizures. These results suggest that previously reported antagonism in vivo actions of PCP by metaphit, is mediated by sites not involved in PCP-induced passive avoidance deficit, and not related to the NMDA receptor complex in brain structures studied (striatum, hippocampus, and cortex).
