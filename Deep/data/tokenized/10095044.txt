Oxygen-induced cell death in embryonic neurons is a useful in vitro model of neuronal apoptosis to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the cell death induced by oxidative stress. In the present study, we examined the involvement of reactive oxygen species and glutamate in the high (50%) oxygen-induced death of cultured hippocampal neurons. During the course of cell death, increases in O2- and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were observed. On the other hand, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and deferoxamine (DFX), which have inhibitory effects on the generation of O2-, H2O2 and hydroxyl radicals, respectively, protected the neurons. These results suggested that both O2- and H2O2 play important roles in this apoptosis. Antagonists of NMDA and AMPA/kinate (AMPA/KA) receptors and an inhibitor of glutamate release partially prevented the apoptosis, suggesting that exposure to high oxygen enhances glutamate release, which results in activation of NMDA receptor and AMPA/KA receptor. In addition, specific nitric oxide (NO) scavenger and NO synthetase inhibitors blocked the apoptosis, indicating that NO and/or peroxynitrite are involved in this mechanism of cell death. Caspase inhibitors also blocked the neuronal apoptosis. These results suggested that multiple effectors including generation of reactive oxygen species, release of L-glutamate and activation of caspases are activated during the death induced by high oxygen.
