The hippocampal region of the brain is a useful model system for understanding the plasticity and resilience of brain cells to stress hormone action and aging. Hippocampal neurons show both structural and functional plasticity, and individual differences in hippocampal function are shaped by early life experiences. For human brain aging, there are new non-invasive imaging tools to relate to the animal models, and these can help to assess the vulnerability of the aging hippocampus in relation to stress and Alzheimer's disease.
