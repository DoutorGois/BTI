Ischemic stroke is a major disability and cause of death worldwide due to its narrow therapeutic time window. Neuroprotective agent is a promising strategy to salvage acutely ischemic brain tissue and extend the therapeutic time window for stroke treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of isoquercetin in (1) primary culture of rat hippocampal neurons exposure on oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) injury and (2) rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury. The results showed that isoquercetin post-treatment reduced the infarct size, number of apoptotic cells, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response after ischemia and reperfusion injury. The underlying mechanism study indicated that the neuroprotective effects of isoquercetin were elicited via suppressing the activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and caspase-1; the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6. In addition, isoquercetin also effectively alleviated hippocampus neuron apoptosis by regulation of cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3. Our report provided new considerations into the therapeutic action and the underlying mechanisms of isoquercetin to improve brain injury in individuals who have suffered from ischemic stroke. As a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative compound with neuroprotective capacities, the beneficial effects of isoquercetin when used to treat ischemic stroke and related diseases in humans warrant further studies.
