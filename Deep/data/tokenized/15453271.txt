The role of oxidative stress in electroconvulsive therapy-related effects is not well studied. The purpose of this study was to determine oxidative stress parameters in several brain structures after a single electroconvulsive seizure or multiple electroconvulsive seizures. Rats were given either a single electroconvulsive shock or a series of eight electroconvulsive shocks. Brain regions were isolated, and levels of oxidative stress in the brain tissue (cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum) were measured. We demonstrated a decrease in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum several times after a single electroconvulsive shock or multiple electroconvulsive shocks. In contrast, lipid peroxidation increases both after a single electroconvulsive shock or multiple electroconvulsive shocks in cortex. In conclusion, we demonstrate an increase in oxidative damage in cortex, in contrast to a reduction of oxidative damage in hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum.
