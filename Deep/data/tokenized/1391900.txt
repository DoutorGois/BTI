It has been revealed that intraperitoneal injection of T-activin (humoral factor of the thymus) to August rats leads to more rapid and stable conditioned reflex formation to a sound and to a decrease of avoidance time when electric current is given to a shuttle chamber. Furthermore, less amount of uneffective series in testing unconditioned avoidance is registered in the test animals. A positive T-activin effect on conditioned reflex formation and unconditioned reflex manifestation is probably connected with its ability to alter hippocampus functional parameters and (or) with anti-stressor properties of the preparation.
