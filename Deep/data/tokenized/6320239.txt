The effects of intra-hippocampal (dentate gyrus) microinjections of noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5HT) on various forms of rats' behavior were studied. NA injections produced an increase in the rats' exploratory behavior in the open field test, potentiated the animals' reaction to pain and significantly increased the aversive properties of an electric shock in the conflict test. 5HT injections inhibited the rats exploratory behavior in the open field test, attenuated the retention of a passive avoidance reaction and increased suppressant effects of shock in the conflict test. The findings indicate an antagonistic role of both monoamines in the regulation of various aspects of animal behavior and point to the hippocampus as a one of possible anatomic substrates for such an interaction.
