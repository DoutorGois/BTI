The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was examined for the presence of the parametric features of habituation. All 8 of the tested parameters were found in the dentate thus extending the observation of habituation to a monosynaptic junction in the vertebrate forebrain. The data are discussed in relation to hippocampal function and plasticity.
