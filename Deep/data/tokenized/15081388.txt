Our previous study reported that an antitussive drug, dimemorfan, attenuates cholinergic dysfunction-induced amnesia in mice and acts like a sigma1 receptor agonist. This study further showed that dimemorfan (30 microM), like the putative sigma1 receptor agonist (+)-SKF-10047 (10 microM), significantly enhanced 25 mM KCl-evoked [3H]acetylcholine release from rat hippocampal but not striatal slices, which was antagonized by a sigma1 receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.3 microM).
