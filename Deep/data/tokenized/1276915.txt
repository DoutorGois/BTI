Hippocampectomized male rats were prepared, and the incidence as well as severity of gastric ulceration upon restraint were compared with those of normal control animals and controls with localized damage to the cortex over the hippocampus. In another experiment, observations on gastric ulceration were made without restraint in hippocampectomized animals, normal controls, controls with cortical damage, vagotomized animals and animals that received hippocampectomy as well as vagotomy. Both in restrained and unrestrained states, the incidence of animals with ulcer as well as the number and the total area of ulcers per stomach were significantly larger in the hippocampal animals than they were in the other animal groups. Vagotomy abolished the effect of hippocampectomy upon gastric ulceration in the unrestrained state. We infer that the hippocampus helps to protect the stomach from ulceration partly by controlling vagal activity.
