The formation of neural synapses according to the development and growth of neurite were usually studied with various markers. Of these markers, synaptophysin is a kind of synaptic protein located in the synaptic vesicle of neuron or neuroendocrine cell known to be distributed consistently in all neural synapses. The purpose of this study was to investigate differential expression levels and patterns of synaptic marker (synaptophysin) in the mouse hippocampal region according to the developmental stages of embryonic, neonatal, and adulthood respectively. In the embryonic and neonatal groups, synaptophysin immunofluorescence was almost defined to cornu ammonis subfields (CA1 and CA3) of hippocampus and subiculum proper in the hippocampal region. However in dentate gyrus, synaptophysin immunoreactivities were insignificant or absent in all developmental stages. In embryonic and neonatal hippocampus, the intensities of immunofluorescence were significantly different between molecular and oriens layers. Furthermore, those intensities were decreased considerably in both layers of neonatal group compared to embryonic. The results from this study will contribute to characterizing synaptogenic activities in the central nervous system through developmental stages.
