To investigate the role of calcineurin (CaN) in the pathogenesis of stress-related psychiatric disorders, we examined the expression of CaN A mRNA and the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of CaN in the rat brain following various restraint stress paradigms. Northern blot analysis revealed no significant changes in the levels of CaN A mRNA expression, in either the frontal cortex or the hippocampus, in response to a single restraint stress for either 15, 45, or 90 min. In addition, no significant change in the levels of CaN A mRNA was found 3 or 6 h after a single restraint stress for 90 min. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that a single restraint stress for 45 min had no influence on CaN A mRNA expression in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers or in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer of the hippocampus. However, serine/threonine phosphatase activity was significantly increased in both regions in response to a single restraint stress for either 45 or 90 min. These results demonstrate that the single restraint stress paradigms used in this study increase the activity of CaN without any changes in the expression of CaN, suggesting that the activation of calmodulin and the increased levels of heat shock proteins in response to the restraint stress may upregulate the activity of CaN in the rat brain.
