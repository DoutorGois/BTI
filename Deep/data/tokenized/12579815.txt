AIM: To study mRNA expression difference of voltage-dependent potassium channels in the brain of scopolamine-induced memory impaired rats. METHODS: Memory impairments induced in rats by scopolamine (1 mg.kg-1) were assessed in the Morris water maze test. After rats were injected intraperitoneally with scopolamine for 6 days, the mRNA expression level of five voltage-dependent potassium channels, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 were detected in the rat cortex and hippocampus by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Scopolamine (1 mg.kg-1) was shown to significantly induce memory impairment in rats. The mRNA levels of Kv4.2 were decreased by 28.8% and 33.9% in the cortex and hippocampus, respectively. The mRNA levels of Kv1.4 and Kv2.1 were increased in the hippocampus by 111.7% and 64.3%, respectively. There were no differences in the brain mRNA levels of other voltage-dependent potassium channels in scopolamine-induced memory impaired rat. CONCLUSION: The mRNA expression levels of voltage-dependent potassium channels changed significantly in the brain of scopolamine-induced memory impaired rats.
