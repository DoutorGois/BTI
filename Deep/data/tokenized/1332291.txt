In hippocampal slices of rats was studied the influence of different gangliosides on the dynamics of development of long-term post-tetanic potentiation (LPTP) in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA3 area at stimulation of the mossy fibers. Each ganglioside was shown to change synaptic efficiency specifically after the tetanic stimulation. Incubation of hippocampal slices with monosialoganglioside GM1 induced the rapid increase of population spike amplitude in the pyramidal neurons being of higher level in comparison to that of the active control up to the end of the experiment. Disialoganglioside GD1b increased the amplitude of the summary cellular response to a lesser degree than GM1, but contributed to its conservation up the control level in the course of the whole recording period. Gangliosides GD1a and GT1b induced inhibitory action on LPTP decreasing population spike value lower than that of both the control and initial levels, GT1b causing more rapid decrease of amplitudes of cellular responses than GD1a. A conclusion was drawn on the participation of gangliosides in the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. The differential influence of various kinds of gangliosides on the LPTP dynamics was found out. The possible mechanisms of these reactions are discussed.
