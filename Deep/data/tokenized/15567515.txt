The present study shows that omega-agatoxin-TK, a toxin of the venom of Agelenopsis aperta, which is 10 times more concentrated than the P/Q type Ca(2+) channel blocker, omega-agatoxin-IVA in the venom, inhibits the high K(+) depolarisation-induced rise in internal Ca(2+) (Ca(i), as determined with fura-2) dose dependently in cerebral (striatal and hippocampal) isolated nerve endings, with calculated IC(50)'s of about 60nM. The maximal inhibition exerted by omega-agatoxin-TK in striatal synaptosomes (61 +/- 11%) is 10% larger than in hippocampal synaptosomes, suggesting a larger population of omega-agatoxin-TK-sensitive Ca(2+) channels in striatal than in hippocampal nerve endings. The N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker, omega-conotoxin-GVIA (1muM), inhibits part of the omega-agatoxin-TK-insensitive rise in Ca(i) induced by high K(+). In contrast to the inhibition exerted by omega-agatoxin-TK on the Ca(i) response to high K(+), omega-agatoxin-TK failed to inhibit the tetrodotoxin-sensitive elevations in Ca(i) and in internal Na(+) (Na(i), as determined with SBFI) induced by veratridine, indicating that the Ca(2+) influx activated by veratridine does not involve omega-agatoxin-TK-sensitive channels. High K(+) does not increase Na(i). In [(3)H]Glu preloaded hippocampal synaptosomes super-fused with low Na(+) Krebs Ringer HEPES (a condition that guarantees the elimination of neurotransmitter transporters-mediated release), the release of [(3)H]Glu induced by high K(+) is absolutely dependent on the entrance of external Ca(2+). This exocytotic release of [(3)H]Glu attained in the absence of a chemical Na(+) gradient is inhibited with the same potency and efficacy by omega-agatoxin-TK and by omega-agatoxin-IVA, which is known to differ from omega-agatoxin-TK in its amino terminal moiety. These results indicate that omega-agatoxin-TK represents a good pharmacological tool to study P/Q type Ca(2+) channel-mediated responses in cerebral nerve endings.
