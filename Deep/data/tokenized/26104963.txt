Intraperirhinal cortex infusion of 17-beta estradiol (E2) impairs object-recognition memory. However, it is not currently known whether this hormone modulates synaptic plasticity in this structure. Most excitatory synapses in the central nervous system are located on dendritic spines, and elevated E2 levels influence the density of these spines in several brain areas. The goal of the present study was to determine whether differences in dendritic spine density in the perirhinal cortex are observed following high E2 replacement in ovariectomized rats. The density of total spines, and mushroom-shaped (i.e. mature) spines were compared between a high E2 replacement (10 microg/kg/day, s.c.) and a no replacement condition. The perirhinal cortex is subdivided into Broadmann's area 35 and 36 and so group comparisons were made within each sub-region separately. High E2 replacement resulted in lower density of mushroom-shaped spines in area 35 relative to no replacement. There was no effect of high E2 replacement on dendritic spine density in area 36. These findings are consistent with the idea that higher E2 levels reduce dendritic spine density in area 35, which may result from spine shrinkage, or reduced synapse formation. This study provides preliminary evidence for a mechanism through which E2 may impair object-recognition memory.
