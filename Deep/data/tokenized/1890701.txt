Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CS-PG) bearing glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains containing unsulfate (COS) and 6-sulfate (C6S) disaccharides was immunolocalized in rat and human CNS by using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific for the two disaccharides. The immunostaining with both MAb was restricted to the periphery of a neuronal subset in rat and human CNS. Double immunofluorescence showed codistribution of the antigens around the same neuronal population. The staining with anti-COS MAb was stronger than with anti-C6S MAb, suggesting that the proteoglycan (PG) contains mainly COS disaccharides. In different rat cortical areas, 40-60/mm2 positive interneurons were found, the visual cortex showing the highest value. In human cortex, positivity was also observed around the soma of some pyramidal cells. In the rat, positive neurons were also localized in deep cerebellar nuclei, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and other structures of the midbrain and hindbrain. CA3 region of hippocampus and the external layer of pyriform cortex were characterized by positivity of the neuropil. Immunoelectronmicroscopy showed the antigens in the extracellular space around the neuronal soma, the synaptic elements and the cell processes of the neuropil. The neuronal surface of the soma and of the proximal dendrites were positive, but the pre- and postsynaptic membranes and clefts were negative.
