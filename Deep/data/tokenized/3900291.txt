We reviewed recent evidence that chemical kindling of epileptic seizures can be induced by injection into the amygdala of multiple cholinergic muscarinic agonists, and blocked by multiple muscarinic antagonists. The stereospecific induction of kindling by (+) but not by (-) acetyl-beta-methylcholine shows that some types of repeated synaptic activation can produce epilepsy, in the absence of specific brain damage. The failure of bicuculline (but not of carbachol) to produce kindling with amygdaloid injections, and its ability to produce a limited seizure spread in neocortex, suggest that repetitive seizure activity alone is not sufficient to produce kindling. A review of some recent neurochemical changes in the synaptic apparatus associated with some types of kindling suggests potential areas for future investigation, but no cause-and-effect relationship between neurochemical and behavioral changes can be inferred so far.
