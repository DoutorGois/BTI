By means of the fully reversible tetrodotoxin inactivation technique, perirhinal cortex (PC) mnemonic function was investigated in rats trained to a passive avoidance response (PAR). It was shown that PC functional integrity is necessary during PAR acquisition, during late and very late consolidation (from 24 hr up to 192 hr after the training session), and during retrieval. An unexpected finding was that the PC was not involved in the early consolidation period. Thus the PC may play a relatively simple relay or connective role during acquisition, but its very late and very long consolidative involvement may indicate a peculiar function in consolidation and possibly in the storage of the PAR engram. The results are discussed in terms of the mnemonic characteristics of other neural sites (amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex) involved in the same learning process.
