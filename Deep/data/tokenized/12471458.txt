We examined the laminar structure and distribution of mossy fiber terminal fields in the dorsal hippocampus, an important area for spatial learning, in rats exposed to ethanol during gestational days 10-21. Pyramidal cells in the CA3a subfield were loosely packed compared to control rats. Aberrant infra- and intrapyramidal mossy fibers were found in the CA3 region, especially in the CA3a subfield, throughout the dorsal hippocampus of ethanol-exposed rats. Aberrant mossy fiber terminals were observed more frequently in the rostral than the caudal level of the dorsal hippocampus. At the most caudal level of the dorsal hippocampus, disarrangement of pyramidal cells was seen in the CA3c subfield along with disturbed mossy fiber terminals. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was not related to aberrant distribution of mossy fiber terminals after prenatal exposure to ethanol. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity was increased in the dorsal hippocampus of ethanol-exposed rats compared with control rats. Abnormal development of the dorsal hippocampus induced by prenatal ethanol exposure may be associated with the defect of spatial memory seen in fetal alcohol syndrome children and their animal models.
