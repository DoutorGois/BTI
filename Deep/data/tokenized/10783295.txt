Mutations in the presenilin-1 (PS1) gene cause approximately 50% of cases of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. The function of this protein remains unknown. We have made an electrophysiological study of hippocampal slices from transgenic mice expressing either a normal human PS1 transgene (WT) or one of two human PS1 transgenes bearing pathogenic mutations at codon M146 (M146L and M146V). Medium and late afterhyperpolarizations in CA3 pyramidal cells were larger in mice expressing either mutant form compared with WT and nontransgenic controls. Calcium responses to depolarization were larger in M146L mice compared with nontransgenic littermates; synaptic potentiation of the CA3 to CA1 projection was also stronger. These results demonstrate disruption of the control of intracellular calcium and electrophysiological dysfunction in PS1 mutant mice.
