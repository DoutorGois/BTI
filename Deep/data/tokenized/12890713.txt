(1) Aim of this study was to gain insight into the mechanism of action of CHF3381, a novel putative antiepileptic and neuroprotective drug. (2) CHF3381 blocked NMDA currents in primary cultures of cortical neurons: maximal effect was nearly -80% of the NMDA-evoked current, with EC(50) of approximately 5 micro M. This effect was selective, reversible, use-dependent and elicited at the concentrations reached in the rodent brain after peripheral administration of therapeutic doses. (3) CHF3381 also inhibited voltage-gated Na(+) currents in an apparently voltage-dependent manner. However, this effect could be obtained only at relatively high concentrations (100 micro M). (4) Consistent with the mild effects on voltage-gated Na(+) channels, CHF3381 (100 micro M) failed to affect electrical stimulation-evoked glutamate overflow in hippocampal slices. In contrast, the anti-convulsant agent and Na(+) channel blocker lamotrigine (100 micro M) inhibited stimulation-evoked glutamate overflow by approximately 50%. (5) CHF3381 reduced kindled seizure-induced c-fos mRNA levels within the same brain regions, and to a similar level, as the selective NMDA receptor antagonist MK801, providing circumstantial evidence to the idea that CHF3381 blocks NMDA receptors in vivo. (6) The present mechanistic studies suggest that the primary mechanism of action of CHF3381 in the forebrain is blockade of NMDA receptors. On this basis, this compound may have a potential use in other diseases caused by or associated with a pathologically high level of NMDA receptor activation.
