RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The neurotrophic effect of Xaliproden has been followed using sequential cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in rats with vincristine-induced brain lesion as a model of Alzheimer disease. METHODS: Nineteen rats received an intraseptal injection of vincristine on day 0, followed by a daily gavage with either the vehicle (Tween-20 1%) (n = 10) or Xaliproden (10 mg/kg) (n = 9). Eight sham-operated controls received a daily gavage with either the vehicle (n = 4) or Xaliproden (n = 4). Brain MR imaging was performed at 4.7 T on a Biospec 47/30 MR system before surgery then 3, 7, 10, and 14 days after surgery. RESULTS: At day 3 following vincristine injection, an increase in MR signal intensity in the septum was observed on T2-weighted images. This increase was maximal at day 10, and remained stable until day 14. Daily treatment with Xaliproden delayed the appearance of hypersignals until day 7 and reduced by Ca. 50% the magnitude of the increase in signal intensity from day 10. No changes were observed in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Quantitative MRI objectifies noninvasively the neuroprotective effect of Xaliproden on rat brain anatomy.
