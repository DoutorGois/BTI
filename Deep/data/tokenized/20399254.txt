Pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include memory deficits, accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles, and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, which has been linked to mutations in the presenilin gene that code for presenilin (PS) proteins. PSs are a family of multi-pass transmembrane proteins where normal presenilins (PS1 and PS2) are highly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Several past studies have explored alterations in long-term potentiation (LTP), a proposed molecular correlate of memory, and in behavioral tests of spatial memory in a variety of PS1 models. These reports suggest that calcium plays a role in these alterations, but mechanistic explanations for changes in LTP and in behavioral tests of memory are still lacking. To test the hypothesis that calcium-related mechanisms, such as changes in calcium buffering, are associated with alterations in LTP and memory, we utilized in vitro experimental paradigms of LTP in hippocampal slices obtained from the PS1-M146V transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We also used the in vivo Morris water maze (MWM), a test for hippocampal dependent spatial memory. In addition, we used cellular assays to explore molecular mechanisms. We confirm that PS1 mutations (M146V) enhance LTP. We also find increases in some parameters of the MWM, and alterations in other parameters, such as path length indicating impairment in cognitive functioning in PS1-M146V mice. In addition, these findings are observed in association with increased calbindin D28K expression in the CA1 hippocampus of PS1-M146V mice.
