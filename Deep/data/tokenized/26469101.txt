BACKGROUND: It was previously found that synthetic, insect-derived octapeptide leucopyrokinin (LPK) applied directly into the lateral brain ventricle induced a significant antinociceptive effect in rats. Its synthetic truncated analog heptapeptide [2-8]-leucopyrokinin displayed a stronger antinociceptive effect in comparison to native LPK. Moreover it was previously found a high accumulation of these both 125I-labeled peptides in adrenals, as well as in hypothalamus and in hippocampus of rats brain. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the distribution of 125I-labeled [2-8]-leucopyrokinin in rats' internal organs an in several parts of the brain after peripheral - intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed on male Wistar rats. A synthetic [2-8]-leucopyrokinin ([2-8]-LPK) was iodinated with Na125I. On the day of experiment a solution of 125I-[2-8]-LPK was i.p. injected and the next after 1 and 24 h animals were sacrificed by decapitation. Radioactivity levels in samples of parts of the brain and of internal organs were determined by counter Gamma Auto Count. RESULTS: A uniform, low accumulation 125I-[2-8]-LPK was found in evaluated samples of the brain and in internal organs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study indicate a weak penetration into the brain and internal organs of intraperitoneally applied 125I-[2-8]-LPK in rats and correspond with previously determined weak biological effects of i.p. injected LPK and [2-8]-LPK.
