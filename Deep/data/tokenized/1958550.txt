We studied the effects of steroid hormones on the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative mechanism of neuronal plasticity and memory storage in the CNS. In vivo experiments were performed in rats under chloral hydrate anesthesia (0.4 mg/kg i.p.). All animals were adrenalectomized 48 h before recording. LTP was induced after priming tetanic stimulation at the perforant pathway (PP) and single pulse field potentials were obtained from the dentate gyrus (DG). The excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) slope and population spike (PS) amplitude were analyzed before and after the i.v. injection of the steroids and after the induction of LTP, and followed up to 1 h. Results obtained with the hormones were compared with matched control animals injected with vehicle alone, Nutralipid 10%. Previous results from our laboratory showed that deoxycorticosterone (DOC) decreased the magnitude of the EPSP at all times after priming stimulation and the PS decreased during the first 30 min of the LTP. Corticosterone decreased the EPSP in the first 15 min and the PS during the first 30 min after priming stimuli. In these experiments the mineralocorticoids aldosterone and 18-OH-DOC elicited a decrease of the EPSP at all times post-train; and no significant difference against vehicle was observed in the PS. Post-injection values were not changed except for 18-OH-DOC at a dose of 1 mg, where a decrease of both the EPSP (P less than 0.01) and the PS (P less than 0.02) was observed against vehicle. ATH-progesterone at 0.1 mg/rat also decreased the EPSP values significantly after priming stimulation and no significant changes against vehicle were observed in the PS. These results show that adrenal steroids can modulate hippocampal LTP, that they can act at different neuronal loci and with different time courses in the development of the phenomena.
