Synaptic plasticity is manifested by long-lasting changes in synaptic potency. Increased potency is of special importance in relation to the neural basis of memory. Even mild repetitive stimulation evokes large and prolonged potentiations of hippocampal synapses, as is revealed by electrical recording either in vivo or in vitro. More importantly there is a matching hypertrophy of the synaptic spines on the dendrites of hippocampal granule cells, as is shown by most convincing electronmicrographs. The increase is to about 40% some 2 h after a mild stimulation (900 impulses) and there was relatively little decline by 23 h. There is brief reference to the metabolic processes that could be involved in this plastic response.
