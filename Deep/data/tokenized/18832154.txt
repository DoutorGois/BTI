Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is genetically linked with schizophrenia, a neurodevelopmental cognitive disorder characterized by imbalances in glutamatergic and dopaminergic function. NRG-1 regulates numerous neurodevelopmental processes and, in the adult, suppresses or reverses long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal glutamatergic synapses. Here we show that NRG-1 stimulates dopamine release in the hippocampus and reverses early-phase LTP via activation of D4 dopamine receptors (D4R). NRG-1 fails to depotentiate LTP in hippocampal slices treated with the antipsychotic clozapine and other more selective D4R antagonists. Moreover, LTP is not depotentiated in D4R null mice by either NRG-1 or theta-pulse stimuli. Conversely, direct D4R activation mimics NRG-1 and reduces AMPA receptor currents and surface expression. These findings demonstrate that NRG-1 mediates its unique role in counteracting LTP via dopamine signaling and opens future directions to study new aspects of NRG function. The novel functional link between NRG-1, dopamine, and glutamate has important implications for understanding how imbalances in Neuregulin-ErbB signaling can impinge on dopaminergic and glutamatergic function, neurotransmitter pathways associated with schizophrenia.
