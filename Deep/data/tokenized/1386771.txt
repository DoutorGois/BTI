The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801) has been shown to block methamphetamine (MA) induced damage to the dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) systems of the brain. DL-Fenfluramine (FEN) is another potential neurotoxin but its long-term depletions are more selective to the 5HT system. To determine whether MK-801 protects against damage induced by FEN, we treated rats with FEN (4 injections of 12.5 mg/kg, at 1 h intervals) in conjunction with either saline or MK-801 (2 injections of 2.5 mg/kg, administered 15 min before and 90 min after the first FEN injection). Two weeks post-treatment, MK-801 alone caused a small but significant decrease in 5HT tissue concentrations in striatum and amygdala. FEN significantly reduced 5HT in all 8 brain regions studied. MK-801 + FEN did not protect against FEN-induced 5HT depletions in nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle, septum, frontal cortex, somatosensory cortex or hippocampus. MK-801 + FEN enhanced 5HT depletions in striatum, hypothalamus and amygdala. The differential protective effect of MK-801 between MA and FEN are discussed in terms of a possible dopaminergic mechanism.
