Background and objectives: Cognitive impairment is a common extrapulmonary comorbidity in COPD patients. The default mode network (DMN) plays a critical role in maintaining the normal activities of humans, and its function can be evaluated by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations between cognition and function changes of the DMN in COPD patients. Methods: One hundred and thirteen eligible participants including 30 control subjects and 83 COPD patients matched for demographic characteristics were recruited. All participants performed cognitive function tests and underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The total cognitive function scores of COPD patients were significantly different from those of control subjects (P<0.05) and worsened with the degree of airflow obstruction. The activated brain regions in the DMN of COPD patients were less than those of normal controls. Six activated brain regions in the DMN were found to develop significantly different functional connectivity (FC) values among the subjects. Meanwhile, the FC values of the left posterior cingulate cortex and left hippocampus correlated well with cognitive functions and pulmonary function. Conclusion: COPD patients have cognitive impairments that correlate well with disease severity. FC changes in activated brain regions in the DMN may predict cognitive impairment, and the left posterior cingulate cortex and left hippocampus may be important brain regions related to cognitive impairment in COPD patients.
