Cytosolic calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in cultured hippocampal neurons from rat embryos were measured using fura-2. Neurons with higher resting [Ca2+]i showed greater [Ca2+]i responses to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and K+ depolarization. There was a strong relationship between resting [Ca2+]i and the maximal changes in [Ca2+]i (delta[Ca2+]i), which fit the our proposed equation to describe this relationship.
