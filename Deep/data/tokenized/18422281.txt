OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of vitamin C and E on blood lead (Pb) levels and SOD, GSH-Px, NOS activity and NO, MDA content in hippocampus of rats with lead poisoning. METHODS: Rat lead poisoning model was established by oral administration of 0.615 mmol/L lead acetate in drinking water for 4 weeks; and animals were fed with vitamin C 100 mg/kg. bw and/or vitamin E 100 mg/kg. bw for 1 week. Then blood Pb levels and SOD, GSH-Px, NOS activity and MDA, NO contents in hippocampus of rats were determined by corresponding kits. RESULT: Compared with control group, blood Pb level was decreased significantly (P<0.05) after given vitamin C, vitamin E or combination of vitamin C and E. The concentrations of SOD, GSH-Px, NO and NOS were significantly higher in vitamin C and/or E groups than those in control group (P<0.05). The concentration of MDA in vitamin treatment groups was significantly lower than that in lead control group (P<0.05); furthermore concentration of MDA in combination of vitamin C and E group was significantly higher than that in vitamin C alone group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Administration of vitamin C and E can decrease blood lead level, alleviate damage of lipid peroxidation in hippocampus by lead toxicity and reverse NO, NOS levels in rats with lead poisoning.
