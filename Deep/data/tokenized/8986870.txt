Secretoneurin is a 33-amino acid peptide, generated in brain by proteolytic processing of secretogranin II. The distribution of secretoneurin-like immunoreactivity and secretogranin II mRNA was investigated in the hippocampus of the rat. Secretogranin II mRNA was found in high concentrations throughout the granule cell and pyramidal cell layers and in many local neurons, notably in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The general distributional pattern of secretoneurin-like immunoreactivity was characterized by a prominent staining in the area of the terminal field of mossy fibers with an obvious staining in the infrapyramidal area of CA3 and a strongly immunopositive band in the inner third of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Lesions of the granule cells by local injection of colchicine significantly reduced secretoneurin-like immunoreactivity in the terminal field of mossy fibers, but not in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. On the other hand, destruction of interneurons of the dentate gyrus (mossy cells and certain gamma-aminobutyricacid-ergic interneurons) by kainic acid-induced seizures was associated with a reduction of secretoneurin-like immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. However, 30 days after kainic acid-induced seizures, a strongly secretoneurin-immunoreactive band reappeared in this area, which at this late time point is due to sprouting of mossy fibers collaterals. Our experiments suggest a widespread distribution of secretoneurin-like immunoreactivity in neurons of the hippocampal formation with a preferential localization in excitatory pathways including associational/commissural fibers originating from secretoneurin-containing mossy cells.
