The ventral hippocampus (VH) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) are both crucial in inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory. However, the exact role of the VH-BLA circuit in IA memory consolidation is unclear. This study investigated the effect of post-training reversible disconnection of the VH-BLA circuit in IA memory consolidation. Male Wistar rats with implanted guide cannulae were trained with a one-trial IA task, then received immediate intracerebral injections of muscimol or saline, and were tested 24 h later. Muscimol injection into the bilateral BLA, or the unilateral VH and contralateral BLA, but not the unilateral VH and ipsilateral BLA, significantly decreased the retention latencies (versus saline treatment). The results suggest that the VH-BLA circuit could be an important circuit to modulate consolidation of IA memory in rats.
