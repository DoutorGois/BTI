Transgenic APP23 mice expressing human APP(751) with the K670N/M671L mutation, were compared at ages 3, 18 or 25 months to non-transgenic littermates in passive avoidance and in a small and large Morris maze. The task in the smaller pool habituated their flight response to the platform. Impairments in passive avoidance and small pool performance in APP23 mice were clearly age-related. In the larger Morris maze APP23 mice at all ages were impaired in latency and distance swum before finding the platform. Identical performance of 18-month APP23 and controls in a visible platform condition indicates that the Morris maze performance deficit was not due to sensory, motor or motivational alterations. At age 3 months both groups initially unexpectedly avoided the visible platform, suggesting that in young mice neophobia may contribute significantly to performance in cognitive tests. In conclusion, APP23 mice exhibit both early behavioral impairment in the large Morris maze as well as impairments in passive avoidance and small pool performance that are marked only in old age.
