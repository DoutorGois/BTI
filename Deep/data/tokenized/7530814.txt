We have investigated the effects of administration of exogenous glutamate receptor agonists on the amplitude of field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibres. L-Glutamate applied by iontophoresis or by bath perfusion (50 microM for 5 min) evoked a slowly rising increase in the amplitude of the fESPS which persisted for over 90 min. L-Glutamate induced potentiation was blocked by either D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (40 microM) or by (RS)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (500 microM). In slices in which synaptic long-term potentiation had been saturated, iontophoretically applied L-glutamate did not induce further potentiation, but reset the fEPSP amplitude back to control levels. Iontophoretic administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) evoked a transient potentiation which decayed back to control levels within 90 min whereas bath perfusion of NMDA (50 microM) evoked a persistent depression. Bath perfusion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA, 50 microM) evoked no persistent effects. Bath administration of (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD, 50 or 100 microM) caused a short term depression of the fEPSP and no significant persistent effects. Perfusion of 100 microM ACPD in medium containing 1 microM picrotoxin caused a much smaller short term depression of the fEPSP and this was followed by a gradually developing and persistent potentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
