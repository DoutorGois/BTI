Since dioxin and related compounds are suspected of affecting permanently the brain function of offspring of human and experimental animals, effects of perinatal exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) on the expression of rat NMDA receptor NR2A and NR2B subunit mRNA were examined. The mRNA quantification by competitive RT-PCR clearly revealed that TCDD inhibited NR2B mRNA expression and enhanced NR2A mRNA expression in the neocortex and hippocampus on postnatal day (PND) 49, whereas these changes in mRNA expression were not found on PND 5. The results demonstrate for the first time that the perinatal exposure to TCDD can alter the molecular basis of brain of offspring in adulthood.
