Most of the experimental models of status epilepticus result either from administration of a variety of excitatory neurotoxins or repeated electrical stimulation. Here we propose a new model based on the withdrawal of chronic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) infusion into limbic structures via osmotic minipumps. Appearing with a latency of about 50 min, continuous pseudo-rhythmic EEG epileptic spiking was elicited for about 12-24 h after removal of GABA infusion in hippocampus or amygdala. No apparent distant brain damage was observed. This model differs from many others by several features and could result from different mechanisms.
