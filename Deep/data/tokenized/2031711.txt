The nucleus accumbens septi (NAS) receives afferent input from the amygdala via the stria terminalis and from the hippocampus via the fimbria. Extracellular recordings from 196 NAS neurons in halothane-anesthetized rats revealed heterogeneous response patterns following stimulation of the amygdala. The observation that 30% of anterior NAS units but only 16% of posterior NAS units were responsive to amygdala stimulation suggested a topographical arrangement of amygdala efferents. Comparing the effects of amygdala and fimbria stimulation revealed that the two afferent pathways converge onto individual NAS neurons, but that the two sites of stimulation can differentially influence other neurons. The present results clarify the topographical distribution of amygdala input to the NAS, confirm that inputs from two limbic structures are integrated within the NAS, and further illustrate the electrophysiological heterogeneity of NAS neurons.
