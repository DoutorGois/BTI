OBJECTIVE: To study the change of c-fos mRNA and protein in hippocampus of morphine addicted mice after injected with ribozyme specially cleaving per1 mRNA. METHOD: The recombined plasmid pcDNA 3.1-per1RZ DNA was injected into the ventricles of morphine addicted mice to transcript the corresponding ribozyme which cleaves per1 mRNA particularly. And then, the brains of mice were fixed by perfusion. The level of c-fos mRNA was assayed by in situ hybridization and c-fos protein was detected by immunohistochemical staining. RESULT: The level of c-fos mRNA and protein decreased after injection of the recombined plasmid pcDNA 3.1-per1RZ DNA expressing the ribozyme cleaving per1 mRNA. CONCLUSION: The ribozyme specially cleaving per1 mRNA has potential function in inhibiting the transcription and expression of c-fos and blocking the morphine addiction.
