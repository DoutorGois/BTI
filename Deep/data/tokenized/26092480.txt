AIMS: Induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been widely accepted to be neuro-protective. This study aimed to examine whether hemin (a HO-1 inducer) attenuates neuronal damage in the hippocampus induced by orthotopic autologous liver transplantation (OALT) in adult rats. MAIN METHODS: Rats were randomly allocated into four groups (n=8 each): (i) Sham control group; (ii) OALT model group; (iii) Hemin+OALT group, with intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of hemin (5 mg/kg) 24 hours (h) before the OALT; and (iv) ZnPP (a HO-1 inhibitor)+OALT group, with i.p. injection of ZnPP (32 mg/kg) 24h before the OALT. Twenty four hours after the surgery, the hippocampal tissues were collected for electron microscopic examination and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. The levels of hippocampal HO-1 protein and serum S-100beta, the concentrations of regional tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins (IL-6, IL-10), as well as the status of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampus were assessed. KEY FINDINGS: Rats suffered severe neuronal damage in the hippocampus after OALT, mainly in apoptosis. Pre-treatment with hemin obviously alleviated the damage; up-regulated the HO-1 protein level; inhibited the release of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MDA; and promoted the activities of SOD, CAT and IL-10; however, pre-treatment with ZnPP did not exhibit the opposite effect, except that a marked increase in serum S-100beta level was detected. SIGNIFICANCE: Hemin up-regulated the expression of HO-1 and attenuated hippocampal neuronal damage induced by OALT.
