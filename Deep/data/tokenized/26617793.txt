OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of calcium-sensing receptors (CaSR) on apoptosis in rat hippocampus during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). METHODS: After rat hippocampus was isolated, the cultures were subjected to H/R, and meanwhile gadolinium chloride (GdCl3, agonist of CaSR) and NPS 2390 (antagonists of CaSR) were added to reperfusion solution. The number of hippocampal neuron, cell viability and apoptosis rate were determined by inverted microscope, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometer (FCM), respectively. Besides, caspase-3, Bax, cytochrome C (Cyt-c), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2, pERK1/2, P38 and pP38 were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: The hippocampal neuron number and cell viability were significantly decreased during H/R, and were further significantly reduced when co-treatment with CaSR agonist GdCl3. But the effects of GdCl3 were attenuated by NPS-2390. Whereas, apoptosis rate, the expression level of caspase-3, Bax and Cyt-c were all significantly increased under H/R condition, and was further significantly increased by GdCl3, but were reversed by NPS-2390 (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were no significant differences in expression of ERK1/2, P38 and pP38 among different groups. However, the expression of pERK1/2 was significantly increased during H/R, but was significantly reduced by NPS 2390 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that CaSR might play significant roles in the induction of hippocampus apoptosis in rat during H/R through phosphorylation of ERK1/2.
