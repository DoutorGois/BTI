Repeated use of opioids can lead to the development of analgesic tolerance and dependence. Additionally, chronic opioid exposure can cause a paradoxical emergence of heightened pain sensitivity to noxious stimuli, termed hyperalgesia, which may drive continued or escalated use of opioids to manage worsening pain symptoms. Opioid-induced hyperalgesia has traditionally been measured in rodents via reflex-based assays, including the von Frey method. To better model the cognitive/motivational dimension of pain in a state of opioid dependence and withdrawal, we employed a recently developed non-reflex-based method for measuring pain avoidance-like behavior in animals (mechanical conflict avoidance test). Adult male Wistar rats were administered an escalating dose regimen of morphine (opioid-dependent group) or repeated saline (control group). Morphine-dependent rats exhibited significantly greater avoidance of noxious stimuli during withdrawal. We next investigated individual relationships between pain avoidance-like behavior and alterations in protein phosphorylation in central motivation-related brain areas. We discovered that pain avoidance-like behavior was significantly correlated with alterations in phosphorylation status of protein kinases (ERK, CaMKII), transcription factors (CREB), presynaptic markers of neurotransmitter release (Synapsin), and the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine synthesis (TH) across specific brain regions. Our findings suggest that alterations in phosphorylation events in specific brain centers may support cognitive/motivational responses to avoid pain.
