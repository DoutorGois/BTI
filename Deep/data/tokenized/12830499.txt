To study clinical features of temporal lobe epilepsy in children of different age, to trace disease development and to define risk factors for its occurrence and adverse course, 88 patients aged 3-14 years were examined. The study confirmed that temporal lobe epilepsy has its characteristic clinical features in children of different age. In children under 7 years of age, motor and autonomic paroxysms prevail accompanied in older children with psychomotor and psychosensory fits. With age the latter become more complicated. In children under 10 years of age psychomotor seizures prevail and in those older 10 years sensory and psychosensory ones predominate. Children over 10 years were characterized by polymorphic seizures or combinations of several kinds of seizures. The seizures can transform into either generalized or focal ones. In our study, the course of temporal lobe epilepsy was rather favorable. Seizures number reduced by more than a half in 82% of the cases. Adverse disease course was mainly detected in children with perinatal complications in their anamnesis and "spike-wave" complexes in EEG as well as in those suffering from psychomotor and psychosensory seizures.
