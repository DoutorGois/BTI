A radioimmunoassay was used to measure the calmodulin content in eleven brain areas of the rat. Calmodulin showed an uneven distribution. Various cortical regions, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala and substantia grisea were highest in calmodulin content (15 micrograms/mg protein). Locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarii (+A2 region) and A1 region, contained 7 micrograms calmodulin per mg protein and the cerebellum 4 micrograms/mg.
