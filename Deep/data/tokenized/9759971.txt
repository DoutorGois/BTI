In the present study we investigated the axotomy-induced expression of the proto-oncogene c-jun in young rat medial septal neurons and its regulation by nerve growth factor. First, medial septal neurons were retrogradely labelled by Fast Blue injection into the hippocampus at postnatal day 1 (P1). Rats of different developmental ages (P6, P9, P14, P21, P28 and P42) were then subjected to bilateral fimbria-fornix transection resulting in the axotomy of septohippocampal projection neurons. After the lesion, c-JUN immunoreactivity was observed in the nuclei of axotomized medial septal neurons of all stages examined, suggesting that c-JUN induction is an age-independent feature of axotomized medial septal neurons. Double immunolabelling for choline acetyltransferase and c-JUN or parvalbumin and c-JUN, respectively, revealed that both cholinergic and GABAergic septohippocampal projection neurons express c-JUN after axotomy. In addition, a co-localization of immunostaining for c-JUN and the neuropeptide galanin was found after lesion, as both proteins were induced in the same medial septal neurons following fimbria-fornix transection. Next, the regulation of c-JUN expression in axotomized medial septal neurons was studied in organotypic cultures of the medial septum. Axotomized medial septal neurons in culture did not express c-JUN in contrast to the in vivo situation. With the concept that nerve growth factor suppresses c-JUN expression, slice cultures of the medial septum were treated with antibodies against nerve growth factor. This treatment caused a dose-dependent increase in c-JUN-positive cells in these slice cultures. Simultaneous addition of nerve growth factor and antibodies against nerve growth factor resulted in the reversal of this effect. These data suggest an age-independent induction of c-JUN in axotomized medial septal neurons and its regulation by nerve growth factor.
