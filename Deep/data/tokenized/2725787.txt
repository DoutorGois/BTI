DSTA was analyzed for its effect, on the amplitude of population spikes (PS) evoked in CA1 area by the Shaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices. Bath application of DSTA (10(-6)-10(-5) mol/l) caused a pronounced increase in the amplitude of PS and appearance of secondary PS. Introduction of GABA restored it to the initial state. These results demonstrate that DSTA inhibits the synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
