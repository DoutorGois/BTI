Objective. To investigate the role of apoptosis in mechanisms of brain damage induced by +Gz exposures. Method. Twenty conscious SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups. Rats in the control group (n=4) were exposed to +1 Gz and rats in the 4 experimental groups (n=16) were exposed to +14 Gz for three times, each for 45 seconds with 30 min interval in between. All the +Gz exposured were on an animal centrifuge. The rat brains were taken 30 min, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h after the last centrifuge run and fixed and embedded. The apoptosis and expression changes of related gene bcl-2 and p53 were detected by terminal deoxynucleotide (correction of deoxynuleotide) transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique and immunohistochemical method, respectively. Result. Apoptotic cells and expression changes of bcl-2 and p53 were observed in CA1 subregion of rat hippocampus taken 6 h after repeated +Gz exposures, but returned to normal after 24-48 h. Conclusion. It suggests that apoptosis and expression changes of bcl-2 and p53 in rats hippocampus can be induced by repeated +Gz exposures and the apoptosis is one of the molecular mechanisms of brain damage induced by repeated +Gz exposures.
