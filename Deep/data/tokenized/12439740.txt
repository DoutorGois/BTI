Serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)R) transcripts undergo RNA editing, generating pharmacologically different isoforms. To test whether the RNA editing of 5-HT(2C)R is regulated by serotonergic activity, effects of cocaine or reserpine administration in the rat cerebral cortex were examined. Although these drugs have been known to alter serotonin metabolism, no alterations in the RNA editing were found by the sequencing analysis. Towards high throughput analysis, we developed a non-RI method that allows accurate and rapid estimation of RNA editing by combining the primer extension with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). By using this, RNA editing efficiencies of 5-HT(2C)R in the midbrain and hippocampus as well as the cerebral cortex were examined, and no alterations were found among these regions. Our method using DHPLC is applicable to examine association of RNA editing with various diseases.
