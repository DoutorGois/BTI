Ephrins and Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are cell-surface molecules that serve a multitude of functions in cell-cell communication in development, physiology, and disease. EphA4 is a promiscuous member of the EphA subclass of Eph receptors and can bind to both EphrinAs and EphrinBs. In addition to its well-established roles in guiding the development of neuronal connectivity, EphA4 has been implicated for a role in synaptic plasticity, vascular formation, axon regeneration, and central nervous system repair following injury. However, the study of its role in the adult stage has been hampered by confounding developmental defects in EphA4 germline mutants. Here, we report the generation and molecular characterization of an EphA4 conditional allele along with a novel null allele with a knockin fluorescent reporter gene (mCFP). The conditional allele will be useful in ascertaining postdevelopmental and/or cell type-specific function of EphA4 in physiology, injury, and disease.
