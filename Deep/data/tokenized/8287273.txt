The involvement of the hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the response to tonic pain was investigated in rats injected with formalin, either 50 microliters 10% or 50 microliters 0.1%. Hippocampal ChAT activity was found to be reduced both 30 and 60 min after injection of the higher concentration of formalin but only 30 min after the lower one. Results indicate that the decrease in ChAT activity depends upon the presence of the nociceptive input rather than its magnitude. The hippocampal formation is involved in the specific behavioural response to pain, namely licking.
