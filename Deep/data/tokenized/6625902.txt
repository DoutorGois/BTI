As demonstrate chronic experiments performed in 36 rabbits after application of physical loadings having different intensity and duration, during the process of adaptation and deadaptation, there is a close interconnection between the changes in morphological signs and the physiological data. The most profound morphological changes appear in nontrained animals under a maximal loading up to "capacity" (especially in the hemisphere cortex). The dynamics of the adaptive reactions in the hemisphere cortex and in the hippocamp are not the same: the most profound adaptive rearrangements are observed in the cerebral hemisphere cortex. During the deadaptation, the morphological changes increase.
