Seven patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were matched with ten healthy control subjects of similar age. Hippocampal volume, obtained from magnetic resonance images using an unbiased method, showed no difference between the two groups, whereas proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a significantly reduced concentration of N-acetylaspartate in the right hippocampus of CFS patients (p = 0.005).
