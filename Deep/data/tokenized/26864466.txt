This study seeks to determine whether knockdown of basal forebrain p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR) ) expression elicits increased hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in mature animals. Antisense (AS) oligonucleotides (oligos) targeting p75(NTR) were infused into the medial septal area of mature rats continuously for 4 weeks. In all rats, the cannula outlet was placed equidistant between the left and the right sides of the vertical diagonal band of Broca. We tested phosphorothioate (PS), morpholino (Mo), and gapmer (mixed PS/RNA) oligos. Gapmer AS infusions of 7.5 and 22 mug/day decreased septal p75(NTR) mRNA by 34% and 48%, respectively. The same infusions increased hippocampal ChAT activity by 41% and 55%. Increased hippocampal ChAT activity correlated strongly with septal p75(NTR) downregulation in individual rats. Infusions of PS and Mo AS oligos did not downregulate p75(NTR) mRNA or stimulate ChAT activity. These results demonstrate that p75(NTR) can dynamically regulate hippocampal ChAT activity in the mature CNS. They also reveal the different efficacies of three diverse AS oligo chemistries when infused intracerebrally. Among the three types, gapmer oligos worked best.
