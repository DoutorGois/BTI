Two limitations of the classical [14C]2-deoxyglucose (DG) method are the severe stress to which the restrained animals are exposed, and the difficulties with the anatomical analysis of the autoradiograms. The present study describes modifications which circumvent these limitations. Firstly, rats are provided with two chronic indwelling cannulas to allow blood sampling under unrestrained conditions. Absence of stress is demonstrated by low plasma corticosterone levels in the cannulated rats at the start of the experiment. The second modification concerns the image analysis system. The image of the autoradiogram is superimposed on the image of the identical histologically stained section in order to improve the accuracy of the structure identification. This approach enables the operator to delineate the anatomical brain structure in the histologically stained section and quantify the glucose uptake in the autoradiogram generated from this section. The reproducibility of the present quantitative measuring system is illustrated by glucose uptake measurements in different laminar zones of the various fields in the dorsal hippocampal formation. It is concluded that the present technical improvements of the classically applied [14C]2-deoxyglucose technique provide favourable conditions for the quantitative study on cerebral glucose uptake in normally behaving animals.
