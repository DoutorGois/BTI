AIM: Alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) is a ligand-gated Ca(2+)-permeable ion channel implicated in cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. Activation of alpha7 nAChR improves learning, memory, and sensory gating in animal models. To identify novel alpha7 nAChR agonists, we synthesized a series of small molecules and characterized a representative compound, Br-IQ17B, N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2,2,2]oct-3-yl]-5-bromoindolizine-2-carboxamide, which specifically activates alpha7 nAChR. METHODS: Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings were primarily used for screening in Xenopus oocytes expressing human alpha7 nAChR. Assays, including radioisotope ligand binding, Western blots, whole-cell recordings of hippocampal culture neurons, and spontaneous IPSC recordings of brain slices, were also utilized to evaluate and confirm the specific activation of alpha7 nAChR by Br-IQ17B. RESULTS: Br-IQ17B potently activates alpha7 nAChR with an EC50 of 1.8+/-0.2 mumol/L. Br-IQ17B is selective over other subtypes such as alpha4beta2 and alpha3beta4, but it blocks 5-HT3A receptors. Br-IQ17B displaced binding of the alpha7 blocker [(3)H]-MLA to hippocampal crude membranes with a Ki of 14.9+/-3.2 nmol/L. In hippocampal neurons, Br-IQ17B evoked alpha7-like currents that were inhibited by MLA and enhanced in the presence of the alpha7 PAM PNU-120596. In brain slice recordings, Br-IQ17B enhanced GABAergic synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons. Mechanistically, Br-IQ17B increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was MLA-sensitive. CONCLUSION: We identified the novel, potent, and selective alpha7 agonist Br-IQ17B, which enhances synaptic transmission. Br-IQ17B may be a helpful tool to understand new aspects of alpha7 nAChR function, and it also has potential for being developed as therapy for schizophrenia and cognitive deficits.
