Acute changes in neurochemical levels induced by ischemia were studied in the mouse brain. Contents of neurochemicals in the frontal, parietal and occipital cortices and hippocampus were determined immediately after 15 min of ischemia (0), and then at 15, 30, 90 and 180 min after recirculation following ischemia. These data were compared with those for sham-operated control mice. Choline (Ch) contents in ischemic animals increased by 530-630% from control levels immediately after ischemia, and returned to control levels by 90 min. Decreases in levels of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) were observed during 30 min after recirculation. There were no significant changes in levels of acetylcholine (ACh) or dopamine (DA), throughout recirculation. On the other hand, DA and 5-HT metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) significantly increased. Thus, comprehensively investigating the various neurotransmitters will provide meaningful information regarding the disturbance of central nervous system induced by cerebrovascular disease.
