Unit neuronal activity was investigated in the Rat lateral entorhinal cortex. Neurons were found which reacted to various sensory stimulations, auditory, visual, somesthetic, gustative and olfactory. This cortex is thus a site of convergence of sensory information which could be relayed further to the hippocampus.
