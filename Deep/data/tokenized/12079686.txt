Previous studies have shown different roles for proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Using a rat model of beta-amyloid induced neuropathology, we tested whether low molecular weight glycosaminoglycans (Certoparin and C6) could be useful as preventative agents and/or as a potential therapeutic treatment for AD. Chronic subcutaneous low molecular weight glycosaminoglycan injections beginning either before or after an intra-amygdaloid beta-amyloid-(25-35) injection blocked abnormal intracellular tau changes and reactive astrocytosis but did not affect beta-amyloid's aggregation state. Also, low molecular weight glycosaminoglycan injections beginning 1 day prior to sacrifice did not block the effects of beta-amyloid nor did injections of a disaccharide, suggesting chronic low molecular weight glycosaminoglycan treatment is needed to block the effects of beta-amyloid. Furthermore, these data indicate that there is a molecular weight range of active low molecular weight glycosaminoglycans in this model; and supports the investigation of low molecular weight glycosaminoglycans as a preventative and/or therapeutic treatment of beta-amyloid induced neuropathology.
