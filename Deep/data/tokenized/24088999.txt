INTRODUCTION: Effects of postresuscitation treatment with argon on neurologic recovery were investigated in a porcine model of cardiac arrest (CA) with an underlying acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded in 12 pigs, and CA was induced. After 8 min of untreated CA, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed for 5 min before defibrillation. Following resuscitation, animals were subjected to 4-h ventilation with 70% argon/30% oxygen or 70% nitrogen/30% oxygen. Myocardial function was echocardiographically assessed, and serum neuron-specific enolase was measured. Animals were observed up to 72 h for assessment of survival and neurologic recovery. RESULTS: All the animals were resuscitated and survived for 72 h, except for a control pig. Ventilation with argon did not have any detrimental effects on hemodynamics and respiratory gas exchange. All the six argon-treated animals had a fast and complete 72-h neurologic recovery, in contrast to only two of the six controls (P < 0.05). Seventy-two-hour neurologic alertness score and neurologic deficit score were, respectively, 100 and 0 in the argon group and 79 and 29 in the control one (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). Significantly lower increases in serum neuron-specific enolase (12% vs. 234%) and minimal histological brain injury (neuronal degeneration: 0 vs. 1) were also observed in argon-treated animals, in comparison to controls. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, postresuscitation treatment with argon allowed for a faster and complete neurologic recovery, without detrimental effects on hemodynamics and respiratory gas exchanges.
