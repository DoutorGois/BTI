Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that environmental enrichment (EE) in young rats results in improved learning ability and enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (mGluR-dependent LTP) resulting from sustained activation of p70S6 kinase. Here, we investigated whether 1-month EE is sufficient to improve hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and enhance hippocampal LTP in 23-24 month-old Fischer 344 male rats. Aged rats were housed in environmentally enriched, socially enriched, or standard housing conditions. We find that aged rats exposed to 1-month of EE demonstrate enhanced learning and memory relative to standard housed controls when tested in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition behavioral tasks. Furthermore, we find that environmentally enriched rats perform significantly better than socially enriched or standard housed rats in the radial-arm water maze and display enhanced mGluR5-dependent hippocampal LTP. Enhanced hippocampal function results from activity-dependent increases in the levels of mGluR5, Homer1c, and phospho-p70S6 kinase. These findings demonstrate that a short exposure of EE to aged rats can have significant effects on hippocampal function.
