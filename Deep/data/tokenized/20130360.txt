OBJECTIVE: To detect whether and where brain functional connectivity exists in the resting state of patients with early-onset schizophrenia by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). METHODS: Nineteen early-onset schizophrenic patients were diagnosed with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) of American Psychiatric Association. The 19 early-onset schizophrenic patients and another 19 healthy volunteers underwent fMRI in resting state. Cingulate gyrus was selected as region of interest and the difference was analyzed in the cingulate gyrus functional connectivity pattern between the 19 patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 19 matched controls using resting-state fMRI. A two-sample t test was performed on the individual in a voxel by voxel manner. RESULTS: Statistical map was set a combined threshold of P<0.005 and the number of voxel>20. Functional connectivity in the resting state was abnormal in the patients,including decreased functional connectivity and increased functional connectivity. The abnormal area was distributed all over the brain. The brain area with decreased functional connectivity included bilateral posterior cerebellar lobes, superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, gyrus rectus,hippocampus, cuneus gyrus,fusiform gyrus,middle occipital gyrus,inferior occipital gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus,right middle temporal gyrus, and right angular gyrus. The brain area with increased functional connectivity included left middle temporal and left inferior temporal gyrus. CONCLUSION: Abnormal cingulate gyrus functional connectivity of schizophrenia might exist in the resting state. Resting state fMRI is important for the research of schizophrenia.
