We used E1 mice, a ddY mouse-derived, autosomal mutant strain and a model of hereditary sensory-precipitated epilepsy, to test the hypothesis that epileptic susceptibility may be associated with the activity of voltage-dependent ion channels. We examined the saxitoxin binding capacity of the receptor site 1 of the Na+ channel alpha-subunit, the expression activity of the Na+ channel mRNA, the veratridine-induced 22Na+ influx in the brain synaptosomes, and the regional distribution of Na+ channels in the brain. Compared with control ddY mice, in E1 mice which have not experienced seizures, the number of Na+ channels in the brain synaptosomes increased by approximately 20% starting at the fourth postnatal week through the adult stage as determined by [3H]saxitoxin binding assay. Northern blot hybridization analysis showed excess expression of Na+ channel mRNA (by 30-40%) coincidentally with Na+ channel increases. Regional analysis using the saxitoxin binding assay demonstrated approximately 1.3-fold denser distribution of Na+ channels in the cortex and cerebellum but not the hippocampus and midbrain including thalamus of E1 mice compared to ddY mice. Scatchard plot analysis for saxitoxin binding in the cortex of E1 mouse brains revealed higher maximum binding capacity (Bmax) values (ddY, 4.43 +/- 0.28 pmol/mg protein; E1, 5.43 +/- 0.25 pmol/mg protein) without a change in Kd (ddY, 1.05 +/- 0.03 nM; E1, 1.03 +/- 0.01 nM). Lastly, veratridine-evoked 22Na+ influx, sensitive to tetrodotoxin, was increased approximately 45% in the cortical synaptosomes in six-week-old E1 mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
