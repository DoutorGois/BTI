Small amplitude depolarizations (fast prepotentials, spikelets) recorded in mammalian neurons are thought to represent either dendritic action potentials or presynaptic action potentials attenuated by gap junctions. We have used whole-cell recordings in an in vitro calcium-free model of epilepsy to record spikelets from CA1 neurons of the rat hippocampus. It was found that spikelet appearance was closely correlated with the occurrence of dye coupling between pyramidal neurons, indicating that both phenomena share a common substrate. Spikelets were characterized according to waveform (amplitude and shape) and temporal occurrence. Spikelet amplitudes were found to be invariant with neuronal membrane potential, and their pattern of occurrence was indistinguishable from patterns of action potential firing in these cells. Voltage and current recordings revealed a spikelet waveform that was usually biphasic, comprised of a rapid depolarization followed by a slower hyperpolarization. Numerical differentiation of spike bursts resulted in waveforms similar to recorded spikelet sequences, while numerical integration of spikelets yielded waveforms that were indistinguishable from action potentials. Modification of spikelet waveforms by the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium chloride suggests that spikelets may arise from both resistive and capacitive transmission of presynaptic action potentials. Intracellular alkalinization and acidification brought about by perfusion with NH4Cl caused changes in spikelet frequency, consistent with reported alterations of field burst activity in this model of epilepsy. These results suggest that spikelets result from gap junctional communication, and may be important determinants of neuronal activity during seizure-like activity.
