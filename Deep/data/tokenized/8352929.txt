Protein phosphorylation has been suggested to be correlated with brain development and with the molecular mechanism of behavioral effects of neuropeptides. The present study reports in vitro endogenous phosphorylation of P46, a membrane-associated protein that is changed during development of the rat hippocampus. This study indicated that the degree of endogenous phosphorylation may be correlated with the establishment of synaptic connections. Interestingly, P46 was proved to be identical to a well-known growth-associated protein B-50/GAP-43 in its identical apparent molecular weight, isoelectric point, phosphorylation dependence, and the cross immunoreaction of monoclonal anti-B-50/GAP-43 antibody and P46. Moreover, neonatal administration of neuropeptide ZNC(C)PR could facilitate the developmental progress of P46 endogenous phosphorylation. It is suggested that the changes in P46 phosphorylation could be involved in the cellular mechanism of ZNC(C)PR behavioral effects on learning.
