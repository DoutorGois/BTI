Cultures of purified rat embryonic spinal cord motoneurons were used to investigate the capacity of the neurons to survive rabies virus infection in vitro. In crude primary spinal cord cultures, neurons did not survive more than 2 days after rabies virus infection with the fixed strain Challenge Virus Standard. In contrast, virus-infected purified motoneurons resisted cytolysis for at least 7 days, as also did infected motoneurons treated with conditioned medium sampled from rabies virus-infected crude spinal cord cultures. This survival rate was also observed when motoneurons were grown in the presence of astrocytes or fibroblasts and it was not dependent on the presence of growth factors in the culture medium. Moreover, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling experiments showed that only 30% of infected motoneurons were apoptotic after 7 days of infection. In vivo, despite the massive infection of the spinal cord in infected rat neonates, the moderate number of apoptotic cells in the ventral horn suggests that only a few motoneurons were affected by this mechanism of cell death. Morphometric analyses showed that motoneurons' axon elongated at a comparable rate in virus-infected and noninfected cultures, a sign of high metabolic activity maintained in rabies virus-infected motoneurons. In contrast, hippocampus neurons were susceptible to rabies virus infection, because 70% of infected neurons were destroyed within 3 days, a large proportion of them being apoptotic. These experiments suggest that spinal cord motoneurons consist in a neuronal population that survive rabies virus infection because the viral induction of apoptosis is delayed in these neurons. They suggest also that paralyses frequently observed in rabid animals could be the consequence of dysfunctions of the locomotor network or of the spinal cord motoneurons themselves, whose parameters could be studied in vitro.
