Cannabinoids exert powerful action on various forms of synaptic plasticity. These retrograde messengers modulate GABA and glutamate release from presynaptic terminals by acting on presynaptic CB1 receptors. In particular, they inhibit long-term potentiation (LTP) elicited by electrical stimulation of excitatory pathways in rat hippocampus. Recently, LTP of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) induced by exogenous ATP has been thoroughly explored. The present study demonstrates that cannabinoids inhibit ATP-induced LTP in hippocampal slices of rat. Administration of 10 muM of ATP led to strong inhibition of fEPSPs in CA1/CA3 hippocampal synapses. Within 40 min after ATP removal from bath solution, robust LTP was observed (fEPSP amplitude comprised 130.1 +/- 3.8% of control, n = 10). This LTP never appeared when ATP was applied in addition to cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (100 nM). Selective CB1 receptor antagonist, AM251 (500 nM), completely abolished this effect of WIN55,212-2. Our data indicate that like canonical LTP elicited by electrical stimulation, ATP-induced LTP is under control of CB1 receptors.
