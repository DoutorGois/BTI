The autoradiographic method with L-[35S]methionine was used to examine the effect of acute administration of L-triiodothyronine on local rates of brain protein synthesis in free-moving adult rats. Triiodothyronine was given intraperitoneally at doses of 12.5 or 25 micrograms kg-1. It did not modify the rate of plasma methionine incorporation in the 40 brain regions examined, despite a 4- to 8-fold increase of plasma free triiodothyronine levels. Biochemical analysis confirmed that triiodothyronine (25 micrograms kg-1) had no apparent effect on the overall rate of protein synthesis in the brain as a whole. These results suggest that changes in the circulating levels of thyroid hormones do not exert a general and direct metabolic effect in brain of intact adult rats.
