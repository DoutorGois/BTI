Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability towards proteins was determined in rats 4 h after intrastriatal kainic or ibotenic acid application, using Evans blue as indicator. Whereas, with the exception of the unspecific damage in cortex, after ibotenic acid BBB remained intact in deep brain areas. Evans blue leakage was found ipsilateral to the kainic acid injection, occasionally in striatum, thalamus and amygdala and regularly in hippocampus. There it was confined to the fimbria and the CA3 field. Only rarely a mirror focus-like staining was present in the contralateral hippocampus. The ultrastructural investigation revealed that BBB opening in CA3 is due to increased transendothelial pinocytosis; the tight junctions were intact. Thus, changes in the microenvironment around vessels, elicited by kainic acid and/or seizures, might be responsible for BBB opening.
