The effects of CDP-choline (citicoline), cytidine monophosphate or cytidine on the number of CA1 hippocampal neurones surviving five-minute forebrain ischaemia have been evaluated in gerbils. The substances tested were given in daily doses equivalent on a molar basis to 500 mg/kg CDP-choline, starting immediately after ischaemia. On day five the brains were perfused, postfixed, cut into 10 microm slices and stained with cresyl violet, and the number of neurones in the CA1 sectors was counted manually under a light microscope at magnification x 400. The results indicate a significant degree of protection provided by citicoline, but no protection by cytidine monophosphate or cytidine. The choline moiety of CDP-choline appears to be essential for the neuroprotective properties of the drug.
