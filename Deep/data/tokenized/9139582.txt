Different approaches to the study of the relationship between hippocampal electrical activity and behavior have shown that hippocampal EEG varies according to different behavioral aspects. In particular, a rhythmic slow activity (RSA, Theta rhythm) can be recorded during voluntary movements and to a lesser degree during immobility. In laboratory experiments, we tried to evaluate the influence on the hippocampal EEG of external stimuli evoking emotional or cognitive responses. Similar electrical responses were observed during animal hypnosis and in the presence of threatening stimuli, while some electrical parameters, such as frequency and rhythmicity, varied according to the nature of the stimulus. In order to have greater and clearer information, we adopted a neuro-ethological approach ch. which allowed us to classify behavior into several categories and to record the hippocampal EEG during natural behavior. The influence exerted on hippocampal electrical activity by novel stimuli and the electrical profiles recorded during exploratory behavior or alert or quiet immobility allowed us to classify the hippocampal EEG on the basis of frequency and rhythmicity. Moreover, the study of social behavior showed that the variations of the electrical parameters of the hippocampal activity depended on the characteristics of the stimulus and that typical electrical profiles could be observed in immobile or motor activities caused by specific stimuli. Socially dominant and subordinate rabbits could also be distinguished on the basis of hippocampal electrical parameters.
