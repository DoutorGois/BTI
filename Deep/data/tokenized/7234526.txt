This study presents general observations of neurological examination in rats after various CNS manipulations. The examination consisted of neurologic reactions as described in Bures and co-workers. Subjects studied were controls, hippocampal irradiates, and animals with cerebellar lesions or midline cerebellar transplants. Utility of the procedure as an adjunct to more detailed testing is discussed.
