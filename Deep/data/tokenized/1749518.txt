In the rat hippocampal slice, we evaluated the effects of potassium depolarization on phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (E1 alpha, mol. wt. approximately 41 kDa) using an in vitro back-titration assay. The in vitro back-titration phosphorylation of El alpha was maximal following 30 s of depolarization and remained elevated for up to 3 min following termination of the depolarizing pulse. Possible significance of and mechanisms for the depolarization-induced changes in E1 alpha phosphorylation are discussed.
