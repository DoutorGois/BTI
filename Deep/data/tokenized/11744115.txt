The paired-pulse paradigm was used to study the maturation of CA1 population spikes (PS) in the hippocampal slices of Wistar rats. Measurements were taken daily, from postnatal day (PN) 14 to PN27. In the slices from younger animals, inputs exhibit strong paired-pulse profile, which may be associated with low synaptic efficacy. Both responses increased during the third week of life, however, PS1 increased faster so that the PS1/PS2 ratio increased during the early period and remained increased thereafter. This may reflect postnatal modifications of synaptic transmission mediating the increase in hippocampal responses. Modifications of synaptic efficacy are prevailing during early phases while other mechanisms take over at later stages. Partial correlation analysis suggests that the decline of PS amplitude after PN19 may be due to the decrease in the number of connected neurons rather than to modifications of the synaptic efficacy. Thus, the actual direction and magnitude of postnatal PS maturation is suggested to depend on the balance of these two factors. The transient decline of PS amplitude coincided with a period of caspase-3 activation. There was a clear general trend for caspase-3 activity to decrease before PN17, while the inverse trend was observed during next period up to PN21.
