One memory disorder that is potentially treatable with antiepileptic drugs is transient epileptic amnesia (TEA). Working diagnostic consensus criteria for TEA include: (1) a history of recurrent witnessed episodes of transient amnesia; (2) confirmation by a reliable witness that cognitive functions other than memory are intact during typical episodes; and (3) evidence for a diagnosis of epilepsy. We describe a case with both complex partial seizures and episodes of TEA. This is the first reported case of a neurosurgical intervention for symptoms resembling those described in refractory TEA. Video/EEG, 3-T MRI, neuropathology, and neurological as well as neuropsychological findings are presented with postsurgical clinical outcome. The patient underwent right anterior amygdalohippocampectomy for symptoms resembling refractory TEA with additional complex partial seizures at our epilepsy surgical center. She remained seizure free at the 15-month follow-up, and memory complaints remitted. This case report illustrates one memory disorder, transient epileptic amnesia, that is potentially treatable with antiepileptic drugs or surgery.
