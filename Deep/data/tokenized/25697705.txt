Stress exposure and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system have been implicated as mechanistically involved in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and associated rodent models. In particular, the major stress receptor, CRF receptor type 1 (CRFR1), modulates cellular activity in many AD-relevant brain areas, and has been demonstrated to impact both tau phosphorylation and amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathways. The overarching goal of our laboratory is to develop and characterize agents that impact the CRF signaling system as disease-modifying treatments for AD. In the present study, we developed a novel transgenic mouse to determine whether partial or complete ablation of CRFR1 was feasible in an AD transgenic model and whether this type of treatment could impact Abeta pathology. Double transgenic AD mice (PSAPP) were crossed to mice null for CRFR1; resultant CRFR1 heterozygous (PSAPP-R1(+/-)) and homozygous (PSAPP-R1(-/-)) female offspring were used at 12 months of age to examine the impact of CRFR1 disruption on the severity of AD Abeta levels and pathology. We found that both PSAPP-R1(+/-) and PSAPP-R1(-/-) had significantly reduced Abeta burden in the hippocampus, insular, rhinal, and retrosplenial cortices. Accordingly, we observed dramatic reductions in Abeta peptides and AbetaPP-CTFs, providing support for a direct relationship between CRFR1 and Abeta production pathways. In summary, our results suggest that interference of CRFR1 in an AD model is tolerable and is efficacious in impacting Abeta neuropathology.
