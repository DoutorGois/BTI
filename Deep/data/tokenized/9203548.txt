The influence of entorhinal cortex lesions on behaviour and concommitant changes in synaptophysin immunoreactivity (IR) in the denervated dentate gyrus was assessed. Male, C57/B6 mice received either bilateral (BI), unilateral (UNI), or no lesion (SHAM) to the entorhinal cortex. At various stages post-lesion the animals were evaluated in tests to examine neurological and cognitive (spatial and cued learning, Morris water maze) function. UNI lesioned animals from 6-36 days post-lesion showed no neurological nor marked cued learning deficit, yet a profound spatial learning deficit. However by 70 days post-lesion, spatial learning ability was clearly evident. In contrast, BI lesioned animals showed severe spatial learning deficits throughout the test period (6-70 days), cued learning was also impaired. In parallel groups of UNI lesioned mice, 6-36 days post-lesion there was a marked reduction (-40%) in synaptophysin IR in the dentate gyrus molecular layer. However by 70 days post-lesion a clear increase in this measure was noted. Changes in the expression of the growth associated protein, GAP43, were also noted over this period. Taken together, the present results suggest some recovery of spatial learning following unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions in mice. This behavioural recovery of a hippocampally dependant task may be associated with a recovery of function related to the synaptic remodelling and elevation of synapse number in the denervated hippocampus, as evidenced by changes in synaptophysin and GAP43 IR.
