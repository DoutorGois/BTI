1-Bromopropane (1-BP), an alternative to ozone-depleting solvents, exhibits neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity in animals and humans. The present study investigated the effects of exposure to 1-BP on expression of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the rat brain to explore possible biomarkers for central neurotoxicity and find brain regions sensitive for microarray analysis. Thirty-six F344 rats were divided at random into four equal groups of nine and exposed to 1-BP at 0, 400, 800 and 1000 ppm for 8 h/day; 7 days/week for 4 weeks. Total RNA from different brain regions was extracted and real-time PCR was conducted to quantify the mRNA levels of serotonin, dopamine and GABA receptors. Western blot analysis for specific regions of interest was also carried out to determine the protein levels. The mRNAs of 5HTr2a, D2R and GABAa1 were down regulated in a 1-BP dose-dependent manner in the hippocampus. The mRNA levels of 5HTr1a, 5HTr2a, D1R and GABAa1 were significantly decreased in the cortex of rats exposed to 800 ppm, but not to 1000 ppm. The mRNAs of 5HTr1a and 5HTr3a in the pons-medulla were decreased in rats exposed to 400 ppm or higher concentrations. The mRNA expression of D2R in the hippocampus and 5HTr1a and 5HTr3a in the pons-medulla oblongata were the most sensitive indicators of 1-BP neurotoxicity. The results suggest that mRNA expression analysis is useful in identifying brain regions susceptible to 1-BP, as well as providing potential biomarkers for central nervous system toxicity.
