Cho et al. (Reports, 2 October 2015, p. 82) report that gene repression after contextual fear conditioning regulates hippocampal memory formation. We observe low levels of expression for many of the top candidate genes in the hippocampus and robust expression in the choroid plexus, as well as repression at 4 hours after contextual fear conditioning, suggesting the inclusion of choroid plexus messenger RNAs in Cho et al. hippocampal samples.
