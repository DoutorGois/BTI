The various biochemical cascades that follow primary brain injury result in secondary brain injury which can adversely affect the clinical outcome. Over the last few years it has been well established that molecules like erythropoietin (Epo) have a neuroprotective role in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). Epo is shown to produce this effect by modulating multiple cellular processes, including apoptosis, inflammation, and regulation of cerebral blood flow. Derivatives of Epo, including asialo Epo and carbamylated Epo, have been developed to separate the neuroprotective properties from the erythropoiesis-stimulating activities of Epo which may have adverse effects in clinical situations. Peptides that mimic a portion of the Epo molecule, including Helix B surface peptide and Epotris, have also been developed to isolate the neuroprotective activities. The TBI model in rodents most commonly used to study the effect of Epo and these derivatives in TBI is controlled cortical impact injury, which is a model of focal contusion following a high velocity impact to the parietal cortex. Following TBI, rodents are given Epo or an Epo derivative vs. placebo and the outcome is evaluated in terms of physiological parameters (cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure), behavioral parameters (motor and memory), and histological parameters (contusion volumes, hippocampus cell counts).
