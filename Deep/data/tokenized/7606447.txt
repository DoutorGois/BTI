The aim of the present study was to determine whether calcium channel antagonists attenuated hypoxia/hypoglycemia- or glutamate-induced reduction in 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake of hippocampal slices obtained from ethanol withdrawal rats. Ethanol withdrawal significantly potentiated the hypoxia/hypoglycemia- and glutamate-induced reductions in 2-DG uptake of hippocampal slices. Both nifedipine and flunarizine exhibited attenuating effects on ethanol withdrawal-induced potentiation of impairment of 2-DG uptake caused by hypoxia/hypoglycemia or glutamate. Hypoxia/hypoglycemia-induced deficit of 2-DG uptake was prevented by ethanol, but chronic consumption of ethanol resulted in the development of tolerance to neuroprotective effect. These findings suggest that the increased sensitivity of neurons to ischemic damage by ischemia may involve in the increased activity of calcium channels in the hippocampus.
