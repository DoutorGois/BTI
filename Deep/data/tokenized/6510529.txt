In response to electrical self-stimulation of the hypothalamus, 5 out of 22 neurons of the hippocampus (fields CA2, CA3, dentate fascia) were inhibited and 9 neurons were activated. Micro-iontophoretic application of noradrenaline weakened the activation response and had no obvious effect on the inhibitory responses. The data obtained disagree with the noradrenergic hypothesis of positive reinforcement mediation (at the level of the brain hippocampal structures).
