Posterior parietal, hippocampal, or sham-lesioned rats were tested for the acquisition of a non-monotonic serial learning task. The performance of control rats and those with a posterior parietal lesion was similar, while those with hippocampal damage demonstrated a working memory deficit. The results are integrated with contemporary conceptualizations of hippocampal and posterior parietal cortex involvement in learning and memory for non-spatial tasks.
