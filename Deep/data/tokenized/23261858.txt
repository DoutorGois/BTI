V1aR has a well established role in the neural regulation of adult mammalian social behavior. The role of V1aR in developmentally emerging social behavior is less well understood. We mapped V1aR at post-natal day 8 (P8) and demonstrate developmentally-specific expression in the neocortex and hippocampus. We tested the ability of male and female C57BL/6J mice to show orienting bias to a familiar odor at this age. We demonstrate that females, but not males, show an orienting bias for odors previously paired with the mother, which is eliminated by V1aR signaling.
