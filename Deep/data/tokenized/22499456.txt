Imaging has been used in clinical trials for decades and has proven a useful biomarker in many disease states. Although imaging is not widely used in clinical practice for AD patient care, many pharmaceutical and biotech companies have relied on this technique for eligibility, safety and efficacy roles in their trials. In this overview, issues with standardization, validation and regulations will be discussed in order to gain a better understanding of the benefits, risks and impact on study conduct of adding imaging to Alzheimer's disease clinical trials.
