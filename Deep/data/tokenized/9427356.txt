Guanidino compounds play specific physiological and pathological roles in the central nervous system. We investigated the effect of an intrahippocampal infusion of GMP (a guanidino compound) administered immediately post-training on the inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm in rats. Bilateral intrahippocampal micro-injection of GMP (0-30 nmol) caused a dose-dependent increase in test step-down latencies which was completely reversed by intrahippocampal co-administration of muscimol or baclofen (GABA agonists) or preadministration (15 min pre-training, i.p.) of MK-801 (an NMDA antagonist). These results provide evidence for a participation of GABA and NMDA receptors in the GMP-induced increase in the test step-down latencies.
