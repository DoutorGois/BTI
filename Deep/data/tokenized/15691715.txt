Homer proteins mediate molecular rearrangements leading to changes in spine morphology. This points to a role of Homer in learning and memory. Homer 1c features both the ligand binding domain and a coiled-coiled domain for self-multimerization. Homer 1a lacks the coiled-coiled domain. Here, we report a new isoform which we termed 1g, lacking the Homer ligand binding domain. We dissected the functional roles of the individual Homer 1 domains, encoded by Homer 1a, 1c, and 1g, in vivo. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of these forms in the hippocampus of adult rats has opposing effects on learning behavior. Increased levels of Homer 1a impaired hippocampal-dependent memory, while Homer 1g and 1c slightly enhanced memory performance. Homer 1g induced anxiety. Moreover, AAV-Homer 1a animals showed attenuation of electrographic seizures in a model of status epilepticus. These results suggest that Homer 1 proteins play an active role in behavioral plasticity.
