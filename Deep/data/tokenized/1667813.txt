Voltage-activated Ca2+ channel currents were recorded from cultured rat hippocampal neurones using the whole-cell clamp technique with Ba2+ as a charge carrier. After breaking into the cell the amplitude of low-voltage activated Ca2+ channel current increased to a new steady value within 1 min whereas several minutes were required for a full development of the high-voltage activated current (IHVA). Pretreatment of cells with calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine or W-13) or protein phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, fastened the development of IHVA. Trifluoperazine (6-40 microM) also increased IHVA when applied after breaking into the cell in standard external solution. Incubation of cells in the presence of permeable precursor of Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA, was without effect. The effects of all inhibitors studied allow to suggest that IHVA in intact cells is largely masked due to activity of calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase.
