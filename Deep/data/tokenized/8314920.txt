A model system for studying cerebral microvasculature is presented in which submerged in vitro brain slices are examined by computerized videomicroscopy. Brain slices are superfused continuously with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, while blood vessels are monitored using a transmission light microscope with water immersion objectives. The responses to well-characterized vasoactive compounds indicate that basic physiological characteristics are maintained in this preparation. This model system represents a simple and rapid technique for studying cerebrovascular responses under conditions in which vessels are surrounded by their normal cellular microenvironment. An additional advantage of this technique is the ability to perform simultaneous electrophysiological recordings in identified neurons. This will facilitate the study of interactions between neuronal and vascular elements and may help elucidate mechanisms underlying the local regulation of cerebral microvasculature.
