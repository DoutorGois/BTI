An interaction of harmaline (HA), a beta-carboline, with benzodiazepine (Bzd) receptors, has been reported. HA perfusion induced a similar, although less potent, depressing effect as clonazepam (CLO) on the amplitude of the population spikes (PS) evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices. The suppressant effect of both CLO and HA on PS amplitude was reversed by simultaneous perfusion of the GABA antagonist picrotoxin. These results suggest that HA acts as a weak or partial agonist at Bzd receptors.
