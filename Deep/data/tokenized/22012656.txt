Mutations in the CLN6 gene cause a variant form of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a relentless neurodegenerative disease that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in humans and in the naturally occurring nclf mouse strain. The CLN6 protein is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, but it has an unknown function. To develop a molecular understanding of neurodegeneration induced by mutations in CLN6, we examined the spatial and temporal distribution of Cln6 mRNA expression in murine brain. By using Northern blot and tissue qPCR array techniques, a single Cln6 transcript was detected throughout the adult brain, with greatest expression in the cerebellum and hypothalamus. Real-time qPCR showed 2.4-4-fold increases in Cln6 mRNA levels in the cortex and cerebellum during the first 28 days of life, with less prominent enhancement of expression in the hippocampus. In situ hybridization analyses demonstrated Cln6 expression in brainstem, dentate gyrus, and hippocampal neurons of newborn P0 mice. From P14 onward, Cln6 expression is widely distributed throughout the brain and is most prominent in cells of cortical layers II-VI, the Purkinje cell layer, dentate gyrus, and hippocampal CA1 region of adult mice. In different regions of the brain in P0 and P28 nclf mice, the Cln6 mRNA abundance was reduced by 30-40% compared with control mice. These findings implicate Cln6 in the survival and maturation of specific neuronal populations during development and make it possible to compare regional Cln6 expression with the distribution of subsequent pathology.
