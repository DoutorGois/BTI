It is well known that chronic, excessive consumption of alcohol can cause brain damage/structural changes in the regions important for neurocognitive function. Some of the damages are permanent, while others are reversible. Molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced and/or -related brain damage are largely unknown, although it is generally believed that three factors (ethanol, nutritious and hepatic factors) play important roles. Recently, we have been employing a high-throughput proteomics technology to investigate several alcohol-sensitive brain regions from uncomplicated and hepatic cirrhosis-complicated alcoholics to understand the mechanisms of alcohol effects on the CNS at the level of protein expression. The changes of protein expression profiles in the hippocampus of alcoholic subjects were firstly demonstrated using 2D gel electrophoresis-based proteomics. Protein expression profiles identified in the hippocampus of alcoholic subjects were significantly different from those previously identified by our group in other brain regions of the same alcoholic cases, possibly indicating that these different brain regions react differently to chronic alcohol ingestion at the level of protein expression. Identified changes of protein expression associated with astrocyte and oxidative stress may indicate the possibility that increased levels of CNS ammonia and reactive oxygen species induced by alcoholic mild hepatic damage/dysfunction could cause selective damage in astrocytes of the hippocampus. Although our data did not demonstrate any evidence of direct alcohol effects to induce the alteration of protein expression in association with brain damage, high-throughput neuroproteomics approaches have proved to have the potential to dissect the mechanisms of complex brain disorders. Proteomics studies on human hippocampus, an important region for neurocognitive function and psychiatric illnesses (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, alcoholism and schizophrenia) are still sparse, and further investigation is warranted to understand the underlying mechanisms.
