We evaluated the therapeutic effects of two noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, MgCl2 and ketamine, both individually and together, on cognitive dysfunction observed following parasagittal fluid-percussion (FP) brain injury in the rat. Using a modified Morris water maze technique, we found significant attenuation of post-traumatic memory dysfunction in animals treated with either MgCl2 (125 mumol) or ketamine (4 mg/kg) (P < 0.005). Combined MgCl2 and ketamine treatment also preserved memory function (P < 0.005), with no apparent additive effect.
