GABAergic synaptic responses were studied by direct, monosynaptic activation of GABAergic interneurons in the CA1 region of in vitro hippocampal slices from rats made tolerant to the benzodiazepine, flurazepam. Monosynaptic IPSPs were elicited in CA1 pyramidal neurons, following 1 week oral flurazepam administration, by electrical stimulation at the stratum oriens/stratum pyramidale or stratum radiatum/ stratum-lacanosum border < or = 0.5 mm from the recording electrode plane. Excitatory input to pyramidal cells and interneurons was eliminated by prior superfusion of the glutamate receptor antagonists, APV (50 microM) and DNQX (10 microM). GABAA receptor-mediated early IPSPs were further isolated by perfusion of the GABAB antagonist, CGP 35348 (25 microM) or by diffusion of Cs- from the recording electrode. GABAB receptor-mediated late IPSPs were pharmacologically isolated by perfusion of the GABAA antagonist, picrotoxin (50 microM). There was a significant decrease in the amplitude of pharmacologically isolated early and late IPSPs in FZP-treated neurons without a change in passive membrane properties. A shift of the early IPSP, but not the late IPSP, reversal potential in FZP-treated neurons suggested that a change in the driving force for anions, presumably Cl, in CA1 neurons was one important factor related to the decreased early IPSP amplitude after prolonged activation of GABAA receptors by flurazepam. A decreased early IPSP amplitude accompanied by a decreased late IPSP amplitude suggested that presynaptic GABA release onto FZP-treated pyramidal cells may also be reduced. We conclude from these data that an impairment of GABAergic transmission in CA1 pyramidal neurons associated with the development of tolerance during chronic benzodiazepine treatment may be related to the regulation of both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms at the GABA synapse.
