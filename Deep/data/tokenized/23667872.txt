The effects of original Russian preparations, derivatives of 3-hydroxypyridine and succinic acid (emoxipin, reamberin, mexidol), on the cellular composition of the cerebrocortical and diencephalic structures were studied and correlations of shifts in the cellular composition with changes in the severity of hyperglycemia in rats with alloxan diabetes were analyzed. The efficiency of 3-hydroxypyridine and succinic acid derivatives was evaluated in comparison with alpha-lipoic acid. Seven injections of the optimal doses of all the studied drugs prevented the neuron loss in layers I-III of the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition, emoxipin, reamberin, and alpha-lipoic acid prevented astrocyte loss in the neocortical surface layers and of neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. Reamberin limited microglial infiltration of the hippocampal field CA1. Injection of alpha-lipoic acid augmented the increase in astrocyte count in the paraventricular nucleus and potentiated the reduction of tigroid granularity of CA1 field neurons. Emoxipin and mexidol caused an increase in the counts of neurons and oligodendrocytes in CA1 field. By contrast, reamberin and alpha-lipoic acid reduced the counts of neurons and oligodendrocytes, respectively, in this hippocampal zone. More favorable effects of emoxipin and mexidol vs. reamberin and alpha-lipoic acid on the cellular composition of the hippocampus of rats with alloxan diabetes were explained by more effective correction of hyperglycemia under the effect of 3-hydroxypyridine derivatives.
