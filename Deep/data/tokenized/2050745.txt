We used quantitative autoradiography to measure the regional rate constants of blood-to-brain transport of lactate in normal rats and rats treated with kainic acid. Mean cerebral values of lactate transport rate constants were not significantly different between the normal and treated rats, being 0.13 and 0.14 min-1 (ml/g), respectively. Regional values were also generally similar between the groups, but structures that are known to be activated by kainic acid showed increased values in the treated rats compared with rates in the controls. Our measured values of lactate transport rate constants are approximately 50% as great as those published for glucose, indicating that blood-brain transfer of lactate can be significant. This observation supports the hypothesis that radiolabel derived from glucose can leave the brain as radiolabeled lactate in conditions in which intracerebral lactate concentration rises, a hypothesis that has previously been presented to explain differences between rates of accumulation of radiolabel derived from deoxyglucose and glucose in such conditions.
