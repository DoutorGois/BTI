The importance of well characterized calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) II in hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) is widely well established; however, several CaMKs other than CaMKII are not yet clearly characterized and understood. Here we report the activation of CaMKIV, which is phosphorylated by CaMK kinase and localized predominantly in neuronal nuclei, and its functional role as a cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) kinase in high frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. CaMKIV was transiently activated in neuronal nuclei after HFS, and the activation returned to the basal level within 30 min. Phosphorylation of CREB, which is a CaMKIV substrate, and expression of c-Fos protein, which is regulated by CREB, increased during LTP. This increase was inhibited mainly by CaMK inhibitors and also by an inhibitor for mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, although to a lesser extent. Our results suggest that CaMKIV functions as a CREB kinase and controls CREB-regulated gene expression during HFS-induced LTP in the rat hippocampal CA1 region.
