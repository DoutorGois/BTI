OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of receptor-interacting protein of 140,000 (RIP140) in the developmental brain. METHODS: The brain tissues of 15-day-old and 20-day-old fetal Balb/c mice and 1, 7, 14, 28, 42, and 56-day-old postnatal mice were collected. The expression of RIP140 was examined by immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to quantify the expression of the mRNA and protein levels of RIP140. RESULTS: (1) Immunochemistry showed that RIP140 was expressed extensively in the brain of embryonic and newborn mice, mainly present in the neurons in many different brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and pituitary gland. The cellular location of RIP140 was confined to the nucleus. (2) Real-time PCR revealed that the RIP140 mRNA expression in brain was in an increment as the time went by, peaked on the 7th day after birth, then was in a instable level after that until the adulthood. (3) Western blotting indicated that the protein level of RIP140 was coincident with the mRNA level [r(s) = 0.767, P = 0.016 (bilateral)]. CONCLUSION: The expression and role of RIP140 may be involved in the whole neurodevelopment stages of brain, and may take part in the development and the function of the brain.
