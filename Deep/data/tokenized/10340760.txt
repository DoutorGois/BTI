Increasing evidence supports an essential role for interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development, differentiation, as well as de- and re-generation of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Both IL-6 and its specific receptor (IL-6R) are expressed on neurons and glial cells including astrocytes. In this study, we have analyzed the responses of primary rat astrocytes of various brain regions to IL-6 with respect to morphological changes and neurotrophin expression. Since IL-6 alone failed to initiate effects on astrocytes, we have examined whether the soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) can modulate the responsiveness of to IL-6 in these cells. For this purpose, we used a highly active fusion protein of IL-6 and sIL-6R, which is designated Hyper-IL-6 (H-IL-6). We show that treatment of cultured astrocytes with Hyper-IL-6 promotes region-specific morphological changes of GFAP-positive astrocytes from typical stellate- to fibrous-like cells. In addition, we find that Hyper-IL-6 induces expression of neurotrophins (NTs) of the nerve growth factor (NGF)-family in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, astrocytes of various brain regions show differing patterns of cytokine-induced NT expression: NGF is maximally induced in cortex and hippocampus, NT-3 in hippocampus, and NT-4/5 in cortex and cerebellum. In summary, our results indicate that IL-6 in conjunction with sIL-6R regulates specific neurotrophin expression in astrocytes in a brain region dependent manner. Thus, the IL-6 system provides a local supply of neurotrophins that participate in diverse CNS functions such as protection of neurons from insults, neuronal survival, and neuro-immune responses.
