In a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) of symptomatic epilepsy in the Chinese population, the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele was rs2292096 [G] (P=1.0x10(-8), odds ratio [OR]=0.63), in the CAMSAP1L1 gene (also known as CAMSAP2). Here, we report that rs2292096 genotypes tended to associate with expression of CAMSAP1L1 RNA in the temporal lobe (p=0.054) and hippocampus (p=0.20) of epilepsy surgery patients, with expression tending to increase with the G allele. CAMSAP1L1 and beta-tubulin double immunofluorescence exhibited partial overlap. CAMSAP1L1 siRNA transfection of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with or without retinoic acid reduced the CAMSAP1L1 protein level nearly 60% and stimulated neurite outgrowth, as measured by total length, number of processes and number of branches. Therefore, the rs2292096 G allele of CAMSAP1L1, which was associated with reduced risk of symptomatic epilepsy, tended to associate with increased expression of CAMSAP1L1, which represses neurite outgrowth. Greater neurite growth in response to brain insults might increase formation of ectopic neural circuits and thus the risk of epileptogenesis.
