Temporal changes in cholinergic functions following transient cerebral ischemia (10 min) were studied in the hippocampus of awake unrestrained gerbils using in vivo microdialysis. These data were compared with the results for temporal change in the area of each CA1 cell soma, measured with a microcomputer imaging device. KCl-induced release of acetylcholine (ACh) tended to be lower within 1 day after recirculation, and was significantly lower on the 4th, 7th and 14th days. Atropine-induced release of ACh gradually decreased over the test period. In histological estimation, no differences were observed within the 1st day, but a significant decrease of the area of CA1 cell soma was observed from the 4th to 14th days. Moreover, ischemia over 2 min decreased KCl- and atropine-induced ACh release on the 14th day without significant changes of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell. From these results, it is clear that ischemia produced dysfunction of hippocampal cholinergic neurons, and that dysfunction of the hippocampal cholinergic system following transient ischemia precedes pyramidal cell damage in the hippocampal CA1 subfield.
