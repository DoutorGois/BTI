Converging evidence indicates that the medial temporal lobe participates not only in memory but also in visual object processing. We investigated hippocampal contributions to visual object identification by recording event-related potentials directly from within the hippocampus during a visual object identification task with spatially filtered pictures of real objects presented at different levels of filtering. Hippocampal responses differentiated between identified and unidentified visual objects within a time window of 200-900 ms after stimulus presentation: identified objects elicited a small negative component peaking around 300 ms (hippocampal-N300) and a large positive component, around 650 ms (hippocampal-P600), while the N300 was increased and the P600 was reduced in amplitude in response to unidentified objects. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus proper contributes to the identification of visual objects discriminating from the very early between identified and unidentified meaningful visual objects.
