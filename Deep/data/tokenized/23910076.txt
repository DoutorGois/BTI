Tet proteins and DNA demethylation are key regulators of embryonic stem cells, but their roles in development and tissue stem cells remain unclear. In this issue, Zhang et al. (2013) show that Tet1 regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis by controlling progenitor proliferation, and Tet1 deficiency generates defects in learning and memory.
