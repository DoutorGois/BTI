Majun Baladar (MB), a traditional herbal formulation of the Unani system of medicine, was studied for its efficacy against cerebral ischaemia-induced oxidative damage in hippocampus and associated neurobehavioural deficits. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. The first group was sham, the second group was ischaemic (MCAO: middle cerebral artery occluded) and the third group was a MB pre-treated ischaemic group (MCAO + MB). The fourth group was given MB (1.05 g/kg) orally for 15 days as a drug control. The middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 hr and reperfused for 22 hr in the ischaemic as well as the drug pre-treated group. The activity of the various enzymatic antioxidants like glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase and non-enzymatic antioxidants, glutathione along with levels of lipid peroxidation were evaluated. Cerebral ischaemic rats showed elevated level of lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of various antioxidants significantly over sham values. As a result of MB pre-treatment, the level of lipid peroxidation was found to be significantly depleted as compared to the ischaemic group. Furthermore, depleted levels of glutathione and the activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase were restored significantly in MB treated group. Majun Baladar exhibited a significant improvement in neurobehavioural activities in the drug pre-treated animals as compared to the ischaemic group as evidenced by the grip strength test, Rota-Rod and video path analysis. The results of the present study provide baseline information regarding the neuroprotective efficacy of MB and also open a window for a potent therapeutic use of this traditional herbal Unani medicine.
