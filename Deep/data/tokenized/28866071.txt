Soman (GD) exposure results in status epilepticus (SE) that leads to neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and behavioral consequences including learning and memory deficits. The neuroinflammatory response is characterized by the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1), which mediates the expression of other neurotoxic cytokines induced after GD exposure. However, the specific role of IL-1 signaling has not been defined in terms of the consequences of GD-induced SE. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to regulate IL-1 signaling and study the behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration that occur after convulsion onset. Wild type (WT), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) knockout (KO), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) KO mice were exposed to a convulsive dose of GD, and behavior was evaluated up to 18days later. Activity was studied using the Open Field, anxiety was assessed in the Zero Maze, and spatial learning and memory were evaluated with the Barnes Maze. The animals were euthanized at 24hours and 18days to determine neuropathology in the piriform cortex, amygdala, thalamus, and CA1, CA2/3, and CA4 regions of the hippocampus. Unlike the IL-1Ra KO, the IL-1R1 KO showed less neuropathology compared to WT at 24hours, but moderate to severe injury was found in all strains at 18days. Compared to their saline controls, the exposed WT mice were significantly more active in the Open Field, and the IL-1R1 KO strain showed reduced anxiety in the Zero Maze Test. Compared to WT mice, IL-1R1 and IL-1Ra KO mice had spatial learning and memory impairments in the Barnes Maze. Therefore, the IL-1 signaling pathway affects neurodegeneration and behavior after GD-induced convulsions.
