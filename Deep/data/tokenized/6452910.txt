The specific binding of (3H)kainic acid (KA) to high- and low-affinity receptor sites was assayed in postmortem samples from the brains of patients affected with Huntington's disease (HD) and age-matched controls. Treatment of rat brain with conditions that closely mimic the temperature gradient occurring in postmortem human brain only slightly but not significantly decreased receptor binding by 12 hr after death. In HD brains, total specific binding of (3H)KA was reduced in the caudate nucleus by 51%, putamen by 77%, and frontal cortex by 47%. Specific binding to the high-affinity site was virtually undetectable in the caudate nucleus and was reduced by 90% in the putamen from HD brains. No significant alterations in specific binding of (3H)KA were noted in the insular or temporal cortex, hippocampus, or cerebellum. Thus, losses of KA receptor binding were mainly localized to those regions of the HD brain that are most severely affected by neuronal degeneration, and the high-affinity receptor site appeared more affected.
