By locally dispensing poly-L-lysine (PLL) molecules with a FluidFM onto a protein and cell resistant poly-L-lysine-graft-polyethylene glycol (PLL-g-PEG) coated substrate, the antifouling layer can be replaced under the tip aperture by the cell adhesive PLL. We used this approach for guiding the adhesion and axonal outgrowth of embryonic hippocampal neurons in situ. Cultures of hippocampal neurons were chosen because they mostly contain pyramidal neurons. The hippocampus is known to be involved in memory formation, and the stages of network development are well characterized, which is an asset to fundamental research. After fabricating diffuse PLL spots with 10-250 mum diameter, seeded hippocampal cells stick preferentially onto the spots migrating toward the spot center along the PLL gradient. Cell clusters were formed depending on the lateral size of the PLL dots and the density of seeded cells. In a second step of this protocol, the FluidFM is used to connect in situ the obtained clusters. The outgrowth of neurites, which are known to grow preferentially on adhesive substrates, is tailored by writing PLL lines. Antibody staining confirms that the outgrowing neurites are mostly axons, while the activity of the neurons is assessed by a calcium indicator, proving cell viability. The calcium signal intensity of two actively interconnected clusters showed to be correlated, corroborating the formation of vectored and polarized interconnections.
