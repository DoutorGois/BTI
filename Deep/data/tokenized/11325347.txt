Despite reports of differing regional seizure susceptibility in the hippocampus, hippocampal initiation of limbic seizures has not been precisely localized. We compared seizures induced by kainic acid microinjection into the left dorsal and ventral hippocampus of rats. Discharges following ventral injections rapidly propagated to the left amygdala and sensorimotor cortex unlike seizures following dorsal injections. The ventral group showed various ictal behaviors including motor manifestations, while dorsally injected rats showed only immobilization.
