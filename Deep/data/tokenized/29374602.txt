OBJECTIVES: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe mental illness characterized by episodes of mania and depression. Numerous studies have implicated the involvement of endogenous cardiac steroids (CS), and their receptor, Na(+), K(+) -ATPase, in BD. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of brain oxidative stress in the CS-induced behavioral effects in mice. METHODS: Amphetamine (AMPH)-induced hyperactivity, assessed in the open-field test, served as a model for manic-like behavior in mice. A reduction in brain CS was obtained by specific and sensitive anti-ouabain antibodies. The level of oxidative stress was tested in the hippocampus and frontal cortex by measuring the activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), as well as the levels of antioxidant non-protein thiols (NPSH) and oxidative damage biomarkers thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyl (PC). RESULTS: AMPH administration resulted in a marked hyperactivity and increased oxidative stress, as manifested by increased SOD activity, decreased activities of CAT and GPx, reduced levels of NPSH and increased levels of TBARS and PC. The administration of anti-ouabain antibodies, which reduced the AMPH-induced hyperactivity, protected against the concomitant oxidative stress in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that oxidative stress participates in the effects of endogenous CS on manic-like behavior induced by AMPH. These finding support the notion that CS and oxidative stress may be associated with the pathophysiology of mania and BD.
