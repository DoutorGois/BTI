The abnormal synchronisation of neural networks may underlie some of the deficits observed in schizophrenia. Abnormal synchronisation can be induced in animal models. We investigated whether acute clozapine treatment might function therapeutically by ameliorating the deficit in theta frequency coherence between the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus that is induced in rats exposed to maternal immune activation (MIA)--a risk-factor for schizophrenia. Clozapine treatment increased synchrony levels to that of control animals in a dose-dependent manner. Clozapine's effect on synchrony may in part be mediated through increases in local synchrony that occurred in prefrontal cortex but not hippocampus.
