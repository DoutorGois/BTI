We previously demonstrated that chronic stress impaired prefrontal cortex-sensitive working memory, but not reference memory. Since the hippocampal cholinergic system is also involved in these memories, we examined the effects of chronic stress on cholinergic transmission in the rat hippocampus. A microdialysis study revealed that the stress did not affect the basal acetylcholine release, but enhanced the KCl-evoked response. These results suggest that cholinergic transmission in the chronically stressed hippocampus does not contribute to working memory impairment, but it may be involved in maintenance of reference memory.
