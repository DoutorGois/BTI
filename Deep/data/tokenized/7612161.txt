Many trophic factors are now thought to also function in maintenance of the adult brain. We hypothesized that since serotonin plays a role in synaptogenesis, it may also function in maintenance of synapses in the adult. Adult rats were depleted of serotonin with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) for 10 days. Fourteen days after the final treatment, immunodensitometry showed a significant decrease in the synaptic marker, MAP-2. Our results are discussed in respect to the recent finding of decreased MAP-2 staining in postmortem schizophrenic brains.
