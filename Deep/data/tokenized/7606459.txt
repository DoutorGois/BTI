The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) probably plays a role in neural plasticity in the adult vertebrate brain. We here present evidence that NCAM may be involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1-region of rat hippocampal slices. It is shown that local application of antibodies against NCAM inhibits subsequent LTP-induction. Thus NCAM may be directly involved in the initial phase of LTP-induction. These results have important implications for the possible involvement of NCAM in learning and memory.
