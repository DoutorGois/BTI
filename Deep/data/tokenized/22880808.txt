BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ghrelin plays a central role in the regulation of gastrointestinal (GI) motility. This study aimed to investigate the expression of ghrelin and growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) in the central nervous system of rats with chronic renal failure (CRF). METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 180 +/- 20 g, n = 24) were treated by 5/6 nephrectomy to construct CRF model. As their plasma creatinine concentration and blood urea nitrogen were maintained more than double the normal level for 2 weeks, they were killed for assessing the expression of ghrelin and GHSR in hypothalamus and hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The rats (male, 180 +/- 20 g, n = 24) treated by Sham operation served as a control. One-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman-Keuls q test were used to analyze group difference and a p-value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, the ghrelin and GHSR expression was obviously increased in the hippocampus (p < 0.05) but decreased in the hypothalamus of rats with CRF (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CRF was found to impact the expression of ghrelin and GHSR in hypothalamus and hippocampus. This might be associated with the CRF-induced GI motility dysfunction.
