This study examined the effects of RU 41656, a dopaminergic D2 agonist, on the differential working memory performances and on the differential activities of the neurochemical systems of the Roman high (RHA) and Roman low (RLA) avoidance strains of rats. Compared with RLA, RHA performed worse in three tests of working memory (spontaneous alternation, radial maze and object recognition) and had higher levels of exploratory locomotor activity. Hippocampal and frontal cortex choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities were lower in RHA. Frontal cortex DA and DOPAC levels, hippocampal and striatal 5-HT and NA levels were higher in RHA. RU 41656 induced a significant improvement in working memory performance of RHA, whereas in RLA it had no effect. It decreased exploratory locomotor activity in both strains. ChAT activity in hippocampus was not affected by RU 41656 in either strain, whereas in frontal cortex it was increased in RHA but not in RLA. Hippocampal NA levels were decreased by RU 41656 in RHA but not in RLA. These results confirm previous data concerning the promnesic effect of RU 41656 and extend the finding that the Roman strains are a psychogenetic model for the behavioural, neurochemical and psychopharmacological study of the working memory in rats.
