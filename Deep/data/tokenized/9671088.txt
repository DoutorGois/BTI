The density of GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus and the temporal cortex from rats treated for 28 days with either haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine or olanzapine was measured. Compared to haloperidol (0.01 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and chlorpromazine (0.1 and 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), clozapine and olanzapine (0.1 and 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) markedly decreased the density of GABA(A) receptors in these two brain regions. These data suggest that modulation of GABAergic transmission could be an important action of some antipsychotic drugs.
