Proteins of the Homer1 immediate early gene family have been associated with synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity suggesting broad behavioral consequences of loss of function. This study examined the behavior of male Homer1 knockout (KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) and heterozygous mice using a battery of 10 behavioral tests probing sensory, motor, social, emotional and learning/memory functions. KO mice showed mild somatic growth retardation, poor motor coordination, enhanced sensory reactivity and learning deficits. Heterozygous mice showed increased aggression in social interactions with conspecifics. The distribution of mGluR5 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) receptors appeared to be unaltered in the hippocampus (HIP) of Homer1 KO mice. The results indicate an extensive range of disrupted behaviors that should contribute to the understanding of the Homer1 gene in brain development and behavior.
