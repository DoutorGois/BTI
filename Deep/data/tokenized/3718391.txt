The effects of direct intrahippocampal administration of the cholinergic neurotoxin, AF64A, were investigated in male rats. Bilateral injections of AF64A (5 nmole/2 microliters) produced a significant decrease in choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in the dorsal hippocampus (25%) and overlying frontoparietal cortex (30%) but no changes in the striatum. Rats lesioned with AF64A exhibited increased levels of open-field activity, which was most marked at 1 week after the lesion; however, the rates of intrasession habituation were similar in lesioned and control rats. Lesioned rats also displayed deficits in acquisition and retention of a passive avoidance task and less dramatic deficits in acquisition of two-way shuttle box avoidance. These findings indicate that lesioning of cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus and/or cerebral cortex with AF64A leads to long-term deficits in learning and memory as well as increases in open-field activity.
