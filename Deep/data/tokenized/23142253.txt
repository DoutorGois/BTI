In laboratory rodents, procedural and declarative-like memory processes are often considered operating in dual, sometimes even competing with each other. There is evidence that the initial approach of a repetitive task first engages a hippocampus-dependent declarative-like memory system acquiring knowledge. Over repetition, there is a gradual shift towards a striatum-dependent response memory system. In the current experiment, Long-Evans male rats with bilateral, fiber-sparing ibotenic acid-induced lesions of the dorsolateral striatum or the dorsal hippocampus were trained in an olfactory associative task requiring the acquisition of both a procedural and a declarative-like memory. Rats with dorsolateral striatum lesions, and thus an intact hippocampus, were impaired on both sub-categories of memory performance. Rats with dorsal hippocampal lesions exhibited a substantial deficit in learning the declarative-like cue-reward associations, while the acquisition of the procedural memory component of the task was not affected. These data suggest that the dorsolateral striatum is required to acquire the task rule while the dorsal hippocampus is required to acquire the association between a given stimulus and its associated outcome. The finding is that the dorsolateral striatum and the dorsal hippocampus most probably contribute to successful learning of cue-reward associations in a sequential (from procedural to declarative-like memory) order using this olfactory associative learning task.
