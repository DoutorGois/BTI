Affinity labeling of iodinated neuropeptide Y (NPY) to bovine hippocampal binding proteins revealed that benextramine inhibited specific NPY labeling of the 50 kDa NPY binding protein (Y2 binding protein) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 33 microM). Hippocampal membranes, which were pretreated with benextramine and washed, exhibited decreased [125I]NPY labeling of binding proteins in a similar dose-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that benextramine irreversibly blocks specific NPY binding to the 50 kDa NPY Y2 binding protein.
