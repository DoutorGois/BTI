Following elaboration of long-term habituation to a startle-response, antibodies to neurotrophic factor protein S100b exerted selective and dose-dependent influence on different learning processes and memory of learned behavioural patterns in adult rats. S100b increased at all stages of behavioural skill development in hippocampus, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, basal ganglia.
