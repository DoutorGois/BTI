Influence of amygdaloid stimulation on retrieval of the electric correlate of time connection, delayed evoked potentials recorded in the cortex, midbrain reticular formation, lateral geniculate body and hippocampus, was studied in experiments on currarized unaesthetized cats. Delayed evoked potentials were formed after 10-400 pairings of light flash and hypothalamic stimulation and were manifested as potentials appearing in response to a conditioned stimulus with a delay equal to the interval between conditioned and unconditional stimuli. Amygdaloid stimulation facilitated their retrieval if they were previously extinguished or did not appear during initial testing.
