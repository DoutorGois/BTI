GTPases of the Rho subfamily, i.e. Rho, Rac and Cdc42, are molecular switches in various signaling pathways. Best characterized are their functions in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In neuronal cell lines they are involved in the mechanisms leading to synapse formation and plasticity. It is still unknown whether they have respective functions in the mammalian CNS. In this case, they should be present in the adult brain, especially in areas known for their synaptic remodeling. We have studied the expression of the Rho GTPases in adult rat brain with in situ hybridization and Western blot analysis. High amounts of RhoA, RhoB, Rac1 and Cdc42 mRNAs were detected in neurons of the hippocampus, i.e. in pyramidal cells of the CA1-CA4 regions as well as in granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in hilar cells. Also in cerebellum, Purkinje and granular cells expressed the four mRNAs. Strong gene expression was also found in brainstem, thalamus and neocortex. Using Western blot analysis, RhoA and Cdc42 proteins were detected in hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus and neocortex. It is concluded that GTPases of the Rho family play a role in the regulation of cellular functions in the adult brain.
