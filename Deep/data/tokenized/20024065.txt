SCOP (suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian oscillatory protein) was originally identified in 1999 in a differential display screen of the rat SCN for genes whose expression were regulated in a circadian manner (K. Shimizu, M. Okada, A. Takano and K. Nagai, FEBS Lett., 1999, 458, 363-369). The SCN is the principle pacemaker of the circadian clock, and expression of SCOP protein in the SCN was found to oscillate, increasing during the subjective night, even when animals were housed in constant darkness. SCOP interacts with and inhibits multiple proteins important for intracellular signaling, either by directly binding to K-Ras or by dephosphorylating p-Akt and p-PKC. Since the functions of K-Ras, Akt, and PKC are considerably divergent, SCOP may have several roles. We recently discovered that SCOP participates in the formation of long-term hippocampus-dependent memories, and other investigators have examined its role in cell proliferation and survival. In this review, we introduce SCOP from its molecular structure to its physiological functions, focusing mainly on its role in ERK1/2 activation and memory consolidation.
