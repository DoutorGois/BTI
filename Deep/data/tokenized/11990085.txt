The effect of a single administration of a high dose of progesterone on brain [3H]muscimol binding, was examined in mice using quantitative autoradiography. It was found that progesterone given at the dose of 150 mg/kg ip (the ED85 dose established previously in the model of picrotoxin seizures, Czlonkowska et al., Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav., 2000, 67, 345-353), significantly decreased the specific binding of [3H]muscimol to the nucleus caudatus and nucleus accumbens, as early as 1 h after injection. A similar tendency, close to the statistically significant level, was also present in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (p = 0.07). It is suggested that a high dose of progesterone and ensuing excessive stimulation of GABAA receptors by its metabolites, neurosteroids, could bring about rapid changes in the GABAA receptor number and/or affinity.
