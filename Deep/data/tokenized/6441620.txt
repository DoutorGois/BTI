The effect of central intraventricular administration (1 microgram) of corticosterone or dexamethasone on evoked electrical activity of dorsal hippocampus was analyzed in anaesthetized BALB/c mice. Corticosterone produced an important decrease in amplitude of the population spike activity elicited in CA1 field through commissural stimulation as well as through stimulation of the perforant path. In the same conditions, dexamethasone produced only a slight and brief effect.
