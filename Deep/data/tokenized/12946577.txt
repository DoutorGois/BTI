We previously demonstrated that seizure susceptibility developed by the 14th day post-ethacrynic acid (EA)-induced seizure in mice, with a prolonged increase in the expression of c-fos mRNA in the brain during days 10-14. To examine whether such c-fos increase contributes to the development of seizure susceptibility, we administered antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to c-fos by continuous infusion into the lateral ventricle of mice that had shown a moderate stage of EA seizure, and evaluated the seizure susceptibility to kainic acid (10 mg/kg) on the 14th day. Antisense-infused mice displayed significant reduction of the c-Fos level in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex on the 7th and 14th days, and a significant decrease in seizure severity. These findings suggest that the prolonged increase in c-fos expression after EA seizure may lead to the development of seizure susceptibility.
