Withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) and withdrawal seizure resistant (WSR) lines of mice have been genetically selected based on the severity of handling-induced convulsions after identical chronic ethanol exposure. The present experiments showed that naive WSP mice were more sensitive than WSR mice to a subconvulsant dose of picrotoxin, bicuculline or pentylenetetrazole as measured by the ability of these drugs to exacerbate handling-induced convulsions. This may reflect a difference between lines in the GABA-chloride channel. The density and affinity of [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding sites, a cage convulsant which binds to the picrotoxin site on the GABA-chloride channel, was measured in the frontal cortex, remainder of the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. The binding properties of [3H]flunitrazepam and the potency of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to enhance flunitrazepam binding was characterized in whole brain samples. There were no differences between lines. The behavioral results suggest a role for the GABA-chloride channel in the differential ethanol withdrawal seizure behavior of WSR and WSP mice, but this is not due to changes in receptor densities or affinities.
