BACKGROUND: Brain endogenous ouabain (EOU) raises blood pressure (BP) via an angiotensin II (ATII)-sensitive pathway in NaCl-loaded Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DSS). Brain EOU activates central and adrenocortical renin-angiotensin systems, and stimulates marinobufagenin, a vasoconstrictor and natriuretic inhibitor of sodium pump. METHODS: We studied effects of acute NaCl loading (17 mmol/kg NaCl, intraperitoneally) on levels of EOU and marinobufagenin in several brain areas in DSS. We then studied effects of intrahippocampal administration of very-low-dose ouabain (60 pg) on EOU, marinobufagenin, BP, sodium excretion, and sodium-pump activity in the aorta and renal medulla in the absence and presence of anti-marinobufagenin and anti-ouabain antibodies, and losartan. RESULTS: NaCl loading of DSS induced transient increases of EOU in the hippocampus and amygdala (15 min; 300%), supraoptical nucleus of hypothalamus (SON) (30 min, 230%) and pituitary (30 min; 85%), and ATII elevation in the SON (30 min). Intrahippocampal administration of ouabain (60 pg) stimulated ATII in the SON, produced natriuresis, 40 mmHg rise in BP, inhibition of sodium-pump in the renal medulla (19.6%) and aorta (25%), and a two-fold increase in renal marinobufagenin excretion. Pretreatment of rats with anti-marinobufagenin antibody prevented ouabain-induced pressor and natriuretic responses and sodium-pump inhibition. Pressor responses to ouabain were also prevented by losartan (intravenously) and by administration of anti-ouabain antibody into the SON. CONCLUSIONS: NaCl loading of DSS induces a cascade of events, triggered by brain EOU and ATII. Intrahippocampal administration of a low-dose ouabain mimics effects of NaCl loading and stimulates marinobufagenin, which produces natriuresis, and inhibits the vascular sodium-pump, inducing an increase in BP.
