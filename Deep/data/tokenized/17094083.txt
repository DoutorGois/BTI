Stress impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), but it is unknown whether the stress evoked by opiate withdrawal has the same effect. Here the authors report that opiate withdrawal for 4 days does not influence basal synaptic transmission, but results in a greatly increased LTP in hippocampal CA1 area in anesthetized rats. Elevated-platform stress enabled a large LTP in rats withdrawn for only 18 h, but the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 (twice per day for 3 days) prevented the large LTP on 4 days withdrawal. Moreover, 4 days withdrawal enhanced the NMDAR-mediated EPSCs, in which the NR2A-containing NMDAR-mediated EPSC was increased but the NR2B-containing NMDAR-mediated EPSC was decreased. These results suggest that adaptive changes of the NMDAR and glucocorticoid receptor functions during 4 days of opiate withdrawal may enable stress to facilitate hippocampal LTP, potentially contributing to the opiate withdrawal experience-dependent modifications of hippocampal functions.
