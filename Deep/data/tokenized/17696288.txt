The grid cells of the rat medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) show an increased firing frequency when the position of the animal correlates with multiple regions of the environment that are arranged in regular triangular grids. Here, we describe an artificial neural network based on a twisted torus topology, which allows for the generation of regular triangular grids. The association of the activity of pre-defined hippocampal place cells with entorhinal grid cells allows for a highly robust-to-noise calibration mechanism, suggesting a role for the hippocampal back-projections to the entorhinal cortex.
