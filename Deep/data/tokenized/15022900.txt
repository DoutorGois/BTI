Despite clinical evidence of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia, little progress was made for most of the last century in determining its organic parameters. Neuropathology, over the past few decades, has made a substantial contribution to the understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia. During the last 10-15 years the concept of schizophrenia as a 'functional' psychosis has changed to the current paradigm of schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental disorder. Much still has to be unravelled and learnt. This review gives a brief account of the relevant neuroanatomy, viral hypotheses of schizophrenia etiology, pathologic findings reported, concept of neurodevelopmental model and avenues for the future.
