Alterations in the endocannabinoid system (ECS) are thought to play a role in learning and memory impairments observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to determine the status of the brain ECS in the AbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 model of AD. The ECS comprises the neuromodulatory lipid endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2AG), which interact with the G protein-coupled type-1 and type-2 cannabinoid receptors. Using mass spectrometry, we quantified endocannabinoid levels and assessed lipidomic profiles of the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum of 4-8 month old wildtype and AbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice to determine whether regional variations in endocannabinoids and lipid metabolism are observed with age and disease progression. Additionally, open-field activity, performance in the contextual fear conditioning task, and various other tasks assessing spatial and recognition memory were examined to determine the influence of age and pathology on these parameters. At all ages, AbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice were significantly hyperactive in the open-field and acquired contextual fear as well as wildtype mice, reflecting intact associative learning. They, however, exhibited enhanced contextual fear memory and reduced contextual fear extinction regardless of age. Disturbances in striatal lipid metabolism were observed in 6 and 8 month old AbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice. Endocannabinoids increased significantly with age in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of both genotypes. 8 month old AbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice displayed significantly lower levels of striatal 2AG than wildtype mice, but greater cannabinoid receptor/effector coupling. This study shows that alterations in lipid metabolism and endocannabinoid signaling develop with age in AbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice, possibly contributing to the development of AD-like behavioral deficits.
