In utero exposure to cocaine results in neurobehavioral abnormalities in both clinical and laboratory studies. Cocaine administration from embryonic day 13 to parturition disrupts the distribution of S-100-positive astrocytes in the hippocampus and subplate region of the cortex in cocaine-exposed animals. Postnatal treatment with ipsapirone, a 5-HT1A agonist, shown to stimulate glial release of S-100, alleviated the cellular disruptions and growth retardation caused by prenatal cocaine exposure.
