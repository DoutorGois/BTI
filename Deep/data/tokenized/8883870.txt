We used in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to investigate the presence of GABA in neurons that express the type 3 serotonin receptor (5-HT3R). Quantitative analysis indicated that more than 90% of 5-HT3R expressing cells are GABAergic in the neocortex and hippocampus. The co-existence of 5-HT3R and GABA in cortical and hippocampal neurons indicates that serotonin, via 5-HT3R, can affect GABA release and suggests the participation of 5-HT3R in the inhibitory regulation of forebrain neurons.
