Three-month-old Long-Evans rats were subjected to intraseptal infusions of 0.8 microg of 192 IgG-saporin followed, 2 weeks later, by intrahippocampal suspension grafts containing fetal cells from the medial septum and the diagonal band of Broca. The suspensions were implanted in the dorsal or the ventral hippocampus. Sham-operated and lesion-only rats were used as controls. Between 18 and 32 weeks after grafting, all rats were tested in a water maze (using protocols placing emphasis on reference memory or on working memory) and an eight-arm radial maze. The lesion produced extensive cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus, as evidenced by reduced acetylcholinesterase-positivity and acetylcholine content. Depending upon their implantation site, the grafts restored an acetylcholinesterase-positive reinnervation pattern in either the dorsal or the ventral hippocampus. Nevertheless, the grafts failed to normalize the concentration of acetylcholine in either region. The cholinergic lesion impaired working memory performance in both the water maze and the radial maze. To a limited degree, reference memory was also altered. Grafts placed in the ventral hippocampus had no significant behavioral effect, whereas those placed in the dorsal hippocampus normalized working memory performance in the water maze. Our data show that infusion of 192 IgG-saporin into the septal region deprived the hippocampus of its cholinergic innervation and altered spatial working memory more consistently than spatial reference memory. Although the cholinergic nature of the graft-induced reinnervation remains to be established more clearly, these results further support the idea of a functional dissociation between the dorsal and the ventral hippocampus, the former being preferentially involved in spatial memory.
