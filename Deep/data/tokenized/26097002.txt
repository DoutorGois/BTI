Diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction, referred as "diabetic encephalopathy", has been confirmed in a great deal of literature. Current evidence support that oxidative stress, inflammation, energy metabolism imbalance, and aberrant insulin signaling are associated with cognition deficits induced by diabetes. The present study explore the effect of asiaticoside on the cognition behaviors, synapses, and oxidative stress in diabetic rats. Asiaticoside could markedly ameliorate the performance in the Morris Water Maze (decreased latency time and path length, and increased time spent in the target quadrant), which was correlated with its capabilities of suppressing oxidative stress, restoring Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity and protecting hippocampal synapses. In vitro, asiaticoside could up-regulate synaptic proteins expression via modulating Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein Kinase B(AKT)/Nuclear Factor -kappa B (NF-kappaB)-mediated inflammatory pathway in SH-SY5Y cells incubated with high glucose chronically. In conclusion, asiaticoside had beneficial effects on the prevention and treatment of diabetes-associated cognitive deficits, which was involved in oxidative stress, PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB pathway and synaptic function in the development of cognitive decline induced by diabetes.
