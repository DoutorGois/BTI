After cholinergic denervation of the hippocampal formation, peripheral sympathetic fibers arising from the superior cervical ganglia grow into the dentate gyrus and CA3 region; the functional significance of sympathetic ingrowth into the hippocampal formation is unknown. Utilizing electrical stimulation of the preganglionic trunk in combination with 2-deoxy-D-[3H]-glucose fine-grained autoradiograms, we demonstrated an alteration of hippocampal glucose metabolism, suggesting that this neuronal rearrangement makes functional connections within the hippocampus.
