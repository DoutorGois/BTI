In the present study the effects of chronic manganese (Mn) treatment on adenosine A2a receptor binding in mouse brain have been assessed. Male albino mice were divided in two groups: In the Mn-treated group, the animals were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with MnCl2 (5 mg/kg/day) five days per week during 9 weeks; in the control group, they were injected likewise with a saline solution. A significant decrease of the Kd without alteration of Bmax in the cerebellum and, an increase of the Kd and Bmax in hippocampus of mice treated with Mn were found. Also, an increase of Kd in frontal cortex was observed. The binding parameters in caudate nucleus, olfactory bulb and hypothalamus were not altered by Mn. A significant decrease in the adenosine concentration in caudate nucleus, olfactory bulb and hypothalamus, without significant changes in hippocampus, frontal cortex and cerebellum was also detected. These findings suggest that chronic administration of Mn could affect adenosine receptor function and turnover, depending on the brain region analyzed.
