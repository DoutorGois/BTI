We evaluated the effect of the duration of occlusal disharmony induced chronic stress on hippocampal function by examining spatial memory in the Morris water maze and on the number of hippocampal neurons in aged senescence-accelerated prone (SAMP8) mice. The bite of SAMP8 mice was raised 0.1 mm using dental adhesive. Groups of mice were tested in the Morris water maze 8, 11, or 22 d after raising the bite. The results indicated that the longer the duration of the bite-raised condition, the greater the impairment in spatial learning ability and the greater the decrease in the number of neurons in the hippocampal CA3 subfield. Thus, behavioral and morphologic deficits induced by the bite-raised condition in aged SAMP8 mice are influenced by the duration of the occlusal disharmony.
