The effects of a calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor, which does not influence Ca2+ fluxes (calmidazolium, RO-24571), and a new potent inhibitor of protein kinase C (K-252b) on long-term potentiation (LTP) were compared in hippocampal slices. Tetanic stimulation of the stratum radiatum during perfusion of calmidazolium (50 nM) failed to induce the characteristic post-tetanic and long-term increase in the magnitude of CA1-evoked responses. During perfusion with K-252b (50 nM) post-tetanic potentiation and initial LTP is expressed normally, but thereafter declines back to baseline with a 60 min delay. By themselves, the inhibitors had no significant effect on synaptic transmission in a non-tetanized control input. Our data are in line with current evidence from several laboratories that CaM- and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent processes are involved in LTP and support the hypothesis that CaM mediates initiation and that PKC mediates mechanisms underlying the maintenance of LTP.
