Sites which bind tritiated vasopressin (AVP) with high affinity were detected in the brain of male, adult rats, by light microscopic autoradiography. Their anatomical localization differed markedly from that of high affinity binding sites for tritiated oxytocin (OT) determined in the same animal. Co-labelling was minimized by using low concentrations of [3H]AVP and [3H]OT. Binding of the former occurred predominantly in several structures of the limbic system (septum, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, accumbens nucleus), in two hypothalamic nuclei (suprachiasmatic and dorsal tuber) and in the area of the nucleus of the solitary tract. Binding of OT was evidenced in the olfactory tubercle, the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, the central amygdaloid nucleus and the ventral hippocampus. The ligand specificity of the binding sites was assessed in competition experiments. Synthetic structural analogues were used, allowing to discriminate OT receptors (OH[Thr4,Gly7]OT) from V2 receptors (dDAVP and d[Tyr(Me)2]VDAVP), V1 receptors ([Phe2,Orn8]VT) and V1b receptors (desGly9d(CH2)5AVP). Our main conclusions are, firstly, that AVP and OT binding sites can be readily distinguished, and that there is virtually no overlap in their distribution in the rat brain. Second, we showed that the sites which bind AVP with high affinity in the brain are V1 receptors, different both from the renal V2 receptors and from the anterior pituitary V1b receptors. Our results support the conjecture that AVP and OT play a role in interneuronal communication in the brain.
