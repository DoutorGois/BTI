The postnatal evolution of the signals underlying the afterhyperpolarization (slow-AHP and medium-AHP) was studied in rat CA1 hippocampal neurones (P10-16, P17-23 and P greater than 26) using in vitro slices. Noradrenaline (NA) and signal subtraction were used to decompose the AHP (m-AHP and s-AHP). The amplitude of the s-AHP was found significant between P10-16 and P17-23 cells; the m-AHP showed no significant change. The time to peak of the s-AHP of the P greater than 26 cells was found to be significantly different from the remaining groups; the m-AHP showed no significant change. The changes in waveform and amplitude of the AHP at this stage were found to be mainly due to the modifications of the slow-AHP.
