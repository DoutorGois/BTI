Non-species isoform-specific antibodies against three isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (PMCA) were used for immuno-localization of PMCA by Western blot analysis in membrane preparations isolated from different regions of gerbil brain. All three gene products were detected in the membranes from hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum. However, they showed a distinct distribution pattern. Two proteins were revealed in the case of PMCA1 with molecular masses 129 and 135 kDa. The antibody against PMCA2 recognized three proteins of about 130-137 kDa. Only one protein was detected with the anti-PMCA3 antibody. Levels of immuno-signal for the PMCA isoforms varied significantly among the different brain regions. The PMCA1 is the most abundant in the cerebro-cortical and hippocampal membrane preparations. The PMCA2 was detected in a lesser amount comparing to PMCA1 and was highest in the membrane preparations from cerebellum and in a slightly lesser amount from cerebral cortex. Anti-PMCA3 antibody stained weakly and was localized in the cerebellar and hippocampal membrane preparations. Transient forebrain ischemia (10 min) and reperfusion (for a prolonged period up to 10 d) leads to a significant decrease of PMCA immuno-signal. This decrease could be ascribed to the loss of PMCA1 signal, especially in hippocampal membrane preparations.
