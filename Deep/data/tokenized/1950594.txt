Presumed principal cells of the hippocampus CA1 area and the gyrus dentatus were analysed intracellularly in slices cut from young rats. Membrane and postsynaptic potential properties of a sample of neurons were measured. Individual differences between prepotential and afterpotential components of various cells are emphasized. The results are in accord with findings reported by others but some further details are also provided.
