We have reported that activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) by ventricle injection of wortmannin (WT) and GF-109203X (GFX) induces Alzheimer-like memory deficit in rats [Liu et al., J. Neurochem. 87 (2003), 1333]. To further explore the factors responsible for the memory loss, we studied here the temporal alterations of GSK-3, tau phosphorylation, beta-amyloid (Abeta), and acetylcholine (ACh) after injection of WT/GFX, and analyzed their correlation with the memory loss. We observed that the severe memory deficit occurred at 24 and 48 h, and simultaneously, GSK-3 activation, tau hyperphosphorylation at Thr231, Ser396, and Ser404 and decline of ACh in hippocampus were detected, and these changes were mostly recovered at 72 and 96 h after the injection of WT/GFX. Remarkable increase of Abeta and intracellular accumulation of argentophilic substances were detected at 72 h. Pearson analysis showed that the memory deficit was correlated with GSK-3 activation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and decline of ACh but not with Abeta overproduction. Our data provide direct evidence demonstrating that activation of GSK-3 by WT/GFX may cause memory deficit through tau hyperphosphorylation and suppression of ACh in hippocampus.
