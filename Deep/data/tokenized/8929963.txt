Enhancing inhibitory mechanisms has been shown to improve neuronal survival after transient focal or global ischemia. In most studies, histological evaluations have been confined to the CA1 region of the hippocampus up to 7 days after an ischemic insult. We have previously shown that continuous intra-ventricular infusion of gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG) results in significant protection after cerebral ischemia. This present study was designed to assess histological and behavioral function at 7 and 28 days after a single 5 min ischemic episode in gerbils. One set of animals received the medication 30 min before the insult and the other set at 1 h after the insult. Evaluation at 7 days showed significant protection in most regions of the brain in both the pre- and post-ischemic treated animals in comparison to the controls. Delayed evaluation at 28 days showed significant protection only in the pre-ischemic treated animals. Behavioral testing with Morris water maze showed no differences in either pre- or post-ischemic treated animals when compared to saline-treated ischemic controls. Our study clearly demonstrates the usefulness of delayed evaluation in the assessment of 'true' neuronal protection. Pre-ischemic treated animals showed persistent and true neuronal protection, in contrast to a temporary protection as seen at 7 days in the post-ischemic treated animals. The lack of behavioral improvement in the pre- and post-ischemic treated animals suggests that morphological protection alone cannot be considered as the sole criterion for successful outcome.
