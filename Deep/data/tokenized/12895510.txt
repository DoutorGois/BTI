Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by selective vulnerability of specific neuronal populations within particular brain regions. For example, hippocampal glutamatergic cell populations within the CA1/subicular pyramidal cell fields have been found to be particularly vulnerable early in AD progression. In contrast, hippocampal GABA-ergic neurons and receptors appear resistant to neurodegeneration. Despite relative sparing of GABA(A) receptors in AD, it is possible that the specific subunit composition of these receptors may undergo alterations with disease progression. In order to address this issue, we employed quantitative Western blot analysis to examine protein levels of GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha 1, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2 in the hippocampus of subjects displaying increasing severity of AD neuropathology. Subjects were categorized into three groups based upon Braak staging pathologic criteria: pathologically mild (stages I/II, n=9); moderate (stages III/IV, n=8); and severe (stages V/VI, n=7). Across all subject groups, levels of subunit protein were heterogeneously distributed throughout the five hippocampal subregions analyzed (subiculum, CA1-3, dentate gyrus). Statistical analyses revealed differential preservation of GABA(A) receptor subunits in AD. In particular, alpha 1, beta 1, and beta 2 displayed little difference in protein levels among pathologically mild, moderate, and severe subject groups. In contrast, although relatively modest, protein levels of the alpha 5 subunit were significantly reduced between subjects with severe neuropathology compared with pathologically mild subjects (13.5% reduction). Collectively, our data provide evidence for heterogeneous distribution and relative sparing of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the hippocampus of AD patients.
