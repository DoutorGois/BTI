Short-term memory (STM), the brief maintenance of information in the absence of external stimulation, is central to higher-level cognition. Behavioral and neural data indicate that information maintained in STM can be represented in qualitatively distinct states. These states include a single chunk held in the focus of attention available for immediate processing (the "focus"), a capacity-limited set of additional actively maintained items that the focus can access (the "active state"), and passively maintained items (the "passive state"). Little is known about how information is shifted among these states. Here, we used fMRI in humans to examine the neural correlates of shifting information among representational states of STM. We used a paradigm that has demonstrated dissociable performance costs associated with shifting the focus among active items and switching sets of items between active and passive states. Behavioral results confirmed distinct behavioral costs associated with different representational states. Neural results indicated that the caudal superior frontal sulcus (cSFS), in the vicinity of the frontal eye fields, was associated with shifting the focus, consistent with the role of this region in internal and external attention. By contrast, the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) was associated with shifting between active and passive states. Increased cSFS-medial temporal lobe (MTL) connectivity was associated with shifting the focus, while cSFS-MTL connectivity was disrupted when the active state was changed. By contrast, PMv-MTL connectivity increased when the active state was switched. These data indicate that dissociable frontal-MTL interactions mediate shifts of information among different representational states in STM.
