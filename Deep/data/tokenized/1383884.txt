When WGA-HRP was injected into the subicular cortex of the ventral hippocampal formation (Hv) in the cat, terminal labeling was seen ipsilaterally in the caudoventral parts of the medial frontal cortex: in the infralimbic cortex (area 25), ventral part of the prelimbic cortex (area 32), and caudoventral part of the orbitofrontal cortex (area 12). The terminal labeling was observed in all cortical layers except layer 1. The cells of origin of these projections were then confirmed to be pyramidal neurons in the subiculum of the Hv. The projections were topographically organized: the temporal-septal shift along the long axis of the subiculum of the Hv corresponded to a rostroventral-caudodorsal shift in the anterogradely labeled limbic regions of the medial frontal cortex.
