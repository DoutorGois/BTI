The effect of Pb2+ on glutamate receptor activity in rat hippocampal neurons was investigated with a view of explaining the cognitive and learning deficits produced by this heavy metal. Pb2+ (2.5-50 microM) selectively inhibited N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced whole-cell and single-channel currents in a concentration-dependent but voltage-independent manner, without significantly altering currents induced by either quisqualate or kainate. The frequency of NMDA-induced channel activation was decreased by Pb2+. Neither glycine (10-100 microM), nor Ca2+ (10 mM) reversed the effect of Pb2+. Pb2+ also inhibited the [3H]MK-801 binding to rat hippocampal membranes in vitro. The elucidation of the actions of Pb2+ on the NMDA receptor ion channel complex provides important insights into the clinical and toxic effects of this cation.
