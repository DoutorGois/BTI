Recent studies indicated that epigenetic modification, especially DNA methylation, play an important role in the persistence of addiction-related memory. 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza), an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases, was approved for clinical treatment. However, it is not clear whether 5-aza is involved in opiate addiction. In this study, using the morphine-induced conditioned place preference (mCPP) model in rats, we injected 5-aza into hippocampus (CA1) and prelimbic cortex (PL), and tested the behavioral consequences at various stages of consolidation, acquisition and retrieval. Moreover, to test whether protein phosphatase regulates the effects of 5-aza, protein phosphatase (PP) 1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA) was infused before 5-aza injection. We found that 5-aza injection into CA1 but not into PL significantly attenuated the consolidation and acquisition of mCPP, however, the inhibition of DNA methylation in PL but not in CA1 enhanced the retrieval of mCPP. All these behavioral effects were absent when OA was infused before 5-aza injection. These findings suggest that 5-aza interfere opiate-related memory, and protein phosphatase plays an important role in this process.
