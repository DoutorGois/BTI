The time course of the neurogenesis of cells showing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity has been analyzed in the dorsal hippocampus and area dentata of the mouse. The quantitative data indicate that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic cells are generated prenatally, and that their peaks of neurogenesis occur before the peaks of neurogenesis of non-GABAergic cells. Additionally, GABAergic cells in the hippocampus proper follow a 'sandwich' sequence of positioning.
