It is suggested that deficits of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) might be associated with the cognitive impairments of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, and that agonists for alpha 7 nAChR could be useful for treatment of cognitive dysfunction in these diseases. This study was undertaken to examine the role of alpha 7 nAChRs on hippocampal cellular proliferation of adult mice. The number of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-immunoreactive cells in the granule cell layer (GCL) and hilus of alpha 7 nAChR heterozygous (+/-) mice was significantly decreased as compared with that of wild-type (+/+) mice. In contrast, the number of BrdU-immunoreactive cells in GCL and hilus of alpha 7 nAChR homozygous (-/-) mice was not different from that of wild-type mice. The results suggest that reduced levels of alpha 7 nAChRs may decrease cell proliferation of adult hippocampus.
