OBJECTIVE: Brain imaging studies have shown widespread structural abnormalities in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) within and beyond the affected temporal lobe, suggesting an altered network. Graph theoretical analysis based on white matter tractography has provided a new perspective to evaluate the connectivity of the brain. The alterations in the topologic properties of a whole brain white matter network in patients with TLE remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the white matter network in a cohort of patients with left TLE and mesial temporal sclerosis (mTLE) compared to healthy controls. METHODS: Anatomic brain networks of 16 patients with left mTLE were compared to those of 21 healthy controls. A white matter structural network was constructed from diffusion tensor tractography for each participant, and network parameters were compared between the patient and control groups. RESULTS: Patients with left mTLE exhibited concurrent decreases of global and local efficiencies and widespread reduction of regional efficiency in ipsilateral temporal, bilateral frontal, and bilateral parietal areas. Communication hubs, such as the left precuneus, were also altered in patients with mTLE compared to controls. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate white matter network disruption in patients with left mTLE, supporting the notion that mTLE is a systemic brain disorder.
