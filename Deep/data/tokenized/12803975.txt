Cell death/survival following CNS injury may be a result of alterations in the intracellular ratio of death and survival factors. Using immunohistochemistry, Western analysis and in situ hybridization, the expression of the anti-cell death protein, Bcl-2, and the pro-cell death protein, Bax, was evaluated following lateral fluid-percussion (FP) brain injury of moderate severity (2.3-2.6 atm) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. By 2 h post-injury, a marked reduction of cellular Bcl-2-immunoreactivity (IR) and a mild decrease in cellular Bax IR were observed in the temporal and occipital cortices, and in the hippocampal CA3 ipsilateral to the site of impact. These decreases in Bcl-2 and Bax IR appeared to precede the overt cell loss in these regions that was evident at 24 h. Immunoblot analysis supported the immunohistochemical data, with a modest but significant reduction in the intensities of both the Bcl-2 and Bax protein bands at 2 h (p < 0.05 compared to sham levels). However, the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio increased significantly at 2 h (2.28 +/- 0.13) and remained elevated up to 7 days (2.05 +/- 0.13) post-injury compared to sham-injured control tissue (1.62 +/- 0.10, p < 0.05). Furthermore, cortical, but not hippocampal, levels of Bax protein increased by 25% (p < 0.05 compared to sham-injured controls) at 24 h post-injury, and returned to control levels by 7 days. In situ hybridization analysis of Bax mRNA revealed increased cellular grain density in the injured cortex (p < 0.05 compared to sham-injured brains), but not in the CA3 region of the injured hippocampus. No injury-induced changes in the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA were observed in any brain region. Taken together, these data suggest that the association between regional post-traumatic cell death and alterations in the cellular ratio of Bcl-2 and Bax may be, in part, due to alterations in mRNA and/or protein expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins.
