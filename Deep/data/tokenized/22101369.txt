We described the preparation of acute living slices from the hippocampus of the neonatal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Slices from a temporal lobe section were prepared quickly using a rotary slicer. By this method, we successfully recorded field potentials, namely, pre-synaptic fiber volley and field excitatory post-synaptic potentials, from the hippocampal CA1 region with conventional electrophysiological techniques, and analyzed the indicators of synaptic function such as input-output curve. This study thus presents an efficient preparation method for acute living hippocampal slice from which synaptic function of the hippocampus in non-human primate can be analyzed.
