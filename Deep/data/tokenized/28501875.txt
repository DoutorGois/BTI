PURPOSE: To assess the neuropsychological performance recoded over a period of 5 years after stereotactic radiofrequency amygdalohippocampectomy (SAHE) in the treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients (mean age 38 years, 14 females/16 males) were included in this study. Twenty-one patients were treated on the left side, 9 on the right. Patients underwent neuropsychological evaluation by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised preoperatively and 5 years after SAHE. RESULTS: Twenty-three (77%) patients were classified as Engel class I. At the group level, we found significant increases in all intelligence domains (Global, Visual, and Performance) by 19.1 (7.4), 15.8 (6.1), and 19.1 (7.9) points, respectively. Significant improvements were also detected in all memory measures (Global, Verbal, Visual, Attention/Concentration, Delayed Recall) by 19.4 (14.2), 16.9 (13.3), 19.0 (14.7), 15.3 (15.0), and 24.6 (13.4), respectively. Patients with left-sided surgery improved significantly more in Attention/Concentration. Otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences in memory function improvements between subgroups according to the operated side. CONCLUSION: After SAHE, we found favorable long-term neuropsychological outcomes. These results could be caused by incomplete destruction of target structures and minimization of collateral damage that possibly enables adaptive postoperative neuronal reorganization.
