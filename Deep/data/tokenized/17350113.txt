Rats in a runway avoidance task responded to a test shock probe with a period of immobility lasting from 2 to 6s. The shock avoidance-trained group displayed hippocampal theta during the immobility response. The inescapable shock group, in contrast, displayed large amplitude irregular activity (LIA). Following reversal training to escapable shock, all shock avoidance-trained rats responded with LIA and inescapable shock trained rats, reversed to shock avoidance, displayed theta.
