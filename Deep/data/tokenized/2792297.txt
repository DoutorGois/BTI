The present study evaluated the effects of intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered total brain gangliosides on amygdala (AM) kindling in rats. The results showed the following: (i) exogenously injected gangliosides (0.4 and 0.8 mg/4 microliter) significantly decreased the afterdischarge threshold (ADT) in a dose-dependent manner; (ii) both 0.8 and 0.25 mg gangliosides significantly facilitated AM-kindled seizure development and shortened total AD duration when AM stimulation was given at 2-h intervals, especially in the late stages of kindling (stages 3-5); (iii) the facilitated kindled epileptogenesis by gangliosides was maintained persistently for more than 2 weeks; (iv) 0.25 mg gangliosides did not affect previously kindled seizures; (v) 0.8 mg gangliosides had a proconvulsant action in both nonkindled and kindled rats; and (vi) epileptiform responses to gangliosides markedly increased during kindling and remained increased for at least 5 weeks after kindling. It is concluded that gangliosides in neuronal membranes in the CNS may play an important role in the permanent hyperexcitability of kindled epileptogenesis.
