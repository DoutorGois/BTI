The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has still not been fully elucidated, however it is thought that the build up of amyloid plaque at least partially causes the symptoms of AD. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding small RNA molecules that regulate the expression and degradation of proteins. The present study induced symptoms of AD in mice via intraventricular injection of amyloidbeta 142 (Abeta142), which decreased levels of miR107. However, miR107 levels increased following administration of miR107 mimic, a doublestranded RNA molecule designed to imitate the native miRNA. Intraventricular injection of Abeta142 aggregates led to spatial memory impairments, inhibited hippocampal longterm potentiation (LTP) and resulted in the loss of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The miR107 mimic reversed the impairments of spatial memory and LTP and the loss of pyramidal neurons caused by Abeta neurotoxicity. Furthermore, the miR107 mimic reversed the Abetainduced increase in Abeta142 and phosphorylated Tau levels. Critically, Abeta142 injection decreased levels of brainderived neurotrophic factor and reduced the phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B and protein kinase B; these changes were reversed following treatment with the miR107 mimic. Collectively, these results demonstrated that miR107 may be a potential target for the treatment of AD.
