The effect of bilateral lesions of the retrosplenial cortex on discrimination reversal learning of the rabbit nictitating membrane response was examined. Results showed that animals with such lesions were not impaired in their ability to acquire a cross-modality discrimination, but were severely impaired in their ability to reverse the discrimination once it was learned. All animals failed at the reversal phase of the task because they displayed high levels of conditioned responding to both the CS+ and the CS-. Thus bilateral damage to the retrosplenial cortex results in deficits in reversal learning that are highly similar to those observed after bilateral hippocampectomy. These findings are interpreted within a conceptual framework that characterizes multisynaptic projections from the hippocampus to the retrosplenial cortex, and ultimately to the cerebellum, as responsible for the behavioral expression of learning-related changes in hippocampal pyramidal cell activity.
