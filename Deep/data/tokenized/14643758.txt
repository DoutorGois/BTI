S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC), one of the organosulfur compounds found in aged garlic extract, has been shown to possess various biological effects including neurotrophic activity. In our previous experiments, we found that SAC could protect against amyloid beta-protein (Abeta)- and tunicamycin-induced cell death in differentiated PC12 cells. In the study described here, we characterized the neuronal death induced by Abeta, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), tunicamycin, and trophic factor deprivation, and investigated whether and how SAC could prevent this in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Treatment with SAC protected these cells against Abeta- and tunicamycin-induced neuronal death, which is mediated predominantly through caspase-12-dependent pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, it afforded no protection against HNE- and trophic factor-deprivation-induced cell death, which has been shown to be mediated by caspase-3-dependent pathway. SAC also attenuated the Abeta-induced increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species in hippocampal neurons. SAC had no effect on Abeta-induced cell death in cultured cerebellar granule neurons, which was prevented by a caspase-3 inhibitor. These results suggest that SAC could protect against the neuronal cell death that is triggered by ER dysfunction in the hippocampus, and that it has no effect on neuronal cell death that is dependent upon the caspase-3 mediated pathway.
