We report on the expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits in primary neuronal cultures from rat cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum and of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor subtypes in these neuronal cultures as well as in cortical astroglial cultures. We found that the NMDA receptor (NR) subunits NR1, NR2A and NR2B were expressed in all three cultures. Each of the three cultures showed also expression of the four AMPA receptor subunits. Although RT-PCR detected mRNA of all kainate (KA) subunits in the three cultures, western blot showed only expression of Glu6 and KA2 receptor subunits. The expression analysis of mGlu receptors indicated the presence of all mGlu receptor subtype mRNAs in the three neuronal cultures, except for mGlu2 receptor mRNA, which was not detected in the cortical and cerebellar culture. mGlu1a/alpha, -2/3 and -5 receptor proteins were present in all three cultures, whereas mGlu4a and mGlu8a receptor proteins were not detected. Astroglial cultures were grown in either serum-containing or chemically defined medium. Only mGlu5 receptor protein was found in astroglial cultures grown in serum-containing medium. When astrocytes were cultured in chemically defined medium, mGlu3, -5 and -8 receptor mRNAs were detected, but at the protein level, still only mGlu5 receptor was found.
