Decreases in plasma IGF-I levels that occur with age have been hypothesized to contribute to the genesis of brain aging. However, support for this hypothesis would be strengthened by evidence that growth hormone (GH)/IGF-I deficiency in young animals produces a phenotype similar to that found in aged animals. As a result, we developed a unique model of adult-onset GH/IGF-I deficiency by using dwarf rats specifically deficient in GH and IGF-I. The deficiency in plasma IGF-I is similar to that observed with age (e.g., 50% decrease), and replacement of GH restores levels of IGF-I to that found in young animals with normal GH levels. The present study employs this model to investigate the effects of circulating GH and IGF-I on local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU). Analysis of LCGU indicated that GH/IGF-I-deficient animals exhibit a 29% decrease in glucose metabolism in many brain regions, especially those involved in hippocampally dependent processes of learning and memory. Similarly, a high correlation between plasma IGF-I levels and glucose metabolism was found in these areas. The deficiency in LCGU was not associated with alterations in GLUT1, GLUT3, or hexokinase activity. A 15% decrease in ATP levels was also found in hippocampus of GH-deficient animals, providing compelling data that circulating GH and IGF-I have significant effects on the regulation of glucose utilization and energy metabolism in the brain. Furthermore, our results provide important data to support the conclusion that deficiencies in circulating GH/IGF-I contribute to the genesis of brain aging.
