The binding of [3H]LSD to serotonergic sites in human brain was studied. The pharmacological profile of [3H]LSD binding in frontal cortex differed to that in hippocampus. Analysis of the inhibition of [3H]LSD binding by serotonin and spiperone was consistent with the presence of two binding sites, which differed in pharmacological specificity. The results are discussed in relation to previously published findings in experimental animals.
