1. The objective of the present study was to distinguish if inhibition of neuronal activity by hypoxia is related to a block of voltage-gated Na+ channels. 2. The effect of chemical hypoxia induced by cyanide (0.5 mM, 10 min perfusion) was studied with patch-clamp technique in visualized intact CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices. Action potentials were elicited in whole cell current-clamp recordings and the threshold was estimated by current pulses of 50-ms duration and incremental amplitudes (n = 31). The effect of cyanide on the Na+ current and conductance was studied in voltage clamp recordings from cell-attached patches (n = 13). 3. Cyanide perfusion during 10 min increased the threshold for excitation by 73 +/- 79 pA (p = 0.001), which differed from the effect in control cells (11 +/- 41 pA, ns). The change in current threshold was correlated to a change in membrane potential (r = -0.88, p < 0.0001). Cyanide had no significant effect on the peak amplitude, duration, or rate of rise of the action potential. 4. Cyanide perfusion did not change the Na+ current size, but caused a small decrease in ENa (-17 +/- 22 mV, ns) and a slight increase in Na+ conductance (+14 +/- 26%, ns), which differed (p = 0.045) from controls (-19 +/- 23 %, ns). 5. In conclusion, chemical hypoxia does not cause a decrease in Na+ conductance. The decreased excitability during hypoxia can be explained by an increase in the current threshold, which is correlated with the effect on the membrane potential.
