Ceruloplasmin (CP), the major plasma anti-oxidant and copper transport protein, is synthesized in several tissues, including the brain. We compared regional brain concentrations of CP and copper between subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 12), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 14), Huntington's disease (HD, n = 11), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, n = 11), young adult normal controls (YC, n = 6) and elderly normal controls (EC, n = 7). Mean CP concentrations were significantly increased vs. EC (P < 0.05) in AD hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, and putamen. PD hippocampus, frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices, and HD hippocampus, parietal cortex, and substantia nigra. Immunocytochemical staining for CP in AD hippocampus revealed marked staining within neurons, astrocytes, and neuritic plaques. Increased CP concentrations in brain in these disorders may indicate a localized acute phase-type response and/or a compensatory increase to oxidative stress.
