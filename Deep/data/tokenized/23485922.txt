OBJECTIVES: Compared to the Dark Agouti (DA), the Albino Oxford (AO) rat strain exhibits lower susceptibility to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we investigated the potential contribution of the heavy metal-binding proteins metallothioneins (MTs) I/II to these effects. METHODS: Rats were immunized with bovine brain homogenate emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant or only with complete Freund's adjuvant. The expression patterns of MTs mRNA and proteins and tissue concentrations of Zn2+ and Cu2+ were estimated in the brain and in the liver on days 7 and 12 after immunization, by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and inductively coupled plasma spectrometry, respectively. Additionally, the hepatic transforming growth factor beta and nuclear factor kappa B immunoreactivities were tested. RESULTS: Clinical signs of EAE were not induced in AO rats, but they upregulated the expression of MT I/II proteins in the brain (hippocampus and cerebellum) and in the liver, similarly as DA rats. The transcriptional activation of MT-I occurred, however, only in DA rats, which accumulated also more zinc in the brain and in the liver. In contrast, intact AO rats had greater hepatic MT-I mRNA immunoreactivity and more Cu2+ in the hippocampus. Besides, in immunized AO rats a high upregulation of transforming growth factor beta and nuclear factor kappa B immunoreactivities was found in several hepatic structures (vascular endothelium, Kupffer cells and hepatocytes). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that AO and DA rats differ in constitutive and inductive MT-I gene expression in the brain and in the liver, as well as in the hepatic cytokine profile, suggesting that these mechanisms may contribute to the discrepancy in the susceptibility to EAE.
