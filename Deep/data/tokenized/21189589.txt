AIM: To study effect of CoCl2 pretreatment on the voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents of the rat hippocampal neurons after acute hypoxia. METHODS: Primarily cultured hippocampal neurons were divided into CoCl2 pretreated and non-pretreated groups. Patch clamp whole cell recording technique was used to examine Na+ and K+ currents of the hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: After acute hypoxia, I(Na) and I(K) of the hippocampal neurons were significantly decreased and the threshold of I(Na) was right-shifted. Pretreatment of the neurons with CoCl2 inhibited the reduction of I(Na) and I(K). CONCLUSION: CcCl2 pretreatment alleviates the acute hypoxia-induced changes of I(Na) and I(K), which may be one of the mechanisms for the protective effect of CoCl2 on neurons.
