It remains unknown if tissue acidosis contributes to neuronal loss during cerebral ischemia. We report that brief intracellular acidification (pH 6.62) results in delayed neuronal loss in cultured hippocampal slices. Cell loss was located primarily in stratum pyramidale and the hilus suggesting that neurons were preferentially damaged. Removal of molecular oxygen greatly attenuated cell loss suggesting that generation of reactive oxygen species may underlie acidosis-induced toxicity. These data suggest that acidosis and incomplete anoxia contributes to the delayed neuronal loss in the ischemic penumbra.
