Epidemiological observations report an increase in fat consumption associated with low intake of n-3 relative to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in women of childbearing age. However, the impact of these maternal feeding habits on cognitive function in the offspring is unknown. This study aims to investigate the impact of early exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) with an unbalanced n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio on hippocampal function in adult rats. Furthermore, we explored the effects of perinatal HFD combined with exposure to HFD after weaning. Dams were fed a control diet (C, 12% of energy from lipids, n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio: 5) or HFD (HF, 39% of energy from lipids, n-6/n-3 PUFAs ratio: 39) throughout gestation and lactation. At weaning, offspring were placed either on control (C-C, HF-C) or high-fat (HF-HF) diets. In adulthood, hippocampus-dependent memory was assessed using the water-maze task and potential hippocampal alterations were determined by studying PUFA levels, gene expression, neurogenesis and astrocyte morphology. Perinatal HFD induced long-lasting metabolic alterations and some changes in gene expression in the hippocampus, but had no effect on memory. In contrast, spatial memory was impaired in animals exposed to HFD during the perinatal period and maintained on this diet. HF-HF rats also exhibited low n-3 and high n-6 PUFA levels, decreased neurogenesis and downregulated expression of several plasticity-related genes in the hippocampus. To determine the contribution of the perinatal diet to the memory deficits reported in HF-HF animals, an additional experiment was conducted in which rats were only exposed to HFD starting at weaning (C-HF). Interestingly, memory performance in this group was similar to controls. Overall, our results suggest that perinatal exposure to HFD with an unbalanced n-6/n-3 ratio sensitizes the offspring to the adverse effects of subsequent high-fat intake on hippocampal function.
