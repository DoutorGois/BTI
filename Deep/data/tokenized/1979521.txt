Isoproterenol induced long-lasting potentiation (LLP) of the medial perforant path-evoked excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) and long-lasting depression (LLD) of the lateral perforant path-evoked EPSP in the absence of perforant path activation. The NMDA receptor antagonist D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid [D(-)APV] blocked the induction of LLP and LLD. After wash, a subsequent exposure to isoproterenol induced only LLP of medial perforant path EPSPs; LLD of lateral perforant path-evoked EPSPs did not occur. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic agonist-induced synaptic modifications in the dentate gyrus arise from pre- and postsynaptic events.
