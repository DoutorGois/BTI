The putative muscarinic M1 receptor agonist, AF102B, was applied to rat hippocampal slices and the responses of intracellularly recorded pyramidal cells were examined. AF102B mimicked some effects of acetylcholine on these cells as follows: at low concentration, AF102B attenuated a slow after-hyperpolarization in response to a long depolarizing current pulse. This effect was blocked by the M1 antagonist, pirenzepine. At higher concentrations, AF102B also depolarized the cells and caused an increase in their input resistance. AF102B did not affect local excitatory postsynaptic potentials or reactivity to topically applied excitatory amino acid substances. These experiments indicate that AF102B acts as an agonist at some muscarinic M1 receptor subtypes in mammalian brain.
