Neuronal activity of the auditory thalamus, amygdala, cingulate cortex, and substantia nigra was recorded during the administration of a behavioral test for latent inhibition (LI) or the retardation of behavioral conditioning because of preexposure of the conditional stimulus (CS). Following CS preexposure, both the preexposed CS and a control CS predicted avoidable footshock. LI occurred as significantly fewer avoidance conditioned avoidance responses after the preexposed CS than after the control CS. Attenuation of neuronal responses to the preexposed CS, or neural LI, occurred in all monitored areas. One group of subjects (Oryctolagus cuniculus) then received context extinction, and additional groups experienced novel context exposure or handling. Context extinction enhanced behavioral responding to the preexposed CS, eliminating LI. Context extinction also eliminated cingulate cortical neural LI by enhancing posterior cingulate cortical responses to the preexposed CS and attenuating anterior cingulate cortical responses to the control CS. Present and past results are interpreted to indicate that LI is (a) a failure of response retrieval and/or expression mediated by interfering CS-context associations and (b) a product of interactions of the posterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus.
