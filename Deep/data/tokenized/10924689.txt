Postischemic delayed neuronal death (DND) of hippocampal CA1 neurons can be prevented by a preconditioning sublethal ischemic stimulus. To check for possible participation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in neuronal death or survival, we analyzed postischemic protein expression of subtypes 1b and 5 of group I mGluRs, which are thought to exert neurotoxic effects after pathological activation due to ischemia, and subtypes 2 and 3 of group II mGluRs, which in contrast are thought to be neuroprotective in this state, respectively. Therefore, three groups of gerbils with reperfusion intervals between 8 h and 4 days (n=5 each) were investigated: one group was subjected to 5 min ischemia, resulting in DND of CA1 neurons, a second group to a tolerance inducing 2.5 min period of ischemia and a third group to 5 min ischemia after prior tolerance induction. The major finding was a transient postischemic reduction of mGluR1b and 5 expression in the ischemic tolerant CA1 subfield at 8 h. This downregulation of neurotoxic mGluRs may indicate a contribution to the survival of highly vulnerable CA1 neurons in the ischemic tolerant state.
