Neuropeptide Y (NPY) was continuously administered to Wistar rats intracarotidly via the external carotid artery and local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) was measured by a quantitative autoradiography using [14C]iodoantipyrine. A remarkable reduction in LCBF was observed in the NPY infused hemisphere. This depression was irregular and was particularly evident in the hippocampus, selective thalamic nuclei and the cerebral cortex.
