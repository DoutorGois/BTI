We examined the effects of gestational cocaine treatment on oxytocin levels in the whole hippocampus (HIP), ventral tegmental area (VTA), medial preoptic area (MPOA) and amygdala (AMY) in rat dams on postpartum days (PPDs) 1 and 2. Cocaine treatment significantly reduced oxytocin levels in the MPOA within 12-16 h of delivery (PPD 1), but had no significant effect on the other brain areas. Oxytocin was significantly reduced in the HIP and VTA but not in the AMY or MPOA on PPD 2. These data provide the first evidence for the reduction of oxytocin levels in the VTA, HIP and MPOA as a result of gestational cocaine treatment.
