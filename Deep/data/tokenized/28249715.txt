Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and currently there are no effective disease-modifying treatments available. Hallmark symptoms of AD include impaired hippocampus-dependent episodic memory and disrupted sleep and circadian rhythms. The pathways connecting these symptoms are of particular interest because it is well established that sleep and circadian disruption can impair hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. In rodents, these procedures also markedly suppress adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a form of brain plasticity that is believed to play an important role in pattern separation, and thus episodic memory. A causal role for sleep disruptions in AD pathophysiology is suggested by evidence for sleep-dependent glymphatic clearance of metabolic waste products from the brain. This review explores a complementary hypothesis that sleep and circadian disruptions in AD contribute to cognitive decline by activating neuroendocrine and neuroinflammatory signaling pathways that suppress hippocampal neurogenesis. Evidence for this hypothesis underscores the promise of sleep, circadian rhythms, and neurogenesis as therapeutic targets for remediation of memory impairment in AD.
