To investigate the role played by GABA transporters in epileptic seizures, we examined time-dependent and regional changes in expression of GAT-1 and GAT-3 GABA transporter mRNA in amygdala-kindled rat brain using an in situ hybridization method. GAT-1 mRNA was significantly increased bilaterally in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (111-116%) at 1 h after kindled generalized seizures. GAT-1 mRNA was also significantly increased bilaterally in the hippocampal subfields (CA1-4 and dentate gyrus [110-117%]) at 4 h after kindled seizures. There were no significant changes in GAT-1 mRNA level in the amygdalar nuclei, pyriform cortex or cerebral cortex either ipsilaterally or contralaterally at any time after kindled seizures. In contrast, GAT-3 mRNA was significantly increased bilaterally in the amygdalar nuclei and in the contralateral pyriform cortex and cerebral cortex 1 h after seizures. Since all these changes returned to control levels by 8 or 24 h after kindled seizures, the increases in GABA transporter mRNA appeared to be transient responses to seizure activity. These findings indicate that GAT-1 subtype transporter is specifically involved in seizure activity in the hippocampus, while GAT-3 subtype transporter is mainly involved in seizure activity in the amygdalar nuclei and pyriform cortex following amygdala-kindled generalized seizures.
