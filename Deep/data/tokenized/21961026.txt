Cell membranes are made up of a mixture of glycerolipids, sphingolipids, gangliosides and cholesterol. Lipids play important roles in a cell's life. However many of their functions have still to be discovered. In the present work, we describe an efficient, easy and rapid methodology to accurately localize phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins from a single coronal rat brain section in the cerebrum area. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry was used to profile and image lipids. The best resolved structure was 25-50 mum in the hippocampus.
