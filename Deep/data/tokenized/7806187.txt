Based on the receptor competitive binding assays in the mice and rat body, it has been proved that both diazepam and alpha-sec-butyl-p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (G-018) can inhibit 125I-G-018 binding with brain benzodiazepine receptor. Inhibiting effects were obvious in the cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and midbrain. But in the medullao blongata and hypothalamus no inhibiting effect was observed. Experimental results have demonstrated that the inhibiting effect is consistent with distribution of benzodiazepine receptor in the brain. Also, experimental results have shown no difference between in vitro and in vivo. The G-018 binding with benzodiazepine receptor has been clarified under physiologic conditions.
