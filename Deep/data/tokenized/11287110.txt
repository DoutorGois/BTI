Intracerebroventricular injection of NPY inhibits epileptiform seizures and seizure-related "wet dog shakes" (WDS) following electrical stimulation of the dentate gyrus or subiculum. This study examined the effects of NPY on seizures and WDS elicited in hippocampal CA3. Like in the other hippocampal regions, NPY significantly inhibited both seizures and accompanying WDS consistent with in vitro data. The identification of an additional antiepileptic hippocampal target for NPY could prove therapeutically relevant considering that the hippocampal formation is a frequent seizure focus in human epilepsy. The effects of NPY were found to persist on seven repeated NPY injection days. Thus tolerance to the anti-seizure effects of NPY does not appear to develop rapidly. Tolerance being a problem with several current antiepileptic drugs, this further strengthens the concept of NPY receptors as a potential future antiepileptic target.
