We have previously demonstrated that administration of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, or spermine can prevent neuronal degeneration in rats during naturally occurring cell death or after injurious treatments such as nerve injury or monosodium glutamate neurotoxicity. The present study demonstrates that also in adult gerbils polyamine treatment can protect forebrain neurons from degeneration after ischemia. Neurons in the hippocampus and striatum were rescued from delayed cell death after brief (5 min) global ischemia in gerbils which were treated with daily injections (10 mg/kg) of polyamines. The evidence accrued, so far, indicates that systemic polyamines can protect a wide variety of central and peripheral neurons from natural or induced degeneration.
