Western analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the time-course and the distribution of the 27,000 mol. wt heat shock protein, Hsp27, in rat brain following systemic administration of kainic acid. No Hsp27 immunoreactivity was detected in naive control animals or in rats that failed to develop status epilepticus. Hsp27 immunoreactivity was detected as early as 12 h in the parietal cortex, piriform cortex and the hippocampus of rats that developed status epilepticus. The number of cells expressing Hsp27 and the intensity of Hsp27 immunoreactivity were increased 24 h after kainic acid administration. Hsp27 immunoreactivity was still observed seven days post-kainic acid injection. The morphology of the Hsp27-positive cells and double immunofluorescence against Hsp27 and glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that Hsp27-positive cells were astrocytes. In addition, the distribution of Hsp27 suggested that astrocytic Hsp27 was dependent on excitation-induced metabolic stress rather than the direct effect of kainic acid on astrocytes.
