Kinetics of 22Na metabolism in rat hippocampal slices and its changes after single or 7-day injections of hydrocortisone (HC) were studied with an improved method of compartmental analysis. HC caused a redistribution of Na towards an increase of intracellular fractions. The rate constants of Na transfer through cell membranes increased, the Na influx rate constant enhanced to a greater extent than the efflux one. Both single and week HC administration caused a rise in transmembrane stationary fluxes of sodium. The effects observed were compared with the HC action on 22Na metabolism in slices of the neocortex described earlier.
