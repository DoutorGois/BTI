The transfer of ebiratide into the brain was examined in rats. Its brain levels after intravenous administration (2-20 mg/kg), determined by radioimmunoassay, peaked at 5 min and declined almost in parallel with the plasma levels. Brain/plasma ratios (B/P) were constantly about 0.05 ml/g at all doses. Brain distribution study at 5 min after 125I-ebiratide at an effective dose (0.4 microgram/kg) revealed that unchanged ebiratide had larger B/P than the metabolites and region selectivity. The combined use with unlabeled ebiratide resulted in marked decreases in B/P, particularly in the hippocampus, suggesting a specific uptake of this peptide.
