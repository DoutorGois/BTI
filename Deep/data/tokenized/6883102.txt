Retrograde transport of Evans blue dye from the rat dentate gyrus was used to identify afferent hypothalamic cells. Photography of the fluorescent hypothalamic cells was followed by incubation in an acetylthiocholine medium. Slides were re-photographed for acetylcholinesterase-induced reaction product. Nearly all posterior hypothalamic cell afferents to the dentate gyrus could be positively identified as containing acetylcholinesterase.
