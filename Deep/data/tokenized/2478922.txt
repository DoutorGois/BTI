The present study was an attempt to clarify the role of noradrenaline (NA) and of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system in various nuclei in brain, as a component of a proposed neural circuit in the mediation of conflict behavior and the anticonflict action of anxiolytics. The authors investigated changes in the concentrations of NA, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol, 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in discrete regions of the brain in rats, in correlation with conflict behavior and also the effects of diazepam and suriclone. Noradrenergic neural activity diminished with a conflict situation, in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, mammillary body and dorsal hippocampus. 5-Hydroxytryptaminergic neural activity increased with a conflict situation in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, basolateral amygdala and medial septum. These changes in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, mammillary body and dorsal hippocampus were not observed when diazepam 20 mg/kg (p.o.) and suriclone 40 mg/kg (p.o.) produced anticonflict action. Suriclone normalized the increased 5-HT-ergic activity in the medial septum. The suppression of NA-ergic and the activation of 5-HT-ergic (except for the mammillary body) neural activity in the frontal cortex, central amygdala, mammillary body and dorsal hippocampus seemed to be linked to the mediation of conflict behavior. The facilitatory and inhibitory action on NA and 5-HT (except for the mammillary body) neurons, respectively, in these regions of the brain, may be involved in mechanisms underlying the anticonflict action of anxiolytics (diazepam or suriclone).
