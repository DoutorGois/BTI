The development of the human fetal hippocampus and dentate gyrus has been studied immunocytochemically. The first glial cells to appear are vimentin-positive radial glial cells. A gradual transition from vimentin to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reactivity in the radial glial cells occurs at week 8. The GFAP-positive radial glial cells transform into astrocytes from week 14. A population of small S-100-positive somata which morphologically and spatially are distinct from GFAP-positive radial glial cells and their transformed progeny, are found as early as week 9.5 in the hippocampus during the period of peak neurogenesis. The well-defined immunoreactivity of the morphologically homogenous cell subpopulation for S-100 protein, which has been used as an astrocytic marker in the adult hippocampus, indicates that astrocytes may differentiate at very early gestational ages in human fetuses. The S-100-positive astrocytes are thought to be derived from ventricular zone cells, which at the time of their appearance do not express any of the applied astrocytic markers (S-100, GFAP, vimentin). It is suggested that the S-100-positive astrocytic cell population interacts with the first incoming projection fibers, so modulating the pattern of connectivity.
