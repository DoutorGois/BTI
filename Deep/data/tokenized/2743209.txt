It has been reported that a nonapeptide (Val-Pro-Val-Glu-Ala-Val-Asp-Pro-Met) called V-9-M is produced from procholecystokinin in the brain. Since this peptide is particularly abundant in the hippocampus, septum, and amygdala. V-9-M may be involved in memory processes. The present study was attempted to observe the effect of V-9-M on memory processes of rat performing a one-trial passive avoidance task and a platform jumping active avoidance task. The results indicate that injection of V-9-M into the lateral ventricle of the rat prevents experimental amnesia induced by electroconvulsive shock in passive avoidance testing, and that this effect is not significantly affected by cholecystokinin-8 antagonists. V-9-M also causes a long-lasting enhancement of memory in the active avoidance task. These results suggest that V-9-M may participate in the facilitation of memory.
