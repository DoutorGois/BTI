In the mammalian hippocampal formation, dendrotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels modulate action potential propagation and neurotransmitter release. To explore the neuroanatomical basis for this modulation, we used in situ hybridization, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry to determine the subcellular localization of the Kv channel subunits Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.4, and Kvbeta2 within the adult rat hippocampus. Although mRNAs encoding all four of these Kv channel subunits are expressed in the cells of origin of each major hippocampal afferent and intrinsic pathway, immunohistochemical staining suggests that the encoded subunits are associated with the axons and terminal fields of these cells. Using an excitotoxin lesion strategy, we explored the subcellular localization of these subunits in detail. We found that ibotenic acid lesions of the entorhinal cortex eliminated Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 immunoreactivity and dramatically reduced Kv1.2 and Kvbeta2 immunoreactivity in the middle third of the dentate molecular layer, indicating that these subunits are located on axons and terminals of entorhinal afferents. Similarly, ibotenic acid lesions of the dentate gyrus eliminated Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 immunoreactivity in the stratum lucidum of CA3, indicating that these subunits are located on mossy fiber axons. Kainic acid lesions of CA3 dramatically reduced Kv1.1 immunoreactivity in the stratum radiatum of CA1-CA3, indicating that Kv1.1 immunoreactivity in these subfields is associated with the axons and terminals of the Schaffer collaterals. Together with the results of coimmunoprecipitation analyses, these data suggest that action potential propagation and glutamate release at excitatory hippocampal synapses are directly modulated by Kv1 channel complexes predominantly localized on axons and nerve terminals.
