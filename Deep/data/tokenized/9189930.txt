The changes of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and nitrite level in rat brain regions after spatial learning were investigated. NOS activity was assayed by conversion of [3H]L-arginine to [3H]L-citrulline, and a sensitive fluorometric assay for quantification of nitrite was used. Compared with sham-trained rats, NOS activity and nitrite level in hippocampus and cortex, and also the nitrite level in cerebellum, was elevated significantly one day after rats had learnt a water-rewarded spatial alteration task. These results suggest a spatial memory-related changes of endogenous NO in rat brain, and support the idea that NO participates in learning and memory processes.
