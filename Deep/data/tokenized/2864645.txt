Isolated pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampus were investigated under conditions of intracellular perfusion and voltage clamp using the method of rapid application of extracellular solution. It was found that the L-glutamate-activated current was carried by sodium and potassium ions with PK+/PNa+ ratio about 0.6. The dose-response relationship demonstrated one to one interaction between L-glutamate and membrane receptor with Kd value about 1.1 mmol/l.
