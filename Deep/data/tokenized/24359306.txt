OBJECTIVES: Xiaochaihutang (XCHT) has been used in China for thousands of years to treat 'Shaoyang syndrome', which involves depressive-like symptoms. However, no studies were conducted to demonstrate its antidepressant effect and mechanism. This study was designed to confirm the antidepressant effect of XCHT and explore its mechanism using the pharmacological methods. METHODS: Ultra-HPLC and mass spectrometry was used to identify the chemical constituents of XCHT. Forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) were used to determine the antidepressant-like activity of XCHT in mice and rats. The possible mechanism of XCHT was elucidated by the reserpine-induced hypothermia and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head-twitch in mice. The levels of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus tissue of both mice and rats. Moreover, the extracellular 5-HT in rat hippocampus was assessed by using microdialysis coupled to HPLC with electrochemical detection. KEY FINDINGS: Forty-four components were detected in XCHT. XCHT significantly reduced immobility time in the TST and the FST, antagonized reserpine-induced depressive-like behaviours, increased 5-HTP-induced head-twitches, elevated 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, and increased 5-HT turnover at doses that did not affect general activity. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that XCHT has therapeutic effects in animal models of depression by enhancing the serotoninergic system in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.
