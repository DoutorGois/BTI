Both N- and P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels are involved in fast transmitter release in the hippocampus, but are differentially regulated. Although variable contributions of voltage-dependent calcium channel subtypes to presynaptic Ca2+ influx have been suggested to give a neural network of great diversity, their presence has only been demonstrated in a culture system and has remained unclear in the brain. Here, the individual large mossy fiber presynaptic terminal was labeled with Ca2+/Sr2+-sensitive fluorescent dextrans in the hippocampal slice of the mouse. The fractional contribution of voltage-dependent calcium channel subtypes to presynaptic Ca2+/Sr2+ influx was directly measured by the sensitivity of Ca2+/Sr2+-dependent fluorescent increment to subtype-selective neurotoxins, omega-conotoxin GVIA (an N-type selective blocker), omega-agatoxin IVA (a P/Q-type selective blocker) and SNX-482 (an R-type selective blocker). Synapse-to-synapse comparison of large mossy fiber terminals revealed that the contributions of N- and R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels varied more widely than that of P/Q-type. Even two large mossy fiber presynaptic terminals neighboring on the same axon differed in the fractional contributions of N- and R-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. On the other hand, these terminals were similar in the fractional contributions of P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. These results provide direct evidence that individual large mossy fiber synapses are differential in the contribution of N- and R-type voltage-dependent calcium channel subtypes to presynaptic Ca2+/Sr2+ influx. We suggest that the synapse-to-synapse variation of presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channel subtype contributions may be one of the mechanisms amplifying diversity of the hippocampal network.
