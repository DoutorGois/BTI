Piracetam, when applied microiontophoretically and/or by hydropneumatic pump on the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus of the rat, affected neuronal activity by depressing or facilitating the spontaneous firing rate, depending on the area studied. Its effect were either additive or counteracting the actions of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine, when administered together on the same neuron, thus supporting the assumption that its action is directed towards specific membrane elements, presumably the synaptic sites.
