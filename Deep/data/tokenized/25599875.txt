A major feature of Alzheimer's disease is the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in the brain. Recent studies have indicated that Abeta oligomers (Abetao) can interact with the cellular prion protein (PrPc). Therefore, this interaction might be driving some of Abeta toxic effects in the synaptic region. In the present study, we report that Abetao binds to PrPc in the neuronal membrane playing a role on toxic effects induced by Abeta. Phospholipase C-enzymatic cleavage of PrPc from the plasma membrane attenuated the association of Abetao to the neurons. Furthermore, an anti-PrP antibody (6D11) decreased the association of Abetao to hippocampal neurons with a concomitant reduction in Abetao and PrPc co-localization. Interestingly, this antibody blocked the increase in membrane conductance and intracellular calcium induced by Abetao. Thus, the data indicate that PrPc plays a role on the membrane perforations produced by Abetao, the increase in calcium ions and the release of synaptic vesicles that subsequently leads to synaptic failure. Future studies blocking Abetao interaction with PrPc could be important for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.
