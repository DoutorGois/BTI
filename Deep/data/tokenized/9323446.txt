Recently, attention has been focused on the degradation of cytoskeletal proteins in animal models of cerebral ischemia, as the collapse of cytoskeletal proteins may be closely related to cytoskeletal disintegration and ultimate neuronal cell death. Among these proteins, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) has been shown to be highly vulnerable to ischemic injuries. To determine the degree of anesthetic effect on the collapse of cytoskeletal proteins, we compared the effect of three inhalation anesthetics; isoflurane, halothane, and nitrous oxide (N2O), on MAP2 degradation during 20 min of forebrain ischemia in the rat. Under equipotent anesthesia, forebrain ischemia was induced by the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) combined with a lowering of mean arterial pressure (mAP) to 50 mmHg. After 20 min of ischemia, three regions of the brain, the frontoparietal cortex, brainstem, and hippocampus, were removed and separately homogenized. Subsequently, MAP2 of each region was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus, MAP2 was significantly protected from degradation when isoflurane was used combined with nitrogen (N2). However, the protective effects of isoflurane were drastically reduced when N2O was given instead of N2. These results suggest that the use of N2O should be discontinued when severe cerebral ischemia is accidentally incurred during anesthetic management.
