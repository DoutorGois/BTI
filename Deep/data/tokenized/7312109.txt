The authors discuss the morphology of records of spontaneous and stimulated bioelectric activity in an analysis of selected 15 EEG records using electric stimulation of deep temporal structures using relatively low parameters of stimulation (optimal: 2--3 V, 50 Hz, 1 msec, duration 5 sec). Attention is called also to the fact that seizure activity is absent in leads from skull surface during long-lasting bioelectric seizure activity in deep cerebral structures. It is concluded that induction of afterdischarges and analysis of the directions of their spread may be of practical importance from the point of view of diagnosis and therapy. The authors state also that induction of bioelectric afterdischarges in deep temporal structures, particularly in the hippocampus caused in these patients no disturbances of consciousness and memory.
