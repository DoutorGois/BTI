The effects of GABA agonists on [3H] flunitrazepam binding were examined in membranes from CNS areas proposed to contain different populations of benzodiazepine binding site subtypes (BZ1/BZ2). Since these effects were broadly similar in both cerebellar and hippocampal membranes, it seems unlikely that GABA receptors interacting with the proposed BZ1/BZ2 binding sites have markedly different properties. Sodium chloride clearly facilitated the potentiating effect of muscimol on [3H] flunitrazepam binding but produced a complex interaction with the effects of GABA itself and the partial agonist imidazoleacetic acid in the phosphate buffer system used.
