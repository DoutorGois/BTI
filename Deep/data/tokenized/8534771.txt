Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a key extracellular enzyme that enables tissue to import fatty acids from triacylglyceride-rich lipoproteins. LPL is present in most tissues of the body, but in the brain its functional significance remains unclear. Lipids constitute the main components of myelin and undergo significant changes during maturation. However, nothing is known of the postnatal evolution of LPL activity in the brain areas during postnatal development. Here we found that LPL activity is relatively high in the newborn brain and peaks between the 5th and the 10th days after birth, reaching activities 5 times higher than in the adult brain. In all the areas studied (olfactory bulbs, cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, brain-stem and spinal cord) LPL also increases sharply during postnatal development. Hippocampus shows the highest LPL activity levels, which are between 5 and 11 times higher than in the other regions. The significance of these high LPL activity levels is discussed.
