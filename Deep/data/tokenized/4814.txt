Levels as well as accumulation of serotonin (5-HT) were measured in various brain regions of the rat after administration of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (MIF-I). The method used in determining the serotonin measured both 5-OH-tryptamine (5-HT) and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT). No statistically significant changes in levels or accumulation of serotonin after pargyline injection were found when unoperated control rats were treated with either MSH or MIF-I. Similar treatment of hypophysectomized rats indicated that both peptides significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered serotonin accumulation only in the area of the frontal cortex; a similar but smaller, not statistically significant, decrease was seen in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of the hypophysectomized rat. Since only hypophysectomized rats were affected, no correlation between the behavioral effects of these peptides (which has been found to occur in both unoperated and hypophysectomized rats) and the biochemical changes could be made.
