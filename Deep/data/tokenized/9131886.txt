Rat neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (nNOS) activity was measured in frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum using the assay of [3H]citrulline, following chronic alcoholization. The Km and Vmax values were significantly increased in the frontal cortex and in the striatum, and were not affected in the cerebellum and hippocampus.
