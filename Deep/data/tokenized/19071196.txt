Basic and clinical studies have revealed that depression is frequently observed following myocardial infarction (MI). We observed changes in neurons in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) 14 days after chronic cardiac ischemia. Cresyl violet staining was conducted to examine neurodegeneration. Cresyl violet-positive neurons in the hippocampus in the MI-operated group were similar to those in the sham-operated group, and Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells were not observed in either group. Next, we observed changes in cell proliferation using Ki67 and in the differentiation of neuroblasts using doublecortin (DCX) in the DG. The number of Ki67- and DCX-positive cells in the subgranular zone of the DG in the MI-operated group was significantly increased compared to that in the sham-operated group. In addition, DCX-positive processes were prominent in the MI group. These results suggest that MI may influence cell proliferation and affect neuroblast differentiation in the subgranular zone of the DG.
