Epileptic seizures result in an increased generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the adult mammalian hippocampus. The role of these seizure-induced newborn neurons in the process of epileptogenesis remains largely unknown. Recent work, however, suggests an aberrant incorporation of newborn cells into the existing hippocampal network in such a way that they promote hippocampal hyperexcitability. In the present review, we discuss current knowledge about the possible role of seizure-induced newly generated neurons and the putative involvement of ligand-gated ion channels in the process of epileptogenesis.
