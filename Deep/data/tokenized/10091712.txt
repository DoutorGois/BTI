The experiments carried out on Albino Swiss mice indicated that bilateral clamping of carotid arteries (BCCA) for 30 min caused no neuronal damage but produced an increase in GABA content in the hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex. The behavioral studies have shown that BCCA did not influence the motor coordination, the spontaneous locomotor activity, the reactivity to pain and the cataleptic response to haloperidol of the mice. However, a significant increase in amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was observed after BCCA. In mice, BCCA did not impair long-term memory and spatial working memory, reflected by alternation behavior in the Y-maze. The same dose of scopolamine impaired the working memory in mice which underwent BCCA much more than sham-operated controls. Naftidrofuryl improved the working memory in mice subjected to BCCA as measured 48 h after the surgery. Pretreatment with naftidrofuryl protected the animals against the impairment of alternation behavior caused by scopolamine administration.
