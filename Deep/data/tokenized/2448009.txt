Trophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) are thought to support survival, differentiation and maintenance of neurons. Recent results indicate that NGF produced in cortical and hippocampal areas is required for the function of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain. With the use of enzyme immunoassay and RNA blot hybridization we studied the NGF protein and NGF mRNA, respectively, in regions of the brain innervated by basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in adult and aged rats. Levels of NGF protein were decreased by 40% in hippocampus of aged (28 months) Fischer 344 rats compared with adults (6 months), whereas no alterations were observed in cerebral cortex. Moreover, a reduction by 50% in the NGF mRNA was found in samples of the aged forebrain (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain and hypothalamus) compared to the adult. NGF deficiencies may thus account for the loss of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain generally found to accompany normal aging and resulting in altered cognitive functions.
