The SHR and SLA16 inbred strains present behavioral differences in anxiety/emotionality that could be under the influence of dopaminergic neurotransmission. In order to investigate the role of D2 receptors in modulating such differences, an agonist (quinpirole) and an antagonist (haloperidol) of this receptor were administered, either via systemic injection (IP), or microinjected into the ventral area of the hippocampus (vHIP). Quinpirole and haloperidol IP decreased locomotor activity, only in SLA16 rats in the open-field (OF), and in both strains in the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Quinpirole also increased the preference for the aversive areas of the EPM. Quinpirole vHIP decreased locomotor activity in both strains. Haloperidol vHIP did not elicit behavioural changes and no differences in the levels of D2 receptors and of dopamine transporter in the hippocampus were found. Results indicate that systemic activation/blocking of D2 receptors caused a strain-dependent hypolocomotion, whereas activation of D2 receptors in the vHIP, but not D2 receptor antagonism, regardless of dose, decreased general locomotor activity in the two strains. Therefore, we suggest that genomic differences in the chromosome 4 can influence the locomotor activity regulated by the D2 dopaminergic receptor, especially in the vHIP.
