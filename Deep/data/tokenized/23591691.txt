The amygdaloid complex and hippocampal region contribute to emotional activities, learning, and memory. Mounting evidence suggests a primary role for serotonin (5-HT) in the physiological basis of memory and its pathogenesis by modulating directly the activity of these two areas and their cross-talk. Indeed, both the amygdala and the hippocampus receive remarkably dense serotoninergic inputs from the dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Anatomical, behavioral and electrophysiological evidence indicates the 5-HT2A receptor as one of the principal postsynaptic targets mediating 5-HT effects. In fact, the 5-HT2A receptor is the most abundant 5-HT receptor expressed in these brain structures and is expressed on both amygdalar and hippocampal pyramidal glutamatergic neurons as well as on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing interneurons. 5-HT2A receptors on GABAergic interneurons stimulate GABA release, and thereby have an important role in regulating network activity and neural oscillations in the amygdala and hippocampal region. This review will focus on the distribution and physiological functions of the 5-HT2A receptor in the amygdala and hippocampal region. Taken together the results discussed here suggest that 5-HT2A receptor may be a potential therapeutic target for those disorders related to hippocampal and amygdala dysfunction.
