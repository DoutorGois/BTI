The epileptogenic properties of the mast cell degranulating peptide (MCD) have been investigated in the CA3 region of the hippocampal slice preparation. Brief (3-5 min) bath application of MCD (0.5-2 microM) to CA3 hippocampal neurones produced an enhancement of the spontaneous synaptic activity and the appearance of spontaneous bursts that persisted for several hours. These bursts were network driven and the underlying paroxysmal depolarizing shift met the criteria for a giant excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), with a reversal potential close to 0 mV. Furthermore following the application of MCD, stimulation of the mossy fibres, commissural or temporo-ammonic pathway evoked an EPSP followed by an evoked network burst. The bursts which could be elicited for several hours were reversibly blocked by a brief application of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 microM) or cobalt (2 mM). In contrast, prior and concomitant treatment with TTX or cobalt prevented the occurrence of the bursts induced by MCD. The effects of MCD were not due to a blockade of GABAergic inhibition since the toxin did not reduce the fast and slow IPSP. Furthermore, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists D-2-amino-phosphonovalerate (D-APV; 30 microM) or DL-amino-phosphoheptanoic acid (AP-7, 30 microM) did not block the action of MCD, suggesting that the activation of NMDA receptors are neither necessary nor sufficient for MCD-induced bursts. It is concluded that MCD induces in the CA3 region long-lasting changes in the synaptic responses which may be mediated through a presynaptic mechanism.
