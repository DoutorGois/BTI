INTRODUCTION: Prolactin is a peptide hormone mainly synthetized and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, but also by extrapituitary tissues, such as mammary gland, decidua, prostate, skin, and possibly the brain. Similarly, prolactin receptor is expressed in the pituitary gland, many peripheral tissues, and in contrast to prolactin, its receptor has been consistently detected in several brain regions, such as cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, among others. Classically, prolactin function has been related to the stimulation of lactogenesis and galactopoiesis, however, it is well known that prolactin induces a wide range of functions in different brain areas. PURPOSE: The aim of this review is to summarize recent reports on prolactin and prolactin receptor synthesis and localization, as well as recapitulate both the classic functions attributed to this hormone in the brain and the recently described functions such as neurogenesis, neurodevelopment, sleep, learning and memory, and neuroprotection. CONCLUSION: The distribution and putative expression of prolactin and its receptors in several neuronal tissues suggests that this hormone has pleiotropic functions in the brain.
