Exposure of hippocampal slices to Mg2+ free media (0 Mg) has been shown to trigger full production of stimulus-induced seizure activity after restoration of physiological conditions [1]. In the present study employing hippocampal entorhinal cortical slices (HEC), spontaneous epileptiform discharges (SEDs) were induced using 0 Mg treatment following the return of the slices to physiological conditions. To evaluate the effect of sustained epileptiform activity on gene expression in this HEC slice preparation, changes in mRNA levels of the GABAA alpha 1 and alpha 2 and beta CaM Kinase II subunits were measured using in situ hybridization. HEC slices were incubated in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) in the presence or absence of Mg2+ for 3 h, then placed in oxygenated ACSF containing Mg2+ for up to 3 h. Control slices were maintained in Mg2+ containing ACSF for up to 6 h. Recurrent SEDs were observed in 0 Mg pre-treated slices while no epileptiform discharges were seen in control slices. Following induction of SEDs by 0 Mg pre-treatment, a significant decrease in mRNA encoding GABAA alpha 2 was found in the CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus for up to 3 h after treatment. Levels of mRNA for GABAA alpha 1 and beta CaM Kinase II were not affected. The results document a decrease in GABAA alpha 2 gene expression following the induction of SEDs in the HEC slice preparation and suggest that rapid changes in neuronal gene expression may contribute to long lasting excitability changes associated with the induction of epilepsy.
