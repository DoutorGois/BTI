Purpose. To determine whether moxibustion influences the learning and memory behavior of ApoE-/- male mice, and investigate the mechanism of moxibustion on the alteration of oxidized proteins (glial fibrillary acidic protein, beta-amyloid) in hippocampus. Methods. Thirty-three ApoE-/- mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 11/group): moxibustion, sham moxibustion, and no treatment control. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice (n = 13) were used for normal control. Moxibustion was performed with Shenque (RN8) moxibustion for 20 minutes per day, 6 days/week for 12 weeks. In sham control, the procedure was similar except burning of the moxa stick. Behavioral tests (step-down test and Morris water maze task) were conducted in the 13th week. The mice were then sacrificed and the tissues were harvested for immune-histochemical staining. Results. In the step-down test, the moxibustion group had shorter reaction time in training record and committed less mistakes compared to sham control. In immune-histochemical study, the moxibustion group expressed lower level of GFAP and less aggregation of beta-amyloid in the hippocampus than the sham control. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that moxibustion may enhance learning capability of ApoE-/- mice. The mechanism may be via inhibiting oxidized proteins (GFAP and beta-amyloid) in astrocytes.
