OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on hippocampal apoptosis protein caspase-9 expression and neuroethology in hyperlipemia plus cerebral ischemia (HL-CI) rats. METHODS: Seventy male SD rats were randomized into control, hyperlipemia (HL), CI, HL-CI, CI + EA, HL-CI + EA I , and HL-CI + EA II groups, with 10 cases in each. HL model was established by feeding the animals with high fat forage for 6 weeks and CI model was established by occlusion of the unilateral middle cerebral artery. EA (1-3 mA, 15 Hz) was applied to bilateral "Sanyinjiao" (SP 6) and "Fenglong" (ST 40) for 20 min every time; and "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Shuigou" (GV 26) were punctured and stimulated by twirling the acupuncture needle with hand continuously for 1 min. Acupuncture was given once daily for 17 days (beginning from the 10th day on before CI) in HL-CI + EA I group, and for 7 days (beginning after CI) in HL-CI + EA II group. The expression of hippocampal Caspase-9 was detected with immunohistochemistry. The score of neuroethology was also measured according to modified Bederson's method. RESULTS: In comparison with normal control and hyperlipemia model groups, Caspase-9 immune reaction (IR) positive cells in the hippocampus in HL-CI group increased significantly (P<0.01). After acupuncture Caspase-9 IR-positive cells decreased remarkably. In comparison with group HL-CI + EA II, Caspase-9 IR-positive cells decreased significantly in HL-CI + EA I (P<0.01). The score of neuroethology also degraded obviously. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can improve neuroethology symptom, lessen over expression of hippocampal Caspase-9, and prevent CI injury in hyperlipemia rats with concurrent CI.
