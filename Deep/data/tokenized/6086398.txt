Diazepam in vitro produced a concentration-dependent increase of membrane fluidity in crude synaptic membranes from rat hippocampus, but not cerebellum. Similar effects were obtained with higher concentrations of Ro 15-1788 and PK 11195, while zopiclone was completely inactive. In vivo acute treatment with diazepam and Ro 15-1788 gave results similar to those in vitro. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist also significantly increased membrane fluidity and was not able to reverse diazepam's effect. The data are discussed in terms of a possible role of protein kinase inhibition by the drugs not mediated by the 'central' or 'peripheral' type of benzodiazepine receptors.
