Muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus are relevant to learning and memory, but the role of each subtype is poorly understood. Muscarinic toxins (MTs) from Dendroaspis snakes venom are selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes. MT2, a selective agonist for M(1) receptors, given into the hippocampus immediately after training, improved memory consolidation of an inhibitory avoidance task in rats, whereas the antagonist pirenzepine was amnestic, supporting a facilitatory role of M(1) receptors. Instead, MT3, a selective antagonist at M(4) receptors, caused amnesia. Neither M(1) nor M(4) receptor appeared involved in habituation to a new environment. Thus, our results suggest that memory consolidation of an inhibitory avoidance task in the rat involves the participation of both M(1) and M(4) hippocampal receptors, with a positive modulatory role.
