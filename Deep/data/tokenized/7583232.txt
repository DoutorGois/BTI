Polyamines have been demonstrated to modulate seizure activity in animals. Repeated administration of a subthreshold dose of cocaine resulted in the development of sensitization to cocaine-induced seizures during an initial 3 or 4 days, followed by the development of tolerance to seizures on days 5 and 6. In the present study, polyamines, such as putrescine, spermidine and spermine, were measured in regions of the brain obtained from mice that showed differential sensitivity in seizure activity during repeated cocaine injections. Animals were sacrificed for polyamine measurements 24 h after the second and the fifth injections of either cocaine or saline (on day 3 and day 6, respectively), and 3 days after the last injection. On day 3, there were significant increases in putrescine in the striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum, and in spermine in the cerebellum of cocaine-treated mice, as compared to saline-treated mice. On day 6, treatment with cocaine significantly increased putrescine in all regions, and spermidine in striatum and hippocampus, as compared to saline treatment. Cocaine treatment had no effect on any polyamine levels measured 3 days after the last injection, except for spermidine in the cortex. Because putrescine has been shown to be an antagonist of the polyamine-binding site on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and to retard the development of amygdala-kindling, the present results suggest that the increases in putrescine content may be associated with the development of tolerance to convulsant effects observed during the later period of repeated administration of cocaine.
