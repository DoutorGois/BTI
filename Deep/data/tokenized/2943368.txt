In 2 inbred strains of mice (C57Bl/6J, DBA/2J) in 15 areas, the in vivo GABA turnover rates are significantly correlated with the GABA steady-state levels in 21 day-old mice. In 3 month-old mice the correlation stands only in some areas, the same ones in the 2 strains: olfactory bulbs, frontal cortex, septum, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum. Moreover, the turnover rates decrease sharply with age.
