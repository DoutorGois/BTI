This study with rats examined the effects of excitotoxic lesions to the entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (HPC) on using extramaze and intramaze cues to navigate to a hidden platform in a water maze. HPC lesions resulted in a disruption to the use of extramaze cues, but not intramaze cues, whereas EC lesions had no effect on the use of these cues when they were encountered for the first time. However, prior navigation training in which 1 type of cue was relevant disrupted navigation with the other type in rats with EC lesions. Results show that the EC contributes to the processing of spatial information, but that this contribution is most apparent when there is a conflict between 2 sources of navigational cues in the water maze.
