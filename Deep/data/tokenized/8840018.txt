Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is thought to play an important role in the regulation of neural function. We reported previously that CL100, a cytoplasmic type protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), was induced after transient forebrain ischemia. In the present study, changes in the mRNA levels after ischemia of PRL-1, a cytoplasmic type PTP and immediate-early gene similar to CL100, was examined. In situ hybridization histochemistry showed that PRL-1 mRNA was expressed in normal adult rats in neurons and oligodendrocytes in widespread regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. PRL-1 mRNA was expressed in the developing brains on embryonic days 15 and 19 and postnatal day 1. Northern blot analysis showed that PRL-1 mRNA was induced from 6 h to 9 h after reperfusion in the cerebral cortex of postischemic rats. These findings suggest that PRL-1 plays a role in neurons and oliogodendrocytes, and that expression of PRL-1 mRNA is regulated by a mechanism different from those of other immediate-early genes such as c-fos and c-jun.
