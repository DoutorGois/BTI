Cerebral hypoperfusion and impaired autophagy are two etiological factors that have been identified as being associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the exact relationships among these pathological processes remain unknown. To elucidate the impact of cerebral hypoperfusion in AD, we created a unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) model by occluding the left common carotid artery in both young and old 3xTg-AD mice. Two months after occlusion, we found that ligation increases phospho-Tau (p-Tau) at Serine 199/202 in the hippocampus of 3-month-old AD mice, compared to sham-operated AD mice; whereas, there is no change in the wild type (WT) mice after ligation. Moreover, cerebral hypoperfusion led to significant increase of p-Tau in both the hippocampus and cortex of 16-month-old AD mice and WT mice. Notably, we did not detect any change in Abeta42 level in either young or old AD and WT mice after ligation. Interestingly, we observed a downregulation of LC3-II in the cortex of aged AD mice and WT mice after ligation. Our results suggest that elevated p-Tau and reduced autophagy are major cellular changes that are associated with hypoperfusion in AD. Therefore, targeting p-Tau and autophagy pathways may ameliorate hypoperfusion-induced brain damage in AD.
