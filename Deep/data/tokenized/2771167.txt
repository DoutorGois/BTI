We have previously shown that lesion of the posterior cingulate cortex (CCP) but not of the anterior cingulate cortex (CCA), produced learning and memory deficits. As a first evaluation of the functional anatomical basis of this dissociation, we used the quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose method and electrical brain stimulation to determine the functional connections of the CCA and CCP in mice. CCP stimulation (but not CCA stimulation) produced significant metabolic increases in the hippocampal formation and in the subicular complex. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that learning and memory deficits following CCP lesion may be due to the disruption of functional neural pathways between the CCP and hippocampal structures.
