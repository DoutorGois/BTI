The ability of striated muscle to support CNS axonal regeneration was tested by grafting pieces of the lateral rectus muscle of the orbit into the hippocampus or neocortex of adult inbred CBA mice. The mice were perfused with fixative 4-5 weeks after operation and ultrathin sections of the grafts examined by electron microscopy. Many axons were present in the grafts and some were traced into the surrounding brain tissue. Most axons were in contact with Schwann cells, or their processes, and both were often associated with basal lamina material left behind by degenerating muscle cells. A few axons and their accompanying Schwann cells were found in contact with the plasma membrane of muscle cells. Fenestrated capillaries were present in the grafts. It is suggested that Schwann cells form the substratum for axonal extension into muscle implants in the CNS, although other factors may contribute to the extensive axonal invasion of the tissue.
