The present study was conducted to understand the effect of arachidonic acid on nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity. Arachidonic acid persistently (>/=1 h) potentiated currents through neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors (alpha7 and alpha4beta2) expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the effect was blocked by the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, such as GF109203X, PKCI, and co-expressed active PKC inhibitor peptide. This free fatty acid markedly increased nicotine-sensitive glutamate release from hippocampal slices and enhanced the rate of nicotine-sensitive miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents without affecting the amplitude in cultured hippocampal CA1 neurons under the influence of PKC. Furthermore, arachidonic acid induced a long-lasting (>/=3 h) facilitation of hippocampal CA1 synaptic transmission in slices, and the effect was blocked by nicotinic ACh receptor antagonists, alpha-bungarotoxin and mecamylamine. The facilitation, whereas independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, shares a common mechanism with long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by tetanic stimulation. The results of the present study thus suggest that arachidonic acid sustains enhanced activity of nicotinic ACh receptors by interacting with a PKC pathway, thereby increasing glutamate release from presynaptic terminals, and then leading to an 'LTP-like' facilitation of hippocampal synaptic transmission.
