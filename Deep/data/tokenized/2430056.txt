We have studied changes of cerebral monoamine metabolism and water content, during recirculation following global transient ischemia (20 min) using the four-vessel occlusion model in rats. Levels of monoamines and their metabolites were determined in cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Water content was evaluated by weight and by the analysis of T1 and T2 relaxation times in 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance. Norepinephine levels decreased; 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels oscillated and levels of the end products homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid increased. The regional changes were qualitatively similar but quantitatively different, and were greatest in the hippocampus, illustrating the concept of neuronal selective vulnerability. The changes suggest an initial monoamine depletion and catabolism due to massive release from stores followed by autoregulatory processes. The water content increased moderately, with a maximum at 1 h. The variations of T1 were similar, positively correlated with water content and more pronounced in the cortex than in the white matter. T2 was markedly altered over the entire 24-h period. Those latter parameters are positively correlated with 5-hydroxytryptamine concentration in the hypothalamus consistent with a relationship between 5-hydroxytryptamine and cerebral edema.
