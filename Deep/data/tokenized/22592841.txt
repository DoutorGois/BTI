Inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) are composed of homologous alpha- (alpha1-4) and beta-subunits. The beta-subunits (GlyRbeta) interact via their large cytosolic loops with the postsynaptic scaffolding protein gephyrin and are therefore considered essential for synaptic localization. In situ hybridization studies indicate a widespread distribution of GlyRbeta transcripts throughout the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), whereas GlyRalpha mRNAs and proteins display more restricted expression patterns. Here we report the generation of a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes rodent GlyRbeta (mAb-GlyRbeta) and does not exhibit crossreactivity with any of the GlyRalpha1-4 subunits. Immunostaining with this antibody revealed high densities of punctate GlyRbeta immunoreactivity at inhibitory synapses in mouse spinal cord, brainstem, midbrain, and olfactory bulb but not in the neocortex, cerebellum, or hippocampus. This contrasts the abundance of GlyRbeta transcripts in all major regions of the rodent brain and suggests that GlyRbeta protein levels are regulated posttranscriptionally. When mAb-GlyRbeta was used in double-labeling experiments with GlyRalpha1-, alpha2-, alpha3-, or alpha4-specific antibodies to examine the colocalization of GlyRbeta with these GlyR subunits in the mouse retina, >90% of the GlyRalpha1-3 clusters detected were found to be GlyRbeta-immunoreactive. A subset (about 50%) of the GlyRalpha4 puncta in the inner plexiform layer, however, was found to lack GlyRbeta and gephyrin immunostaining. These GlyRalpha4-only clusters were apposed to bassoon immunoreactivity and hence synaptically localized. Their existence points to a gephyrin-independent synaptic localization mechanism for a minor subset of GlyRs.
