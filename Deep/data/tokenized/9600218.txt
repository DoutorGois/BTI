The mechanisms that underlie cholinergic neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer disease (AD) are unclear, but recent data suggest that oxidative stress plays a role. We report that 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), an aldehydic product of lipid peroxidation, damages and kills basal forebrain cholinergic neurons when administered intraparenchymally. Examination of Nissl-stained brain sections following unilateral HNE infusion revealed widespread neuronal loss in basal forebrain ipsilateral to the injection, but not on the contralateral side. Levels of choline acetyltransferase activity and immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral basal forebrain and hippocampus were significantly reduced by 60-80% seven days following HNE administration. Performance in Morris water maze tasks of visuospatial memory was severely impaired in a dose-dependent manner seven days following bilateral administration of HNE. Bilateral infusion of FeCl2 (an inducer of membrane lipid peroxidation) into the basal forebrain caused neuron loss and decreased choline acetyltransferease immunoreactivity and deficits in visuospatial memory. Additionally, FeCl2 infusion increased HNE immunoreactivity, implicating HNE in iron-induced oxidative damage. Because recent studies have demonstrated HNE adducts in degenerating neurons in AD brain, the present findings suggest a role for HNE in damage to cholinergic neurons in AD.
