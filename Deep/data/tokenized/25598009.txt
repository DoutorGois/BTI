BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have described a novel antidepressant peptide, spadin, that acts by blocking the TWIK-related-potassium channel, type 1 (TREK-1). Here, we examined possible mechanisms of action of spadin at both molecular and cellular levels. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES: Effects of spadin were measured in primary cultures of neurons or tissues from mice injected i.v. with spadin. Western blots, qPCR, histochemical and electrophysiological techniques were used. KEY RESULTS: In vitro, spadin increased neuronal membrane potential and activated both the MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The latter pathway was involved in the protective effect of spadin against staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Also, spadin enhanced both mRNA expression and protein of two markers of synaptogenesis, the post-synaptic density protein of 95 kDalton (PSD-95) and synapsin. We confirmed these effects on synaptogenesis by the observation that spadin treatment significantly increased the proportion of mature spines in cortical neurons. Finally, in vivo injections of spadin led to a rapid increase in both mRNA expression and protein level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, confirming the antidepressant action of the peptide. We argue for a new role of spadin in synaptogenesis as both PSD-95 and synapsin mRNA expression and protein levels were further enhanced in the hippocampus, following treatment in vivo with the peptide. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings provide new mechanisms of action for the rapidly acting antidepressant peptide spadin by stimulating expression of BDNF and synaptic proteins, both in vitro and in vivo.
