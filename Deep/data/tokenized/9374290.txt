The role of calcium-activated proteolysis in hypoxic neuronal injury was investigated using an in vitro slice model of moderate hypoxia that mimics many features of an ischemic penumbra. The calpain inhibitor, MDL28170, significantly improved the recovery of synaptic responses in hippocampal slices following prolonged, moderate hypoxia without hypoxic depolarization. This finding further implicates calpain-mediated proteolysis in the development of neuronal injury following moderate metabolic challenge such as occurs in regions of partial ischemia.
