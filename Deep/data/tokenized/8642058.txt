We have previously shown that, in experimentally inoculated mice, canine distemper virus (CDV), a neurotropic virus, selectively infects certain brain structures (hypothalamus, hippocampus, monoaminergic nuclei, etc). Here we demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 transcripts are selectively expressed in these CDV-targeted structures, except in the dentate gyrus, where cytokines are induced without prior CDV replication. The time-course of TNF-alpha expression vs. viral replication in the hypothalamus was different from that in hippocampus. In addition, we show that a substantial number of neurons express TNF-alpha and IL-6. These findings provide new insights into the possible participation of cytokines in the neurological disorders triggered by CDV infection.
