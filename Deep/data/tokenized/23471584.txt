Among the members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family that affect the growth, differentiation, migration, and survival of many cell types, FGF2 is the most abundant in the central nervous system. Because of its wound healing effects, FGF2 has potential as a therapeutic agent. The protein is also added to the culture media to maintain stem cells. Expression and purification procedures for FGF2 that are highly efficient and low cost have been intensively investigated for the past two decades. Our current study focuses on the purification of FGF2 fused with b'a' domains of human protein disulfide isomerase to elevate overexpression, solubility, and stability with a simplified experimental procedure using only ion exchange chromatography, as well as on the confirmation of the biological activity of FGF2 on fibroblast Balb/c 3T3 cells and hippocampal neural cells.
