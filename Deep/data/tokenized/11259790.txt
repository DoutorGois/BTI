To determine the involvement of the hippocampal regions in a operant-type delayed alternation task of short delay or long delay, microinjections of muscimol into the hippocampus were used for temporal inactivation during the behavioral test in each rat. Dorsal hippocampal inactivation impaired the correct ratio of long delay. Ventral hippocampal inactivation showed no changes in the correct ratio, however, it increased the tendency of perseveration in long delay. These findings suggest hippocampus has regional differentiation in delayed alternation task.
