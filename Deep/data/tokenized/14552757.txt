Seeking neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitors, we designed and synthesized hydrolytically stable analogues of sphingomyelin. These novel analogues replace the phosphodiester moiety of sphingomyelin with carbamate and urea moiety, resulting in inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase. Compound 1 prevented ceramide generation and apoptotic neuronal cell death in a model of ischemia based on organotypic hippocampal slice cultures.
