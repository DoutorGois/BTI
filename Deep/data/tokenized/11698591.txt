Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), its cognate receptor trkC, and voltage-gated calcium channels are coexpressed by embryonic pyramidal neurons before target contact, but their functions at this stage of development are still unclear. We show here that, in vitro, anti-NT-3 and anti-trkC antibodies blocked the increase, and NT-3 reversed the decrease in the number of calbindin-D(28k)-positive pyramidal neurons induced by, respectively, calcium channel activations and blockades. Similar results were obtained with single-neuron microcultures. In addition, voltage-gated calcium channel inhibition downregulates the extracellular levels of NT-3 in high-density cultures. Moreover, electrophysiological experiments in single-cell cultures reveal a tetrodotoxin-sensitive spontaneous electrical activity allowing voltage-gated calcium channel activation. The mouse NT-3 (-/-) mutation decreases by 40% the number of developing calbindin-D(28k)-positive pyramidal neurons, without affecting neuronal survival, both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, present results strongly support that an activity-dependent autocrine NT-3 loop provides a local, intrinsic mechanism by which, before target contact, hippocampal pyramidal-like neurons may regulate their own differentiation, a role that may be important during early CNS differentiation or after adult target disruption.
