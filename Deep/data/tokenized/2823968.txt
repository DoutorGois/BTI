The forebrain distribution of [125I]Bolton-Hunter (BH) neuropeptide Y (NPY) binding sites was compared in 4 mammalian species including rat, hamster, guinea pig and monkey. In all species studied, high densities of [125I]BH NPY binding sites were observed in the hippocampus. In this structure, [125I]BH NPY binding sites were distributed in a laminar fashion, with high densities seen in the oriens layer and stratum radiatum. However, species differences were seen in certain brain areas such as striatum, septum, thalamus and hypothalamus. These differences should be taken into account when studying central effects of neuropeptide Y.
