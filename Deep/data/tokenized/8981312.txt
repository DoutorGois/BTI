Copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) levels in five different brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus, inferior parietal lobule, superior and middle temporal gyri, and cerebellum) were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) in samples from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and age-matched control subjects. A significant decrease in Cu, and significant increases in Zn and Fe were found in AD hippocampus and amygdala, areas showing severe histopathologic alterations in AD. None of these elements were significantly imbalanced in the cerebellum which is minimally affected in AD.
