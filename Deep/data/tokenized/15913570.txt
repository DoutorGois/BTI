We observed chronological changes of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), final mediator of neutrophil transendothelial migration, immunoreactivity, and protein level in the gerbil hippocampus proper after 5 min of transient ischemia. One day after ischemic insult, PECAM-1 immunoreactivity and protein level increased slightly in the hippocampus proper. Thereafter, PECAM-1 immunoreactivity and protein level increased significantly in the hippocampus proper by 4 days after ischemic insult. Especially, PECAM-1 in the hippocampal CA1 region was higher than that in the CA2/3 region. Five days after ischemic insult, PECAM-1 immunoreactivity decreased compared to the 4 days post-ischemic group. However, the RNA levels of PECAM-1 in the hippocampus proper were significantly decreased in the 4 days post-ischemic groups compared to that in the sham-operated group. This result suggests that the increase of PECAM-1 and decrease of PECAM-1 RNA in the CA1 region 4 days after ischemia may be associated with transmigration of neurotrophil.
