OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the marginal division (MrD) of the striatum and other brain regions associated with learning and memory. METHODS: Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path-dentate gyrus, and changes in hippocampal LTP after destruction of the marginal division with kainic acid were observed. RESULTS: High-frequency stimulation of the perforant path produced significant increases in the peak amplitudes of the population spike (PS) in normal rats and those receiving saline treatment. In rats with damaged MrD, the increase in PS and the excitatory postsynaptic potential were less obvious compared with normal or saline-treated rats, indicating that the LTP of the hippocampus was attenuated by damage of the MrD. CONCLUSION: Damage of the MrD impacts the LTP formation in the hippocampus.
