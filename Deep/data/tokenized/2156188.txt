Unilateral lesions of the rat hippocampus produced by needle insertion lead to ipsilateral accumulation of c-fos protein in dentate granule cells and neurons in the piriform cortex, as well as in glial-like cells in the corpus callosum and in ependymal cells lining the lateral ventricle adjacent to the lesion site. C-fos protein was detected immunocytochemically using two different antibodies in formalin-fixed brain sections. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist MK-801 produced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of c-fos protein accumulation in dentate granule cells and in neurons in the piriform cortex, but did not affect glial or ependymal c-fos protein accumulation. MK-801 at 4 mg/kg injected two hours before lesion inhibited c-fos accumulation. Thus, c-fos protein accumulation in hippocampal neurons and in neurons in the piriform cortex induced after traumatic brain injury involves activation of NMDA receptors.
