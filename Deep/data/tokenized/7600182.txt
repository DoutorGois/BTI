The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau species in neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) might result from a relative decrease in their content of protein phosphatases. In this study we have investigated the immunocytochemical distribution of calcineurin (phosphatase 2B) in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of human control subjects and in AD. Calcineurin was strongly expressed in neuronal perikarya and dendrites but only weakly in white matter tracts, both in controls and in AD. The distribution of calcineurin was preserved in AD. By double-immunolabelling with calcineurin antibodies and the AT8 antibody to paired helical filament-tau, it was observed that a strong calcineurin immunoreactivity was still present in many neurons containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Calcineurin was present in dystrophic neurites in some senile plaques (SP) located in the hippocampal formation but more rarely in neocortical areas; this calcineurin immunoreactivity did not always overlap with the tau immunoreactivity in SP. These results suggest that development of NFT in most neurons does not result from a major decrease of calcineurin expression.
