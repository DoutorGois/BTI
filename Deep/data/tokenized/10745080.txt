Intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) changes were measured in cell bodies of cultured rat hippocampal neurones with the fluorescent indicator Fluo-3. In the absence of external Ca(2+), the cholinergic agonist carbachol (200 microM) and the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump inhibitor thapsigargin (0.4 microM) both transiently elevated [Ca(2+)](i). A subsequent addition of Ca(2+) into the bathing medium caused a second [Ca(2+)](i) change which was blocked by lanthanum (50 microM). Taken together, these experiments indicate that stores depletion can activate a capacitative Ca(2+) entry pathway in cultured hippocampal neurones and further demonstrate the existence of such a Ca(2+) entry in excitable cells.
