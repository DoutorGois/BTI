Our previous study has shown that pentobarbital causes memory deficits and impairs hippocampal synaptic plasticity. The Tat-GluA23Y peptide (GluA23Y) prevents activity-dependent alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) endocytosis. It enables early-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) to proceed to late-phase LTP allowing short-term memory to convert to long-term memory. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential effects of GluA23Y on pentobarbital-induced memory deficits through behavioral and electrophysiological paradigms. We found that in vivo intrahippocampal infusion of GluA23Y (100muM, 1mul per hippocampus) 30min prior to pentobarbital administration (8mM, 1mul per hippocampus) significantly rescued the pentobarbital-induced deficit of memory retrieval in rats during the Morris water maze test. Pre-incubation of GluA23Y (10muM) partially rescued bath application of pentobarbital-induced synaptic transmission of the CA3-CA1 pathway in hippocampal slices. More importantly, GluA23Y selectively upregulated the synaptic GluA2 expression that was suppressed by pentobarbital. Together, these results suggest that inhibition of GluA2-containing AMPAR endocytosis by GluA23Y increases the pentobarbital-suppressed basal synaptic transmission by upregulating the synaptic GluA2, and then subsequently alleviates spatial memory deficits. Therefore, inhibition of AMPAR endocytosis may be a potential therapeutic way to treat memory disorders caused by anesthetics.
