To detect neuronal cell bodies whose axon projects to the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus, small volumes (10-50 nl) of 30% horseradish peroxidase or 2% fast blue solutions were pressure-injected into the area of one supraoptic nucleus of rats. Both dorsal and ventral approaches to the nucleus were used. In animals where the injection site extended beyond the limits of the supraoptic nucleus, retrogradely labelled cell bodies were found in many areas of the brain, mainly in the septum, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca and ventral subiculum in the limbic system; the dorsal raphe nucleus, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus of the dorsal tegmentum, the dorsal parabrachial nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the catecholaminergic A1 region in the brain stem; in the subfornical organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, as well as in the median preoptic nucleus. In contrast, when the site of injection was apparently restricted to the supraoptic nucleus, labelling was only clearcut in the two circumventricular organs, the median preoptic nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract and the A1 region. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin coupled with horseradish peroxidase (60-80 nl of a 2.5% solution) made in the septum and in the ventral subiculum anterogradely labelled fibers coursing in an area immediately adjacent to the supraoptic nucleus but not within it. In contrast, labelling within the nucleus was found following anterograde transport of tracer deposited in the A1 region and in an area that includes the nucleus of the solitary tract. Neurones located in the perinuclear area were densely labelled by small injections into the supraoptic nucleus; they may represent a relay station for some afferent inputs to the supraoptic nucleus. These results suggest that the supraoptic nucleus is influenced by the same brain areas which project to its companion within the magnocellular system, the paraventricular nucleus.
