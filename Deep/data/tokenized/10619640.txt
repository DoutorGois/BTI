Adenosine has an anticonvulsant effect in various models of epilepsy. This effect appears to be mediated through the activation of adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs). We immunohistochemically investigated the changes of A1Rs expression in kainate-treated and hippocampus-kindled rats as chronic models of epilepsy. In the normal hippocampus, a predominant expression of A1Rs was detected in the CA2/CA3a field. The A1Rs immunoreactivity in this field began to decline drastically approximately 4 weeks after kainate treatment and remained minimal 8 weeks after treatment. In the hippocampus-kindled animals, A1Rs expression was minimal in the stimulated side but remained high in the nonstimulated side. The reduced expression of A1Rs in the CA2/CA3a field may be related to chronic epileptogenesis.
