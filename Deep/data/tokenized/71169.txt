The EEG method with the assessment of the rhythm power on analogue computers was used to examine the effects of intracentral administration of antibodies to the brain-specific antigen S-100 (S-100 protein). Intracerebral injections of antibodies to S-100 protein caused an increase of the EEG basic rhythm power in the hippocampus, caudate nucleus and the mesenphalic reticular formation, with the subsequent development of epileptiform activity in these structures.
