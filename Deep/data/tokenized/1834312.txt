Striatal dopamine D1 and D2 receptors were investigated in 49 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 33 age-matched controls with [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]spiroperidol as ligands respectively. A full Scatchard analysis giving Bmax and Kd values was performed. In the caudate nucleus, a small but significant decrease in the number of D1 and D2 receptors was seen, whereas in the putamen the number of dopamine receptors was unchanged. Treatment with neuroleptics was found to increase the number of D2 receptors both in the caudate nucleus and putamen. The number of neither D1 nor D2 receptors correlated neither with the duration of disease or levodopa treatment of the patients nor with the post-mortem delay or storage time of the samples. Furthermore, no association was found between either D1 or D2 receptor number and clinical variables of the patients. The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was found to be unchanged in the striatum, whereas a marked decline was seen in the hippocampus and cortical areas, indicating that intrinsic striatal cholinergic neurons are not affected in PD. The present results suggest that there is a modest decline in the number of striatal dopamine D2 receptors in advanced patients with PD at the end stage of the disease.
