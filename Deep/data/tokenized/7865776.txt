From dissected fragments of embryonic H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mouse hippocampal neuroepithelium, we have derived a population of rapidly proliferating, nestin-positive conditionally immortal hippocampal neuroepithelial cells. Treatment with dibutyryl cAMP in non-permissive culture conditions resulted in cessation of cell division and differentiation of the precursor cells into neuronal or glial phenotypes.
