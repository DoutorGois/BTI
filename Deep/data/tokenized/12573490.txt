Hippocampal pyramidal neurons and granule neurons of adult male rats are equipped with a complete machinery for the synthesis of pregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, 17beta-estradiol and testosterone as well as their sulfate esters. These brain neurosteroids are synthesized by cytochrome P450s (P450scc, P45017alpha and P450arom) from endogenous cholesterol. Synthesis is acutely dependent on the Ca(2+) influx attendant upon neuron-neuron communication via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Pregnenolone sulfate, estradiol and corticosterone rapidly modulate neuronal signal transduction and the induction of long-term potentiation via NMDA receptors and putative membrane steroid receptors. Brain neurosteroids are therefore promising neuromodulators that may either activate or inactivate neuron-neuron communication, thereby mediating learning and memory in the hippocampus.
