Neutral carrier-containing Ca2+-selective microelectrodes were used to record the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) in spinal cells in cats and in hippocampal cells of rats (in situ). The mean [Ca2+]i in motoneurons was close to 1 microM. Antidromic or direct stimulation for 30 s at 10 Hz increased [Ca2+]i by a mean of 90 nM. Such a small increase in [Ca2+]i and its slow decay (with a mean half-time of 23 (SD +/- 14.5) s) indicate very effective intracellular sequestration of Ca2+. Orthodromic stimulation consistently evoked smaller increases in [Ca2+]i. A much larger rise of interneuronal [Ca2+]i was evoked by stimulation of dorsal roots: by contrast intra-axonal recording (in motor or sensory fibres) failed to reveal any increase in [Ca2+]i in response to stimulation at 100 Hz. In the hippocampus, presumably because of poorer recording conditions, resting values of [Ca2+]i were higher (mean 8.5 microM). Repetitive stimulation of the fimbria--commissure at 5-20 Hz for 30 Hz, had variable effects on [Ca2+]i. Very large increases (to greater than 200 microM) were elicited repeatedly in some cells, either near the end of the tetanic stimulation or after a 20-30 s delay. Such major increases, which were associated with population cell discharges in bursts, may be related to long-term changes in hippocampal neuronal properties that are evoked by tetanic stimulation. Both in the spinal cord and the hippocampus, probable intraglial recordings showed relatively high mean levels of [Ca2+]i (about 30 microM).
