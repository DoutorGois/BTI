We observed sharp wave/ripples (SWR) during exploration within brief (<2.4 s) interruptions of or during theta oscillations. CA1 network responses of SWRs occurring during exploration (eSWR) and SWRs detected in waking immobility or sleep were similar. However, neuronal activity during eSWR was location dependent, and eSWR-related firing was stronger inside the place field than outside. The eSPW-related firing increase was stronger than the baseline increase inside compared to outside, suggesting a "supralinear" summation of eSWR and place-selective inputs. Pairs of cells with similar place fields and/or correlated firing during exploration showed stronger coactivation during eSWRs and subsequent sleep-SWRs. Sequential activation of place cells was not required for the reactivation of waking co-firing patterns; cell pairs with symmetrical cross-correlations still showed reactivated waking co-firing patterns during sleep-SWRs. We suggest that place-selective firing during eSWRs facilitates initial associations between cells with similar place fields that enable place-related ensemble patterns to recur during subsequent sleep-SWRs.
