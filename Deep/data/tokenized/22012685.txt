The hippocampus and the striatum have traditionally been considered as part of different and independent memory systems. However, there is evidence that supports a functional interaction between the hippocampus and the dorsal striatum at least in particular learning tasks. Here, we evaluated the functional contribution of both brain regions in a visual discrimination learning task using cytochrome c oxidase (CO) quantitative histochemistry. Compared with other brain metabolic mapping techniques, CO activity reflects steady-state neuronal energy demand. Rats were trained for 6 days in a water T-maze to find a hidden escape platform associated with an intramaze visual cue. A control group of animals swam for an equivalent amount of time compared as the trained group but without any escape platform available. After finishing the behavioral task, CO activity was measured in subdivisions of the dorsal hippocampus and the dorsal striatum in both groups. Results show significantly higher CO activity in the CA1 area and the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus in the trained rats compared with the control group. In addition, a significant negative functional cross-correlation between area CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus and the anterodorsal striatum was found. Our results support current theories on competitive interaction of different memory systems during visual discrimination learning.
