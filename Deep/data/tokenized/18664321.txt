AIM: Deoxyschisandrin is one of the most effective composites of Schisandra chinensis, a famous Chinese medicine widely used as an antistress, anti-aging, and neurological performance-improving herb. In this study, we examined its specific mechanisms of action on cultured hippocampal neurons. METHODS: Hippocampal neurons, primarily cultured for 9-11 d in vitro, were used for this study. DS were dissolved in DMSO and applied to calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamp. RESULTS: The application of 3 mg/L DS decreased the frequency of spontaneous and synchronous oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ to 72%+/-2% (mean+/-SEM), and the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents to 60%+/-3% (mean+/-SEM). The inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) for the effect of DS on calcium oscillations was 3.8 mg/L. DS also depressed the high voltage-gated Ca2+ channel and the voltage-gated Na+ channel currents at the same time point. It had no effect, however, on voltage-gated K+ and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. CONCLUSION: DS inhibited the spontaneous and synchronous oscillations of intracellular Ca2+ through the depression of influx of extracellular calcium and the initiation of action potential. By repressing the spontaneous neurotransmitter release, DS modulated the neuronal network activities.
