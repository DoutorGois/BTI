Zinc is one of the trace elements playing an important role in many fundamental biological processes. However, it is also one of the possible etiological agents involved in nerve cell damage in certain human neurodegenerative disorders. The precise mechanism of neuroprotective ability of Zn against neurotoxicity evidenced in various pathological conditions remains unclear, especially concerning the intrinsic potential toxicity of this metal. This ultrastructural study was undertaken to determine the effect of zinc on the evolution of anoxia-induced neuronal injury in the organotypic cultures of rat hippocampus. The in vitro model of oxygen deprivation was produced by maintaining the cultures in a pure nitrogen atmosphere in flask adapted for permanent gas flow for 20 min. The selected cultures were pretreated with micromolar concentration of ZnCl2 (25-500 microM) at 30 min prior anoxia. The ultrastructural findings documented that Zn exhibited dose-dependent ability to reduce anoxia-induced neuronal changes in hippocampal neurons in vitro. Zn at a concentration of 100 microM was able to significantly protect the hippocampal formation against the development of late apoptotic changes, whereas the early necrotic anoxia-induced neuronal injury was not so efficiently reduced.
