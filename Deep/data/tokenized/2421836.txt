Levels of serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DHPG) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in different brain areas of scrapie-infected rats, 8.5 months after intracerebral inoculation of a rat-adapted strain from mice brain (C 506). At this time, rats developed early clinical signs of the disease. Scrapie-infected rats showed a reduction in the levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA (frontal cortex, hippocampus, mesolimbic structure). Concentrations of DHPG decreased in the frontal and parietal cortices but remained unchanged in the hippocampus. DOPAC levels decreased in the striatum but not in the mesolimbic structure. These results confirm that the serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems are altered in the brain of scrapie-infected rats. They can partly account for clinical signs of scrapie and are in agreement with the scarce data provided by the postmortem analysis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease brains.
