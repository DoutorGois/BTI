Afferent connections of the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex of the rat arising from the hippocampal formation were investigated using iontophoretic application of the fluorescent tracer, Fluoro-gold. Our results demonstrate that the projection which originates in the temporal part of the CA1 hippocampal field and in the prosubiculum is restricted to the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex.
