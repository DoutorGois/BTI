Spatial distribution of theta activity was investigated in the dorsal hippocampal formation and overlying neocortex of the urethane-anesthetized rat. Laminar phase profiles from semi-microelectrode penetartions showed approximately 180 degrees phase shifts combined with small amplitude values in stratum radiatum of CA1, instratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus and in layer V/VI of the cingulate cortex at theta peak frequency. Evidence has been presented that layers of neurons in CA1, in the dorsal granular layer and in the cingulate cortex are the sources of dipole-like theta field potentials. A strong linear relationship between the neuronal theta sources in hippocampal CA1, dentate area and cingulate cortex was found.
