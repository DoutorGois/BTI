In an attempt to understand the neurochemical basis of kindling, this study investigated the effects on brain cholecystokinin (CCK) of amygdaloid kindled and non-kindled seizures. Thirteen brain regions were examined in rats sacrificed either 24 hr or 3 weeks after the last kindled seizure, or 24 hr after a suprathreshold stimulation-induced (non-kindled) seizure; and in sham kindled rats. There were no significant differences in CCK immunoreactivity between any of these groups. These results do not confirm a previous report of an increase in CCK in the hippocampus following amygdaloid kindling in the rat.
