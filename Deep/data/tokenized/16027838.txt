Experimental epilepsy induced in rats by infusion of kainic acid into the lateral cerebral ventricles decreased the number of NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons in the hippocampal formation by 55-79% and increased activity of this enzyme in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. All parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells were highly resistant to the cytotoxic effects of kainate in contrast to calbindin- and calretinin-positive interneurons, whose amount decreased by 50%.
