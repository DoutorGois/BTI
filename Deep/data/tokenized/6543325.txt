Daily administration of lidocaine results in progressive increases in frequency and duration of convulsions in response to a dose of drug which was previously subconvulsive--a pharmacological kindling phenomenon. The effects of such lidocaine-kindling on local cerebral glucose utilization were determined by the 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method. Lidocaine-treated animals, in the absence of convulsions, exhibited decreased glucose utilization in most brain structures compared to saline-treated animals and showed no increase in aggressive behavior. In animals displaying lidocaine-kindled convulsions there were marked increases in glucose utilization in either the hippocampus and amygdala or in perirhinal cortical areas during the seizure administration; these animals also displayed long-lasting increases in irritable behavior. Seizure duration was positively correlated with the rate of glucose utilization in the hippocampus, amygdala and septum, but inversely correlated in several non-limbic areas. These data suggest that lidocaine-kindled seizures are highly localized to limbic and perirhinal structures and are associated with important behavioral consequences.
