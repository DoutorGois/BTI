Three-dimensional (3D) fast spin-echo (FSE) imaging can produce contiguous thin sections for high-quality multiplanar reconstructions. Such reformatted images may be useful in the evaluation of three-dimensionally complex, curvilinear anatomic structures such as the hippocampus. The authors describe a 3D FSE protocol for T2-weighted imaging of the hippocampus. The protocol uses an overlapping-multiple-slab imaging strategy to decrease imaging times and a modified refocusing radio-frequency pulse train to improve the reformatted images. The authors describe their parameter optimization, discuss the benefits and limitations of the new sequence, and present representative images of healthy volunteers.
