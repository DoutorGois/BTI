Rats given large dopamine-depleting brain lesions as adults exhibit severe impairments in ingestive behavior and sensorimotor function. In contrast to these well-known effects, virtually complete destruction of central dopaminergic neurons produced no such dysfunctions when it occurred in neonates. Indeed, rats continued to suckle and grow, albeit somewhat more slowly, and they could be weaned readily when they were 27 days old. Although most brain-damaged animals did not survive weaning when they were 18 days old, whereas controls exhibited no difficulty, this failure appears to be the consequence of their reduced body weight and related inability to maintain body temperature in a relatively cool environment (22 degrees C). Such premature weaning occurred more successfully when growth was stimulated by rearing brain-damaged pups in small litters or when ambient temperatures were raised to 31 degrees C so as to minimize heat loss. These results demonstrate that the effects of near-total dopamine-depleting brain lesions are considerably less severe when they occur in infants than when they occur in adults, and, consequently, they reveal a capacity for neural plasticity during development that is no longer present at maturity.
