The systemic injection of oxytocin (OXT) decreases the self-administration of heroin in heroin-tolerant rats. Since OXT-ergic binding sites are present in limbic and mesolimbic brain regions, the effects of intracerebral microinjections of OXT were investigated. In heroin-tolerant rats, the microinjection of OXT (2 ng) into the anterodorsal part of the nucleus accumbens or into the ventral hippocampus disrupted the self-administration of heroin. The effect of intrahippocampal microinjections lasted longer than that of intraaccumbens injections. The administration of N alpha-acetyl-(2-0-methyltyrosine)-oxytocin (ACME-OXT), an inhibitor of oxytocin receptors, prevented the disruptive effect of intrahippocampal OXT injections on heroin self-administration. It is concluded that limbic-mesolimbic brain structures have an essential role in the expression of the disruptive action of OXT on heroin self-administration. It appears that OXT-ergic binding sites mediate the effects of OXT.
