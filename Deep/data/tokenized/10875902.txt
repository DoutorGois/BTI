Functional neuroimaging of the hippocampal formation has presented a challenge to neuroscientists because of the small size of the hippocampus proper and its location at the basal level of the brain. Choosing the appropriate control condition for subtraction-based studies has also proved difficult. Event-related experimental designs are a powerful tool in behavioral and electrophysiological studies. Recently, such experimental designs have been applied to functional MR imaging studies but these studies used large intertrial intervals in order to separate the slow blood flow response from temporally adjacent events, severely limiting the number of events that can be presented in a single run. This leads to poor statistical power and restrictions on the design of the experimental paradigm. We present data obtained using a rapidly presented, randomized event-related paradigm, combined with a novel fMRI imaging method designed to improve imaging in basal brain regions. The results demonstrate bilateral activation in the hippocampal formation in identification of novel complex scenes distinct from a learned basis set of complex scenes. Differential activation is obtained in the counter task of identifying a learned target complex scene against a background of novel scenes. The results are also compared with the more conventional block design complex scene paradigms previously reported by others. The block design provides strong posterior activation, likely related more to visual scene processing, whereas the event-related design provides more anterior hippocampal activation with the encoding of novel scenes.
