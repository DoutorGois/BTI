The effects of some anticonvulsant drugs have been investigated on gamma-hydroxybutyrate release from rat hippocampal and striatal slices. Sodium valproate and ethosuximide inhibited the depolarization-evoked release of gamma-hydroxybutyrate induced by 40 mM K+. The IC50 values for these two drugs are in the concentration range of valproate and ethosuximide that exists in rat brain after administration of anticonvulsant doses to the animals. Trimethadione and pentobarbital are without significant effects. It can be concluded that the inhibition of gamma-hydroxybutyrate release, particularly that observed for hippocampus, might explain the protective effect of valproate and ethosuximide on gamma-hydroxybutyrate-induced seizures and perhaps on other kinds of epileptoid phenomenon.
