Seizures are complex phenomena spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales, from ion dynamics to communication between brain regions, from milliseconds (spikes) to days (interseizure intervals). Because of the existence of such multiple scales, the experimental evaluation of the mechanisms underlying the initiation, propagation, and termination of epileptic seizures is a difficult problem. Theoretical models and numerical simulations provide new tools to investigate seizure mechanisms at multiple scales. In this chapter, we review different theoretical approaches and their contributions to our understanding of seizure mechanisms.
