The changes in the frequency content of electrograms of the optic cortical area and deep structures of the brain (putamen, dorsal hippocampus, medial part of the hypothalamus) were studied during intraventricular introduction of various doses of GABA-receptor agonists (GABA, muscimol, baclofen) and antagonist (bicuculline). The latter was found to affect the overall electrical activity slightly regardless of the dose. When muscimol and baclofen were injected, the greatest EG effect was observed at 1.10(-9) mole. A dose-dependent reversion of EG effects was revealed for GABA and muscimol; at the alpha-range 1.10(-6) mole, of GABA was found to weaken rhythmic activity, while 1.10(-8) mole of muscimol increased and 1.10(-9) mole decreased the power of alpha-rhythm. The correlation analysis of EG changes suggests that there is one interdependent mechanism or more for formation of EG of the range studied which operate by the starting mechanism.
