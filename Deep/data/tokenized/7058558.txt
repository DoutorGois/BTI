Electrophoresis separation of membrane acetylcholinesterase in 5% PAAG resulted in five forms of the enzyme differing by electrophoretic mobility and velocity of ACh hydrolysis. The activity of isoforms (I, II) was decreased by 40 and 76, respectively, 4 days after deafferentiation of septo-hippocampal pathways. Changes in the activity were still greater 7 days after deafferentiation as compared with those mentioned above.
