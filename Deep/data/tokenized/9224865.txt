Our recent studies showed the co-existence of substance P and calretinin in the supramammillo-hippocampal pathway of monkeys, as well as species differences in the synaptic targets of extrinsic substance P fibers in the hippocampi of monkeys and rats. Experiments used: (1) single and multiple stereotaxic injection of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated HRP into the hippocampus and immunostaining for substance P in the supramammillary area; (2) colocalization of substance P and calretinin in supramammillary area cells; and (3) colocalization of these two neurochemicals in retrogradely labeled supramammillary projective cells of both male and female rats. These demonstrated: (a) many calretinin- and fewer substance P-immunoreactive neurons retrogradely labeled in the ipsilateral supramammillary area; (b) approximately 74% of all substance P cells contain calretinin and 9% of the calretinin neurons co-contain substance P; and, most importantly (c) none of the retrogradely labeled supramammillary cells colocalize calretinin and substance P. These results indicate the presence of two distinct supramammillo-hippocampal projections in the rat, one that contains substance P and the other calretinin. The latter innervates the same areas as those in the monkey, and the former terminates only in the CA2 hippocampal subfield.
