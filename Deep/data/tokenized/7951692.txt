Previous experiments have described highly specific effects of noradrenergic agonists on synaptic transmission in the dentate gyrus (DG). For example, perfusion of hippocampal slices with the beta-noradrenergic agonist isoproterenol induces a long-lasting potentiation (LLP) of extracellularly recorded responses following stimulation of the medial perforant path (PP), and long-lasting depression (LLD) of responses evoked by stimulation of the lateral PP (Dahl D, Sarvey JM, 1989, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 86:4776-4780). To examine the possible interactions of LLP, LLD, and long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation (LTP), the authors recorded extracellular field potentials evoked in the DG by stimulation of the lateral or medial perforant path following LTP and LLP or LLD, invoked in different orders. After establishment of LLP or LLD by bath application of isoproterenol, subsequent tetanization of the respective afferents resulted in additional potentiation of the medial PP-evoked response and return of the lateral PP-evoked response to baseline levels. In other slices, application of isoproterenol after establishment of LTP resulted in further potentiation of medial PP-evoked responses but no change in the potentiated response evoked by lateral PP stimulation. Thus the pathway specificity was maintained irrespective of the history of previous potentiation or depression. Experiments using the specific beta 1 antagonist metoprolol further confirmed pathway specificity. Perfusion with 20 microM of metoprolol appeared to reduce LTP evoked by stimulation of the medial but not lateral PP. In a subsequent experiment, metoprolol in the absence of tetanization produced LLD of the medial PP-evoked response and LLP of the lateral PP-evoked response, opposite to the effects of ISO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
