Inhalation or intraperitoneal administration of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE) increased the cAMP content in the brain stem in a dose-related and time-dependent fashion. TCE had no effect on the cAMP level in the cerebellum and hippocampus, but slightly reduced that in the cerebral cortex. Following intraperitoneal administration of TCE the activity of norepinephrine- and F- -activated adenylate cyclase (AC) in a brain stem homogenate was enhanced, while the serotonin-stimulated AC activity was decreased. Neither the basal AC activity nor the guanine nucleotide- and forskolin-activated enzyme was affected by TCE. TCE had no effect on the soluble cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase activity. It is suggested that the increased cAMP content in the brain stem induced by TCE may be mediated via adrenoreceptor interaction with the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component, resulting in activation of the catalytic unit of the adenylate cyclase and thereby an increase in the cAMP level.
