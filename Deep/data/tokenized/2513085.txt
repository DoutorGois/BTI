Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were measured in the caudate-putamen (CPu), the hippocampus (HIP), and the brainstem (BS) of the brains of control animals and of rats treated with one intracerebroventricular infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Injection of 6-OHDA resulted in significant decreases in the activity of SOD in the CPu, the BS, and in the HIP. There were decreases in catalase in the CPu and in the BS, but not in the HIP. GSH was reduced in the CPu and the BS but not changed in the HIP. There were small decreases in the activity of GSH-Px only in the BS. These changes may be secondary to the production of free radicals after the infusion of 6-OHDA in rat brain.
