Neuronal activity of the hippocampus and the caudal neostriatum was studied in chronic experiments on hens (Gallus domesticus) under the action of conditioned acoustic stimuli of different ecological significance. Units which selectively respond to ecologically adequate stimuli were found in the above structures. An active enhancement of filtrating properties of neuronal nets was revealed in the hippocampus; as a result the hippocampal units predominantly pick out the specific information present in the ecologically adequate stimuli.
