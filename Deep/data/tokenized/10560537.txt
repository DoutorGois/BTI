Male Sprague-Dawley rats administered xylene intraperitoneally on alternate days at a dose of 125 or 250 mg/kg for 30 days exhibited no marked changes in locomotor activity, learning and memory capacity. However in rats given xylene on alternate day at a dose of 500 mg/kg for 30 days, a significant decrease in locomotor activity, deficits in learning ability and memory loss were detected. These xylene-induced behavioral changes were associated with a decrease in beta-endorphin and leuenkaphlin concentrations in the pons-medulla. On the contrary, xylene at a dose of 500 mg/kg increased the beta-endorphin level in caudate and c-fos expression in hippocampus. These data suggest that the xylene-induced behavioral alterations might be associated with the expression of Fos protein in the hippocampus.
