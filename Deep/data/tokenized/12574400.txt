Several thousand new neurons are produced each day in the adult mammalian hippocampus, among which only excitatory granule cells (GCs) have thus far been identified. In the present study, we used mutant Semliki Forest Virus vectors to express enhanced green fluorescent protein in the hippocampus, and observed that approximately 14% of newly generated neurons in the dentate gyrus of adult rats are GABAergic basket cells (BCs). With the use of double whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from BC-GC pairs in hippocampal slices, we demonstrate that newly generated BCs in the dentate gyrus form inhibitory synapses with principal GCs. These data show for the first time that functional inhibitory neurons are recruited in the dentate gyrus of adult rats.
