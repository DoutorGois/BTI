Accumulation of c-Fos and Arc proteins in neurons in different regions of the hippocampus after single trial of contextual fear conditioning was studied by using immunohistochemical staining. We found that the dynamics of the c-Fos and Arc expression has a biphasic pattern: the first peak was observed in 15-30 min after learning and the second less pronounced peak in 1-3 h. Induction of Arc occurred earlier than c-Fos and the overall dynamics of the two waves slightly varied in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal CA1 and CA3 fields. The findings open the possibility of mapping the cognitive neural networks of the brain with higher temporal resolution and draw attention to fluctuations of hippocampal activity after a single brief episode of new experience.
