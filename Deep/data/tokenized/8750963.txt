Changes induced by chronic monoarthritis in the nervous system was studied by measuring concentrations of substance P (SP)-, neurokinin A (NKA)-, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)- and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-like immunoreactivities in the brain and in the knee joints of control and monoarthritic normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats on day 21 after the induction of monoarthritis. Knee joint monoarthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of Freund's adjuvant into the right knee joint. The severity of arthritis was examined by measuring knee volumes and scratching behaviour and by X-ray. The right knee of both WKY and SHR monoarthritic rats had an increased volume and osteoporosis. SHR rats had more severe arthritis and increased scratching behaviour compared to the WKY. Tachykinins were significantly decreased in the hypothalamus of arthritic rats. In the pituitary higher concentrations of tachykinins and CGRP were found in the arthritic and/or control SHR rats than in the WKY. In the occipital cortex, striatum and hippocampus NPY was increased in monoarthritic rats. No correlation was found between neuropeptide concentrations in the brain and knee joints. Decrease of tachykinins and increase of CGRP to different degree in the hypothalamus and/or pituitary of the arthritic WKY and SHR rats indicates that these changes were selectively associated with the basal level of sympathetic tone and possibly related to the greater severity seen in SHR rats. The increase of NPY in the brain, not influenced by sympathetic tone, may be part of a general defence reaction to inflammation.
