Glucose, adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, and lactate levels in the cortex, striatum, diencephalon, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem were measured in cats 1 hour after they were subjected to low-level (2 atm) fluid-percussion injury. Following injury, there was a mild but significant increase in lactate levels in the majority of regions studied. The hippocampus exhibited the highest percentage increase in lactate (fourfold). The cortical area directly under the trauma device showed a threefold lactate increase, while there was a twofold increase in other brain regions studied. Although there were consistent decreases in phosphocreatine levels, these decreases were significant only in the hippocampus (p less than 0.05). Glucose levels in all brain regions studied were no different from control levels at the time of study. The unchanged glucose levels, together with previous studies of identically injured cats showing that cerebral blood flow was unimpaired, suggest that excess lactate was not a consequence of cerebral ischemia. Rather, the increase in lactate levels may indicate that concussive injury can produce a mild derangement of brain energy metabolism in the absence of substrate limitations. This derangement may reflect altered mitochondrial function.
