Concentration of neuraminidase (NEU), an enzyme which cleaves negatively charged sialic acids from carbohydrate moieties of the cellular membrane, could vary depending on physiological conditions. Multiple evidences suggest that fluctuations of NEU extracellular concentrations can influence neuronal activity. In the present study we examined the effect of down regulation of endogenous NEU activity on seizure-like activity (SLA) induced by gabazine (specific blocker of inhibitory synaptic transmission) in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal region of cultured slices. We show that in slices pretreated with the blocker of endogenous NEU, N-acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid (NADNA), duration of synchronous oscillations induced by gabazine was considerably increased comparatively to control untreated slices. This study adds further information that changes in the level of NEU activity is an important factor, which can affect neuronal network excitability.
