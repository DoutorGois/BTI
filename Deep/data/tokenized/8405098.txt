DM-9384 (nefiracetam) (N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)acetamide), a pyrrolidone derivative (or a cyclic derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)), is a newly developed nootropic (or cognition-enhancing) agent. In the present study, we examined the biochemical effect of DM-9384 on GABAergic neurons in adult rat brains. DM-9384, when administered orally at a daily dose of 10 mg/kg for 7 days, significantly increased GABA turnover and glutamic acid decarboxylase activity in the cortex and hippocampus, and stimulated Na(+)-dependent high-affinity GABA uptake in cortical synaptosomes. In in vitro experiments, the K(+)-evoked release of [14C]GABA from cortical slices was markedly increased by low concentrations (10(-8), 10(-9) M) of DM-9384. The binding of GABAA and benzodiazepine to their receptors in the brain was not affected by DM-9384 (10(-10)-10(-3) M). The results suggest that DM-9384 increases the turnover of components of the GABAergic system by influencing presynaptic sites rather than postsynaptic sites.
