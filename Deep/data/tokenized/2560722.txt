In unrestrained rats, frequency ranges of dorsal hippocampus electrograms were studied after intraventricular injections of the GABA, muscimol, baclofen, bicuculline and picrotoxin. The data obtained corroborates the idea of an interrelationship between the agonists and antagonists of the GABA receptors. A possibility of participation of these receptors in the formation and/or modulation of total electrical hippocampal activity, is discussed.
