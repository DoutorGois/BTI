Using ventilated rats maintained on N2O-O2 (70:30, vol/vol) we induced continuous seizures with i.v. bicuculline and analysed free fatty acids (FFA) in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum after seizures durations of 1-120 min. In the cerebral cortex, peak FFA concentrations were observed after 5 min, with a threefold increase in total FFA content. The values then remained unchanged for the next 15-20 min, but decreased thereafter. At 60 and 120 min, total FFA contents were only moderately increased above control. In the initial period, arachidonic acid increased about 10-fold and stearic acid 2- to 3-fold, with little change in palmitic acid and linoleic acid concentrations. At all times, the docosahexenoic acid concentration was markedly increased. Following its massive accumulation at 1 min, arachidonic acid gradually decreased in concentration. Pretreatment of animals with indomethacin did not alter this behaviour. After 20 and 120 min of seizure activity, changes in total and individual FFA concentrations in the hippocampus were similar to those observed in the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum behaved differently. Thus, at 20 min the only significant change was a 5- to 10-fold increase in arachidonic acid concentration and, after 120 min, total and individual FFA concentrations were similar to control values. Furthermore, since the control values for arachidonic acid were much lower in the cerebellum, the 20-min values were only about 20% of those observed in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus.
