In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the effects of transient global ischemia on pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) immunoreactivity in gerbil brain regions. PACAP immunoreactivity had significantly decreased in the pyramidal cells of CA1 subfield susceptible to ischemic insult at 1-4 days after transient global ischemia. On the contrary, PACAP immunoreactivity had not changed in the pyramidal cell bodies of more resistant CA3 subfield after ischemic injury. In the Purkinje cell layer, PACAP immunoreactivity had significantly decreased 1 day following transient ischemia, and had increased 2 days after ischemia. The first demonstration of the postischemic localizations of PACAP should allow us to gain a more fundamental rationale for developing methods of treating ischemic brain damage with neuroprotective peptides such as PACAP.
