Besides intrinsic determinants of cell growth, epigenetic signals have been proposed to regulate development and maintenance of neurons. Here we provide evidence that cerebral astrocytes contribute significantly to the set of environmental influences that are required for long-term survival of neurons derived from the mammalian central nervous system. Cerebral astrocytes in serum-free culture express diffusible and non-diffusible neuron-supporting signals, including cell-adhesive neurite growth-promoting glycoproteins, diffusible neurotrophic factors as well as membrane-bound molecules that mediate cell contact interactions. The combination and synergistic interaction of these environmental signals markedly enhance the survival of brain neurons. While astroglia-derived cell-adhesive substrates that include a high molecular weight complex consisting of laminin beta-chains and proteoglycan (Matthiessen et al., 1989) stimulate neurite outgrowth, they fail to enhance long-term neuronal survival when additional neurotrophic and cell-contact interactions are lacking. Astrocytes release a diffusible neurotrophic activity that, when permanently applied, maintains long-term survival of central neurons in culture. The soluble neurotrophic activity seems to interact synergistically with cell-bound signals which are also required for long-term survival and which are expressed by astrocytes and neurons, but not by fibroblasts. Among neurons from different brain areas, such as hippocampus, cerebral cortex and septum, regional differences in their responsiveness to the astroglial neurotrophic activity have been observed.
