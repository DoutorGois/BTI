We evaluated the influence of an acute hypoxic-ischemic insult on the neuronal dendritic cytoskeletal protein microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the immature rat brain. Studies were performed using a well-characterized perinatal rodent stroke model, in which unilateral ischemic forebrain injury was induced in 7-day-old rats by right carotid artery ligation, followed by 3 h exposure to 8% oxygen. Changes in the neuroanatomic distribution of MAP2 in the first 48 h after injury were evaluated by immunocytochemistry with a monoclonal mouse anti-MAP2 antibody. The distribution of MAP2 immunoreactivity was markedly disrupted in the lesioned hippocampus; prominent reductions in MAP2 immunostaining evolved concurrently in lesioned cortex, caudate and thalamus. These data demonstrate that at this developmental stage, MAP2 immunocytochemistry provides a sensitive indicator of the distribution and severity of hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury.
