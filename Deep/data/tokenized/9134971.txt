Effects of a protease inhibitor, leupeptin, on the memory function and the morphological changes in the hippocampus were examined in rats. The leupeptin was infused by an implanted-osmotic minipump into the lateral ventricle of the rats for 14 days. The acquisition and the maintenance of memory were evaluated by a step-down passive avoidance task. The control rats, infused with an artificial cerebral spinal fluid, showed good retention for the passive avoidance training for 21 days after training. The leupeptin-treated rats showed good retention for 7 days following training; however, pronounced impaired retention was observed on day 10 and thereafter. These rats were accompanied by a degeneration of the dentate gyrus in the histological examinations on Days 14 and 21. The granule cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus appeared much more eosinophilic pyknotic. Numerous eosinophilic spherical structures of the cell processes were seen in the neuropil beneath the granule cell layer. Electron microscopic examination disclosed a marked accumulation of lipofuscin-like granules in the perikaryon of the cells and in the dendrites and the axons. These findings suggest that the memory impairment is closely related to the degeneration of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus in the leupeptin-treated rats.
