Microinjections of monoamines and amino acids into rat ventral hippocampus showed functional relevance of GABA- or dopamine- and 5-HT-ergic mechanisms of this structure of brain formed by aversive actions of diverse biological importance rather than glutamate-ergic ones. The participation of hippocampus monoamine- and acidergic mechanisms in the origin of diverse aversive anxiety is discussed.
