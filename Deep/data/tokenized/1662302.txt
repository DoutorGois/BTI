We investigated the iron-induced epileptic rats with special reference to c-fos immunohistochemistry and iron histochemistry in order to elucidate the pathogenesis of post-traumatic epilepsy. The c-fos-immunopositive neurons were observed in a hippocampal formation, especially in the dentate gyrus and CA1 and CA2, in the vicinity of the iron injected cerebral cortex and amygdala only at 3 hours after the iron administration. Three days later after administration, several heavily positively iron staining cells and nerve fibers were observed around the injection site. In the cases of 3 weeks after administration, the large cavity and gliosis were characteristically observed.
