Lesions were examined at different levels of the central nervous system (CNS) in 64 sheep with natural maedi-visna (MV) meningoencephalitis. All animals showed lesions in more than one of the CNS locations examined; the lesions in the cranial regions were periventricular, while those in the spinal cord affected the white matter funicles. Lesions were found particularly in the cerebellar peduncles (non-suppurative meningoencephalitis), followed by the corpus callosum, hippocampus and thoracic spinal cord. Vascular, infiltrative and malacic histopathological patterns were recognized. One pattern predominated in each section examined, although mixed forms occurred. Vascular lesions occurred with similar frequency at all CNS levels, but infiltrative and malacic lesions predominated at rostral and caudal levels, respectively. Cells consistent with macrophages and shown immunohistochemically to be associated with MV virus were seen in malacic and infiltrative lesions, at the periphery of damaged areas.
