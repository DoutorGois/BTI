Electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampus 5 times daily produced significant seizure activity (stage 4), but further stimulations seldom produced full motor seizures (stage 5). Blockade of these seizures with amino acid antagonists, phosphonocarboxylic acids, was achieved but with a reverse order of potency to that seen with the kindled amygdala. Thus APB was the most potent and APH the least potent analog tested. These results indicate that the kindling of different limbic brain areas may involve different neuronal substrates even if the development of the seizure activities are similar.
