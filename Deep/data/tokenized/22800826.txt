BACKGROUND: Baicalin has a significant anti-inflammation effect and is widely used in the clinical treatment of stroke. Most of the studies of Toll-like receptor 2/4 (TLR2/4) during cerebral ischemia had defined their specific expressions in microglia in hippocampus tissue. To explore the targets of baicalin in stroke, we detected the expressions of TLR2/4 in vitro/vivo. METHODS: By constructing a cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model in vivo and glucose oxygen deprivation model, we successfully induced neuron damage, then added baicalin and detected expressions of TLR2/4, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in mRNA level and protein level. RESULTS: We found distinct upregulations of TLR2/4 and TNFalpha in both mRNA level and protein level in PC12 cells and primary neurons. Moreover, TLR2/4 and TNFalpha expressions were significantly higher in mice hippocampus treated with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Baicalin could downregulate the expressions of TLR2/4 and TNFalpha in the damaged cells and mice hippocampus effectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neurons could respond to the damage and activate the related signal pathway directly. TLR2/4 responsed to the damage and sent the signal to downstream factor TNFalpha through activating NF-kB. Baicalin could inhibit the inflammatory reaction in neuron damage and TLR might be its targets, which explained why baicalin could widely be used in the clinical treatment of stroke.
