The effects of Wnt signaling on neural progenitor cells have been controversial. Activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway either promotes neural progenitor cell proliferation or accelerates their differentiation into postmitotic neurons. This study demonstrates that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by itself induces neural progenitor cell proliferation but does not directly affect neuronal differentiation processes. To investigate whether Wnt signaling promotes expansion and/or differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the developing hippocampus, we prepared primary mouse hippocampal progenitors and treated them with Wnt3a in a chemically defined culture medium. Wnt3a increased the total number of cells, including the numbers of Ki67(+) proliferating cells and Tuj1(+) differentiated neurons. This result verified that Wnt3a promoted neural progenitor cell proliferation. Meanwhile, Wnt3a did not appear to actively enhance the neuronal differentiation process itself, because (1) the ratio of Tuj1(+) cells to the total cells, and (2) the ratio of BrdU(+) Tuj1(+) cells to the total BrdU(+) cells, were both comparable between cultures with or without Wnt3a. Indeed, Wnt3a caused no significant change in either cell survival or the proportion of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions that directly affected neuron production. We finally demonstrated that the Wnt3a treatment simply shortened cell cycle duration of neural progenitor cells by 2.9 h. The accelerated cell cycle progression without affecting the ratio of symmetric/asymmetric cell divisions explains how Wnt signaling per se leads to the expansion of both proliferative cell population and differentiated neuronal cell population.
