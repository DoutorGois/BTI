OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluated the nociceptive response induced by dentin hypersensitivity after dental erosion in rats that were exhibited to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)-induced depressive-like behavior. DESIGN: Adult male rats were subjected to UCMS (depression [D] group) or not (no depression [ND] group) for 30days and received either acidic solution to induce dental erosion (E) or water (W), thus forming the WND, END, WD, and ED groups. After the end of treatment, depressive-like parameters (i.e., sucrose preference and immobility in the forced swim test) and dentin hypersensitivity were evaluated. Plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and corticosterone levels were measured, and astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was evaluated in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and hypothalamus. RESULTS: Administration of the acidic solution potentiated dentin hypersensitivity and increased corticosterone levels in the ED group compared with the WD group. TNF-alpha levels only increased in the WD group. The ED group exhibited an increase in astrocytic GFAP expression in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex but decreases in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that UCMS exacerbated the nociceptive response associated with dentin hypersensitivity, concomitant with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels. Hypothalamic and prefrontal cortex astrogliosis in the ED group may be attributable to the increase in corticosterone associated to UCMS procedure. The reduction of astrocytic GFAP expression in the hippocampus in the ED group supports the association between dentin hypersensitivity and depression.
