Imbalance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission has been recently hypothesized to trigger memory decline related either to ageing or to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thereby, benzodiazepine-induced anterograde amnesia has been construed as a model of hippocampal-related cognitive dysfunctions. Since spatial memory is altered both by ageing and by benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, we investigated the pharmacological sensitivity of alprazolam-induced deficit in a delayed spatial discrimination (SD) task, notably with positive allosteric modulators of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors. We showed that alprazolam (0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) induced memory impairments as compared with vehicle-treated mice. The oral administration of modulators of AMPA receptors (IDRA-21: 10 mg/kg; S18986: 3 and 10 mg/kg) reversed the alprazolam-induced deficits. This study is first to show evidence that reference treatments of AD, such as memantine (a NMDA receptor antagonist) at 3 mg/kg per os (po) and donepezil (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) at 1 mg/kg po, also reversed the alprazolam-induced amnesia. Given such results, the SD task emerges as a valuable novel task to screen pro-cognitive compounds. Thus, we highlight the efficacy of modulators of AMPA-type glutamate receptors to counteract alprazolam-induced spatial deficits. These results could be viewed alongside the imbalance between excitation and inhibition observed during normal and pathological ageing.
