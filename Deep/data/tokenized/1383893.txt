The regional distribution of radioactive ligand binding for different receptors of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA)-benzodiazepine-picrotoxin chloride channel complex was measured on tissue section by autoradiography in brains taken from a genetic strain of Wistar rats with spontaneous absence-like seizures, the genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), and a control colony. The ligands employed included [3H]muscimol for high affinity GABA agonists sites; [3H]SR 95531 for the low-affinity GABA sites; [3H]flunitrazepam for the benzodiazepine sites; and [35S]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) for the picrotoxin site. There was no significant change between GAERS and control animals in [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]TBPS binding. However, there was significantly decreased [3H]muscimol and [3H]SR 95531 binding in the CA2 region of the hippocampus of the GAERS. This was due to a decrease in Bmax of both [3H]muscimol and [3H]SR 95531 binding in the epileptic strain.
