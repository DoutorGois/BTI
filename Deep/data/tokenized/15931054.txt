In this study, we examined changes in expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in the mouse brain following chronic morphine treatment. Double immunohistochemical staining showed strong colocalization of CaMKIV with mu-opioid receptors. Chronic treatment with morphine produced an increase in expression of CaMKIV and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, whereas a decrease in CaMKIV and pCREB expression was observed in the caudate putamen. Interestingly, chronic morphine induced a decrease in protein expression of CaMKIV in the basolateral amygdale and the primary somatosensory cortex without any concomitant changes in pCREB. These findings suggest that CaMKIV-dependent signaling may play a role in chronic morphine-induced neuroplasticity in a brain region-specific manner.
