Two groups of patients with global amnesia resulting either from Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) or from medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage were compared with groups of matched healthy control subjects on a list discrimination paradigm. Item recognition memory was matched across the amnesic and control groups in order to determine whether KS, but not MTL amnesics are disproportionately impaired on list discrimination as predicted by Parkin's [Functional significance of etiological factors in human amnesia. In: Squire LR, Butters N, editors. Neuropsychology of memory, 2nd ed. New York: The Guilford Press, 1992] hypothesis. However, both patient groups were impaired disproportionately on the temporal order memory task, which is inconsistent with Parkin's hypothesis. It remains possible that the KS patients are more disproportionately impaired than those with MTL damage because both patient groups performed at floor on the list discrimination task. The results are consistent with theories that postulate a critical role for the hippocampus in the kind of associative memory which underlies memory for temporal order, but not in recognition of single items or arbitrary associations between items of similar kinds.
