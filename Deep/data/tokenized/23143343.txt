Inbred LOU/C/Jall rats are currently described as a model of successful aging. These rats have a longer healthy median lifespan than many other strains, do not develop obesity, diabetes, or tumor and more importantly they do not show cognitive decline with aging. This is the first study to examine gene expression changes in the inbred LOU/C/Jall rat hippocampus and frontal cortex. Microarray data from animals aged 5 and 26 months were compared to that obtained from the classical Wistar rat strain to potentially identify only the genes associated with successful aging. We have thus identified a set of 15 genes in the hippocampus and 70 genes in the frontal cortex that could be grouped into several clearly delineated clusters of highly correlated genes associated with a diversity of biological processes, including regulation of plasticity, inflammatory response, metabolic, catabolic and homeostatic processes, and transcription. Such a multiplicity of gene networks and diversity of biological functions were not observed in the Wistar rat strain. The gene expression profiles identified in aged the LOU/C/Jall rats' hippocampus and frontal cortex should be related to their intact cognitive abilities, such as those assessed through spontaneous alternation.
