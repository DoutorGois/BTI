We have proposed that the translocation/activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in synergism with a Ca2+-mediated event plays an essential role in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In a previous study, we saw no effect of PKC-activating phorbol esters alone on baseline responses, although it has been reported by others to enhance synaptic transmission. To resolve this discrepancy, we investigated the dose-response to phorbol esters of both baseline and potentiated granule cell responses elicited with perforant path stimulation. It was confirmed that iontophoretic ejection of phorbol ester to the dentate hilus, which alone had no effect on baseline responses, prolonged the persistence of potentiation produced by 2 trains of 400 Hz stimulation. These data support the proposed synergistic model in which the effects of phorbol ester and high frequency stimulation together produce a long-lasting potentiation of synaptic activation. A similar synergism was observed with ejection of a lower dose of phorbol ester into the perforant path synaptic zone in the molecular layer. Higher doses delivered to the synaptic zone without 400 Hz stimulation were sufficient to enhance baseline synaptic responses, but these doses inhibited the initial potentiation induced with 2 trains of 400 Hz stimulation delivered immediately after ejection. There was at times a slowly developing enhancement observed after the initial blockade. Thus, induction of a persistent synaptic enhancement was observed without initial potentiation. Measurement of PKC activity in membrane and cytosol indicated that PKC activation is only associated with the persistence phase of LTP. In contrast, there was no change in PKC subcellular distribution associated with the blockade of initial potentiation by higher doses of PDBu.
