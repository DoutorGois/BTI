Depression is one of the most disabling diseases and causes a significant burden to both individual and society. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and nortriptyline, respectively, are commonly used in treatment for depression. These antidepressants were tested on cerebral cortex and hippocampal synaptosomes after acute and chronic in vivo and in vitro treatments. In chronic treatment, fluoxetine and nortriptyline decreased ATP hydrolysis (17.8% and 16.3%, respectively) in hippocampus. In cerebral cortex, nortriptyline increased ATP (32.3%), ADP (51.8%), and AMP (59.5%) hydrolysis. However, fluoxetine decreased ATP (25.5%) hydrolysis and increased ADP (80.1%) and AMP (33.3%) hydrolysis. Significant activation of ADP hydrolysis was also observed in acute treatment with nortriptyline (49.8%) in cerebral cortex. However, in hippocampus, ATP (24.7%) and ADP (46.1%) hydrolysis were inhibited. Fluoxetine did not alter enzyme activities in acute treatment for both structures. In addition, there were significant changes in NTPDase activities when fluoxetine and nortriptyline (100, 250, and 500 microM) were tested in vitro. There was no inhibitory effect of fluoxetine and nortriptyline on AMP hydrolysis in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The findings showed that these antidepressant drugs can affect the ecto-nucleotidase pathway, suggesting that the extracellular adenosine levels could be modulated by these drugs.
