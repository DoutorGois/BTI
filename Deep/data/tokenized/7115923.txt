Long-lasting post-tetanic potentiation (LLPTP) of field potentials that lasted 1/2--4 hours was seen in vitro in hippocampal explants of 9--14-day-old mice on days 4--7 within CA1 and CA3 fields after tetanization of Schaffer's collaterals and mossy fibers. It is assumed that LLPTP is an intrinsic functional property of the hippocamp and might occur whatever afferent effects on the part of other brain structures.
