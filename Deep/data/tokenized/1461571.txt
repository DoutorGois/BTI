The effects of adenosine (A) receptor agonists on ischemia-induced impairment of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake by rat hippocampal slices was evaluated. Hippocampal slices were exposed to 20-min hypoxia + hypoglycemia (ischemia) and then returned to oxygenated and glucose-containing Krebs-Ringer solution for 6 h. Ischemia reduced 2-DG uptake in the hippocampal slices. The ischemia-induced reduction in 2-DG uptake was attenuated by pretreatment with A1 receptor agonists but not with A2 receptor agonists. 8-Phenyltheophylline, an A1 receptor antagonist, exacerbated the ischemia-induced decrease. The A1 receptor agonist-induced neuroprotective effect was blocked by co-treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline. The present study suggests that the A1 receptor-mediated function has a protective role in ischemia-induced decreases in glucose metabolism in hippocampal slices.
