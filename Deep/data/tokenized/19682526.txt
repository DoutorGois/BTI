Dystrophin is a protein found at the plasmatic membrane in muscle and postsynaptic membrane of some neurons, where it plays an important role on synaptic transmission and plasticity. Its absence is associated with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD), in which cognitive impairment is found. Oxidative stress appears to be involved in the physiopathology of DMD and its cognitive dysfunction. In this regard, the present study investigated oxidative parameters (lipid and protein peroxidation) and antioxidant enzymes activities (superoxide dismutase and catalase) in prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum and cortex tissues from male dystrophic mdx and normal C57BL10 mice. We observed (1) reduced lipid peroxidation in striatum and protein peroxidation in cerebellum and prefrontal cortex; (2) increased superoxide dismutase activity in cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum; and (3) reduced catalase activity in striatum. It seems by our results, that the superoxide dismutase antioxidant mechanism is playing a protective role against lipid and protein peroxidation in mdx mouse brain.
