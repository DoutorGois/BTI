Agomelatine is one of the latest antidepressants (melatoninergic agonists) with a new mechanism of action. From the positions of classical monoaminoergic theory, tts mechanism of action is difficult to understand, because the drug increases the levels of monoamines and neurotrophic factors, while not affecting their reuptake and negative feedback, which control neurotransmission level. Besides the effect on suprachiasmatic nucleus, a relevant role in the mechanism of action of agomelatine plays its special functionally selective (with regard to intracellular signaling pathways) interaction with heteromeric complexes of serotonin 5-capital EN, Cyrilliccapital TE, Cyrillic2capital ES, Cyrillic and melatonin MT2 receptors in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Agomelatine is competitive to other modern antidepressants in the efficacy assessed by the percentage of complete responders and superior in the total frequency of remissions. Compared to other SSRI antidepressants, agomelatine is more effective for anhedonia. In these cases, agomelatine increases the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the blood of responders.
