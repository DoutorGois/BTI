PURPOSE: This study was conducted to ascertain whether propofol may protect against delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield in gerbils. METHODS: Thirty-five gerbils were randomly assigned to five groups: Group I, the control group, a sham operation treated with physiological saline solution (PSS); Group II, ischemia/reperfusion treated with PSS; Group III, ischemia/reperfusion treated with 50 mg x kg(-1) propofol; Group IV, ischemia/reperfusion treated with 100 mg x kg(-1) propofol; Group V ischemia/reperfusion treated with 150 mg x kg(-1) propofol. Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries for four minutes under N2O/O2/halothane anesthesia after administration of propofol or PSS. Five days later, histopathological changes in the hippocampal CA1 subfield were examined using a light microscope and degenerative ratio of the pyramidal cells were measured according to the following formula: (number of degenerative pyramidal cell/total number of pyramidal cells per 1 mm of hippocampal CA1 subfield) x 100. RESULTS: In group II, the pyramidal cells were atrophic and pycnotic; vacuolation and structural disruption of the radial striated zone was observed. In the other four groups, these changes were not observed. The degenerative ratios of pyramidal cells were as follows; group I: 5.9 +/- 1.9%, group II: 94.6 +/- 2.5% (P < 0.01), group III: 10.7 +/- 1.7%, group IV: 9.7 +/- 1.8%, group V: 9.2 +/- 1.9%. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that propofol may prevent delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in gerbils.
