We studied the changes in the brain weight and hippocampal histology in adult offspring exposed to 0.25-1.5 Gy of 60Co gamma radiations during day 14 or 17 of gestation. Irradiation with 0.5-1.5 Gy produced a significant decrease in brain weight of the offspring at 6 and 12 months of age. Exposure to 1 Gy at day 14 or 17 of gestation resulted in significant decrease in the number of neurons in the CA3 and CA4 regions of hippocampus of 200 microm length, while 1.5 Gy significantly affected CA1 region also. The fetal period (13-18 days of gestation) of mouse development is an active phase of brain development involving proliferation, migration and differentiation of cerebral cortex and associated structures. The present results show that exposure at this period of mouse development to moderate doses of gamma radiation can induce permanent deficits in the brain histology, which can adversely affect the learning and memory in adults.
