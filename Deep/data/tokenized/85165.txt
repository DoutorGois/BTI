Antiserum against normal human neurotubules purified by in-vitro assembly precipitated both neurotubules and a polypeptide isolated from Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles in Ouchterlony double-diffusion tests. The antiserum specifically labelled neurofibrillary tangles, in isolated neurons by immunofluorescence and in tissue sections by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. These results indicate that neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease probably originate from neurotubules.
