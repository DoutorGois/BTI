1. We investigated the content of S100B protein by ELISA in three brain regions (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum) and in cerebrospinal fluid of rats during postnatal development as well as the content and secretion of S100B in pre- and postconfluent primary astrocyte cultures. 2. An accumulation of S100B occurred in all brain regions with similar ontogenetic pattern between second and fourth postnatal weeks. However, we observed a decrease in the cerebrospinal fluid S100B after the critical period for synaptogenesis in rodents. 3. A similar profile of cell accumulation and decrease in basal secretion was also observed during aging of astrocyte cultures. 4. These data contribute to the proposal that S100B is an important glial-derived protein during brain development and that changes in extracellular levels of S100B may be related to glial proliferation and synaptogenesis.
