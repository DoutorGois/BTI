Acute exposure to a neurotoxin, 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA), in rats results in an increase in total free fatty acid (FFA) concentration in selective brain regions. We investigated the effect of 3-NPA administration on the cerebral concentrations of FFA used as a marker of oxidative stress. Rats (n = 3/group) were dosed subcutaneously (s.c.) either with a vehicle (phosphate buffer) or 3-NPA in phosphate buffer at 30 mg/kg body weight. Animals were sacrificed after 1, 2, 3, and 6 h of injection. Brains were then dissected into frontal cortex (FC), caudate nucleus (CN), and hippocampus (HIP). The concentration of total FFA increased from 130 to 300% within 1-2 h after 3-NPA injection in all brain regions when compared with the baseline level obtained from the control rats and taken as 100%. In CN, FFA returned to the baseline level within 3 h of treatment. However, in FC and HIP the concentration of FFA remained significantly elevated above the baseline until 6 h. The released FFA provide a substrate for free radicals formation. The results of this study suggest a role of oxidative stress in the mechanism of 3-NPA toxicity.
