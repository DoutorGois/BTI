Lavandulyl flavanones of Sophora flavescens roots are anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic. Here, we examined whether four lavandulyl flavanones, (2S)-2'-methoxykurarinone (1), sophoraflavanone G (2), leachianone A (3), and (-)-kurarinone (4), isolated from S. flavescens could protect HT22 immortalized hippocampal cells against glutamate-induced oxidative stress. Compounds 1 and 2 induced the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and increased HO activity dose- and time-dependently. These two compounds also suppressed glutamate-induced reactive oxygen species generation in HT22 cells, whereas compounds 3 and 4 were not protective. These two lavandulyl flavanones (compounds 1, 2) may protect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity via HO-1 induction.
