Nucleoside transport processes regulate the levels of adenosine available to modulate neurotransmission, vascular tone and other physiological events. However, although equilibrative transporter transcripts or proteins have been mapped in the central nervous system of rats and humans, little is known about the presence and distribution of the complete family of nucleoside transporters in brain. In this study, we analysed the distribution of the transcript encoding the high affinity adenosine-preferring concentrative transporter CNT2 in the rat central nervous system and compared it with that of the equilibrative transporter ENT1. Furthermore, we evaluated the changes in expression of these two transporters in a situation of increased extracellular levels of adenosine, such as sleep deprivation. CNT2 mRNA was widespread in rat brain, although most prevalent in the amygdala, the hippocampus, specific neocortical regions and the cerebellum. The distribution of CNT2 mRNA only partially overlapped that of ENT1. Most of the cells labelled were neurones. Total sleep deprivation dramatically diminished the amounts of CNT2 mRNA, whereas ENT1 mRNA remained unchanged. This specific decrease in CNT2 transcript suggests a new physiological role for the transporter in the modulation of extracellular adenosine levels and the sleep/wakefulness cycle.
