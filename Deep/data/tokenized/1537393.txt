The surface morphology of transplants of rat fetal hippocampal tissue, and of cavities formed by aspiration lesion of the adult rat hippocampus and overlying neocortex into which the transplants were placed, was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The surface of lesion cavities was covered by a scar upon which occasional cellular profiles were found. The surface cells resembled supraependymal macrophages. Lesion cavities with a transplant showed similar scarring although the number of supraependymal structures was increased. Polymorphic cells and numerous fiber processes were observed both on the surface and embedded in the scar. Ependymal structures were seen on the non-damaged ventricular surfaces adjacent to the lesion site. These regions, however, also displayed increases in the number and types of supraependymal structures. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated considerable variability in surface morphology of different transplants and over the surface of individual transplants. A transplant could show regions of scarring, areas covered by cells resembling ependymal cells, and regions covered by a dense matrix of fibers. In many regions the fibers coalesced to form a branching, web-like network over the transplant surface. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the surface could be covered by ependymal cells or by the scar seen in scanning specimens. Some surface fibers were identified as axons. Cells on the surface of the transplants could be identified as neuronal, glial-like, and phagocytic. The cells and the possible effects of surface morphology on transplant function is discussed.
