A change was shown in the EEG power spectra of the sensorimotor, visual and auditory neocortical areas and the dorsal hippocampus, and corresponding coherence functions in the range of 14.6-110 c/s during an orienting reaction and the formation of a defensive conditioned reflex in rabbits. It was suggested that the rhythm of about 5 c/s appearing during formation of the conditioned reflex, serves for the functional integration of the brain structures which is specific for a certain functional state.
