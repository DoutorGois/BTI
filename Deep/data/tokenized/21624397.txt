As in humans, genetic background in rodents may influence a peculiar set of behavioural traits such as sensitivity to pain and stressors or anxiety-related behaviours. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that mice with different genetic backgrounds [outbred (CD1), inbred (C57BL/6J) and hybrid (B6C3F1) adult male mice] display altered reactivity to pain, stress and anxiety related behaviours. We demonstrated that B6C3F1 mice displayed the more anxious phenotype with respect to C57BL/6J or CD1 animals, with the latter being the less anxious strain when tested in an open field and on an elevated plus maze. No difference was observed across strains in thermal sensitivity to a radiant heat source. Mice were then treated with a sub-plantar injection of the inflammatory agent Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), 24h later they were hyperalgesic with respect to saline exposed animals, irrespective of strain. We then measured intra-strain differences and CFA-induced inter-strain effects on the expression of various genes with a recognized role in pain and anxiety: BDNF, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-18 and NMDA receptor subunits in the mouse thalamus, hippocampus and hypothalamus. The more anxious phenotype observed in B6C3F1 hybrid mice displayed lower levels of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus and hypothalamus when compared to outbred CD1 and C57BL/6J inbred mice. CFA led to a general decrease in central gene expression of the evaluated targets especially in CD1 mice, while BDNF hypothalamic downregulation stands out as a common effect of CFA in all three strains evaluated.
