The epileptic seizure is a dynamic process involving a rapid transition from normal activity to a state of hypersynchronous neuronal discharges. Here we investigated the network properties of epileptiform discharges in hippocampal slices in the presence of high K(+) concentration (8.5 mmol/L) in the bath, and the effects of the anti-epileptic drug valproate (VPA) on epileptiform discharges, using a microelectrode array. We demonstrated that epileptiform discharges were predominantly initiated from the stratum pyramidale layer of CA3a-b and propagated bi-directionally to CA1 and CA3c. Disconnection of CA3 from CA1 abolished the discharges in CA1 without disrupting the initiation of discharges in CA3. Further pharmacological experiments showed that VPA at a clinically relevant concentration (100 mumol/L) suppressed the propagation speed but not the rate or duration of high-K(+)-induced discharges. Our findings suggest that pacemakers exist in the CA3a-b region for the generation of epileptiform discharges in the hippocampus. VPA reduces the conduction of such discharges in the network by reducing the propagation speed.
