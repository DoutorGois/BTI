Dietary induced acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) is used to reduce central serotonergic function and to investigate the role of serotonin (5-HT) in psychiatric illness. In healthy volunteers ATD produces working memory deficits and decreases mood in some studies. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in both cognition and in the regulation of mood; however, the possible contribution of central BDNF changes to the effects of ATD has not been examined. Therefore, using a rat model we have examined the effect of amino acid mixture-induced ATD on plasma and central BDNF protein levels. ATD significantly reduced free-plasma TRP by 79% and central hippocampal 5-HT by 35% when compared to controls. However, plasma or central BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus and midbrain were not significantly altered by ATD. These results suggest that changes in central BDNF do not contribute to the cognitive or mood effects of ATD.
