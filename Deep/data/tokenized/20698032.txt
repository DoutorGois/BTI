Methamphetamine (MA) is widely abused and implicated in residual cognitive deficits. In rats, increases in plasma corticosterone and egocentric learning deficits are observed after a 1-day binge regimen of MA (10 mg/kg x 4 at 2-h intervals). The purpose of this experiment was to determine if adrenal inactivation during and following MA exposure would attenuate the egocentric learning deficits in the Cincinnati water maze (CWM). In the first experiment, the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) or sham surgery (SHAM) on MA-induced neurotoxicity at 72 h were determined. SHAM-MA animals showed typical patterns of hyperthermia, whereas ADX-MA animals were normothermic. Both SHAM-MA- and ADX-MA-treated animals showed increased neostriatal glial fibrillary acidic protein and decreased monoamines in the neostriatum, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. In the second experiment, SHAM-MA- and ADX-MA-treated groups showed equivalently impaired CWM performance 2 weeks post-treatment (increased latencies, errors, and start returns) compared to SHAM-saline (SAL) and ADX-SAL groups with no effects on novel object recognition, elevated zero maze, or acoustic startle/prepulse inhibition. Post-testing, monoamine levels remained decreased in both MA-treated groups in all three brain regions, but were not as large as those observed at 72-h post-treatment. The data demonstrate that MA-induced learning deficits can be dissociated from drug-induced increases in plasma corticosterone or hyperthermia, but co-occur with dopamine and serotonin reductions.
