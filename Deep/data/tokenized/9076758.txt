Groups of rats received once daily subcutaneous treatments for 22 days with haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg), clozapine (20 mg/kg), SCH 23390 (0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle. Quantitative immunoblots for Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, G(o alpha), Gs alpha (45 kD), G beta 35 and G beta 36 were performed on membranes from the following brain regions: striatum, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA), prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (CA1). No significant alterations were found in the levels of any of these G protein subunits, in any brain region in treated vs control rats.
