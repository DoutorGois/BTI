Post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in memory formation. However, the roles of individual miRNAs in these processes remain largely unknown. In this study, we want to clarify the role of miR-181a in hippocampus-dependent memory formation. A transient increase in miR-181a expression was observed after conditioned fear conditioning (CFC) and object location task (OLT) training. Selective overexpression or inhibition of miR-181a in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) via the injection of a miR-181a agomir or antagomir enhanced or impaired the CFC- and OLT-dependent memory formation, respectively. Using bioinformatics and luciferase assays, we identified PRKAA1 as a potential target gene of miR-181a. After CFC or OLT training, the expression and activity of PRKAA1 decreased as miR-181a expression increased and was effectively blocked by the miR-181a antagomir. Moreover, microinjection of the PRKAA1 agonist AICAR or inhibitor compound C in the DH reversed the roles of the miR-181a agomir or antagomir in CFC- and OLT-dependent memory formation. In conclusion, this work provides novel evidence describing the role and mechanism of miR-181a in hippocampus-dependent memory formation, which sheds light on the potential regulation of cognition and future treatments for cognitive disorders.
