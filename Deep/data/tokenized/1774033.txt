Kindling model of epilepsy induced by intraperitoneal injection of Coriaria lactone (CL) was used in the experiment. The dose of CL was 1.25 mg/kg. Thirty rats in various periods of kindling were killed and the materials of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were drawn. The enzyme activities of AchE, NADHD, CCO, LDH, SDH, AcP, ANAE and AkP of these areas were observed with enzyme histochemical techniques. In another three kindled rats, two blank control rats and two NS control rats, the ultrastructure of neurons in hippocampus were observed. The results of experiments showed an increased activity of enzymes related to saccharometabolism and energy metabolism, indicating that the metabolism of brain in rats was increased by repeated kindling seizures. The mechanism of kindling seizure induced by CL may be related to inhibitory effect of CL on AchE activity of brain. The degeneration damage of brain neurons in kindled rats may result from using CL for a long time.
