Transient brain ischemia induces an inhibition of translational rates and causes delayed neuronal death in selective regions and cognitive deficits, whereas these effects do not occur in resistant areas. The translational repressor eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein-2 (4E-BP2) specifically binds to eIF4E and is critical in the control of protein synthesis. To link neuronal death to translation inhibition, we study the eIF4E association with 4E-BP2 under ischemia reperfusion in a rat model of transient forebrain ischemia. Upon reperfusion, a selective neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region was induced, while it did not occur in the cerebral cortex. Confocal microscopy analysis showed a decrease in 4E-BP2/eIF4E colocalization in resistant cortical neurons after reperfusion. In contrast, in vulnerable CA1 neurons, 4E-BP2 remains associated to eIF4E with a higher degree of 4E-BP2/eIF4E colocalization and translation inhibition. Furthermore, the binding of a 4E-BP2 peptide to eIF4E induced neuronal apoptosis in the CA1 region. Finally, pharmacological-induced protection of CA1 neurons inhibited neuronal apoptosis, decreased 4E-BP2/eIF4E association, and recovered translation. These findings documented specific changes in 4E-BP2/eIF4E association during ischemic reperfusion, linking the translation inhibition to selective neuronal death, and identifying 4E-BP2 as a novel target for protection of vulnerable neurons in ischemic injury.
