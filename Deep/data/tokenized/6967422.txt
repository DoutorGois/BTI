Penicillin administration elicited epileptiform responses whereas micropolarization (MCP) affected the epileptogenic foci in cats with indwelled electrodes and chemotrodes. Three types of experimental epilepsy models were obtained: focal petit mal seizures, adversive, and grand mal seizures. The MCP of amygdala and caudate nucleus completely suppressed all three types of seizures whereas MCP of hippocampus enhanced the pathology. Two mechanisms of seizure suppression seem to exist: the inhibitory and the activating ones.
