BACKGROUND/AIMS: The neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) rat model shows biological and behavioral abnormalities similar to schizophrenia. Disturbed sensory gating reflects a consistent neurobiological abnormality in schizophrenia. Although of critical interest, sensory gating has not been evaluated in the NVHL model. METHODS: The N40 rat analog of the human P50 was measured to assess sensory response and gating in NVHL and sham rats. Epidural electrodes recorded evoked potentials (EPs), from which amplitudes, latencies, difference scores (S1-S2) and gating ratios (S2/S1) were assessed. Power and phase locking were computed for evoked EEG activity, to test for frequency-specific abnormalities. RESULTS: Prolonged S1 N40 latency was detected in the NVHL group, but amplitude and power measures did not differ. NVHL rats demonstrated disturbed phase-locked sensory gating at theta and beta frequencies, as well as reduced phase-locked gamma activity across stimuli, most robustly at S1. CONCLUSIONS: While measures of sensory gating obtained from the EP were relatively insensitive to the NVHL model, phase locking across trials was affected. NVHL rats may have increased evoked response temporal variability, similar to patients with schizophrenia. This pattern of findings likely reflects core developmental NVHL disturbances in dorsal hippocampal circuits associated with temporal and frontal areas.
