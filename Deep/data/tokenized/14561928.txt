A non-invasive method for observing the functioning of the hippocampus could be invaluable in understanding the role of hippocampal abnormalities in many brain disorders. Transverse patterning, a hippocampal-dependent memory task, was used in an attempt to study the functioning hippocampus. Subjects performed transverse patterning while whole-head MEG data were collected. The MEG data were analyzed using a spatial-temporal multiple-dipole approach. Controls showed right hippocampal activation. Patients with unilateral hippocampal damage showed activation in undamaged hippocampus. MEG during transverse patterning performance is a promising, non-invasive tool for assessing hippocampal function.
