The mechanisms by which neuroligin adhesion molecules modulate synaptic plasticity remain unclear. In this issue, Liu et al. (2016. J. Cell Biol. http://dx.doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201509023) demonstrate that neuroligin 1 promotes actin assembly associated with synaptic strengthening independent of adhesion, suggesting additional ways for neuroligins to contribute to neuronal development and disease pathology.
