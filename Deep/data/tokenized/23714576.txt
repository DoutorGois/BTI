gamma Amino-butyric acid type-A receptors (GABARs) containing gamma2 or delta subunits form separate pools of receptors in vivo, with distinct localization and function. We determined the rate of surface membrane insertion of native and recombinant gamma2 and delta subunit-containing GABARs (gamma2-GABARs and delta-GABARs). Insertion of the alpha-bungarotoxin binding site (BBS) tagged gamma2 subunit (t-gamma2)-containing GABARs in the surface membrane of HEK293 cells occurred within minutes and reached a peak by 30 min. In contrast, insertion of the BBS-tagged delta subunit (t-delta)-containing receptors required longer incubation and peaked in 120 min. Insertion of the t-gamma2 subunit-containing receptors was not influenced by assembling alpha1 or alpha4 subunits. In contrast, insertion of the alpha4beta3t-delta subunit-containing receptors was faster than those containing alpha1beta3t-delta subunits. The rate of insertion of native GABARs in the surface membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons, determined by an antibody saturation assay, was similar to that of the recombinant receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Insertion of the gamma2-GABARs was rapid and new gamma2-GABARs were detected on the surface membrane of cell soma and dendrites within minutes. In contrast, insertion of the delta-GABARs was slow and newly inserted receptors were initially present only in the surface membrane of cell soma and later also appeared over the dendrites. Thus the rate of insertion of GABARs was dependent on their subunit composition.
