Biphasic field potentials were recorded in the CA3 distal dendritic region in response to both antidromic (fornix) and orthodromic (mossy fiber) stimulation in guinea pig hippocampal slices in vitro. The positive component (P1) corresponded to intracellularly recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials. The negative component (N1) appears to be due to GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) since it corresponded to the fast IPSP recorded intracellularly, was blocked by bicuculline and penicillin and augmented by barbiturates. The amplitude of N1 and the duration of P1 are sensitive and useful measures of the GABAA-mediated IPSP.
