The overactivation of excitatory amino acid receptors plays a key role in the pathomechanism of several neurodegenerative disorders and in ischemic and post-ischemic events. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous product of the tryptophan metabolism and, as a broad-spectrum antagonist of excitatory amino acid receptors, may serve as a protective agent in neurological disorders. The use of KYNA is excluded, however, because it hardly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Accordingly, new KYNA analogs which can readily cross this barrier and exert their complex anti-excitatory activity are generally needed. During the past 6 years, we have developed several KYNA derivatives, among others KYNA amides. These new analogs included one, N-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-4-oxo-1H-quinoline-2-carboxamide hydrochloride (KYNA-1), that has proved to be neuroprotective in several models. This paper reports on the synthesis of 10 new KYNA amides (KYNA-1-KYNA-10) and on the effectiveness of these molecules as inhibitors of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The molecular structure and functional effects of KYNA-1 are compared with those of other KYNA amides. Behavioral studies with these KYNA amides demonstrated that they do not exert significant nonspecific general side-effects. KYNA-1 may therefore be considered a promising candidate for clinical studies.
