Long-term adrenalectomy results in loss of neurones in the hippocampal formation of the adult rat. The effects of long-term adrenalectomy on spatial learning and exploratory behaviour in adrenalectomized (ADX), adrenalectomized normal weight gain (ADXNW), sham operated and naive control male Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated in this study. The ADX rats had significantly longer latencies in the Morris maze task compared to the other groups. In the open-field situation, as a novel finding, the ADX rats showed significantly lower rearing scores compared to other groups. These data indicate that long-term adrenalectomy causes impairment in spatial learning and explorative behaviour in the rat.
