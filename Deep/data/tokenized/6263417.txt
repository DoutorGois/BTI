The distribution of mu and delta opiate receptors in bovine brain has been investigated using the selective radioligands [3H]morphine and D-[3H]Ala2, D-Leu5-enkephalin. Their distributions were found to vary independently through different brain areas with up to a 10-fold difference between the ratio of mu to delta binding sites for the substantia nigra and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
