It has been reported that piperine (PIP) and deoxyschizandrin (DS) can modulate synchronized Ca(2)(+) oscillations in cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. We investigated the modulation effects of four different combinations of piperine and deoxyschizandrin on synchronized Ca(2)(+) oscillations in cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. The results showed that all four combinations (PIP:DS 4.9:1.9, 2.45:2.85, 7.35:0.95, and 2.45:0.95 mg/L) inhibit Ca(2)(+) oscillation intensity to a similar extent. However, the first three combinations had strong inhibitory effects on the frequency of Ca(2)(+) oscillations whereas the last combination (2.45:0.95 mg/L) only slightly enhanced the frequency of Ca(2)(+) oscillations. We propose an improved Chay's model to explain the mechanism of the effects of piperine and deoxyschizandrin on synchronized Ca(2)(+) oscillations in cultured hippocampal neuronal cells. We concluded that deoxyschizandrin modulated synchronized Ca(2)(+) oscillations in cultured hippocampal neuronal networks bidirectionally and the effect depended on concentration. Deoxyschizandrin reduced voltage-gated sodium channel conductance and ATP-sensitive potassium channel conductance, and affected the rate of exchange of intracellular calcium and the pump activity of Ca(2)(+)-ATPase in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Piperine reduced the activity of calcium release in the ER, and reduced the pump activity of calcium in the cytomembrane or enhanced the pump activity of Ca(2)(+)-ATPase in the ER.
