In this communication, the effect of acute treatment with lamotrigine (LTG) was investigated on release of main excitatory amino acids (EAA) such as glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) in the hippocampus of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced and PTZ-kindled freely moving rats using micro dialysis. The results show that, levels of Glu and Asp significantly increased in the rat hippocampus during the seizure/interical periods for PTZ-status epilepticus (SE) and PTZ-kindled epileptic (EP) rats. The levels of Glu and Asp increased more in EP rat hippocampus than in SE rat hippocampus. After administration of 20 mg/kg LTG, the levels of Glu and Asp significantly decreased in the SE and EP rat hippocampus. The results indicate that: (a) excitability of the PTZ-kindled epileptogenic model is higher than that of the status epilepticus model; (b) the modulation of LTG on the EAA neurotransmitters certainly plays an important role in antiepileptic efficacy, especially in PTZ-kindled epileptic model where the release of EAA was influenced more markedly by acute application of 20 mg/kg LTG.
