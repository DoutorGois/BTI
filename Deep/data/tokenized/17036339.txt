PURPOSE: To demonstrate an MRI method for directly visualizing amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the APP/PS1 transgenic (tg) mouse brain in vivo, and show that T1rho relaxation rate increases progressively with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology in the tg mouse brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained in vivo MR images of a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1) that overexpresses human amyloid precursor protein, and measured T1rho via quantitative relaxometric maps. RESULTS: A significant decrease in T1rho was observed in the cortex and hippocampus of 12- and 18-month-old animals compared to their age-matched controls. There was also a correlation between changes in T1rho and the age of the animals. CONCLUSION: T1rho relaxometry may be a sensitive method for noninvasively determining AD-related pathology in APP/PS1 mice.
