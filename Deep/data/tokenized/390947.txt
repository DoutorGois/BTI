In studying the three-dimensional interrelationship of the thalamic and temporal systems of co-ordinates it was proved that one of them cannot be used in calculating the stereotaxic co-ordinates of structures associated with the other. In combined stereotaxic operations it is necessary to construct combined independent systems of co-ordinates. The possibility of exact construction of the co-ordinate systems of intracerebral structures depends to a great measure on the positive contrasting of the ventricular system.
