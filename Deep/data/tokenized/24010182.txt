Long-term potentiation (LTP) of CA1 population spikes was elicited by cCA3 stimulation. Phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine blocked the potentiation in a dose-dependent manner while diazepam and sodium thiopental had no effect. In midcollicular-transected rats where PCP has no depressant effect on the population spike, the drug still blocked LTP.
