1. The effect of transient forebrain ischemia on endothelin-1 (ET-1) and endothelin-3 (ET-3) production in the hippocampus of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques. 2. In SHRSPs subjected to 10-min bilateral carotid occlusion, neuronal degeneration in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus was detectable at 4 days and remarkable at 7 days after reperfusion. 3. Coinciding with neuronal degeneration, ET-1- and ET-3-like immunoreactivities were intense in the CA1 pyramidal-cell layer, the stratum lacunosum moleculare, and the CA4 subfield of the hippocampus. Almost all of the immunostained cells had morphological characteristics of astrocytes. 4. The possibility that ET has a role in the development of neuronal cell death following transient forebrain ischemia warrants further attention.
