Here we report that selection for behavior and maternal methyl-supplemented diet alters rat hippocampus glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression. Same selection is associated with increased GR mRNA expression as compared with aggressive rats, whereas maternal methyl-supplemented diet inhibits tame rat GR gene activity. The gene promoter methylation is a way to alter GR expression.
