Studies have pointed to a relationship between MAPK kinase (MEK) signaling and the behavioral effects of antidepressant drugs. So, in the present study we examined the behavioral and molecular effects of ketamine, an antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA), which has been shown to have an antidepressant effect after the inhibition of MEK signaling in Wistar rats. Our results showed that acute administration of the MEK inhibitor PD184161, produced depressive-like behavior and stopped antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in the forced swimming test. The phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK 1/2) was decreased by PD184161 in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens, and the effects of ketamine on pERK 1/2 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were inhibited by PD184161. The ERK 2 levels were decreased by PD184161 in the nucleus accumbens; and the effects of ketamine were blocked in this brain area. The p38 protein kinase (p38MAPK) and proBDNF were inhibited by PD184161, and the MEK inhibitor prevented the effects of ketamine in the nucleus accumbens. In addition, ketamine increased pro-BDNF levels in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that an acute blockade of MAPK signaling lead to depressive-like behavior and stopped the antidepressant response of ketamine, suggesting that the effects of ketamine could be mediated, at least in part, by the regulation of MAPK signaling in these specific brain areas.
