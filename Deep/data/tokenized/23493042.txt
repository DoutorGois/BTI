The main objective of the present study was to establish whether the mixed sigma(1)/muscarinic ligand ANAVEX2-73, shown to be neuroprotective in Alzheimer's disease (AD) models in vivo and currently in clinical phase I/IIa, could have the ability to reduce the appearance of hyperphosphorylated Tau and amyloid-beta(1)(-)(4)(2) (Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) in the Abeta(2)(5)(-)(3)(5) mouse model of AD. We therefore first confirmed that Abeta(2)(5)(-)(3)(5) injection induced hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein, by showing that it rapidly decreased Akt activity and activated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in the mouse hippocampus. Second, we showed that the kinase activation, and resulting Tau alteration, directly contributed to the amyloid toxicity, as co-administration of the selective GSK-3beta inhibitor 2-thio(3-iodobenzyl)-5-(1-pyridyl)-[1,3,4]-oxidiazole blocked both Tau phosphorylation and Abeta(2)(5)(-)(3)(5)-induced memory impairments. Third, we analyzed the ANAVEX2-73 effect on Tau phosphorylation and activation of the related kinase pathways (Akt and GSK-3beta). And fourth, we also addressed the impact of the drug on Abeta(2)(5)(-)(3)(5)-induced Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) seeding and observed that the compound significantly blocked the increase in Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) and C99 levels in the hippocampus, suggesting that it may alleviate amyloid load in AD models. The comparison with PRE-084, a selective and reference sigma(1) receptor agonist, and xanomeline, a muscarinic ligand presenting similar profile as ANAVEX2-73 on M1 and M2 subtypes, confirmed that both muscarinic and sigma(1) targets are involved in the ANAVEX2-73 effects. The drug, acting synergistically on both targets, but with moderate affinity, presents a promising pharmacological profile.
