Phase and amplitude depth profiles of EEG theta-like activity (TLA) induced by bath perfusion of 50 micro M of the cholinergic agonist carbachol were investigated using rat hippocampal formation slices. The data showed that the amplitude and phase of laminar profiles of TLA recorded in vitro were the same as the type III theta profiles recorded in in vivo rat preparations. These results supported the conclusion that the neural mechanisms involved in the generation of theta field activity in in vivo preparations and the generation of TLA in in vitro preparations were similar. The study provided further validation for the use of carbachol in vitro slice preparation as a model for studying the neural circuitry underlying theta generation in the hippocampal formation.
