Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), causing neuronal death through apoptosis. In this study, the neuroprotective role of small peptides, Gly-Pro-Glu (GPE), Gly-Glu (GE), Gly-Pro-Asp (GPD), and Gly-Pro-Arg (GPR) were examined against Abeta-induced toxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We report here that GPR (10-100 microM) prevented Abeta-mediated increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and Abeta inhibition of MTT reduction, even in neurons that were pre-exposed to Abeta for 24 or 48 h. Since GPR prevented Abeta inhibition of MTT reduction, the anti-apoptotic effect of GPR was studied by examining activation of caspase-3 and expression of p53 protein. Caspase-3 was significantly activated by 20 microM Abeta25-35 and 5 microM Abeta1-40, but GPR effectively prevented the Abeta-mediated activation of caspase-3. Similarly, Abeta increased numbers of p53-positive cells, but GPR prevented this Abeta effect. Our findings suggest that GPR can rescue cultured rat hippocampal neurons from Abeta-induced neuronal death by inhibiting caspase-3/p53-dependent apoptosis.
