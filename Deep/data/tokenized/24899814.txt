Tryptophan (TRP) and its neuroactive metabolite, kynurenic acid (KYNA), are thought to play key roles in central fatigue, but the specifics are still unknown. To clarify their roles in the brain, we developed a rat model of central fatigue induced by chronic sleep disorder (CFSD) by disturbing the sleep-wake cycle. Results showed that while 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration did not differ between control and CFSD groups, levels of TRP and KYNA in the CFSD group were about 2 and 5 times higher in the hypothalamus, and 2 and 3.5 times higher in the hippocampus, respectively. Moreover, CFSD-induced fatigue led to abnormal running performance (via treadmill test) and social interaction (via social-interaction test). These results support a TRP-KYNA hypothesis in central fatigue in which increased TRP concentration in the brain and subsequently synthesized KYNA may produce an amplified effect on central fatigue, with enhanced concentrations being a possible mechanism by which social-interaction deficits are generated.
