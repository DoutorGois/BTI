5-HT1A receptor binding sites were measured, by saturation binding with [3H]8-OH-DPAT, in frontal and occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala obtained at post-mortem examination from suicide victims with a firm retrospective diagnosis of depression, and matched controls. The number of 5-HT1A binding sites did not differ significantly between suicides and controls, either in the total sample or when the suicides were divided on the basis of violence of death or recent antidepressant treatment.
