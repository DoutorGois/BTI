Parvalbumin (PV)- and calbindin (CaBP)-immunostaining in the hippocampal formation of 3-, 11- and 28-month-old Wistar rats was studied using monoclonal antibodies. A quantitative analysis of the densities, cross-sectional areas, length and number of processes of PV-immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampal dentata and CA1 areas of the three age groups was employed. Marked age-related changes in the morphological appearance and in the quantitative parameters characterizing the PV-immunoreactive neurons in both hippocampal regions were observed. The intensity of CaBP-immunostaining of the hippocampal principle cells and interneurons remained the same but the immunoreactive fibers were structurally altered in aging.
