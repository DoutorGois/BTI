The activities of RNA polymerase I and II were assayed in nuclei isolated from different regions (cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus, corpus striatum and pituitary) of brains from young (10 days), adult (6 months), and old (2 years) rats. The RNA polymerases I and II activities generally increased during maturation, i.e., from 10 days to 6 months of postnatal age and then showed a decrease from 6 months to 2 years of age in all the regions except in cerebral cortex where the RNA polymerase II activity was highest at 10 days but showed a gradual decrease through the lifespan up to 2 years.
