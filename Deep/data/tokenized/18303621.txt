OBJECTIVE: To explore rat prenatal lead exposure on gene transcription level of Brn-3a mRNA in the neurons of central nervous system. METHODS: The pregnant rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, which were provided with distilled water and contenting 0.5g/L, 1.0g/L and 2.0g/L lead acetate solution drinking water respectively, the lead-exposed period for exposure groups were limited from the 15th day after pregnancy to the 21st day when the offspring began to weaned, Brn-3a mRNA transcription level were observed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The RT-PCR results showed that Brn-3a mRNA transcription level significantly decreased in neural cells from cerebral hippocampus in all lead treatment groups compared with the control group (P < 0.05), but in cerebral cortex and cerebellum, we had not seen the same result. The in situ hybridization results showed that Brn-3a mRNA transcription level significantly decreased in high dose lead group in cerebral cortex and cerebellum (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The study indicated that Brn-3a mRNA transcription level significantly decreased in neural cells from cerebral hippocampus. It might participate in the neurological toxicity as a transcription regular factor damaging the learning and memory ability induced by lead.
