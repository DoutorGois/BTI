OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of astragalan (AG) on the expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule(NCAM) and c-fos of hippocampus CA1 region after the ischemic brain injury in rats. METHODS: One hundred male Wistar rats (180-220 g) were divided into ten groups randomly, they were sham operated group (SOG, n = 10), three model group(MG-ld, 3d, 7d, n = 10), as well as three low and high dose astragalan treatment groups (L/H-AGTG-1d, 3d, 7d, n = 10), respectively. And then, middle cerebral artery of MG and AGTG were intercepted by operation inducing brain injured. Their cerebral blood vessel were reperfused on 1, 2, 3 d, respectively, after the L/H-AGTG were treated with the AG (5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, ip). After neurologic impairment(NIP) was scored, animals were decapitated to take out hippocampus for counting apoptosis , determining the expression of the NCAM and c-fos by immunohistochemistry method and RT-PCR semiquantitative analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The NIP scores and apoptotic cell of the L-AGTG and H-AGTG were significantly lower than MG (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). The expression of NCAM and c-fos were significantly higher than the MG (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Astragalan could improve significantly neural function of ischemia brain injury in rats,the mechanism concerned probably with blocking or reversing apoptosis of hippocampus by promoting the expression of the NCAM and c-fos of hippocampus CA1 region.
