The hippocampal formation of Mongolian gerbils expresses high amounts of atypical angiotensin II type-1 receptors. We studied the expression of these receptors by in situ hybridization using specific [35S]-labeled riboprobes and by receptor autoradiography using [125I]Sarcosine1-angiotensin II. Angiotensin II receptor mRNA was found in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subfields, with the highest expression in the CA2 subfield, and in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Angiotensin II binding was detected in the stratum oriens and stratum radiatum of the CA1 and CA2 subfields, in the stratum oriens of the CA3 subfield, and in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. We then studied the effect of ischemia on hippocampal angiotensin II receptor expression, 1, 4 and 15 days after bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 5 min. No changes in angiotensin II receptor mRNA or binding were detected 1 day after ischemia. Delayed, progressive loss of angiotensin II mRNA and binding occurred 4 and 15 days after ischemia, in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 subfields. The decline was faster in the CA1 subfield, and paralleled the loss of neurons after ischemia. In the dentate gyrus, angiotensin II receptor mRNA and angiotensin II binding were not changed when compared to sham operated controls. The decrease of angiotensin II receptor expression may reflect the loss of angiotensin II receptor-producing neurons rather than a down-regulation of receptor expression.
