Recent research into the transplantation of foetal cerebral tissue into the brains of adult mammals is reviewed. Functional integration of the graft with the host CNS makes it possible to form new intercentral connections and heterotopic sensory inputs, to replace lost neuroendocrine or modulatory influences and to produce brains with unusual functional properties. The potential significance of the transplantation studies for the therapy of traumatic or degenerative brain lesions calls for international coordination of these multidisciplinary research projects.
