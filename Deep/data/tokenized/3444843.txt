Increase of the potassium concentration up to 8 mM in the superfused solution of rat hippocampal slices leads to the development of an epileptiform bursting. The derivative agonist L-phenyl isopropyl adenosine (L-PIA) (0.05-0.5 microM) is able to block the potassium induced epileptiform activity. The adenosine antagonist caffeine (100 microM) reverts the antiepileptic effect of L-PIA. Our data show a modulatory action of the purinergic transmission in a model of experimental in vitro epilepsy, and point out about a control of endogenous adenosine in the development of focal epileptiform activity. The relationships between the purinergic influence on the release of neurotransmitters, and the convulsant-anticonvulsant effects of the drugs are discussed.
