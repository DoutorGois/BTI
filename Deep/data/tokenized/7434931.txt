Neurophysiological mechanisms of facilitation of excitation transmission from receptors to effectors were studied in the case of maximal correlation between cortical potentials. This condition was accompanied by a rise in excitability of the sensorimotor, visual, auditory cortex and of the dorsal hippocampus as well as by an increase of muscle activity. On the basis of the obtained and literature data it is suggested that maximal synchroneity of cortical potentials reflects a certain state not only of the neocortex, but also of other CNS parts, down to spinal centres. This condition is attended with facilitation of excitation irradiation and of its transmission to motor periphery.
