The effects of repeated treatment (14 days) with electroconvulsive shock (ECS) or imipramine on binding sites on alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the rat were studied. The binding of [3H]prazosin studied with WB4101 and phentolamine, as binding inhibitors, showed the existence of two subtypes of alpha 1-adrenoceptor (alpha 1A and alpha 1B). Proportions of the alpha 1A and alpha 1B binding sites were about 3:7 in the frontal cortex and 9:1 in the hippocampus. Pretreatment of the membranes with chlorethylclonidine (CEC) almost abolished the alpha 1B binding sites. Inhibition of the binding of [3H]prazosin studied with antidepressants (imipramine, desipramine, maprotiline and mianserin) showed that these drugs bound to alpha 1-adrenoceptors with low affinity, in an apparent monophasic manner. The characteristics of the alpha 1A and alpha 1B binding sites were studied by the binding assay with [3H]prazosin, in the presence of a small concentration (2 nM) of WB4101 to mask the alpha 1A binding sites, as well as the assay without WB4101, for the total alpha 1-adrenoceptor (alpha 1A and alpha 1B) binding. Repeated treatment with electroconvulsive shock increased but that with imipramine decreased, the density of the alpha 1B binding sites in the frontal cortex, without change of the affinity. Neither treatment affected the alpha 1A binding sites in the frontal cortex. The alpha 1-adrenoceptors (alpha 1A and alpha 1B) in the hippocampus were not affected at all by these repeated treatments. The electroconvulsive shock-induced increase in the alpha 1B binding sites in the frontal cortex of the rat could contribute to differences in clinical effects between electroconvulsive shock and antidepressant drugs.
