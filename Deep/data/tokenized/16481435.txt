The mechanisms through which circulating ghrelin relays hunger signals to the CNS are not yet fully understood. In this study, we have examined the potential role of the subfornical organ (SFO), a circumventricular structure that lacks the normal blood-brain barrier, as a CNS site in which ghrelin acts to influence the hypothalamic centers controlling food intake. We report that ghrelin increased intracellular calcium concentrations in 28% (12 of 43) of dissociated SFO neurons and that the SFO expresses mRNA for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. Whole-cell patch recordings from SFO neurons demonstrated that in 29% (9 of 31) of neurons tested ghrelin induced a mean depolarization of 7.4 +/- 0.69 mV, accompanied by an increase in action potential frequency. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that ghrelin activates a putative nonselective cationic conductance. Previous reports that the satiety signal amylin exerts similar excitatory effects on SFO neurons led us to examine whether these two peptides influence different subpopulations of SFO neurons. Concentration-dependent depolarizing effects of amylin were observed in 59% (28 of 47) of SFO neurons (mean depolarization, 8.32 +/- 0.60 mV). In contrast to ghrelin, voltage-clamp recordings suggest that amylin influences a voltage-dependent current activated at depolarized potentials. We tested single SFO neurons with both peptides and identified cells responsive only to ghrelin (n = 9) and only to amylin (n = 7) but no cells that responded to both peptides. These data support a role for the SFO as a center at which ghrelin and amylin may influence separate subpopulations of neurons to influence the hypothalamic regulation of feeding.
