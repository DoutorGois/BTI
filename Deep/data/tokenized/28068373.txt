The CacyBP/SIP target S100A6 is widely present in the nervous system, and its up-regulation is associated with certain neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we examined the involvement of S100A6 protein in stress responses in mice. Using Western blotting, we observed a marked change in brainstem structures, whereby stressed mice showed approximately one-third the protein level produced in the control group. A decreased level of S100A6 protein in stressed animals was also detected in the olfactory bulb and the cerebellum and stress-related structures such as the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. Additionally, using immunohistochemistry, high levels of S100A6 expression were observed in astrocytes localized in the border zones of all brain ventricles, tanycytes of the ventro-lateral walls of the hypothalamus, including the arcuate nucleus (ARH) and low levels of this protein were in neurons of the olfactory bulb, the hippocampus, the thalamus, the cerebral cortex, the brainstem and the cerebellum. Although S100A6-expressing cells in all these brain structures did not change their phenotype in response to stress, the intensity of immunofluorescent labeling in all studied structures was lower in stressed mice than in control animals. For example, in the ARH, where extremely strong immunostaining was observed, the number of immunolabeled fibers was decreased by approximately half in the stressed group compared with the controls. Although these results are descriptive and do not give clue about functional role of S100A6 in stress, they indicate that the level of S100A6 decreases in several brain structures in response to chronic mild stress, suggesting that this protein may modify stress responses.
