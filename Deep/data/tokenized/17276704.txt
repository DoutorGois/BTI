The current study employed aged and young male Fischer 344 rats to examine the relationship between long-term depression (LTD), age, and memory. Memory performance was measured on two tasks that are sensitive to hippocampal function; inhibitory avoidance and spatial discrimination on the Morris water maze. The slope of the extracellular excitatory postsynaptic field potential was recorded from CA3-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. Low frequency stimulation (LFS) induced a modest LTD only in aged animals under standard recording conditions. The decrease in synaptic transmission examined only in aged animals correlated with memory scores on the spatial task and LTD was not observed in aged animals with the highest memory scores. LTD induction was facilitated by increasing the Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) ratio of the recording medium or employing a paired-pulse stimulation paradigm. Age differences disappeared when LFS was delivered under conditions of elevated Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) in the recording medium. Using multiple induction episodes under conditions which facilitate LTD-induction, no age-related difference was observed in the maximum level of LTD. The results indicate that the increased susceptibility to LTD induction is associated with impaired memory and results from a shift in the induction process. The possible relationship between LTD and memory function is discussed.
