In order to improve diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), candidate biological markers in CSF as well as structural and functional imaging were investigated. Biomarkers are clearly needed to support detection of incipient AD in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). To date the most promising core candidate markers are total and hyperphosphorylated tau protein and amyloid beta peptides in the CSF, as well as hippocampus and whole brain volumetry using MRI. None of the candidates has been finally validated and established for clinical routine so far. International controlled multicenter cooperative studies are ongoing to further develop these core diagnostic marker candidates (phase III). The core markers are reviewed in detail. Promising novel approaches are discussed.
