The proto-oncogene bcl-2 can rescue cells from apoptosis and necrosis and its mechanism of action may involve antioxidant activity. The possible involvement of free radicals necrotic cell death induced by the neuroleptic drug haloperidol has led us to investigate the potential protective effect of Bcl-2 against haloperidol toxicity. We found that clonal mouse hippocampal cells stably transfected with the antioxidant Bcl-2 are protected against haloperidol toxicity. This data strongly supports the causative involvement of free radicals in haloperidol toxicity.
