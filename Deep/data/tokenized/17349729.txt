The main impacts of insulin favor the peripheral organs. Although it functions as a neuropeptide, insulin possesses also some central effects. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of intrahippocampal infusion of insulin on passive avoidance learning in healthy male rats. Thirty male wistar rats were divided into three groups (n=10 each). The experimental group had posttraining insulin infusion into the CA1 region of dorsal hippocampus, after which they were compared with sham (saline) and control (intact) groups. Insulin treated animals had greater latency to enter the dark compartment in compare with saline treated (p=0.023) or control groups (p=0.017). Upon our results, we concluded that intrahippocampal injections of insulin may enhance memory for a simple learning task which supports the concept that insulin possibly plays an endogenous role in memory formation.
