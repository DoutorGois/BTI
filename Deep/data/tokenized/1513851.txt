Amphetamine with appropriate motor experience has been found to facilitate the recovery of motor function after several different types of brain injuries. We investigated whether amphetamine would hasten the recovery of spatial mapping ability in gerbils previously subjected to a 3-min episode of forebrain ischemia. Amphetamine did not promote behavioral recovery, nor did it attenuate ischemic cell damage of hippocampal CA1 neurons. The beneficial effects of amphetamine after brain injury may be limited to restoration of sensorimotor ability and not to cognitive functions such as memory.
