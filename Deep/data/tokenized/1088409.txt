Pyrasidol (1,10-trimethylene-8-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrasino/1,2-q/indol hydrochloride) produces an activating influence on the EEG of the brain cortex, the reticular formation of the mesencephalon and hippocampus. It potentiates the electroencephalographic effects of amphetamine, 1-DOPA and 5-oxytryptophan, displays no central cholinolytic activity and has no influence on the electrophysiological effects of anticholinesterase and cholinomimetic agents.
