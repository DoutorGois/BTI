Unilateral lesions of rat entorhinal cortex produce a transitory performance deficit on spatial learning tasks, such as reinforced alternation in a T-maze. Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA), a cholinesterase inhibitor, was administered to determine its effects on behavioral recovery using a reinforced alternation task in a T-maze. Rate of recovery after unilateral entorhinal lesion was not affected by a low dose of THA (0.05 mg/kg), while a higher dose (5.0 mg/kg) impaired recovery. Behavioral recovery was subsequently evaluated in the same rats following lesions to the contralateral entorhinal cortex. Serial bilateral lesions of the entorhinal cortex are known to produce a prolonged performance deficit on the alternation task. The 0.05 mg/kg THA group exhibited an intermediate rate of recovery, between the undamaged control group and bilateral lesion-saline injected groups. The group receiving 5.0 mg/kg of THA after bilateral lesion did not differ from the bilateral lesion-saline group. The failure of THA to significantly improve functional recovery in rats with lesions of the entorhinal cortex indicates that the compound may have limited applicability in treating human neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
