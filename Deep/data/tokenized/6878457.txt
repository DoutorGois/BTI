The possible involvement of cerebral DNA synthesis in the learning process was examined in rats injected intracerebrally with 3H thymidine. During the period of incorporation (4.5 hr) one rat was trained to an active avoidance task while a second animal was kept in the same experimental room. In comparison with control rats paired to learning animals, the concentration of PCA-soluble radioactivity and of radioactive DNA of the cerebral cortex increased in all animal groups, i.e., control rats paired to non-learning animals, learning rats and non-learning rats. No change occurred in liver. In the cerebral cortex the slope of the regression line obtained by plotting the concentration of radioactive DNA versus the concentration of PCA-soluble radioactivity was lower in learning rats than in the group of pooled control animals. A comparable effect was noted in the hippocampus. In non-learning animals a similar decrease was present in the cerebral cortex and in cerebellum. In addition, it was found that in learning animals the percent incorporation was inversely related to the total number of avoidances only in the cerebral cortex. In non-learning rats a similar inverse relationship was present in the cerebral cortex and in cerebellum. In the former region the regression line of learning rats was shifted upwards in comparison with the regression line of non-learning animals. These results are interpreted to indicate that the incorporation of 3H-thymidine into cerebral DNA is directly related to the level of stress and is increased by learning.
