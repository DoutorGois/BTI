Effect of the long-term treatment with a Dan-Shen (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix) methanol extract (DME) or its major ingredient lithospermate B (LSB) on memory and learning in scenescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) was investigated by means of Morris's water maze task. DME or LSB treatment significantly decreased the escape latency in the P8 strain of SAM (SAMP8), which strain spontaneously develops learning deficits. These results suggest that DME and LSB treatment improved spacial learning. Neurochemical investigations indicated that both drugs did not affect the cholinergic system, but enhanced functions of the glutamate-PKC system in hippocampus, since the increases in [3H]MK-801 ((+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,b]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate) binding in cortex and [3H]PDBu (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) binding in hippocampus were observed in DME and LSB treatments. Our previous studies indicate the decrease in PDBu binding and NMDA receptor-mediated functions in SAMP8 brain. Thus, it is suggested that 1) Methanol extract of Dan-Shen is effective for prevention of spacial learning deficit caused with aging, 2) lithospermate B is one of the active ingredients, 3) SAMP8 is useful model animal to investigate drugs for anti-aging or anti-dementia.
