The present paper reports the clinical and neuropathological findings in two cats with a neuropathologically confirmed diagnosis of necrosis of the hippocampus and piriform lobe. The cats were presented because of acute onset of behavioural changes and complex partial seizures. The neurological examination suggested a forebrain lesion. The results of blood examination were within the normal range, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and computed tomography (CT) scan in one cat did not show any abnormality. Despite therapy with diazepam (Valium; Roche) there was deterioration of the clinical signs and the cats were euthanased. The neuropathological examination revealed hippocampal necrosis that included the piriform lobe.
