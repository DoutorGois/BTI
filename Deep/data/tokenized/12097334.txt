Neurotrophins support neuronal survival and differentiation via Trk receptors, yet can also induce cell death via the p75 receptor. In these studies, we investigated signaling mechanisms governing p75-mediated death of hippocampal neurons, specifically the role of caspases. Although p75 is structurally a member of the Fas/TNFR1 receptor family, caspase-8 was not required for p75-mediated death, unlike other members of this receptor family. In contrast, p75-mediated neuronal death was associated with mitochondrial loss of cytochrome c and required Apaf-1 and caspase-9, -6, and -3. In particular, caspase-6 plays a central role in mediating neurotrophin-induced death, illuminating a novel role for this caspase. Inhibition of DIABLO/Smac, which blocks inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, protected cells from death, whereas simultaneous inhibition of both DIABLO/Smac and MIAP3 allowed trophin-induced death to proceed. In vivo, pilocarpine-induced seizures, previously shown to up-regulate p75 expression and increase neurotrophin production, caused activation of caspase-6 and -3 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in p75-expressing hippocampal neurons. In p75(-/-) mice, no activated caspase-3 was detected, and there was a marked reduction in the number of dying neurons after pilocarpine treatment compared with wild type mice. Neurotrophin-induced p75-mediated death is likely to play an important role in mediating neuronal loss consequent to brain injury.
