Learning and memory are the most important executive functions performed by the human brain, the loss of which is a prominent feature in dementia. Gladiolus dalenii is traditionally used to treat a number of illnesses such as epilepsy and schizophrenia in Cameroon. This study aims to investigate the anti-amnesia effect of Gladiolus dalenii in scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats and its possible antioxidant properties in this model. Morris water maze, novel object location and recognition tasks were used to assess spatial and working memory. Male rats were treated for 12 days with saline, G. dalenii or Tacrine. Experimental animals were co-treated with scopolamine once daily from day 9 to 12. Acetylcholinesterase activity was measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Malondialdehyde and glutathione levels were measured in the hippocampus. G. dalenii reversed memory impairment induced by scopolamine in the Morris water maze, novel object location and recognition tasks. It decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It also decreased the level of malondialdehyde and increased the level of glutathione in the hippocampus. The results of this study show that G. dalenii ameliorates the cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine, through inhibition of oxidative stress and enhancement of cholinergic neurotransmission. It can therefore be useful for treatment of conditions associated with memory dysfunction as seen in dementia.
