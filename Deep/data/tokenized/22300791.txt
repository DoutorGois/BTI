We evaluated the effect of brain ischemic post-conditioning on cell apoptosis in the hippocampus following global brain ischemia in rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (n=15/group): sham operation, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and ischemic post-conditioning (I PostC). Global brain ischemia was induced by four-vessel occlusion. Ischemic post-conditioning consisted of six cycles of 10s/10s reperfusion/reocclusion at the onset of reperfusion. All rats were sacrificed 24 hours or 72 hours after reperfusion. The hippocampal CA1 regions were analysed using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labelling (Tunel) staining technique for determining cell apoptosis. Levels of caspase-3 and Bcl-2 were measured by Western blotting. After 72 hours, fewer Tunel-positive brain cells were observed in rats from the I PostC group than in rats from the I/R group (10.3 +/- 2.7% versus 40.8 +/- 6.2%, p<0.01). After reperfusion at 24 hours and 72 hours, expression of caspase-3 in the I PostC group was significantly decreased (p<0.01) and expression of Bcl-2 in the I PostC group was significantly increased (p<0.01) compared with the I/R group. We conclude that down-regulation of caspase-3 and up-regulation of Bcl-2 by ischemic post-conditioning may underlie the protective effects of post-conditioning.
