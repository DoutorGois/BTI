Peculiarities of natural behavior in unanesthesired Wistar strain rats, and their electrogram patterns under the liquor brainstem electrical stimulation were in the focus of present study. Analysis of the electrogram specters of somatosensory and auditory areas of the cortex, hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, lateral periaqueductal gray and fastigial cerebellar nucleus revealed authentic increasing of teta-waves most significantly during slow-wave sleep period under the electrostimulation. The increasing of complete wakefulness-sleep cycles was found after multiple (15-20 per hour) stimulations. Possible homeostatic effect of the liquor brainstem electrical stimulation on somnogenic mechanisms are discussed.
