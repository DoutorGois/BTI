Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can regulate the survival and differentiation of certain neurons and glial cells in culture. To determine the role of this cytokine in the central nervous system in vivo, we examined the brains of young and adult mice in which the LIF gene was disrupted. Immunohistochemical staining of neurons for choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin, parvalbumin, calbindin, neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and calcitonin gene-related peptide revealed no significant differences between null mutant and wild-type (WT) brains. In contrast, analysis of glial phenotypes demonstrated striking deficits in the LIF-knockout brain. Staining with several anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies showed that the number of GFAP-positive cells in various regions of the hippocampus in the female mutant is much lower than in the WT. The null male hippocampus also displays a significant, though less marked deficit. The number of astrocytes in the mutant hippocampus, as determined by S-100 staining, is not, however, significantly different from WT. In addition, quantification of immunohistochemical staining of female, but not male, mutants reveals a significant deficit in myelin basic protein content in three brain regions, suggesting alterations in oligodendrocytes as well. Thus, while overall brain histology appears normal, the absence of LIF in vivo leads to specific, sexually dimorphic alterations in glial phenotype.
