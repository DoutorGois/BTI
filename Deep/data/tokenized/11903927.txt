Hippocampal deafferentation has been proposed as a pathogenetic mechanism for neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in human mesolimbocortical dementia. We previously developed a rodent model of hippocampal deafferentation involving bilateral destructive lesions of the ventrotegmental area (VTA), septum of the medial forebrain and entorhinal cortex combined with pharmacological inhibition of serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D1 receptors. Unexpectedly, we observed an alteration in phosphorylated neurofilament protein immunoreactivity and argyrophilia in magnocellular neurones of the red nucleus. Here, we determined the neuroanatomical, pharmacological and temporal requirements for this effect on red nucleus neurones. We found that abnormal phosphorylation and argyrophilia were critically dependent on bilateral destruction of the VTA and antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors. Although extensive neurofilament hyperphosphorylation and argyrophilia were observed in red nucleus magnocellular neurones within nine days of treatment, no NFTs were formed and these effects were transitory. Resolution of these cytoskeletal abnormalities was accompanied by increased expression of the calcium binding protein, parvalbumin, suggesting that alterations in intraneuronal calcium levels may modify the deafferentation response.
