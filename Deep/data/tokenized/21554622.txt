The gonadal steroids estradiol and progesterone have previously been shown to modulate the specific binding of the GABA(A) agonist, [(3) H]muscimol, in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and the midbrain central gray of ovariectomized female rats. In this report we show a sex difference in the level of binding in the very caudal ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. In contrast to females, there is no steroid modulation of [(3) H]muscimol binding in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus and midbrain central gray of males. These effects may be functionally related to GABAergic control of female sexual behavior. In contrast, steroid modulation of [(3) H]muscimol binding in the CA1 region of the hippocampus occurred to the same degree in males and females, and there was no difference in the level of binding in any region of the hippocampus between gonadectomized males and females. Incubation of brain slices with progesterone or its metabolite 5alpha-3alpha-pregnanolone dissolved in ethanol, produced a significant increase in [(3) H]muscimol binding in most brain regions as compared to control brain slices treated with ethanol alone. Moreover, there was also a marked increase in [(3) H]muscimol binding in all brain areas in the control condition which contained 100 mM ethanol, as compared to brain slices not preincubated with ethanol. The increase in binding after in vitro treatment with either progesterone or 5alpha-3alpha-pregnanolone is notably different from that seen after progesterone given in vivo 4 h prior to assay in that it is not site-specific, does not depend on prior treatment with estradiol and shows no sex difference. These results suggest different mechanisms for progesterone effects on the GABA(A) receptor when administered in vivo as compared to in vitro.
