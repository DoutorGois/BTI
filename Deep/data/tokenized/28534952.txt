Ovariectomy (OVX) is a method used to block estrogen in female rats that induces hippocampal dysfunction and affects brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathways. The majority of previous studies investigating OVX focused on BDNF expression in the hippocampus and cognitive function. The present study focused on the pathways of each BDNF type, precursor (proBDNF) and mature (mBDNF), and the effects of regular exercise in the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats. Female SpragueDawely rats were used and OVX surgery was performed. After 1 week of recovery from surgery, two groups of rats that received OVX surgery were subjected to regular treadmill exercise for 8 weeks. The results of protein levels by western blotting indicated that the expression of proBDNF, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and cJun Nterminal protein kinase (JNK) was increased, and mBDNF, tropomyosinrelated kinase B (TrkB) and nuclear factorkappaB expression was significantly reduced in the OVX control group compared with the sham control group SC (P<0.05). Thus, the survival pathway by mBDNF was impaired and the proapoptotic response was activated by increased JNK expression due to proBDNFp75NTR binding in the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats. By contrast, exercise reduced activation of the proapoptotic response and increased mBDNFTrkB expression in the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats. Thus, regular exercise may increase the activation of survival pathways via mBDNF and reducing the activation of the proapoptotic pathway of proBDNF in the hippocampus of ovariectomized rats.
