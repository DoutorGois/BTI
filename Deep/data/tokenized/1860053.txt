Using immunohistochemical techniques, a study was conducted to determine whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is generated as one of the 'self-repair' responses in rat brain following transient forebrain ischemia. In normal brain, slight bFGF-like immunoreactivity was observed. However, in rats exposed to 20 min of forebrain ischemia, intense bFGF-like immunoreactivity was observed in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus and the caudate putamen, and marked activity was evident in the temporal cortex, corpus callosum and the CA4 subfield of the hippocampus. Marked neuronal degeneration was also observed in these brain regions following forebrain ischemia. These results suggest that induction of bFGF-like immunoreactivity may be related to the healing which follows brain ischemia.
