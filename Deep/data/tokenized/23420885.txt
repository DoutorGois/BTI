The C/EBP beta is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates a variety of biological processes, including metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation, and immune response. Recent findings show that C/EBP beta-induced inflammatory responses mediate kainic acid-triggered excitotoxic brain injury. In this article, we show that protein kinase C zeta enhances K-ras expression and subsequently activates the Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in the hippocampus of domoic acid (DA)-treated mice, which promotes C/EBP beta expression and induces inflammatory responses. Elevated production of TNF-alpha impairs mitochondrial function and increases the levels of reactive oxygen species by IkappaB kinase beta/NF-kappaB signaling. The aforementioned inflammation and oxidative stress lead to memory deficits in DA-treated mice. However, troxerutin inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 1 expression, enhances type 1 protein phosphatase alpha dephosphorylation, and abolishes MEK/ERK1/2/C/EBP beta activation, which subsequently reverses the memory impairment observed in the DA-treated mice. Thus, troxerutin is recommended as a potential candidate for the prevention and therapeutic treatment of cognitive deficits resulting from excitotoxic brain damage and other brain disorders.
