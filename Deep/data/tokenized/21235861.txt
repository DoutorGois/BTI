Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is a key determinant of blood pressure homeostasis and platelet aggregation and is synthesized by the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In the vascular wall, eNOS is activated by diverse cell-surface receptors and by increases in blood flow, and the consequent generation of NO leads to vascular smooth-muscle relaxation. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation is deranged in a variety of disease states, including hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, but the roles of eNOS in endothelial dysfunction remain to be clearly defined. The past several years have witnessed important advances in understanding the molecular and cellular biology of eNOS regulation. In endothelial cells, eNOS undergoes a complex series of covalent modifications, including myristoylation, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation. Palmitoylation of eNOS dynamically targets the enzyme to distinct domains of the endothelial plasma membrane termed caveolae; caveolae may serve as sites for the sequestration of signal-transducing proteins and are themselves subject to dynamic regulation by ligands and lipids. Originally thought to be expressed only in endothelial cells, eNOS is now known to be expressed in a variety of tissues, including blood platelets, cardiac myocytes, and brain hippocampus. Paradigms established in endothelial cells for the molecular regulation and subcellular targeting of eNOS are being extended to the investigation of eNOS expressed in nonendothelial tissues. This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the molecular regulation of eNOS and the other NOS isoforms and identifies important parallels between eNOS and other cell-signaling molecules.
