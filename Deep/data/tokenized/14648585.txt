During memory consolidation neuroplastic events in the mediotemporal corticohippocampal pathway are accompanied by transient increases in the frequency of neurons expressing polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM PSA), a posttranslational modification associated with morphofunctional change. As a bidirectional pathway between the hippocampus and the septal nuclei also influences memory processing, we have determined the distribution of NCAM PSA within this system before and after learning in the adult Wistar rat. The most intense NCAM PSA immunoreactivity was observed in the medial and triangular septal nuclei, regions that regulate hippocampal theta rhythm during memory consolidation. Within the fimbria, NCAM PSA was expressed only in a subpopulation of fibres, most likely cholinergic projections from the medial septum to the hippocampus. Grey level analysis or direct cell counting revealed no learning-specific change in NCAM PSA expression in these septal subregions after avoidance conditioning or spatial training. A population of discrete polysialylated neurons in the subtriangular septal zone, however, exhibited a transient twofold frequency increase at 12 hr after training in either task. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed these cells to be gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic) interneurons co-expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide. The unique location of these interneurons is proposed to provide a natural plexus by which bidirectional communication between the septum and hippocampus may be modified during memory consolidation.
