Intracellular recordings from pyramidal neurones during microiontophoretic ejection of N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate into the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice showed that both amino acids caused depolarization and evoked spike activity. Whereas quisqualate evoked tetrodotoxin-sensitive spikes, those produced by N-methyl-D-aspartate consisted of bursts of tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials superimposed on an underlying depolarizing shift of membrane potential. Both membrane depolarization and the superimposed depolarizing shifts associated with N-methyl-D-aspartate excitation were selectively and reversibly antagonized by the D(-) isomer of 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and Co2+. Both amino acids caused an increase in membrane conductance when small ejection currents were used, and the depolarizing response to these compounds was prevented by current injection. However, only the increase by N-methyl-D-aspartate was blocked by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and Co2+. These results provide evidence to support the suggestion that different mechanisms underlie the excitatory response to N-methyl-D-aspartate and quisqualate in CA1 pyramidal neurones.
