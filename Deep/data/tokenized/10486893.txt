It was shown by means of in vivo microdialysis combined with HPLC/EC analysis that the exocytotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation impaired the emotional conditioning and led to additional glutamate release in the n. accumbens during acquisition and performance of the conditioned response. Thus, it was shown that the disruption of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the n. accumbens results in a compensatory increase in the volume glutamatergic transmission in this structure.
