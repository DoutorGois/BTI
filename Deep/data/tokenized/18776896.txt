Several synaptic depression mechanisms have been described for the hippocampus, cerebellum and neocortex in vitro, but little is known about which, if any, are engaged during experience-dependent depression (EDD). We found that EDD in the mouse barrel cortex depends on the AMPA subunit GluR1 in layers II/III and IV, but not in layer V, and that long-term depression is also GluR1 dependent in the IV-II/III, but not II/III-V, pathway.
