[3H](3MeHis2)TRH binding was examined in the septal nucleus of rats given brain lesions which destroyed specific neuronal elements within the septum. Kainic acid injected directly into the septum caused a 35% decrease in receptor binding. All other lesions did not significantly alter receptor binding. These data suggest that the septal TRH receptors are located on kainic acid-sensitive cell bodies.
