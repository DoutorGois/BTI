Phoneutria nigriventer spider venom (PNV) contains Ca(2+), K(+) and Na(+) channel-acting peptides that affect neurotransmitter release and causes excitotoxicity in PNS and CNS. It has been demonstrated that PNV causes blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown of hippocampal microvessels time-dependently through enhanced microtubule-mediated vesicular transport. Herein, it is hypothesized that PNV can cause BBB breakdown in the hippocampus and cerebellum time-dependently through other molecular mechanisms. The BBB integrity was assessed through the analysis of expression of Poly-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter protein, laminin from basement membrane and endothelial tight junctional and adhesion junctional (TJ/AJ) proteins. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) expression, which are known to have a role in the phosphorylation of junctional proteins and BBB opening, were also investigated. Astrocytes P-gp activity was determined by flow cytometry. The study demonstrated temporary decreased expression of laminin, TJ and AJ proteins (ZO1//occludin//claudin-5//beta-catenin) and P-gp (more prominently in hippocampus), which was completely or partially resolved between 2 and 5 h (and more quickly for cerebellum). PNV inhibited P-gp activity in astrocytes. PP2A phosphorylation, which inhibits the enzyme activity, was increased in both regions (15-45 min); however the phosphorylation level returned to baseline after 2 h. In conclusion, PNV disrupts paracellular transport in the BBB and possesses substrates for the active P-gp efflux transporter located in the BBB complex. Further studies into cellular mechanisms of astrocyte/endothelial interactions, using PNV as tool, may identify how astrocytes regulate the BBB, a characteristic that may be useful for the temporary opening of the BBB.
