Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a neuropeptide occurring in the brain of all vertebrate species. In chromatophores of teleost fishes it induces pigment granule aggregation. In mammals, however, its physiological function is not yet clear. Attempts to identify the site(s) of its action by binding analysis failed because radioiodinated MCH with the natural sequence was devoid of biological activity. We have now synthesized an analogue of rat/human MCH, [Pra4,8,12,19]-MCH, containing four L-propargylglycine (Pra) residues in positions 4, 8, 12, and 19 for catalytic tritiation to norvaline ([3H4]Nva) residues, each of which containing four tritium atoms. The resulting [3H]-MCH ([(3H4)Nva4,8,12,19]-MCH) had a specific radioactivity of approx. 12,200 GBq/mmol (330 Ci/mmol) and retained a biological activity of 10% as compared to rat/human MCH when tested in the carp scale assay. A series of qualitative binding studies performed with rat crude membranes from brain and peripheal tissues as well as with rat brain synaptosomes using the [3H]-MCH radioligand provided the first evidence for the presence of MCH receptors in mammalian tissues. The data showed that specific binding is present in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and in the adrenal gland while none was detected in the brain cortex or spleen. Owing to the tendency of [3H]-MCH to non-specific binding to tissue, glass and plastic surfaces, a saturation binding analysis with this radioligand was not possible.
