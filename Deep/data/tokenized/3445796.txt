The effect of chronic GMl ganglioside administration (30 mg/kg, daily) for 6, 21, 42 and 90 days on the activity of choline acetyltransferase was investigated in the hippocampus of rats with partial electrolytic lesions of the dorsal hippocampal afferents and in unoperated rats. No influence of GM1 administration on ChAT activity was noted in unoperated animals. The lesions caused denervation in the hippocampus, which occurred with varying intensity along its dorsoventral axis, as shown by the gradual pattern of decrease in ChAT activity. GM1 counteracted the decline in enzyme activity, however the intensity of this influence diminished with the time after surgery. A positive correlation between the GM1 effectiveness and the degree of denervation at early postsurgical stages (6, 21 days) was found, which may be ascribed to the appearance of neuronotrophic factors at this period, proportional to the severity of damage. We suggest that the decline of the GM1 effectiveness is due to a decrease in trophic activity, and/or the development of spontaneous recovery
