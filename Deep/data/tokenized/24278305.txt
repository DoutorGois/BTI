Recent genetic analyses have implicated several candidate susceptibility variants for schizophrenia. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7294919 is likely a schizophrenia-susceptibility variant according to its significant association with hippocampal volume, hippocampus function, and cognitive performance as well as the nominal association with schizophrenia. However, all previous analyses were conducted only in Europeans, and whether rs7294919 is associated with schizophrenia in other populations are yet to be tested. Here, we conducted a case-control analysis of rs7294919 with schizophrenia in six independent Chinese (N = 3) and Japanese (N = 3) samples, including a total of 7,352 cases and 10,824 controls. The results of our association analysis were not able to confirm the association of rs7294919 with schizophrenia (p = 0.51 in total samples, odds ratio = 1.02 for allele[C]). The absence of rs7294919's association in Chinese and Japanese suggest a potential genetic heterogeneity in the susceptibility of schizophrenia on this locus and also demonstrate the difficulties in replicating associations of schizophrenia across different ethnic populations.
