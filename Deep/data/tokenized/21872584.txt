The present paper is to examine whether liquiritigenin is able to attenuate the Alzheimer's-like learning and memory deficits in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model that over-expresses amyloid protein precursor (APP), and explores the underlying mechanisms. Consistent with our previous observations, we found that treatment with liquiritigenin improved the behavioral performance of Tg mice and it attenuated the protein expression of oligomeric form of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta). Furthermore, treatment with liquiritigenin inhibited astrocytosis in the hippocampus, and it may through its inhibitory activities on Notch-2, an important molecular regulating neural proliferation and differentiation. These findings provide evidence for beneficial activity of liquiritigenin in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and support the continued investigation of Notch signaling pathway as a target for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
