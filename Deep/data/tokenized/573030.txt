Parietoectomized dogs (n = 8), like intact ones (n = 102), are able to extrapolate the direction of the movement of an alimentary stimulus when presented with a complex task variant. In this they differ from animals with a prefrontal lobectomy (n = 10) in which, according to the authors' previous data (1971), the ability to elementary rational activity in Krushinsky extrapolation test (1977), is impaired.
