This study investigated the effects of chronic homocysteine administration on some parameters of inflammation, such as cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6), chemokine CCL(2) (MCP-1), nitrite and prostaglandin E(2) levels, as well as on immunocontent of NF-kappaB/p65 subunit in hippocampus and/or serum of rats. Since acetylcholinesterase has been associated with inflammation, we also evaluated the effect of homocysteine on this enzyme activity in hippocampus of rats. Wistar rats received daily subcutaneous injections of homocysteine (0.3-0.6 mumol/g body weight) or saline (control) from the 6th to the 28th days-of-age. One or 12 h after the last injection, rats were euthanized and hippocampus and serum were used. Results showed that chronic hyperhomocysteinemia significantly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6), chemokine CCL(2) (MCP-1) and prostaglandin E(2) in hippocampus and serum of rats at 1 and 12 h after the last injection of homocysteine. Nitrite levels increased in hippocampus, but decreased in serum at 1 h after chronic hyperhomocysteinemia. Acetylcholinesterase activity and immunocontent of citoplasmic and nuclear NF-kappaB/p65 subunit were increased in hippocampus of rats subjected to hyperhomocysteinemia at 1 h, but did not alter at 12 h after the last injection of homocysteine. According to our results, chronic hyperhomocysteinemia increases inflammatory parameters, suggesting that this process might be associated, at least in part, with the cerebrovascular and vascular dysfunctions characteristic of some homocystinuric patients.
