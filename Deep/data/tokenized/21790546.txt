PURPOSE: To characterize seizure outcomes following temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery in patients with normal preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: We reviewed adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy and normal MRI who underwent TLE surgery (1996-2009). Seizure outcomes were analyzed using survival and multivariate regression with Cox proportional hazard modeling. Two analyses were performed using two favorable outcome definitions: complete seizure freedom and Engel classification. KEY FINDINGS: Sixty-four patients were analyzed (mean follow-up 4.1 years; range 1-14.5 years). Most had a standard anterior temporal lobectomy (84%) and unremarkable pathology (45%). At 1 year, the chance of complete seizure freedom was 76% [95% confidence interval (CI) 71-81%] comparable to an 81% (95% CI 76-86%) chance of Engel score of 1. With longer follow-up, a progressively broadening significant discrepancy between the two outcome measures was observed. The chance of complete seizure freedom was 66% (95% CI 61-71%) at 2 years, and 47% (95% CI 40-54%) at 7 years and beyond, whereas the respective chances of achieving an Engel 1 classification were 76% (95% CI 70-82%), and 69% (95% CI 63-75%) at similar time points. Seizure outcome as defined by either measure was worse in patients with higher baseline seizure frequency (adjusted risk-ratio 2.7 when >12 seizures/month; p = 0.01) and with preoperative generalized tonic-clonic seizures (adjusted risk ratio 10.8; p = 0.0006). Memory measures declined with dominant hippocampus resections. SIGNIFICANCE: A normal MRI should not prevent presurgical evaluations in patients with suspected TLE, as favorable long-term postoperative seizure outcomes are possible. Proposed mechanisms of epileptogenicity and seizure recurrence in this group are discussed.
