The hippocampus is a region of the brain that serves several functions. The dopaminergic system acts through D1- and D2-like receptors to interfere in pain modulation and the opioid receptors play major roles in analgesic processes and there are obvious overlaps between these two systems. The present study investigated the interaction between the opioidergic and dopaminergic systems in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) region for formalin-induced orofacial pain. Two guide cannulae were stereotaxically implanted in the CA1 region and morphine (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mug/0.5 mul saline) and naloxone (0.3, 1 and 3 mug/0.5 mul saline) were used as the opioid receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively. SKF-38393 (1 mug/0.5 mul saline) was used as a D1-like receptor agonist, quinpirole (2 mug/0.5 mul saline) as a D2-like receptor agonist, SCH-23390 (0.5 mug/0.5 mul saline) as a D1-like receptor antagonist and sulpiride (3 mug/0.5 mul DMSO) as a D2-like receptor antagonist. To induce orofacial pain, 50 mul of 1% formalin was subcutaneously injected into the left side of the upper lip. Our results showed that different doses of morphine significantly reduced orofacial pain in both phases induced by formalin. Naloxone (1 and 3 mug) reversed morphine induced analgesia in CA1. SKF-38393 and quinpirole with naloxone (1 mug) significantly decreased formalin-induced orofacial pain in both phases. SCH-23390 had no effect on the antinociceptive response of morphine in both phases of orofacial pain. Sulpiride reversed the antinociceptive effects of morphine only in the first phase, but this result was not significant. Our findings suggest that there is cross-talk between the opioidergic and dopaminergic systems. Opioidergic neurons also exerted antinociceptive effects by modulation of the dopaminergic system in the CA1 region of the brain.
