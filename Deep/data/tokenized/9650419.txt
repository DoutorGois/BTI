Jean Piaget's "stage theory" suggests that cognitive development proceeds in discrete steps, among which the first is the sensorimotor period that occupies the first two years. In recent years it became clear that an intact and mature hippocampus is necessary for memory formation both in experimental animals and in human. In the present experiments the perinatal morphological development of the human hippocampus was studied to describe structural changes that may correlate with the developmental changes of intellectual growth. Our results suggest that cell formation in the human hippocampus terminates several weeks before birth, but immature cells migrate to their final positions through the first six postnatal months. The newborn hippocampus contains all cell types and cell layers that are characteristic for the adult hippocampus. However, changes of the light microscopic features of the postsynaptic target neurons of hippocampal granule cells indicate that connections between granule cells and their target neurons are immature at birth and develop through an extended period of time that may last for three years. Since this neuronal connection is the first link in the chain of the main hippocampal synaptic circuitry, it may be suggested that human hippocampus is functionally impaired at birth. This period of light microscopic morphological maturation correlates well with the time period of Piaget's first stage of cognitive development. It can also be suggested that the prolonged postnatal development of some neuronal circuitries in the human hippocampus may be responsible for the psychological phenomenon of "infantile amnesia", that is the lack of memory traces from the early postnatal period.
