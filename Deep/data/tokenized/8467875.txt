The effects of the 21-aminosteroids, U-74500A and U-78517F (drugs endowed with lipid peroxidation inhibitor properties) were tested on hypoxia-induced functional failure in rat hippocampal slices. For comparison, the effects of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, dizocilpine (MK-801) were studied. Perfusion of slices with 50 microM of MK-801 or with 50-100 microM of U-78517F, but not with 100-200 microM of U-74500A, significantly (P < 0.01) increased the incidence of reappearance of the CA1 population spikes after reoxygenation in rat hippocampal slices subjected to a 45-min hypoxic period followed by a 45-min reoxygenation period. Perfusion of slices with 12.5 microM of MK-801 plus 12.5 microM of U-78517F significantly (P < 0.05) increased the incidence of reappearance of the CA1 population spikes after reoxygenation with respect to perfusion of slices with 12.5 microM of U-78517F alone or with 12.5 microM of MK-801 alone. The results show that 21-aminosteroids have protective effects against hypoxia-induced functional failure in rat hippocampal slices. In addition, the data show that, under the same experimental conditions, the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, was also able to improve hypoxia-induced functional failure. On the whole, the results suggest that the hypoxia-induced functional electrical failure might depend on both release of excitatory amino acids and oxygen free-radical-mediated membrane lipid peroxidation.
