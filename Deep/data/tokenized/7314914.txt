EEG-correlates of completed functional brain reorganization following its lesion were studied on six adult cats. Performance by the cats of a conditioned delayed food reflex restored after a bilateral ablation of the temporal cortical areas, was attended with the statistically significant changes in both temporal and spatial patterns of probability of appearance of single EEG-oscillations for all the studied frequency ranges: 2.0-4.5; 4.5-7.5; 7.5-10.5; 10.5-14.0 c/s. Reorganization of brain activity was characterized by a vast involvement of all the studied brain structures and areas: the frontal, parietal, occipital cortex, the ventral and dorsal hippocampus, the caudate nucleus head, the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus and hypothalamic lateral area.
