Changes in amino acid concentrations were investigated in selected regions of rat brain prior to the onset and during the course of epileptiform seizures induced by L-homocysteine. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) decreased preictally in substantia nigra (-18%), caudate putamen (-26%), and inferior colliculus (-46%). After seizure onset, the GABA content was further reduced in substantia nigra (-31%) and additionally in hippocampus (-18%). Preictal taurine levels were elevated in globus pallidus (+26%) and caudate putamen (+13%) but returned to normal after seizure onset. However, in hippocampus, taurine decreased both preictally (-22%) and after seizure onset (-56%). Glycine was reduced preictally only in globus pallidus (-13%). After seizure onset the direction of its concentration change varied in the brain regions studied. Glutamate levels decreased preictally in hippocampus (-10%) and hypothalamus (-46%) but increased in globus pallidus (+14%). Normal levels were detectable after seizure onset in hypothalamus and globus pallidus but a further reduction in hippocampus (-59%) and significant reductions in substantia nigra (-15%) and caudate putamen (-17%) were detected. Aspartate was elevated in hippocampus, both preictally (+49%) and after seizure onset (+21%) while at the same phases in globus pallidus a consistent reduction (-30%) was observed. The glutamine content increased preictally in globus pallidus (+41%) and hypothalamus (+36%), and in all brain areas during the ictal phase of seizure, the hippocampus exhibiting a dramatic increase (approximately 300%). The contents of serine and alanine were altered in most regions studied only after seizure onset, with the exception of the hippocampus, where a decrease (-41%) of serine was observed preictally.
