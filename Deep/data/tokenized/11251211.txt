It has been suggested that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and prostaglandin play a role in epilepsy. We studied the expression of COX-2 in the hippocampus and the effect of oral administration of indomethacin, a COX inhibitor, on seizure activity in genetically seizure-susceptible El mice. COX-2 protein significantly increased in the hippocampi of El mice after epileptic seizure. Indomethacin did shorten the duration from seizure onset to full recovery in El mice although the threshold and the duration of seizure were not changed.
