Levetiracetam (LEV, 2S-(oxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)butanamide, Keppra, UCB Pharma) is a new anti-epileptic drug used to treat certain types of seizures in epilepsy patients. However, the pharmacodynamics of LEV is still controversial. Recently, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) has been reported to involve in epileptic phenomena. Therefore, we investigated the effects of LEV on IL-1 beta system in the hippocampus and piriform cortex of chronic epileptic rats. As compared to controls, typical reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis were observed in the hippocampus and piriform cortex of epileptic animals. In addition, both reactive astrocytes and reactive microglia showed strong IL-1 beta and interleukin-1 receptor subtype 1 (IL-1R1) immunoreactivities. LEV reduced reactive gliosis and expression levels of IL-1 beta system in the hippocampus and the piriform cortex, while valproic acid did not. These findings suggest that the LEV may have, at least in part, anti-inflammatory effect, particularly against IL-1 beta system in neuroglia within epileptic brains.
