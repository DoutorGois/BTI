It was found that the cholinergic component of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) is involved in the generation of theta rhythm in the hippocampus. However, it is still not known how important PPN is in the brainstem theta-generating system, where the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis is regarded as a primary generator. In the present experiment, performed on urethane-anesthetized rats, we studied the effect on the tail pinch-elicited hippocampal theta of unilateral inactivation of PPN by means of direct procaine microinjection. Procaine induced ipsilateral suppression of theta rhythm, manifested as desynchronization of hippocampal EEG, a shift of the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) power peak toward lower frequencies, and a reduction of FFT peak magnitude at theta band. Hippocampal field activity returned to normal (both its FFT peak frequency and magnitude) within 30 min after the injection. The results obtained indicate that PPN is critical for hippocampal theta generation but it may not be involved in encoding theta frequency.
