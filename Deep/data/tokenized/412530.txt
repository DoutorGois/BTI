Nervous fiber bundles formed between the explants during the organotypic cocultivation of the hippocampus and mamillary nuclei of the newborn mouse. Some of the fibers within these bundles were the continuation of axons localized in the alveus of the Ammon's horn. It is suggested that under conditions of cultivation the hippocampal pyramidal neurons deprived of the afferent leads-in from other brain structures are capable of forming the projection efferent connections typical of the intact hippocampus neurons.
