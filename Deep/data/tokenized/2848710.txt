Nerve growth factor (NGF) is well known to be involved in the development, survival, and maintenance of sympathetic and neural crest-derived sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Over the last 10-15 years, however, the role of NGF as a necessary trophic substrate for magnocellular cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) has emerged. Because the trophic effects of NGF are initiated by its interaction with membrane-bound receptors, the characterization, localization, and function of these specific NGF receptors are essential to understanding the many actions of NGF. The first part of this review will summarize briefly the presence and possible role of NGF in the CNS, with the remainder of the review focusing on what is known about the receptor to NGF.
