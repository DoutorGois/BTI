Grafts of embryonic entorhinal cortex (EC) or non-entorhinal cortex (NEC) were placed into the hippocampus of adult rats with transection of the perforant paths. Graft-host connectivity was investigated at 4-6 months post-transplantation by recording extracellular evoked responses in hippocampal slice preparations. Electrical stimulation of the grafts evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, and the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA1, CA3, and elicited population spikes in the granule cell layer and the pyramidal cell layer of CA1, but not CA3. While the latencies and the forms of these evoked response were similar to those in matched control slices from the normal animals, the amplitudes were smaller than normal controls. However, in the slices with NEC grafts, no such responses were recorded when stimulus was applied in similar position in the grafts. The findings suggest that grafted entorhinal neurons make viable synaptic connections with the host hippocampus.
