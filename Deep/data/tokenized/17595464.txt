This paper gives the results on the studies of the effect of multiple generalized seizures (MGSs) on the wakefulness-sleep cycle (WSC). The adult Wister rats served as the experimental objects. The animals, under chloral hydrate anesthesia (35-40mg/kg) were stereotaxically implanted with stainless metal electrodes aimed into the neocortex and dorsal hippocampus. Typical EEG and behavioral GSs evoked in response to electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus by the EEG recording of WSC the ration of different phases, latency of sleep and first PS onset were evaluated It have been shown that MGSs produce potent effect on the structure in WSC. In particular MGSs in postconvulsive WSC evoke sharp decrease in the latency of the sleep. Moreover, in ratio of WSC occurs prolongation of sleep and shortening of wakefulness.
