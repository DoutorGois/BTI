Open microscale cultures of primary central nervous system (CNS) cells have been implemented in microfluidic chips that can expose the cells to physiological fluidic shear stress conditions. Cells in the chips were exposed to differently aggregated forms of beta-amyloid (Abeta), i.e. conditions mimicking an Alzheimer's Disease environment, and treated with CNS drugs in order to assess the contribution of glial cells during pharmacological treatments. FTY720, a drug approved for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, was found to play a marked neuroprotective role in neuronal cultures as well as in microglia-enriched neuronal cultures, preventing neurodegeneration after cell exposure to neurotoxic oligomers of Abeta.
