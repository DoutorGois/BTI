Caffeine-augmented electroconvulsive therapy has been introduced into medical practice without experimental confirmation that such seizure modification does not result in neuronal injury. In this report rats pretreated with caffeine prior to a series of nine electrically induced convulsions showed neuronal injury confined to hippocampal sectors and striatum. Electrically induced convulsions without caffeine pretreatment did not result in injury. The potential deleterious effects of caffeine augmentation of human electroconvulsive therapy require rigorous clinical assessment.
