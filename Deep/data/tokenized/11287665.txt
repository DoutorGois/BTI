Arachidonoyldiacylglycerol (20:4-DAG) is a second messenger derived from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and generated by stimulation of glutamate metabotropic receptors linked to G proteins and activation of phospholipase C. 20:4-DAG signaling is terminated by its phosphorylation to phosphatidic acid, catalyzed by diacylglycerol kinase (DGK). We have cloned the murine DGKepsilon gene that showed, when expressed in COS-7 cells, selectivity for 20:4-DAG. The significance of DGKepsilon in synaptic function was investigated in mice with targeted disruption of the DGKepsilon. DGKepsilon(-/-) mice showed a higher resistance to electroconvulsive shock with shorter tonic seizures and faster recovery than DGKepsilon(+/+) mice. The phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-signaling pathway in cerebral cortex was greatly affected, leading to lower accumulation of 20:4-DAG and free 20:4. Also, long-term potentiation was attenuated in perforant path-dentate granular cell synapses. We propose that DGKepsilon contributes to modulate neuronal signaling pathways linked to synaptic activity, neuronal plasticity, and epileptogenesis.
