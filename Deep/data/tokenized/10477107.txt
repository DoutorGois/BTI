We investigated the spatial and temporal expression of osteopontin (OPN) mRNA following transient forebrain ischemia in rats. Experiments were carried out using a four-vessel occlusion model for forebrain ischemia. The transient induction of OPN mRNA after global ischemia occurred earlier in the striatum than in the hippocampus. It was pronounced in the dorsomedial striatum close to the lateral ventricle and in the CA1 subfield and the subiculum of the hippocampus before microglial cells became more reactive. It also could be detected in the dentate hilus and to a marginal extent in the CA3. Our results suggest that the hippocampus and the striatum following global forebrain ischemia upregulate OPN mRNA in different spatiotemporal profiles.
