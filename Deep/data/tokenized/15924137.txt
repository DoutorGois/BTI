GluR1 and GluR2 subunits compose AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the mature hippocampus, and both the GluR1 subunit and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are required for synaptic plasticity, memory and learning. Although GluR1 phosphorylationby CaMKII is preserved, the functional regulation of AMPARs by phosphorylation is lost in the presence of the GIuR2 subunit. Our findings define a previously unknown, dominant role of the GluR2 subunit in signaling mediated by CaMKII at AMPARs.
