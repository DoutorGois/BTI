The use of MR spectroscopy to obtain nonivasive, in vivo biochemical information from the central nervous system might provide a powerful complement to the exquisite anatomic detail provided by MR imaging. This article briefly reviews current MR spectroscopy methodology and spectral analysis, introduces some of the recent applications of 1H and 31P MR spectroscopy of the brain, and discusses the applications of MR spectroscopy to the study of the anterior temporal lobe and hippocampus.
