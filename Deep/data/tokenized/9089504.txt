Despite a considerable amount of investigation on long-term potentiation, the question of whether this process occurs at inhibitory synapses has remained controversial until studies of these junctions have been achieved in the Mauthner cell of Teleosts. In this preparation, inhibitory long-term potentiation similar to that occurring at hippocampal excitatory synapses has been demonstrated.
