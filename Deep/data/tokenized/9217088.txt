The sprouting capacity of aged noradrenergic neurons of the brain-stem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) was examined using intraocular transplants of fetal tissues. Fetal hippocampal tissue (E18) and LC tissue (E15) were transplanted together as a double transplant into the anterior chamber of the eye of young adult Fischer 344 rats. The double transplants were allowed to mature for 14-18 months, after which an additional fetal hippocampal transplant was placed next to the LC graft. The triple transplants were monitored for overall growth and vascularization for an additional 2-6 months. Immunohistochemical examinations showed that both young (2-6 months old) and aged (16-24 months old) hippocampal cografts contained a plexus of thin varicose tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive fibers extending throughout the grafted hippocampal tissues. However, the aged hippocampal grafts contained a denser uniform plexus of TH-positive fibers compared to the young transplants. Immunohistochemistry with synapsin antibodies demonstrated that both the young and the aged hippocampal transplants contained much higher densities of synaptic elements than the LC grafts. In vivo electrochemical measurements of potassium-evoked overflow of norepinephrine (NE) in the grafts showed that similar amounts of NE overflow were detected in both the young and the aged hippocampal grafts. HPLC-EC measurements of NE levels in the grafts revealed that there were similar amounts of NE in the young and the aged grafts, and the grafts did not contain serotonin or dopamine. In summary, the findings of the present study show that aged LC neurons are capable of undergoing collateral sprouting producing a functional NE neuronal system when introduced to an appropriate young target.
