Heme oxygenase (HO) produces biliverdin and bilirubin which are physiological antioxidants and potent scavengers of oxygen radicals. Recently, we found that intracerebroventricular injection of kainic acid (KA) induced inducible HO (HO-1) predominantly in glial cells in the rat hippocampus in vivo. In this study, we examined the mechanism of HO-1 expression induced by agonists for glutamate receptors in cultured glial cells in vitro. The HO-1 protein level was significantly enhanced by several agonists for non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) such as KA, quisqualic acid (QA), (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propanoic acid (AMPA), and trans-(+/-)-1-amino-(1S,3R)-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD). Among these agonists, QA had the greatest potency. KA-induced HO-1 expression was inhibited by the non-NMDA antagonist NBQX. In addition, KA induced the marked production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and KA-induced HO-1 expression was also inhibited by the antioxidants allopurinol and ascorbic acid. ACPD-induced HO-1 expression was inhibited by the mGluR antagonist MCPG and the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor calphostin C. These results suggest that induction of HO-1 expression by the activation of non-NMDA receptors is mediated by ROS production, and that expression induced by mGluR activation is mediated by PKC activation in rat glial cells.
