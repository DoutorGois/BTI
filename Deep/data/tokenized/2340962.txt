The septum and fornix are known to modulate the functional activity of the hypothalamus. Since the hypothalamus has been shown to influence crypt cell mitotic rate, it was considered possible that the septum and fornix might have a similar influence. Using a stathmokinetic technique, bilateral fornix and septal lesions were found to be associated with a marked increase in rat small bowel crypt cell mitotic rate. There was no associated significant change in food intake. It appears possible that the effects of the septal and fornix lesions may have been mediated via their influence over the functions of the hypothalamus.
