The activity of the adenylate cyclase located in membranes prepared from hippocampus of adult rat can be stimulated by serotonin (5-HT) (Ka = 4 X 10(-7) M). The maximal effect is obtained with 10 microM 5-HT. Freezing of the tissue decreases the 5-HT stimulation; this stimulation is optimal in the presence of 82.5 mM Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.4) and 50 microM GTP. The adenylate cyclase activity of membranes prepared from cortex, hypothalamus, and colliculi of adult rats is not significantly stimulated by 5-HT. Dopamine (DA) also stimulates adenylate cyclase located in hippocampal membranes; its effect can be blocked by haloperidol (10(-6) M), which fails to inhibit 5-HT stimulation. Moreover, p-chlorophenylalanine treatment for 2 weeks or selective lesion of 5-HT axons afferent to the hippocampus increases the Vmax of 5-HT stimulation, but fails to change that of DA stimulation. The 5-HT stimulation can be inhibited by metergoline, spiroperidol, and pizotyline (10(-6) M), but not by the same concentrations of mianserin, ketanserine, alprenolol, phenoxybenzamine, and mepyramine. The 5-HT stimulation of adenylate cyclase of hippocampal membranes can be mimicked by tryptamine, 5-methoxytryptamine, bufotenine, and to a lesser extent by LSD; N-methyltryptamine, N-methyltryptophan, and 5-hydroxytryptophan are inactive. Studies with kainic acid suggest that the 5-HT recognition site (5-HT1) linked to adenylate cyclase is located on the membrane of intrinsic hippocampal neurons.
