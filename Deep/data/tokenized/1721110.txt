The involvement of L-type calcium channels in heterosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of the stratum radiatum input to area CA1 was studied in rat hippocampal slices. LTD of the radiatum field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and population spike, produced by tetanization of the alveus in the presence of picrotoxin, was blocked by the calcium antagonist nimodipine and by a monoclonal antibody to the L-type calcium channel. LTD was produced in the absence of picrotoxin when the L-type calcium channel agonist, BAY-K8644, was applied. This effect was also blocked by nimodipine. These results indicate that L-type calcium channels are involved in heterosynaptic long-term depression.
