S100B is an astrocyte-derived cytokine implicated in the IL-1beta-triggered cytokine cycle in Alzheimer's disease. However, the secretion of S100B following stimulation by IL-1beta has not been directly demonstrated. We investigated S100B secretion in cortical primary astrocyte cultures, C6 glioma cells and acute hippocampal slices exposed to IL-1beta. S100B secretion was induced by IL-1beta in all preparations, involving MAPK pathway and, apparently, NF-small ka, CyrillicB signaling. Astrocytes and C6 cells exhibited different sensitivities to IL-1beta. These results suggest that IL-1beta-induced S100B secretion is a component of the neuroinflammatory response, which would support the involvement of S100B in the genesis of neurodegenerative diseases.
