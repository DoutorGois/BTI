In chronic experiments on cats ACTH facilitated the development of behavioral responses to gradually increasing electric stimulation of the medial hypothalamus, hippocampus and the midbrain reticular formation as well as potentiated the reticulo-hypothalamic influence. The effect of hydrocortisone was opposite. The reciprocal reticular and hormonal influences on the basal and anterior amygdala were revealed as well as some hormonal changes due to unspecific thalamic effects upon the limbic structures. The revealed systemic hormonal effect on the state and interaction of cerebral structures seems to be the base for integration of neural and hormonal mechanisms of some behavioral responses.
