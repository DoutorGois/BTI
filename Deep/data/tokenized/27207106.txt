Since the discovery of long-term potentiation (LTP) about a half-century ago, Ca(2+) /CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been one of the most extensively studied components of the molecular machinery that regulate plasticity. This unique dodecameric kinase complex plays pivotal roles in LTP by phosphorylating substrates through elaborate regulatory mechanisms, and is known to be both necessary and sufficient for LTP. In addition to acting as a kinase, CaMKII has been postulated to have structural roles because of its extraordinary abundance and diverse interacting partners. It now is becoming clear that these two functions of CaMKII cooperate closely for the induction of both functional and structural synaptic plasticity of dendritic spines. Because of its extraordinary abundance within neuronal cells, calmodulin kinase CaMKII has been believed to act as a structural protein as well as an enzyme during synaptic plasticity. In this review, we summarized studies in CaMKII field and provide an insight into how enzymatic and structural functions of CaMKII cooperate with each other for long-term potentiation (LTP) in neurons. This article is part of a mini review series: "Synaptic Function and Dysfunction in Brain Diseases".
