The regional distribution of 125I-galanin specific binding sites was determined by radioautography on brain sections in young (3- to 4-month-old) and aged (26- to 27-month-old) male Sprague-Dawley rats, previously tested for their performances in the Morris water maze task. In aged rats, a significant increase in specific binding was observed in piriform, perirhinal and entorhinal cortex, the CA1 field of the ventral hippocampus, ventral subiculum, and dorsal dentate gyrus, whereas no significant change was observed in the ventral dentate gyrus, the dorsal subiculum, the CA3 field of the hippocampus, the amygdala or the septal area. The area-specific regional increase in specific binding density in aged rats was significantly correlated with the impairment of their behavioral performances in the Morris water maze task. The change in 125I-galanin specific binding in the aged rats was a result of an increase in the number of galanin-binding sites, without change in affinity.
