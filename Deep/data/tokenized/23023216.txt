BACKGROUND: Testosterone and its metabolites have important roles in learning and memory. The current study has conducted to assess the effect of pre-training, post-training and pre-probe trial intrahippocampal CA1 administration of 3alpha-anderostanediol (one of the metabolites of testosterone) and indomethacin (as 3alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme blocker) on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in Morris water maze (MWM) task. METHODS: Adult male rats were bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of hippocampus and then received 3alpha-diol (0.2, 1, 3 and 6 mug/0.5 mul/side), indomethacin (1.5, 3 and 6 mug/0.5 mul/side), indomethacin (3 mug/0.5 mul/side) + 3alpha-diol (1 mug/0.5 mul/side), 25-35 min before training, immediately after training and 25-35 min before probe trial in MWM task. RESULTS: Our results showed that injection of 3alpha-diol and indomethacin significantly increased the escape latency and traveled distance to find hidden platform in acquisition and consolidation stage, but did not have any effect on retrieval of spatial learning as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that intra-CA1 administration of 3alpha-diol and indomethacin could impair spatial learning and memory in acquisition and consolidation stage. Also, intrahippocampal injection of indomethacin + 3alpha-diol could not change spatial learning and memory impairment effect of indomethacin or 3alpha-diol in MWM task.
