Amyloid-beta (Abeta) plays a central role in the neuroinflammation and cholinergic neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease, and thus has been considered as a main determinant of this disease. In the previous study, we reported that PMS777, a novel bis-interacting ligand for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor antagonism, could significantly attenuate PAF-induced neurotoxicity. Continuing our efforts, we further investigated the protective effect of PMS777 on Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and neuroinflammation in vivo. PMS777 (1-100 microM) was found to inhibit Abeta-induced human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Concurrently, PMS777 increased ratio of bcl-2 to bax mRNA, and inhibited both mRNA expression and activity of caspase-3 in SH-SY5Y cells after the exposure with Abeta. In vivo experimental study demonstrated that PMS777 could attenuate Abeta-induced microglial and astrocytic activation in the rat hippocampus after systemic administration. These results suggest that PMS777 potently protects against Abeta-induced neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation, and warrants further investigations in connection with its potential value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
