Visual evoked potentials were recorded in the amygdala, hippocampus, mid- and inferotemporal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and lateral frontal cortex of seven epileptic patients while they were engaged in a difficult task requiring the discrimination between repeated and nonrepeated faces. The explicit recognition of previously seen faces was at chance levels, as measured by the accuracy of push-button responses. Nevertheless, all subjects showed clear-cut differential evoked responses to repeated versus nonrepeated faces, indicating implicit encoding of the distinction between the two types of stimuli. Differential responses were more frequent in neocortical recording sites (especially in the mid- and inferotemporal leads) than in limbic recording sites such as the amygdala and hippocampus. The authors conclude that implicit encoding processes are modulated by neocortical visual association areas of the temporal lobes.
