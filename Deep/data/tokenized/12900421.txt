Molecular misreading of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene generates mRNA with dinucleotide deletions in GAGAG motifs. The resulting truncated and partly frameshifted APP protein (APP+1) accumulates in the dystrophic neurites and the neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex and hippocampus of Alzheimer patients. In contrast, we show here that neuronal cells transfected with APP+1 proficiently secreted APP+1. Because various secretory APP isoforms are present in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), this study aimed to determine whether APP+1 is also a secretory protein that can be detected in CSF. Post-mortem CSF was obtained at autopsy from 50 non-demented controls and 122 Alzheimer patients; all subjects were staged for neuropathology (Braak score). Unexpectedly, we found that the APP+1 level in the CSF of non-demented controls was much higher (1.75 ng/ml) than in the CSF of Alzheimer patients (0.51 ng/ml) (p < 0.001), and the level of APP+1 in CSF was inversely correlated with the severity of the neuropathology. Moreover the earliest neuropathological changes are already reflected in a significant decrease of the APP+1 level in CSF. These data show that APP+1 is normally secreted by neurons, preventing intra-neuronal accumulation of APP+1 in brains of non-demented controls without neurofibrillary pathology.
