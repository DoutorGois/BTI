The dopaminergic modulation of long-term potentiation (LTP) has been studied well, but the mechanism by which dopamine induces LTP (DA-LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons is unknown. Here, we report that DA-LTP in basal dendrites is dependent while in apical dendrites it is independent of activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VDCC). Activation via NMDAR is critical for the induction of DA-LTP in both apical and basal dendrites, but only BDNF is required for the induction and maintenance of DA-LTP in apical dendrites. We report that dopaminergic modulation of LTP is lamina-specific at the Schaffer collateral/commissural synapses in the CA1 region.
