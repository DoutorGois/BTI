Genetic and molecular studies indicate that dysbindin-1 plays a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We examined dysbindin-1 mRNA in the hippocampal formation of patients with schizophrenia and found reduced expression in dentate granule and polymorph cells and in hippocampal field CA3, but not in CA1. Furthermore, there were positive correlations between dysbindin-1 mRNA and expression of synaptic markers known to be reduced in schizophrenia. Our results indicate that previously reported dysbindin-1 protein reductions may be due in part to decreased dysbindin-1 mRNA and that reduced dysbindin-1 may contribute to hippocampal formation synaptic pathology in schizophrenia.
