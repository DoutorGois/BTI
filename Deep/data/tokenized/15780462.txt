A conflict task was developed that simultaneously examines place aversion learning and fear-motivated context discrimination. The task superimposed Pavlovian discriminative fear conditioning on an appetitively motivated instrumental response (alternation). Rats were trained to alternate along a high-walled, diamond-shaped runway between two chambers for food. On half of the trials, a tone CS signaled the fact that a fixed section at the apex of the runway was electrified. Both the tone and the shock were turned on at the beginning of, and remained on for the duration of, each tone trial. A new trial was initiated at the time the animal entered the subsequent food chamber. Therefore, during a tone trial, in order to attain additional food reinforcement, the animal had to cross over the electrified region at the runway apex. Behavioral performance of rats with small lesions of the amygdala or dorsal hippocampus (DH) was compared with that of sham-operated controls. All groups displayed significant discriminative responding, hesitating more on tone trials while in areas of the runway adjacent to the shock region. Animals with lesions of the DH were similar to controls with respect to the tone-mediated discrimination, yet were delayed in the initial expression of a location-specific fear response. Conversely, amygdala lesions did not affect place learning; however, these animals were impaired in their suppression of the fear response following repeated unpaired trials.
