Pro interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme (ICE) activity in the pituitary was found to be significantly increased 4 h after intraperitoneal injection of E. coli lipopolysaccharides, when distribution and inducibility of the enzyme was studied in the adult rat brain and the adrenal gland, using an artificial fluorescence peptide substrate. The same lipopolysaccharide treatment induced ICE mRNA levels in the pituitary, adrenal gland and hypothalamus as studied by reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction.
