The influence of halothane on the interactions of 5-HT1A and adenosine A1 receptors with G proteins was determined by monitoring the guanine nucleotide sensitivity of agonist binding to these receptors. Halothane inhibited the binding of radiolabeled agonists to 5-HT1A and adenosine A1 receptors by up to 30%, but only at concentrations considerably greater than those necessary for the maintenance of the anesthetic state. The sensitivity of high-affinity agonist binding to a guanine nucleotide (guanylyl-5'-imidodiphosphate) was not affected by halothane, indicating no disruption of receptor-G protein coupling. Thus, it appears that the ability of halothane to disrupt receptor-mediated signal transduction by interference with receptor-G protein interactions is receptor specific.
