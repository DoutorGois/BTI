Recent studies have shown that the centrally active muscarinic agonist pilocarpine induces c-fos mRNA in rat cortex. Here we describe the localization of muscarinic receptor-induced FOS protein, within the rat central nervous system (CNS), following administration of pilocarpine (25 mg/kg). High levels of FOS induction were apparent in many forebrain structures including the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus, neocortex and supra-optic nucleus of the hypothalamus. Within the neocortex FOS induction followed a laminar distribution being highest in layers 4 and 6 with lower induction seen in layers 2 and 5. Other areas showing FOS induction included the striatum, septum, inferior colliculus, thalamus, hypothalamus and several brainstem nuclei. Both atropine (10 mg/kg) and pirenzepine (100 mg/kg) reduced FOS induction suggesting that a pirenzepine-sensitive muscarinic receptor was involved. The possible significance of muscarinic-mediated FOS induction, to cholinergic kindling and the cholinergic hypothesis of learning and memory, is discussed.
