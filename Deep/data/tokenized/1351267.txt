Ischemia-induced selective neuronal injury to field CA1 is not attributable to selective glutamate release in field CA1 during ischemia. Excessive release of glutamate has been proposed to play a major role in ischemia-induced selective neuronal death in field CA1 of the hippocampus. It is well known that, following carotid arterial occlusion of 5 min duration in the gerbil, the pyramidal neurons in field CA1 show delayed neuronal death, whereas the neurons in field CA3 do not show any neuronal degeneration. In the present study, we measured the levels of released glutamate during ischemia in field CA1 and field CA3, separately, and evaluated whether there are subregional differences in the concentration of released glutamate which could be a satisfactory explanation for the selective vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to ischemia. Extracellular glutamate levels were significantly increased during ischemia in both field CA1 and field CA3. No significant differences were detected in the time-course of change in glutamate release and the levels of glutamate between field CA1 and field CA3. This result indicates that the increased glutamate levels do not play a pivotal part in the detrimental effect of glutamate during 5-min ischemia. Some differentiated post-synaptic organization may act as a crucial factor in the development of ischemia-induced selective neuronal death in the gerbil hippocampus.
