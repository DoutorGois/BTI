The present study tested if a positive modulator of AMPA-type glutamate receptors would counteract the behavioral effects of a drug that enhances the release of dopamine. BDP-29, a compound shown to increase AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic responses in hippocampal slices, markedly attenuated the amount of stereotypic rearings seen in rats after methamphetamine injections. These results suggest that AMPA receptor modulators ameliorate certain aberrant, dopamine-related behaviors and hence may be of interest with regard to schizophrenia.
