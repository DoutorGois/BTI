We studied in vivo the influences exerted by the retrorubral field (RRF) on the on commissural-evoked CA1 pyramidal cell excitability in the rat hippocampal formation (HF). The stimulation of RRF before the activation of the contralateral CA3 area evoked in all the studied rats a reduction in amplitude of the evoked population spike in the CA1 pyramidal cell body layer of both the dorsal and the ventral HF. No significant differences in the intensity of the inhibitory effect were observed between dorsal and ventral parts of the HF. The stimulation of the ipsilateral RRF reduced the amplitude of the evoked population spike in a higher degree with respect to the contralateral side. Since these side-to-side differences were significant, it can be concluded that the RRF-induced inhibitory effect is stronger on the ipsilateral CA1 pyramidal cells. The inhibitory effect appears within 0.1 s of stimulating the RRF, reaches its maximal effect around 0.4-0.5 s following the conditioning train and returned to its control size after 5 s.
