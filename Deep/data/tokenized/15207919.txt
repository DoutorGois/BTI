We determined COX-3 mRNA expression in regions of the rat central nervous system (CNS). On a regional basis, levels were the highest in choroid plexus and spinal chord followed by pituitary gland, hypothalamus, hippocampus, medulla, cerebellum, and cortex. COX-3 mRNA levels were higher in major brain arteries, and dramatically higher in brain microvessels. Our results suggest that the expression pattern of COX-3 mRNA in the rat CNS primarily relates to the vascular density of a given region.
