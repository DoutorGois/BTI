Abstract An unavoidable complication of space travel is exposure to high-charge, high-energy (HZE) particles. In animal studies, exposure of the CNS to HZE-particle radiation leads to neurological alterations similar to those seen in aging or Alzheimer's disease. In this study we examined whether HZE-particle radiation accelerated the age-related neuronal dysfunction that was previously described in transgenic mice overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein (APP). These APP23 transgenic mice exhibit age-related behavioral abnormalities and deficits in synaptic transmission. We exposed 7-week-old APP23 transgenic males to brain-only (56)Fe-particle radiation (600 MeV/nucleon; 1, 2, 4 Gy) and recorded synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices at 2, 6, 9, 14 and 18-24 months. We stimulated Schaeffer collaterals and recorded field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and population spikes (PS) in CA1 neurons. Radiation accelerated the onset of age-related fEPSP decrements recorded at the PS threshold from 14 months of age to 9 months and reduced synaptic efficacy. At 9 months, radiation also reduced PS amplitudes. At 6 months, we observed a temporary deficit in paired-pulse inhibition of the PS at 2 Gy. Radiation did not significantly affect survival of APP23 transgenic mice. We conclude that irradiation of the brain with HZE particles accelerates Alzheimer's disease-related neurological deficits.
