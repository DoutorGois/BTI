We studied the effect of ACTH on plastic synapses in the hippocampal gyrus of the developing mouse brain. Examination of ethanolic phosphotungustic acid stained synaptic junctions revealed no obvious differences between the ACTH-treated brains and controls qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, ACTH may not adversely affect the plastic synapses in the developing mouse brain.
