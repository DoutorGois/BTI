RATIONALE: Given that the pregnane neurosteroid, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), is increased following behavioral challenges (e.g., mating), and that there is behavioral-induced biosynthesis of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in midbrain and mesocorticolimbic structures, 3alpha,5alpha-THP likely has a role in homeostasis and motivated reproduction and reproduction-related behaviors (e.g., affect, affiliation). The role of pregnane xenobiotic receptor (PXR), involved in cholesterol metabolism, for these effects is of continued interest. OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that there would be differences in brain levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP following varied behavioral experiences, an effect abrogated by knockdown of PXR in the midbrain. METHODS: Proestrous rats were infused with PXR antisense oligonucleotides (AS-ODNs) or vehicle to the ventral tegmental area before different behavioral manipulations and assessments. Endpoints were expression levels of PXR in the midbrain, 3alpha,5alpha-THP, and ovarian steroids (estradiol, progesterone, dihydroprogesterone) in the midbrain, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and plasma. RESULTS: Across experiments, knocking down PXR reduced PXR expression and 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels in the midbrain and hippocampus. There were differences in terms of the behavioral manipulations, such that paced mating had the most robust effects to increase 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels and reduce open field exploration and social interaction. An additional question that was addressed is whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a downstream factor for regulating effects of behavioral-induced 3alpha,5alpha-THP biosynthesis. Rats infused with PXR AS-ODNs had lower levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Thus, PXR may be a regulator of mating-induced 3alpha,5alpha-THP formation and behavioral changes and neural plasticity, such as BDNF.
