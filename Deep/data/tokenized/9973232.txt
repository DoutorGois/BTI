AF64A (ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion) was stereotaxically administered bilaterally (1 nmol/side) into rat lateral cerebral ventricles. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and ChAT mRNA levels were measured at predetermined time points in the septo-hippocampal pathway and striatum, both well identified as rich in cholinergic neurons. AF64A caused a rapid but transient increase in ChAT mRNA (167%, P < 0.05) and ChAT activity (164%, P < 0.01) in the septum. By day 7 post treatment, there was a significant decrease in ChAT mRNA (42.5% of control, P < 0.05) in the septum although the ChAT activity still stayed high. This decreased ChAT mRNA level in the septum lasted for at least four weeks, and was paralleled by a long-lasting decrease in ChAT activity in the hippocampus. In the striatum, on the other hand, there were no observed changes in either ChAT activity or ChAT mRNA. These data suggest that the long term effect of AF64A on the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway may, at least in part, be due to an action of AF64A on gene expression in the cholinergic neuron. The difference in the response to AF64A between the septo-hippocampal and striatal cholinergic systems might be due to their difference in neuron types.
