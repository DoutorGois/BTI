Cortical laminar necrosis (CLN) is a metabolic injury pattern usually observed after cerebral hypoxia, hypoglycemia, or ischemia. We report serial magnetic resonance imaging findings in a patient with complex partial status epilepticus (SE) developing a band-like, T1-hyperintense lesion consistent with CLN along the surface of the left hippocampus without concurrent other causes of CLN. This observation suggests a direct pathogenetic link between SE and CLN involving combined damage to neurons and glia.
