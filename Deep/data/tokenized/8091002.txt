Myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphoric acid (IP3) formation stimulated by (+-)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentane-trans-dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD) was examined in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of iron-induced epileptic rats and epileptic El mice. Increased IP3 formation by trans-ACPD was observed in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of iron-injected rats while it was found in the hippocampus and cerebellum of the saline-injected control rats. Increased IP3 formation by trans-ACPD was remarkably higher in the hippocampus of iron-injected rats than the other regions. Increased IP3 formation by trans-ACPD was observed in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of ddY mice, while such an increase was found only in the cerebral cortex and not in the hippocampus and cerebellum of El mice. These findings suggest that the inositol response may be involved in the seizure mechanisms of iron-induced epileptic rats and epileptic El mice in some different forms.
