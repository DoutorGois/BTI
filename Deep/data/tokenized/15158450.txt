Glial precursor cells (GPCs) are present in the adult human central nervous system (CNS) and they can be isolated and maintained in culture for in vitro studies. This study analysed expression of mGluR3 and mGluR5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mRNAs in GPCs. A2B5 surface antigen positive GPCs were isolated using immunomagnetic selection from dissociated temporal lobe subcortical white matter cells. The separated GPCs were maintained in cultures and characterised by immunoreactivity for the differentiation markers A2B5 and human platelet-derived growth factor-alpha receptor (PDGFalphaR). Reverse transcription followed by multiplex PCR analysis showed that the GPCs expressed both mGluR3 and mGluR5a mRNAs. Double immunostaining for glial progenitor markers and mGluR5 proteins demonstrated that all A2B5 and PDGFalphaR-positive cells were also positive for mGluR5. The results indicate that GPCs present in the adult human CNS express mGluR3 and mGluR5a. These neurotransmitter receptors may be involved in the proliferation and differentiation of glial cells.
