The previously described gene sip1 belongs to transcription factors of the zinc finger family. It has been ascertained recently that this gene is involved in TGF signaling cascade. Mutations in human gene sip1 cause Hirschprung syndrome. The expression of gene sip1 during embryonic mouse development was studied by in situ hybridization and immunostaining. Starting at E12.5, sip1 transcripts are present in a number of tissues: in the cortical plate, ventricular zone of the basal ganglion, thalamus, pons and midbrain, in specific nuclei of the brain stem and in the dorsal part of the spinal cord. In the developing cerebral cortex, sip1 expression is region-specific. In the brain of adult mice, sip1 expression is mostly detected in hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and white matter of the neocortex. Sip1 protein expression in the cerebral cortex is mostly confined to glutamatergic neurons.
