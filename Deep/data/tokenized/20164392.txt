The hippocampus and olfactory regions are anatomically close, and both play a major role in memory formation. However, the way they interact during odor processing is still unclear. In both areas, strong oscillations of the local field potential (LFP) can be recorded, and are modulated by behavior. In particular, in the olfactory system, the beta rhythm (15-35 Hz) is associated with cognitive processing of an olfactory stimulus. Using LFP recordings in the olfactory bulb and dorsal and ventral hippocampus during performance of an olfactory go/no-go task in rats, we previously showed that beta oscillations are also present in the hippocampus, coherent with those in the olfactory bulb, during odor sampling. In this study, we provide further insight into information transfer in the olfacto-hippocampal network by using directional coherence (DCOH estimate), a method based on the temporal relation between two or more signals in the frequency domain. In the theta band (6-12 Hz), coherence between the olfactory bulb (OB) and the hippocampus (HPC) is weak and can be both in the feedback and feedforward directions. However, at this frequency, modulation of the coupling between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus is seen during stimulus expectation versus odor processing. In the beta frequency band (15-35 Hz), analysis showed a strong unidirectional coupling from the OB to dorsal and ventral HPC, indicating that, during odor processing, beta oscillations in the hippocampus are driven by the olfactory bulb.
