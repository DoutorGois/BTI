aFGF injection s.c. once a week into SAMP8 was begun at 3 weeks after birth and continued for 10 months. Saline was injected as a control. learning and memory and cellular immunological functions in the aFGF group were enhanced significantly, while those of the saline group deteriorated. 1. The number of cholinergic neurons was decreased by less than 20% and ChAT activity in individual neurons in the medial septum which send monosyonaptic terminals to the hippocampus was significantly decreased in the saline group, but not so much in the aFGF group. 2. The respective densities of muscarinic and aFGF receptors, on the hippocampal neurons were significantly higher in the aFGF group than in the saline group. 3. The LTP in hippocampal slice preparations was significantly facilitated in the aFGF group, but not in the saline group. 4. The DTH, (T cell immune response) measured at the end of the 2nd and 7th months were reduced in the 7th month as compared with the 2nd month in the saline group, but aFGF group protected against this reduction. 5. These results show that aFGF provides protection against impairment of not only learning and memory but also the DTH immunoreactivity in SAMP8.
