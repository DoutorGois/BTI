Despite the great number of studies devoted to neural stem/progenitor cell biology, the ultrastructural characteristics of these cells in vitro have not been fully studied. To determine the fine structure of hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in culture, mouse fetal hippocampi (E18) were extracted, dissected, and cells were expanded as adherent monolayer culture. Electron microscopy revealed that NPCs had an immature phenotype, with a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, small and scant organelles, underdeveloped endoplasmic reticulum, and many free ribosomes and polysomes. Our results may contribute to a better understanding of the fine structure and physiology of hippocampal NPCs in vitro.
