AIM: To observe protective effects of ginsenoside Rb3 on glutamate excitotoxic injury in cultured hippocampal neurons and involved mechanisms. METHODS: On cultured rat hippocampal neurons treated with glutamate at toxic concentration, we made the following investigations: by using MTT assay, LDH leakage detection, tests of total NOS, iNOS and cNOS activity, and the protective effects of ginsenoside Rb3. RESULTS: Ginsenoside Rb3 can enhance the hippocampal neuronal viability, decrease the LDH leakage, elevate the viability of cNOS, and in the same time weaken iNOS's viability. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rb3 has the significant protective effects on glutamate excitotoxic injury. The involved mechanism may include antagonizing the injury of neuron membrane, inhibiting the viability of iNOS, and increasing the activity of cNOS.
