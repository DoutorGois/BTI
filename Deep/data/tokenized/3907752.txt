The distribution of enkephalin-immunoreactive neuronal profiles in the forebrain and upper brainstem of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) was studied by means of the indirect immunofluorescence method. Numerous enkephalin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers were disclosed in various regions including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, septal area, olfactory tubercle, substantia innominata, amygdala, various hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray, midbrain reticular formation and interpeduncular nucleus. Some of the highest concentrations of enkephalin-positive fibers in the squirrel monkey brain were found in the external segment of the globus pallidus, the outer layer of the median eminence, and in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. Overall, the pattern of distribution of the enkephalin-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers in the forebrain and upper brainstem of the squirrel monkey is similar to that found in the rat, except that the density of positive neuronal profiles in the entire forebrain appears much higher in monkey than in rat. Furthermore, the very dense network of enkephalin-immunoreactive fibers disclosed in the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkey appears to be lacking in rat.
