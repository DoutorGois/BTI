Neuronal circuits are defined by synaptic connections between their cellular constituents. In this article, I highlight several recent studies emphasizing the surprising level of precision exhibited by inhibitory GABAergic synapses within the neocortex and hippocampus. Specifically, GABAergic inputs to dendritic shafts and spines of pyramidal cells have a key role in the localized regulation of neuronal Ca(2+) signalling. These findings provide important new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying the contributions of inhibitory transmission to both normal and abnormal brain activity.
