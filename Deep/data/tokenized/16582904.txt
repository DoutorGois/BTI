Postnatal glutamatergic principal neuron synapses are typically presumed to express only calcium-impermeable (CI), GluR2-containing AMPARs under physiological conditions. Here, however, we demonstrate that long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons causes rapid incorporation of GluR2-lacking calcium-permeable (CP)-AMPARs: CP-AMPARs are present transiently, being replaced by GluR2-containing AMPARs approximately 25 min after LTP induction. Thus, CP-AMPARs are physiologically expressed at CA1 pyramidal cell synapses during LTP, and may be required for LTP consolidation.
