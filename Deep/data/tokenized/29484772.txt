Neural stem and progenitor cells continue to generate new neurons in particular regions of the brain during adulthood. One of these neurogenic regions is the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, which plays an important role in cognition and emotion. By exploiting this innate neuronal regeneration mechanism in the DG, new technologies have the potential to promote resistance to or recovery from brain dysfunction or degeneration. However, a deeper understanding of how adult DG neurogenesis is regulated by factors such as sleep and epigenetic modifications of gene expression could lead to further breakthroughs in the clinical application of neural stem and progenitor cells. In this review, we discuss the functions of adult-born DG neurons, describe the epigenetic regulation of adult DG neurogenesis, identify overlaps in how sleep and epigenetic modifications impact adult DG neurogenesis and memory consolidation, and suggest ways of using sleep or epigenetic interventions as therapies for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. By knitting together separate strands of literature, we hope to trigger new insights into how the functions of adult-generated neurons are directed by interactions between sleep-related neural processes and epigenetic mechanisms to facilitate novel approaches to preventing and treating brain disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and Alzheimer's disease.
