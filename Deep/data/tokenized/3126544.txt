A case of infarction in the left anterior choroidal artery territory presenting as a regressive amnestic syndrome, associated with the usual syndrome, is reported. This amnesia had the same characteristics as that found in the left posterior cerebral artery territory infarction. The anterior choroidal artery supplies the medial part of the temporal lobe, the amygdaloid nucleus, part of the hippocampus, uncal gyrus, and the mamillary body. Therefore, an amnestic syndrome can occur together with an infarction in the AChA territory. To our knowledge this is the first report of that occurrence.
