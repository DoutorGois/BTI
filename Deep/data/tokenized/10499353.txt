The effects of soman, a potent irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, on central neuropathology in rats were studied in relation with subsequent spatial memory impairments. In a first step, it was found that, without treatment, neuropathology and learning impairment were observed only in rats which experienced convulsions. Then, treatment consisting of atropine sulfate, and/or TCP and/or NBQX was administered to intoxicated animals at infraanticonvulsant doses to obtain a graded subsequent neuropathology and to appreciate an eventual relation between neuropathology and spatial memory impairment. Thus, a correlation between neuropathology in the hippocampal CA1 region and spatial learning performance was found, the degradation of performance of rat being directly related to the amplitude of their neural damage. A threshold was emphasized : below a certain degree of neural loss, no memory impairment was found. Only treatment with tritherapy (atropine + TCP + NBQX) was able to improve the different parameters of spatial learning, despite no effect on the convulsions of the animals.
