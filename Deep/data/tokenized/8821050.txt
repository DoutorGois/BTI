The effects of unspecific doses of the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegiline on alpha-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherolquinone, ubiquinol and ubiquinone were studied in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of male C57BL/6 mice 4 h and 96 h after a single or six injections of selegiline (100 mg/kg body weight, i.p.), respectively. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase was confirmed by activity measurements of its isoforms A and B in brain stem nuclei and striatum as well as by determination of striatal levels of dopamine and its major metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid. In general, levels of alpha-tocopherol were not altered and levels of alpha-tocopherolquinone were below the detection limit. However, 96 h following selegiline, levels of ubiquinols 9 and 10 were significantly increased, whereas levels of ubiquinones 9 and 10 concomitantly decreased in the striatum. Concentrations of ubiquinols and ubiquinones in frontal cortex and hippocampus were unchanged 96 h following selegiline. These data suggest that selegiline affects the striatal redox ratio of ubiquinol to ubiquinone which is important for cellular antioxidant defense and mitochondrial electron transfer.
