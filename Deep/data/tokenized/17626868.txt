Tyzio et al. (Reports, 15 December 2006, p. 1788) reported that maternal oxytocin triggers a transient excitatory-to-inhibitory switch of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling during labor, thus protecting the fetal rat brain from anoxic injury. However, a body of evidence supports the possibility that oxytocin is released from the fetal pituitary during delivery, not only from the mother, particularly under conditions of hypoxic stress.
