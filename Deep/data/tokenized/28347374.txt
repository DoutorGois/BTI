The glutamate amplifies noradrenergic effects (GANE) model emphasizes the role of focal glutamate-noradrenaline interactions in creating functional hotspots for prioritized processing of salient stimuli. Here, we briefly outline current evidence that synergistic action of noradrenaline and cortisol enables emotional stimuli to gain privileged access to amygdala-hippocampus circuits, eventually resulting in the formation of indelible memories and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
