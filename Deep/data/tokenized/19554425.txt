Salidroside, a phenylpropanoid glycoside separated from a medicinal plant Rhodiola rosea, has been documented to have protective effects on neuronal cells in vitro. This study investigated whether salidroside was able to extend its unique neuroprotection to primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced cell damage. Cell viability tests and cell apoptosis assays confirmed that salidroside pretreatment attenuated H(2)O(2)-stimulated apoptotic cell death in primary culture of hippocampal neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. The measurements of caspase-3 activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and NO synthase (NOS) activity suggest that the protection of salidroside, shown in this study, might be mediated by inhibiting caspase-3 activity, and antagonizing NO production and NOS activity during H(2)O(2) stimulation. Perhaps, this study might contribute to the development of salidroside as a broad-spectrum agent for preventing and/or treating neuronal damage in neurodegenerative disorders.
