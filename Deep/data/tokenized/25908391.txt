As a widely used plasticizer in plastic industry, the data of diisononyl phthalate (DINP) toxicity due to exposure are insufficient. This work investigated the brain tissue injury induced by DINP exposure. Through oral exposure to DINP, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, apoptosis, and hippocampus pathological alterations were found in the mice brain. And through the Morris water maze test, cognitive deficits were tested. Our data also showed that these exacerbations were counteracted by vitamin E. These results above indicated that oral exposure of mice to DINP induced brain damage, and oxidative stress, inflammation, and the consequential apoptosis jointly constituted the potential mechanisms of such induced toxicity.
