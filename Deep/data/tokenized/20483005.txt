OBJECTIVE: Studies exploring roles of p53 and bcl-2 in neuroprotection by hypothermia in focal cerebral ischemia have not provided consistent results. In the present study, we determined whether p53 and bcl-2 are involved in the hypothermia-induced neuroprotection. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: normothermic (37-38 degrees C) ischemia, hypothermic (31-32 degrees C) ischemia, hyperthermic (41-42 degrees C) ischemia and sham-operated group. Global cerebral ischemia was established for 20 minutes using the Pulsinelli four-vessel occlusion model and the brain temperature was maintained at defined levels for 60 minutes following the 20 min ischemia. The mortality in rats was evaluated at 72 hour and 168 hour reperfusion. The expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins was detected at 24, 48 and 72 hours after reperfusion. At the same intervals, neuron necrosis and apoptosis in brain regions was also detected using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and terminal deoxynucleotldyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: The mortalities of rats in normothemia, hypothermia and hyperthermia groups was 33.3, 16.7 and 50% at 72 hour reperfusion. At 168 hours of reperfusion, the mortality in the three groups was 58.3, 25 and 100%, respectively. In light microscopy studies, necrotic neurons and apoptotic neurons were found in the hippocampus after global cerebral ischemia. Surviving neurons in hippocampus was increased in mild hypothermic ischemia group (p<0.05) and decreased in hyperthermia ischemia group (p<0.01) at 24, 48 and 72 hour reperfusion. TUNEL-positive neurons in hippocampus decreased in hypothermic ischemia group (p<0.05 or p<0.01) and increased in hyperthermic ischemia group (p<0.01) at 24, 48 and 72 hour reperfusion. The expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins was found in the neurons of cerebral cortex after global cerebral ischemia. P53 decreased and bcl-2 increased in hypothermia group. CONCLUSION: Hypothermia reduces ischemic neuronal necrosis and apoptosis by reducing p53 and increasing bcl-2 expression. Hyperthermia accelerated ischemic neuronal injury by increasing p53 and reducing bcl-2 expression.
