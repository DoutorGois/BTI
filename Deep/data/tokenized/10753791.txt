Recent results indicate that visual recognition memory (as assessed by habituation and dishabituation of the orienting response) is influenced by associative knowledge, and that this influence is mediated by the hippocampus. A standard, associative model of learning has been recently reported to provide a parsimonious explanation for these results.
