Different glutathione analogues have potential to maintain or increase tissue glutathione level and to scavenge the reactive oxygen species. We designed and synthesized a novel non-toxic glutathione analogue, named UPF1, which possessed 60-fold higher hydroxyl radical scavenger efficiency in vitro, compared with glutathione itself, and investigated the effects of UPF1 on a four-vessel occlusion model of rats. The UPF1 was administered via the jugular vein in two separate experiments at two time points: 20 min before global brain ischemia and immediately before reperfusion. In both cases the number of pyramidal cells surviving in the subfield of CA1 at the dorsal hippocampus in the UPF1-treated groups of rats was twice as high as in the vehicle group.
