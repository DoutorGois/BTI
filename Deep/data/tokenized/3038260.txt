The effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)receptor stimulation on norepinephrine (NE)-induced metabolism of polyphosphoinositides (PIPs) was studied in rat hippocampal slices. Inositol phosphates (IPs), PIPs, and phosphatidic acid were measured. NE induced formation of IPs and phosphatidic acid in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 4.5 microM. GABA, 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid (3APS) and muscimol did not affect PIPs breakdown, but they strongly increased (greater than 100%) PIPs metabolism induced by 1 microM NE. Their action was antagonized by bicuculline (10 microM). We discuss the implications of these findings in hippocampal neurotransmission.
