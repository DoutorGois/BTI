The ectonucleotidase pathway is an important metabolic source of extracellular adenosine. Adenosine has potent anticonvulsant effects on various models of epilepsy. One of these models is pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling, in which repeated administration of subconvulsive doses of this drug induces progressive intensification of seizure activity. In this study, we examine the effect of a single convulsive injection (60 mg/kg, i.p.) or 10 successive (35 mg/kg, i.p.) injections of PTZ on synaptosomal ectonucleotidases. Our results have shown that no changes in ectonucleotidase activities were seen at 0, 1, and 24 h or at 5 days after a single convulsive PTZ injection. However, after PTZ-kindling, rats which were more resistant to seizure development presented an increase in ATP hydrolysis in synaptosomes from hippocampus and cerebral cortex (44% and 28%, respectively). These results suggest that changes in nucleotide hydrolysis may represent an important mechanism in the modulation of chronic epileptic activity in this model.
