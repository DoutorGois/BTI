Adult rats were subjected to 7-day combined stress with stochastic changes of stressors of different modalities (noise, vibration, pulsating bright light) along with mobility restriction and elevated temperature in the chamber during stress exposures (daily 30-min sessions). Circulatory disorders, inhibition of endothelial NO-synthase expression in endothelial cells of the microcirculatory bed, perivascular edema, pronounced degenerative changes, and enhanced expression of inducible NO synthase in CA3 pyramidal neurons in the ventral hippocampus of stressed 12-month-old rats were observed. These findings can attest to the involvement NOdependent mechanisms and different contribution of NO synthase isoforms into the formation of hippocampal neuronal damage.
