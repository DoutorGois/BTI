Antioxidant-like protein-1 (AOP-1) reduces the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species. In the present study, the agerelated change in AOP1 expression in the hippocampus among young, adult and aged gerbils was compared using western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that the protein expression of AOP1 was gradually and significantly increased in the hippocampus during the normal aging process. In addition, the agedependent increase in AOP1 immunoreactivity was also observed in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus proper; however, in the dentate gyrus, AOP1 immunoreactivity was not altered during the normal aging process. These results indicated that the expression of AOP1 is significantly increased in the hippocampus proper, but not in the dentate gyrus, during the normal aging process.
