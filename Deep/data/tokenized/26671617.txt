Diabetes is a chronic disease associated with depression whose pathophysiological mechanisms that associate these conditions are not fully elucidated. However, the activation of the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that participate of the tryptophan metabolism leading to a decrease of serotonin (5-HT) levels and whose expression is associated with an immune system activation, has been proposed as a common mechanism that links depression and diabetes. To test this hypothesis, diabetic (DBT) and normoglycemic (NGL) groups had the cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) and 5-HT and norepinephrine (NE) levels in the hippocampus (HIP) evaluated. Moreover, the effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX), IDO direct inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT), anti-inflammatory and IDO indirect inhibitor minocycline (MINO), or non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor ibuprofen (IBU) was evaluated in DBT rats submitted to the modified forced swimming test (MFST). After the behavioral test, the HIP was obtained for IDO expression by Western blotting analysis. DBT rats exhibited a significant increase in HIP levels of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 and a decrease in HIP 5-HT and NA levels. They also presented a depressive-like behavior which was reverted by all employed treatments. Interestingly, treatment with MINO, IBU, or FLX but not with 1-MT reduced the increased IDO expression in the HIP from DBT animals. Taken together, our data support our hypothesis that neuroinflammation in the HIP followed by IDO activation with a consequent decrease in the 5-HT levels can be a possible pathophysiological mechanism that links depression to diabetes.
