The development of tolerance to the behavioral and biochemical effects of ethanol was studied. Rats were made tolerant to ethanol by the administration of daily ethanol injections (3 g/kg, IP) for 7 and 28 days. Tolerance developed both to the behavioral (hypothermic, sedative) and biochemical (accumulation of dopamine metabolites in various brain areas) actions of ethanol. However, it was found that this tolerance to both the behavioral and biochemical effects of ethanol was no longer present when previously ethanol-tolerant animals were moved from their home environment and given a challenge dose of ethanol (2.5 g/kg; IP) in a new, unfamiliar environment. Our findings confirm that ethanol tolerance cannot be explained on the basis of a singular neurochemical event. The development of ethanol tolerance is due to a complex interaction between environmental, learning, and biochemical factors.
