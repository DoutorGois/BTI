Neuronal activity in the hippocampus was recorded in the awake monkey during presentation of visual and auditory stimuli from various directions. About 10% of the neurons coded visual and/or auditory information from unique directions. Some of these neurons were stimulus-selective, and others were not. Three types of neurons were identified by rotating the animals: egocentric and allocentric, and indeterminate. The results are consistent with a role of the hippocampus in spatial memory.
