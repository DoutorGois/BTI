Effects of sodium valproate (0.5-10 mM) on hippocampal cells (CA3 pyramidal cells and granule cells) of the guinea pig in vitro were studied by intra- and extracellular recording. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were markedly and reversibly augmented. Their shunting action as well as duration increased by more than 150%. Effects of locally administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) did not change significantly. Membrane characteristics such as membrane potential, membrane input resistance and action potential did not alter. Valproate suppressed spontaneous spiking and repetitive discharges evoked by GABA antagonists. It is concluded that valproate enhances GABAergic synaptic transmission by a presynaptic mechanism. However, postsynaptic mechanisms might be involved in the limitation of repetitive firing.
