With method of the radio binding assay (RBA), it was observed that in the present work that in normotensive Wistar rats, the specific binding of [3H] 8-OH-DPAT at 2.4 nmol/L concentration was about the same in hippocampus (7.62 +/- 0.24 pmol/mg), hypothalamus (8.18 +/- 0.63 pmol/mg) and lower brain stem (9.11 +/- 0.78 pmol/mg); whereas, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), these regional specific bindings were 2(+)-3+ times higher. Scatchard analyses showed that the Bmax was also higher than that of normotensive Wistar rats in hippocampus and hypothalamus, whereas the KD in hypothalamus was lower. The differences between SHR and normotensive rats in the 5-HT1A receptor contents in various brain regions appear to be related to one of the linking events in the generation of hypertension.
