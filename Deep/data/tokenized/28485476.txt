Cell death subsequent to or concurrent with neuroinflammation results in some damages like neuron loss and spatial memory impairment. In this study, we demonstrated the temporal pattern of neuroinflammation, necroptotic, and apoptotic cell deaths in hippocampus and frontal cortex following intracerebroventricular administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We evaluated receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1), RIP3, and two related metabolic enzymes including glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD) as necroptosis factors. Apoptosis pathway, antioxidant status and inflammatory cytokines were also assessed. Based on the probable role of these brain regions in working memory performance, spontaneous alternation was evaluated through the Y-maze apparatus. RIP1, RIP3, and then GLUL and GLUD, as well as apoptosis markers, inflammatory regulators, and antioxidant defense demonstrated different time-dependent patterns in hippocampus and frontal cortex. Interestingly, in hippocampus but not in frontal cortex, necroptosis resumed apoptosis. Our results in behavioral section revealed that neuroinflammation along with apoptosis and necroptosis pathways could lead to reversible short-term memory impairment after LPS injection. In conclusion, it can be suggested that there is a region-specific response of cell deaths regulators activation in hippocampus and frontal cortex. In addition, elucidating the time profile of events in response to neuroinflammation would be of great help in mechanistic studies and understanding of pathways interaction. J. Cell.
