Pharmacological data suggest that delta opioid receptors modulate learning and memory processes. In the present study, we investigated whether inactivation of the delta opioid receptor modifies hippocampus (HPC)- and striatum-dependent behaviors. We first assessed HPC-dependent learning in mice lacking the receptor (Oprd1(-/-) mice) or wild-type (WT) mice treated with the delta opioid antagonist naltrindole using novel object recognition, and a dual-solution cross-maze task. Second, we subjected mutant animals to memory tests addressing striatum-dependent learning using a single-solution response cross-maze task and a motor skill-learning task. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of delta opioid receptors reduced performance in HPC-dependent object place recognition. Place learning was also altered in Oprd1(-/-) animals, whereas striatum-dependent response and procedural learning were facilitated. Third, we investigated the expression levels for a large set of genes involved in neurotransmission in both HPC and striatum of Oprd1(-/-) mice. Gene expression was modified for several key genes that may contribute to alter hippocampal and striatal functions, and bias striatal output towards striatonigral activity. To test this hypothesis, we finally examined locomotor effects of dopamine receptor agonists. We found that Oprd1(-/-) and naltrindole-treated WT mice were more sensitive to the stimulant locomotor effect of SKF-81297 (D1/D5), supporting the hypothesis of facilitated striatonigral output. These data suggest, for the first time, that delta receptor activity tonically inhibits striatal function, and demonstrate that delta opioid receptors modulate learning and memory performance by regulating the HPC/striatum balance.
