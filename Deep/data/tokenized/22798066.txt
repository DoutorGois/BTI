Exposure to an enriched environment (EE) is beneficial to the structure and function of the brain. The added sensory, social, and spatial complexity of the EE also improves cognitive functions such as memory in both healthy brains and damaged or diseased brains, yet the underlying neural mechanisms of these cognitive improvements are poorly understood. In particular, studies that have examined the effects of EE on cellular function in the hippocampus, a structure critical for memory storage, have produced somewhat confusing results. Experiments performed in ex vivo hippocampal slices have reported a variety of EE effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity in both CA1 and the dentate gyrus. However, together with data from in vivo recordings made during and after the EE treatment, the overall results suggest an evolution of changes in neuronal function in the hippocampus, whereby there is an early transient increase in cell activity and plasticity that gives rise to more subtle long-term enhancements in cellular and network function that may contribute to enhanced hippocampus-dependent cognition.
