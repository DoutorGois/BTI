Prolonged electrical stimulation of the perforant pathway in the rat evokes epileptiform discharges in dentate granule cells and irreversibly damages hilar neurons. In this in vivo study, we demonstrate that similar perforant path stimulation in C57Bl/6 mice causes the same pattern of hippocampal neuron loss. Therefore, this mouse model of seizure-induced hippocampal injury can be used for a wide variety of studies in genetically altered conditions not available in rats.
