In slices of rat hippocampus, adenosine and its receptor agonist, 2-chloro-adenosine, were both found to (a) enhance the intracellular accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and (b) depress neuronal evoked responses to electrical stimulation. The differences in the dose/effect curves for the biochemical and electrophysiological changes cast doubt on a causal relationship between the two effects.
