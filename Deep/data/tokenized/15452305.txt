The multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein is suspected of contributing to pharmacoresistance in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To assess the role of functional variations in its coding gene (ABCB1) the authors genotyped 210 patients with TLE who were stratified according to their degree of drug resistance. They identified a common haplotype that when present in the homozygous state significantly increased the risk for pharmacoresistance.
