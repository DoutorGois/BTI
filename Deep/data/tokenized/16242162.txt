Postsynaptic glutamate AMPA receptors (AMPARs) can recycle between plasma membrane and intracellular pools. In contrast, trafficking of presynaptic AMPARs has not been investigated. AMPAR surface expression involves interactions between the GluR2 carboxy tail and various proteins including glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP), AMPA receptor-binding protein (ABP), protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1), N-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF). Here, peptides known to selectively block the above interactions were entrapped into synaptosomes to study the effects on the AMPA-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA) and [3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh) from rat hippocampal and cortical synaptosomes, respectively. Internalization of pep2-SVKI to prevent GluR2-GRIP/ABP/PICK1 interactions potentiated the AMPA-evoked release of [3H]NA but left unmodified that of [3H]ACh. Similar potentiation was caused by pep2-AVKI, the blocker of GluR2-PICK1 interaction. Conversely, a decrease in the AMPA-evoked release of [3H]NA, but not of [3H]ACh, was caused by pep2m, a selective blocker of the GluR2-NSF interaction. In the presence of pep2-SVKI the presynaptic AMPARs on noradrenergic terminals lost sensitivity to cyclothiazide. AMPARs releasing [3H]ACh, but not those releasing [3H]NA, were sensitive to spermine, suggesting that they are GluR2-lacking AMPARs. To conclude: (i) release-regulating presynaptic AMPARs constitutively cycle in isolated nerve terminals; (ii) the process exhibits neuronal selectivity; (iii) AMPAR trafficking and desensitization may be interrelated.
