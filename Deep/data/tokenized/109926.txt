The subicular cortices of the primate hippocampal formation form a physical and connectional link between the cortex of the temporal lobe and the hippocampus. Their direct connections with all classes of cortex in the temporal lobe except primary sensory cortex underscore the pivotal role of these areas in the potential interplay between the hippocampal formation and the association cortices.
