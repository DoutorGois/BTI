Elevated activities of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) have been reported previously in the brains of portacaval-shunted (PCS) rats, a model of chronic hepatic encephalopathy (HE). As L-arginine availability for nitric oxide synthesis depends on a specific uptake mechanism in neurons, we studied the kinetics of L-[3H]-arginine uptake into synaptosomes prepared from the brains of PCS rats. Results demonstrate that L-arginine uptake is significantly increased in cerebellum (60%; p < 0.01), cerebral cortex (42%; p < 0.01), hippocampus (56%; p < 0.01), and striatum (51%; p < 0.01) of PCS rats compared with sham-operated controls. Hyperammonemia in the absence of portacaval shunting also stimulated the transport of L-[3H]arginine; kinetic analysis revealed that the elevated uptake was due to increased uptake capacity (Vmax) without any change in affinity (Km). Incubation of cerebellar synaptosomes with ammonium acetate for 10 min caused a dose-dependent stimulation of L-[3H]arginine uptake. Neither portacaval shunting nor hyperammonemia had any significant effect on the synaptosomal uptake of NG-nitro-L-[3H]arginine. These studies demonstrate that increased NOS activity observed in experimental HE may result from increased availability of L-arginine resulting from a direct stimulatory effect of ammonia on L-arginine transport.
