The intention of the comparison of both low and high field was to examine which anatomical brain structures of cats were visible on low field images, as in clinical veterinary practice, 3 Tesla (T) magnets were of limited availability. The research was performed on 20 European short-haired male and female cats, aged 1-3 years, with body weight of 2-4 kg. 0.25 T magnetic resonance images of neurocranium were acquired in all using T2-weighted fast spin echo sequences with repetition time (TR) of 4010 ms and echo time (TE) of 90 ms in dorsal and transverse plane, and T2-weighted fast spine echo sequences with TR of 4290 ms and TE of 120 ms in sagittal plane. Based on a detailed catalogue of feline brain structures visible at 3 T in previously published studies, it was examined which structures were visible on low field images. Anatomic structures were identified and compared to assess the reliability of diagnoses made based on low-field magnetic resonance imaging. In low-field scans, 92 structures were identified. Elements of auditory, visual, motor pathways, hippocampus and cerebral ventricular system were distinguished. Low-field as well as high-field magnetic resonance imaging support the identification of local tissue lesions, metastasis, focal ischaemia and haemorrhage, disorders associated with ventricular system dilation and hydrocephalus. It also produced accurate images of the hippocampus, which contributes to reliable diagnoses of various forms of epilepsy in cats. Due to technical limitations, a low-field scanner is unlikely to visualize microtraumas, local inflammations, small haematomas or metastatic tumours.
