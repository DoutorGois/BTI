Patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy based on left hippocampal sclerosis often show severe verbal memory deficits. Recent studies suggest that memory formation in these patients may be reallocated to the right hemisphere owing to left hippocampal pathology. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine encoding-related activity of verbal items in temporal lobe epilepsy patients with left hippocampal sclerosis and patients with idiopathic epilepsy as a control group. Results demonstrated that patients with idiopathic epilepsy showed more activation in both left and right hippocampi. The temporal lobe epilepsy group showed enhanced activation in left fusiform gyrus. We discuss these results in terms of different strategy use by the groups.
