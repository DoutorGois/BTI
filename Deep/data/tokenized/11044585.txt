To explore the pathogenesis of benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), we determined effects of KCNQ-related M-channels (KCNQ-channels) on hippocampal glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) releases using microdialysis, and propagation of evoked field-potentials (FP) using multielectrode (64-ch)-dish system as two-dimensional monitoring. KCNQ-channel inhibitor, Dup996, enhanced hippocampal K(+)-evoked Glu and GABA releases without affecting basal releases of them. Dup996 unaffected FP-amplitude, but enhanced FP-propagation. The GABA(A)-receptor antagonist, bicuculline, enhanced the stimulatory effects of Dup996 on FP-propagation, however, this stimulatory effects of Dup996 were abolished by the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)/glutamate-receptor antagonist, DNQX. These results suggest that the occurrence of BFNC cannot be produced by KCNQ-channel dysfunction alone, but by reciprocal action between impaired KCNQ-channel and other unknown elements (possibly dysfunction of inhibitory neurotransmission system).
