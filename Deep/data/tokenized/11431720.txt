To assess the epileptogenic lesions, a series of 202 cases with temporal lobectomy were analyzed histopathologically. The severity of hippocampal neuronal loss in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy was quantitatively analyzed and compared against autopsy controls of patients who died of nonneurologic disorders. For the histopathologic diagnosis of neuronal migration disorder (NMD), immunohistochemical stains for neurofilament protein (NF-M/H) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and Bielschowsky silver stains were routinely performed. Histopathology of NMD was classified by the 4-grade system. MAP2 immunoreactivity was useful in the identification of loss of normal polarization of dendrites in the abnormal neurons. NF-M/H immunohistochemistry and silver stains effectively labeled microscopic or occult lesions of NMD (grade II and III). Ammon hom sclerosis (AHS) was identified in 73.3% and NMD in 57.9%. There was more than 50% neuronal cell loss in 82.8% of AHS, and variable degrees of cell loss were observed in the dual-pathology groups. The frequency of dual pathology (both AHS and NMD) was 65.0% and showed relatively equal distributions in grades I, II, III, whereas the pure NMD group were classified predominantly as grades II and III. NMD might be a basic pathogenic substrate causing temporal lobe epilepsy. The dual pathology may indicate the presence of epileptogenic lesions in the neocortical and temporolimbic areas.
