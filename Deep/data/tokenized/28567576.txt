PURPOSE: Previously showed that dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) may cause systemic inflammation and affect the central nervous system (CNS) in Wistar rats by increased levels of cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum (Longhi et al. Eur J Nutr 56(3):1003-1016, 1). Here, we aimed to clarifying the impact of diets with different TFA concentrations on cerebral tissue, focusing on hippocampus and cortex and behavioral performance. METHODS: Wistar rats were fed either a normolipidic or a hyperlipidic diet for 90 days; diets had the same ingredients except for fat compositions, concentrations, and calories. We used lard in the cis fatty acid (CFA) group and PHSO in the TFA group. The intervention groups were as follows: (1) low lard (LL), (2) high lard (HL), (3) low partially hydrogenated soybean oil (LPHSO), and (4) high partially hydrogenated soybean oil (HPHSO). Mitochondrial parameters, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) levels in brain tissue, and open field task were analyzed. RESULTS: A worse brain tissue response was associated with oxidative stress in cortex and hippocampus as well as impaired inflammatory and mitochondrial parameters at both PHSO concentrations and there were alterations in the behavioral performance. In many analyses, there were no significant differences between the LPHSO and HPHSO diets. CONCLUSIONS: Partially hydrogenated soybean oil impaired cortical mitochondrial parameters and altered inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, and the hyperlipidic treatment caused locomotor and exploratory effects, but no differences on weight gain in all treatments. These findings suggest that quality is more important than the quantity of fat consumed in terms of CFA and TFA diets.
