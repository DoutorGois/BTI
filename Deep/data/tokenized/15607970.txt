The transmission of information across neuronal synapses is an energetically taxing business. Sheng and colleagues monitored the localization of mitochondria following different levels of synaptic activation and discovered that these organelles change their distribution in interesting ways, stalling near synapses when neurons are activated and increasing their movement when neurons are silent (Li et al., 2004 [this issue of Cell]).
