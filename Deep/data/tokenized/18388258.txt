Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) in mice elicits impaired memory and cognitive functions. Here, we found that chronic oral administration of spiro[imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3,2-indan]-2(3H)-one (ZSET1446/ST101) (0.1-1 mg/kg/day), a novel cognitive enhancer, significantly improved memory deficits as assessed by Y-maze and novel object recognition tasks in OBX mice. Immunostaining of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum by using an anti-choline acetyltransferase antibody indicated that chronic ZSET1446 treatment did not rescue cholinergic neurons. However, chronic treatment significantly restored OBX-induced decreases both in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation without improving decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in the hippocampal CA1 region. Consistent with enhanced CaMKII and PKC phosphorylation, ZSET1446 treatment improved glutamate receptor 1 (Ser-831) phosphorylation in the hippocampal CA1 region. ZSET1446 treatment also significantly rescued impaired long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region of OBX mice. Taken together, the cognition-enhancing effect of ZSET1446 is probably mediated in part by stimulation of CaMKII and PKC activities, which in turn rescue impaired hippocampal LTP in OBX mice.
