It has recently been shown that hippocampal neurogenesis can be modulated either directly or indirectly by ascending cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain. In the present work, we sought to address whether extended training in a spatial navigation task would affect hippocampal neurogenesis in the presence of a severe and selective cholinergic depletion. Young female rats received stereotaxic injections of the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin into the basal forebrain nuclei and/or the cerebellar cortex. Starting from 4 to 5 weeks post-lesion, and for the subsequent 2 weeks, the animals were trained on paradigms of reference and working memory in the water maze and received single daily i.p. injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) at the end of each testing session. In line with previous observations, a dramatic 80% decrease in neuron proliferation was seen in the dentate gyrus of lesioned animals, as compared to vehicle-injected or intact controls. Interestingly, however, rats subjected to maze training over 2 weeks, irrespective of their learning success, exhibited significantly fewer newborn neurons than matched controls with no maze exposure. Thus, at least for the type of task used here, which has previously been shown to impose a certain degree of stress, extended training and learning does not appear to affect proliferation in the dentate gyrus.
