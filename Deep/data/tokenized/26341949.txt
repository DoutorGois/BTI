Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in neuronal plasticity, a key process related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, the relationship of peripheral levels of BDNF to cortical thickness and subcortical structures has not been extensively investigated. This study aims to investigate the relationship of peripheral serum BDNF levels to cortical thickness and volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala. Twenty-nine patients with schizophrenia and 32 healthy controls were included in this study. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans obtained in a 1.5 T scanner were performed in all subjects. Images were processed using Freesurfer software. Blood samples were collected on the same day of the MRI scan for BDNF peripheral levels. Vertex-wise analysis revealed significantly thinner cortex in patients compared with controls. BDNF levels and cortical thickness showed different patterns of correlation for patients and healthy controls in one cluster in the right hemisphere distributed across the supramarginal, postcentral, and inferior frontal cortices.
