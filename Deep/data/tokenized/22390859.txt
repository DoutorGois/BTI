In patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), previous studies have reported the decrease of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentration and the increase of myo-inositol (MI) concentration using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). However, it remains to be investigated what aspects of cognition these metabolite changes reflect. In this study we evaluated the correlations between the subtests of Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) and the concentrations of NAA and MI. The study group was composed of 42 patients with aMCI and 67 patients with AD. 1H-MR spectra with a single voxel-point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) at a short echo time were acquired from the bilateral hippocampi and posterior cingulate gyrus. Positive correlations were shown between the NAA concentration in the left hippocampus and verbal memory, visual memory, general memory, attention and delayed recall; and furthermore, between the NAA concentration in the right hippocampus and verbal memory and general memory. Negative correlations were shown between the MI concentration in the left hippocampus and verbal memory, general memory, and delayed recall, and between the MI concentration in the right hippocampus and verbal memory. There was no significant correlation between any subtest of WMS-R and these two metabolite concentrations in the posterior cingulate gyrus. These findings suggest that bilateral, especially left hippocampal NAA and MI concentrations are associated with memory dysfunction observed in patients with aMCI and AD. In contrast, NAA and MI concentrations in the posterior cingulate gyrus may be less related to memory function than those in the hippocampus.
