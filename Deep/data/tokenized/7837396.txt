One of the most prominent phenomena that occurs during the early phase of cerebral ischemia has been shown to be the immunohistochemical collapse of cytoskeletal proteins. Among these, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2) has been shown to be vulnerable to ischemic injuries. In order to select a suitable volatile anaesthetic from the standpoint of cytoskeletal protein breakdown during cerebral ischemia, we compared the effect of isoflurane, halothane and sevoflurane on MAP 2 degradation during 20 min of forebrain ischemia in the rat. Under 1 MAC of three volatile anesthetics, forebrain ischemia was induced by the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery combined with a lowering of mean arterial pressure to 50 mmHg. Immediately after cerebral ischemia, four regions of the brain, the frontoparietal cortex, brainstem, hippocampus and cerebellum, were removed separately and homogenized. Subsequently, MAP 2 from each region was quantitatively measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAP 2 in the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus was significantly protected from degradation with isoflurane anaesthesia more than with halothane and sevoflurane anaesthesia.
