OBJECTIVES: To study the role of altered tissue osmolality on the characteristics and propagation dynamics of seizure activity and on interictal activity, in a low-Mg(+2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) model of recurrent seizures, using the immature (P8-P25) intact isolated mouse hippocampus. METHODS: Recordings were obtained extracellularly from a single site in the CA1 region and from multiple sites along the septotemporal axis measuring spontaneous epileptiform field activity in ACSFs of different osmolalities. RESULTS: In normal osmolar ACSF (310 mOsmol), the average duration of recorded seizures was 90+/-10 s and the average peak amplitude was 0.9+/-0.1 mV. In a hypoosmolar ACSF (270 mOsmol), the seizures were significantly prolonged at 165+/-20 s (p<0.05) with a peak amplitude of 1.2+/-0.3 mV, whereas interictal activity was suppressed. Hyperosmolar ACSF (340 mOsmol) reduced the duration (65+/-15 s) and peak amplitude (0.6+/-0.1 mV, p<0.05) from control, but interictal activity was not affected. No differences in seizure recurrence rate were noted in all three osmolar states. CONCLUSION: The present study, the first to assess of the role of altered tissue osmolality in an intact in vitro preparation, demonstrates that changes in perfusate osmolality play a significant role on the amplitude, duration, and propagation velocity of seizure-like events, and the characteristics of interictal activity, without affecting seizure recurrence rate. SIGNIFICANCE: Increasing tissue osmolality should be considered as a valid target for anticonvulsant treatment.
