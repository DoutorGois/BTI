The ultrastructure of axon terminals in the anteroventral thalamic nucleus arising in the cingulate cortex and in the presubiculum was examined using the anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in rats. Anterogradely labeled axonal arborizations arising from the posterior cingulate cortex were concentrated bilaterally in the ventral part of the anteroventral nucleus. In electron micrographs these thalamic terminals arising from the posterior cingulate cortex were consistently small, contained round vesicles, and established asymmetric contacts on distal dendritic processes. In contrast, the axonal arborizations arising from the presubiculum were concentrated ipsilaterally in the dorsal part of the anteroventral nucleus and comprised two identifiable populations of terminals. The smaller terminals, which contained densely packed round vesicles, established asymmetric synaptic contacts on distal dendritic processes and resembled the posterior cingulate cortex terminals described above. The other population of the presubiculum terminals consisted of medium-sized terminals. These contained loosely packed round vesicles and established asymmetric synaptic contacts on proximal dendritic processes. These results indicate that the posterior cingulate cortex and the presubiculum project differentially upon the anteroventral thalamic nucleus. They also indicate that although the posterior cingulate cortex gives rise to only one type of corticothalamic terminal, the presubiculum gives rise to two types of corticothalamic terminals. When taken together, these data suggest that these different limbic cortical areas might subserve distinct roles in the anteroventral thalamic nucleus function.
