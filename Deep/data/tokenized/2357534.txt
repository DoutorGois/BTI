Changes in ganglioside composition, biosynthesis and individual distribution were studied in hippocampal regions after unilateral destruction of the entorhinal cortex. After 1 and 3 days postlesion (dpl), a decrease in ganglioside content was detected in area dentata (AD) and pyramidal cell regions CA1-CA3 (CA), both ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion. By 5 dpl all the values had returned to control values, except in AD which showed a dramatic increase in total ganglioside content reaching a maximum at 12 dpl. By 30 dpl this area also showed control content. A significant increase in biosynthesis of gangliosides was observed at 5 and 8 dpl in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the lesion without changes in the contralateral counterpart. Individual ganglioside distribution showed a pronounced change in GM1 and GQ1b with small changes in the other major gangliosides. Significant differences were observed in the distribution of gangliosides between the two hippocampal regions studied in unoperated control animals. GD1a was more concentrated in AD, whereas GQ1b, GT1b and GD1b predominated in CA. The data presented here indicate that important modifications in ganglioside content as well as pattern occur in the deafferented hippocampus a phenomenon that could be related with the known effect of gangliosides on neuritogenesis observed in cell culture studies.
