Activity from ventral subicular and hippocampal CA1 neurons was recorded in rats exploring a 4-arm radial maze in which the local and distal cues could be manipulated. Cells from both regions exhibited place fields, although ventral subicular neurons had larger fields than hippocampal cells. Rotation of the local and distal cues in opposite directions produced movement of the place fields in either direction or a complete change in firing pattern. Simplifying the environment also produced changes in place field location. Despite similarities between regions, subiculum fields decreased in size whereas hippocampal fields increased in the simple environment. These findings suggest that subicular cells may receive converging input from several hippocampal neurons and code more complex configurations of the cues.
