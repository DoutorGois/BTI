African giant rats (AGR) are large nocturnal rodents with well-developed olfactory abilities uniquely linked to cognition. The post natal proliferation of neurons (adult neurogenesis), is thought to play an important role in spatial memory and learning. Eighteen brains of the African giant rats (Cricetomys gambianus, Waterhouse) belonging to three age groups (neonates n = 6, juveniles n = 6 and adults n = 6) were examined by immunohistochemistry, using antibodies for proliferating cells (Ki-67), and immature neurons (Doublecortin, DCX). Mean brain weights were 0.40 +/- 0.00 g; 4.48 +/- 0.43 g and 5.48 +/- 0.56 g for neonate, juvenile and adult brains respectively. Our results show positive cell proliferation in the subventricular (SVZ) zone of the lateral ventricle and in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus but at low levels in adults compared to juveniles. Estimate of the mean total proliferative Ki-67 positive cells in the SVZ and DG in the neonates was 21145 +/- 8395, and 11800 +/- 1230; brains from juvenile AGRs, 45530 +/- 13950 and 12480 +/- 7860 and from adult brains, (6880 +/- 340 and 1130 +/- 150) respectively. Juvenile AGR in particular, stained positively in potential sites such as the piriform and somatosensory cortices, striatum and cerebellum. This intensity of the proliferating cells within the dentate gyrus in the juvenile and adult brains could be associated with a role in the cognitive functions of landmine detection and tuberculosis diagnosis after olfactory training of the African giant rat. The juvenile rats are proposed as the most suited for experimental research and olfactory training.
