The recent use of novel high-resolution imaging methods of living neurons in vitro has led to a change in the view of the dendritic spine, from a stable, long-term memory storage device to that of a dynamic structure, which can undergo fast morphological changes over periods of hours and even minutes. While the functional significance of these changes in spine dimensions is still obscure, we have obtained evidence to indicate that the length of the spine has a critical role in determining the degree of interaction between the spine head and the parent dendrite, such that longer spines are more independent of the parent dendrite than the short ones. We have now studied the role of intracellular calcium stores in determining the magnitude and time course of spine responses to a calcium surge evoked in response to glutamate, which causes an influx of calcium, and the results indicate that spine morphology has an important role in determining the involvement of the stores in calcium responses. Since spines can change their length over a rather short time, these results indicate that changes in spine length serve to fine-tune the interaction between the spine head and the parent dendrite on a continuous basis.
