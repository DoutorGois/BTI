PURPOSE: The aim of the study wad to estimate a potentially neuroprotective effect of topiramate (TPM) in the experimental model of FS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 24 young male rats divided in 4 groups were involved in the study. Febrile seizures were induced by placing the animals in 45 degrees C warm water bath for four consecutive days. TPM at the dose 80 mg/kg b.m. was administered: before the FS and immediately after the FS. FS group and control rats received only normal saline. Thereafter hippocampal slices were prepared to performing histological and morphometric examination. RESULTS: Morphometric investigations revealed that FS caused death of 60% of the neurons in sector CA1 and a half of them in sector CA3. Histological examinations of hippocampal slices showed that TPM at a dose of 80 mg/kg b.m., administered before the seizures, considerably improved CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell survival. Similar neuroprotective effect, but in a markedly lesser degree was observed when TPM was administrated after the FS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings seem to confirm that FS exert a strong destructive effect on the sensitive hippocampal neurons and on the neuroprotective properties of TPM in this process, which may have practical implications. It can be assumed that in children with recurrent and prolonged FS, prophylactic drug administration could prevent hippocampal sclerosis and development of symptomatic epilepsy.
