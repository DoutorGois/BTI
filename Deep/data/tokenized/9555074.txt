We examined the expression patterns of the DP5 gene, which encodes a protein with apoptosis-inducing activity, in the developing nervous system of mice. This gene was primarily expressed in the spinal motor neurons and peripheral sensory ganglia of mouse embryos and transiently in the postnatal brain, particularly in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These expression patterns suggest that the DP5 gene may be involved in the apoptosis, if not all, of the developing nervous system.
