Preapplication of peptide piracetam analogue pyroglutamyl-asparagine amide to rat hippocampal slices facilitates long-term potentiation of focal responses in the CA1 field after weak tetanization of the synaptic input (30 pulses, 100 Hz). This treatment normalized the development of long-term potentiation after standard tetanization (100 pulses, 100 Hz) impaired by ethanol.
