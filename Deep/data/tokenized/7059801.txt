The contributions of membrane potential and postsynaptic discharge during afferent fibre tetanization to the generation of long-lasting synaptic enhancement was studied by intra- and extracellular recording in the CAl region of hippocampal slices. Neither parameter affected the magnitude of intracellular synaptic enhancement. Thus, if postsynaptic integration is involved in the control of the enhancement process, the integration must be chemically rather than electrically mediated.
