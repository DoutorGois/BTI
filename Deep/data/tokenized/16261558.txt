Performance in hippocampus-dependent and other tasks can be improved by exposure to an enriched environment (EE), but the physiological changes in neural function that may mediate these effects are poorly understood. To date, there have been conflicting reports regarding potential mechanisms, such as an increase in basal synaptic transmission, an increase in cell excitability, or altered synaptic plasticity. Here, we reexamined in freely moving animals the conditions under which varying degrees of EE exposure might lead to increases in synaptic or neural function in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically implanted with stimulating and recording electrodes in the perforant path and dentate gyrus, respectively, and housed singly in standard cages. After stable recordings were established for field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and population spikes (PSs), the effects of various degrees of periodic novel environment exposure for 19 days were assessed. Exposure to an EE increased fEPSPs, but only when animals were kept in nominally low-stress housing conditions. An increase in granule-cell excitability, as evidenced by PS increases, was induced by all environmental treatments with the greatest effect being induced by overnight EE exposure. EE exposure did not change the level of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a moderate high-frequency tetanus, but continued EE exposure post-tetanus produced a significantly faster decay of LTP relative to control animals. These results suggest that, in adult animals, EE exposure may augment hippocampal information processing, but may also speed turnover of information in the hippocampus during the maintenance period.
