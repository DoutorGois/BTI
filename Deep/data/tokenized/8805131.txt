Two heme oxygenase (HO) proteins have been identified to date; HO-1, a stress-induced protein, and HO-2, a constitutively expressed isoform. Recently, it was demonstrated that HO-1 mRNA expression is increased following transient global ischemia. The present study examined the effects of global and focal ischemia on HO-1 and HO-2 protein, using immunocytochemistry. Following 20 min of ischemia (rat 4 vessel occlusion model with hypotension) and 6 h of recirculation, increased HO-1 immunoreactivity was evident in hippocampal neurons. After 24 h of recirculation, HO-1 was observed in both hippocampal neurons and astroglial cells. By 72 h, expression was primarily glial and restricted to CA1 and CA3c. In addition to hippocampus, HO-1 was also evident in both neurons and glia in cerebral cortex and thalamus, and in striatal glial cells. Twenty-four hours following permanent focal ischemia, HO-1 immunoreactivity was observed in astroglial cells in the penumbra region surrounding the infarct. In contrast to HO-1, the pattern of HO-2 immunoreactivity was not altered following transient global or permanent focal ischemia. The increased expression of HO-1 following ischemia may confer protection against oxidative stress, but might also contribute to the subsequent neuronal degeneration.
