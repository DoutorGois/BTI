The effects of intraventricular administration of ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF64A) were studied in male Wistar rats. Bilateral injections of AF64A (3 nm/3 mcl) reduced the reactions to biological alarm signal and produced a decrease in the open-field activity 3 weeks after this lesion. The lesioned rats also displayed deficit in retention of a passive avoidance task.
