OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Jingqianshu granule (JQS), a Chinese medicinal formula on the expression levels of ERa and ERbeta mRNA in hypothalamus and hippocampus of PMS model rats with liver-qi depression. METHOD: The female SD rats were divided randomly into three groups: control, model and model plus Jingqianshu granule. We make the model rats of PMS with liver-qi depression using the method of emotional stimulation multiple factors. Then we applied semi-quantitative RT-PCR gene amplification technology to detect the expression levels of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA in the brain regions of all rats. RESULT: Compared with the control group, the expression levels of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA in hypothalamus and hippocampus of model rats were higher significantly (P < 0.05), while in the JQS-administration group, the expression levels of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA were lower than model group (P < 0.05), and were no difference with the control group. CONCLUSION: The JQS granule can down-regulate the expression levels of ERalpha and ERbeta mRNA in hypothalamus and hippocampus, which maybe one of the mechanism to treat PMS with Liver-qi depression.
