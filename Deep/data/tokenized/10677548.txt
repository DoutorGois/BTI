Experimental and modeling efforts suggest that rhythms in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that are in the beta range (12-29 Hz) have a different dynamical structure than that of gamma (30-70 Hz). We use a simplified model to show that the different rhythms employ different dynamical mechanisms to synchronize, based on different ionic currents. The beta frequency is able to synchronize over long conduction delays (corresponding to signals traveling a significant distance in the brain) that apparently cannot be tolerated by gamma rhythms. The synchronization properties are consistent with data suggesting that gamma rhythms are used for relatively local computations whereas beta rhythms are used for higher level interactions involving more distant structures.
