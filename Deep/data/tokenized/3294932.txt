Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunocytochemistry was used to study GABAergic neurons and synapses in intracerebral allografts of the rat hippocampus and fascia dentata. Tissue blocks of regio inferior of Ammon's horn (hippocampal field CA3) or of the fascia dentata were taken from newborn rats and transplanted to the hippocampal region of young adult rats. After 6 1/2 months' survival the recipient brains were fixed by perfusion and serially sectioned on a Vibratome. Sections containing the transplant and/or the host hippocampal region were immunostained for GAD and flat-embedded in Araldite for a correlated light and electron microscopic analysis. Immunostained neurons and terminals in the transplants were compared to immunoreactive elements in the hippocampus and fascia dentata of the hosts and other, normal rats. As in the hippocampal formation in situ, GAD-immunoreactive neurons and terminals in the transplants were observed in all layers. In dentate transplants a preponderance of immunostained cells was found just beneath the granule cell layer. In both hippocampal and dentate transplants, immunoreactive terminals were most abundant in the cell layers where they formed characteristic pericellular baskets around the pyramidal and granule cell bodies. In the electron microscope, the transplant GAD-immunoreactive neurons exhibited numerous cytoplasmic organelles, deeply infolded nuclei, and nuclear rods. Immunoreactive terminals formed symmetric synaptic contacts on the cell bodies, dendritic shafts, and spines of transplant pyramidal cells, granule cells, and hilar neurons. These are normal characteristics of GAD-immunoreactive neurons and terminals as also observed in the hippocampus of the host rats and the normal controls. Our results demonstrate that GABAergic neurons survive transplantation and develop a cell-specific morphology that includes the axonal projections.
