The ability to simultaneously quantify multiple signaling molecule protein levels from microscopic neural tissue samples would be of great benefit to deciphering how they affect brain function. This follows from evidence that indicates signaling molecules can be pleiotropic and can have complex interactive behavior that is regionally and cellularly heterogeneous. Multiplexed examination of tissue proteins has been exceedingly difficult because of the absence of available techniques. This void now has been removed by the commercial availability of bead-based immunoassays for targeted proteins that allow analyses of up to 100 (6-150 kDa) proteins from as little as 12 microl. Thus far used only for sera (human and mouse) and culture media, we demonstrate here that sensitive (as low as 2 pg/ml), wide-ranging (up to 2-32 000 pg/ml), accurate (8% intra-assay covariance) and reliable (4-7% inter-assay covariance) measurements can be made of nine exemplary cytokines (e.g., IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) simultaneously not only from rat serum but, for the first time, also brain tissue. Furthermore, we describe animal handling procedures that minimize stress as determined by serum glucocorticoid levels since they can influence cytokine expression.
