There is a bewildering variety of hyperpolarizing potentials which control activity in hippocampal pyramidal cells. These include an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) with early and late components, voltage- and calcium-dependent potassium conductances, a voltage-dependent potassium conductance modulated by muscarinic agents (the M-current), and a complex and poorly understood afterhyperpolarization following epileptiform bursts. In hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells, mossy fiber stimulation elicits an IPSP which is made up of two readily separable components. Using the in vitro slice preparation, we investigated the underlying ionic basis of these IPSP components and compared them to other hyperpolarizing potentials characteristic of the CA3 neurons. Intracellular recordings were obtained and then tissue was exposed to bathing medium low in chloride concentration or high in potassium concentration; the ion "blockers" EGTA (intracellular); tetraethylammonium (TEA) (intra- and extracellular), and barium and cobalt (extracellular); and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/chloride antagonists penicillin, bicuculline and picrotoxin.
