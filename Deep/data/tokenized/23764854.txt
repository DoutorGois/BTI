Accumulation evidence shows that beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a neurotoxic and accumulation of Abeta is responsible for the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is currently not fully understood what makes Abeta toxic and accumulated. Previous studies demonstrate that Abeta is a suitable substrate for glycation, producing one form of the advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). We speculated that Abeta-AGE formation may exacerbate the neurotoxicity. To explore whether the Abeta-AGE is more toxic than the authentic Abeta and to understand the molecular mechanisms, we synthesized glycated Abeta by incubating Abeta with methylglyoxal (MG) in vitro and identified the formation of glycated Abeta by fluorescence spectrophotometer. Then, we treated the primary hippocampal neurons cultured 8 days in vitro with Abeta-AGE or Abeta for 24 h. We observed that glycation exacerbated neurotoxicity of Abeta with upregulation of receptor for AGE (RAGE) and activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), whereas simultaneous application of RAGE antibody or GSK-3 inhibitor reversed the neuronal damages aggravated by glycated Abeta. Thereafter, we found that Abeta is also glycated with an age-dependent elevation of AGEs in Tg2576 mice, whereas inhibition of Abeta-AGE formation by subcutaneously infusion of aminoguanidine for 3 months significantly rescued the early cognitive deficit in mice. Our data reveal for the first time that the glycated Abeta is more toxic. We propose that the glycated Abeta with the altered secondary structure may be a more suitable ligand than Abeta for RAGE and subsequent activation of GSK-3 that can lead to cascade pathologies of AD, therefore glycated Abeta may be a new therapeutic target for AD.
