Idazoxan (IDA), an alpha 2 receptor antagonist which increases firing rate of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) and release of noradrenaline (NA) in target structures, was used to study the neuromodulatory effects of NA in the hippocampus in awake rats. After IDA the population spike in the dentate gyrus (DG), evoked by a single pulse to the perforant path, was greatly enhanced with no effect of the drug on excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). Paired pulses with short interpulse intervals (25-30 ms) produced inhibition of the response to the second pulse which was increased by IDA. This drug effect was independent of its effect on the amplitude of the first spike, since the increase in inhibition was seen at stimulation intensities which did not increase the response amplitude to the initial pulse. Thus both excitability and inhibitory processes can be enhanced in the same population of neurons by an alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist.
