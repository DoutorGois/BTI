In the present work we demonstrate by means of quantitative in vitro autoradiography that the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is able to increase the number of serotonin1 (5-HT1) binding sites in the dorsal subiculum of the rat hippocampus and to decrease them in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Bilateral adrenalectomy (ADX) for 6 days counteracted the stimulatory effect of VIP on 5-HT1 binding sites in the dorsal subiculum, but did not modify the inhibitory effect of the peptide in the SCN. Moreover, ADX increased 5-HT1 binding sites in response to VIP in various subfields of the hippocampus as well as in the superior colliculus and in the dorsal lateral septum, but this effect was not observed in normal or in ADX rats bearing a corticosterone implant. The present data are suggestive of a possible interaction between VIP and 5-HT in the regulation of the SCN and of a modulatory role of adrenal steroids in VIP activity in the hippocampal formation.
