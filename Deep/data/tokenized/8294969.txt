1. The possibility of long-lasting modifications of glutamatergic responses after anoxic-aglycemic (AA) episodes was investigated in CA1 hippocampal neurons of adult slices. Bicuculline (10 microM) was continuously bath applied to block GABAA receptor-mediated currents. AA episodes were induced by brief (1.30-3 min) perfusions with a glucose free artificial-cerebro-spinal-fluid (ACSF) saturated with 95% N2-5% CO2. 2. In presence of (0.6 mM) Mg2+ and a low concentration of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 1 microM), the Schaffer collateral field EPSPs consisted of an early AMPA receptor-mediated component and a late N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated component. The former was blocked by (10 microM) CNQX and the latter by (50) microM D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV). The AA episode induced a selective long-term potentiation (LTP) of the NMDA receptor-mediated component [+70 +/- 13% (mean +/- SE), P < or = 0.008, n = 9] without affecting significantly the AMPA receptor-mediated component (+2 +/- 4, P < or = 0.86 n = 9). This selective LTP is due to an enhanced efficacy of synaptic transmission and will be referred to as anoxic LTP. 3. In slices perfused with an ACSF containing a physiological concentration of (1.3 mM) Mg2+ and no CNQX, the intracellularly recorded excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) was mixed (AMPA/NMDA) at -65 mV and exclusively mediated by AMPA receptors at -100 mV. At -65 mV, the AA episode induced a persistent potentiation of the EPSP (peak amplitude potentiated by 43 +/- 6%, P < or = 0.008, n = 9, 1 h after return to control ACSF). This potentiated component of the EPSP was fully sensitive to (50 microM) D-APV. The CNQX-sensitive AMPA receptor-mediated component was not affected by the AA episode (-5.7 +/- 6%, P < or = 0.123, n = 9). Furthermore, at -100 mV a large APV-sensitive component appeared after the AA episode (+58 +/- 18% of the peak amplitude, P < or = 0.018, n = 9). Therefore, the AA episode induced a selective LTP of the NMDA receptor-mediated component of the EPSP. 4. A robust LTP (+50.0 +/- 7.5%, P < or = 0.008, n = 12) of the NMDA receptor-mediated intracellular EPSP was also observed when AMPA receptors were fully and continuously blocked by (15 microM) CNQX.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
