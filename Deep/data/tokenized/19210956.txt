Brief whole body exposures of rats to weak (1 microT) complex magnetic fields whose patterns induce long term potential (LTP) when applied as electric current to hippocampal slices produced powerful behavioral changes. Rats exposed for 30 min before but not 30 min after hourly training sessions for spatial memory displayed impairments comparable to those elicited by complete electrode-induced saturation of hippocampal activity. Exposure to the same LTP-patterned magnetic fields after weaning during the induction of limbic seizures produced diminished learning of conditioned contextual fear during adulthood. However exposure to magnetic fields designed to simulate a "virtual" hippocampal state during acquisition of a timed inhibitory task (DRL) facilitated performance. These results show that physiologically-patterned magnetic fields can produce dramatic changes in behavior when they are applied during states associated with marked synaptic plasticity.
