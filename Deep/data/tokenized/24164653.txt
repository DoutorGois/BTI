How the number of docked vesicles is regulated is still unclear. Following chronic activity blockade the number of docked vesicles increases, providing a model through which to address this issue. We tested the hypotheses that the number of docked vesicles is regulated with the size of the terminal, and by the level of Rab3-interacting molecule 1/2 (RIM1/2). We immobilized mouse hippocampal slice cultures by high-pressure freezing after 3 days of tetrodotoxin treatment and analysed them by electron microscopy. The number of docked vesicles, the size of the active zones and the amount of GluA2 were increased after activity blockade. However, there was no modification of either the total number of synaptic vesicles or the area of presynaptic profiles. Surprisingly, immunocytochemistry showed no change in the mean level of RIM1/2 per terminal but its distribution was modified. Additionally, there was no modification of the mean frequency or amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, but the distribution of amplitudes was modified. These results indicate a specific homeostatic regulation of the synaptic junction. The number of docked vesicles does not seem to be regulated by the amount of RIM1/2. The modification of the distribution, but not the amount, of RIM1/2 may explain the contradiction between the morphological and electrophysiological findings.
