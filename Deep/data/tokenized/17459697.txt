Progesterone regulates diverse functions in the rabbit brain through the interaction with its nuclear receptor (PR). Although PR protein has been detected in some regions of the rabbit forebrain, PR mRNA expression and distribution in the rabbit brain are unknown. Hence, we investigated these issues by in situ hybridization. New Zealand adult female rabbits were ovariectomized and treated with vehicle or estradiol (5 microg/(kg day)) for 3 days. The results show an extended distribution of PR mRNA expression in the rabbit brain. The highest expression was detected in preoptic area and hypothalamic anterior nuclei such as paraventricular, periventricular and arcuate nuclei. A high expression was also detected in thalamic and telencephalic areas, including hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Estradiol treatment induced an increase in PR mRNA expression in many brain areas, particularly in the hippocampus and the hypothalamic and preoptic area regions. The wide distribution of PR mRNA in the rabbit brain suggests that progesterone through PR activation is involved in several functions apart from reproductive behavior in rabbits, and that PR expression is up-regulated by estradiol in the rabbit brain.
