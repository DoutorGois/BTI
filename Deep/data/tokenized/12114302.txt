IL-15, a key cytokine linking innate and acquired immunity, is expressed in many cell types and tissues. Recent data indicate constitutive expression of IL-15 in human neural cell lines and tissues. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression patterns of mRNA encoding IL-15 and IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ralpha) isoforms in select structures of human fetal brain. We report that mRNA for IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha isoforms were expressed in all tested brain structures: cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and thalamus. However, the levels of IL-15 and IL-15Ralpha mRNA were higher in the hippocampus and cerebellum in comparison with cortex and thalamus. Moreover, higher levels of cytosol in comparison with membrane-bound IL-15 isoform were present in all brain structures. The constitutive, but distinct, expression of IL-15 and its receptors in select human fetal brain structures suggests that IL-15 plays a role in their development and physiology.
