c-Fos protein-like immunoreactivity (IR) was investigated in the rat brain following an application of weak anodal direct current to the surface of the unilateral sensorimotor cortex in an attempt to elucidate the cellular and molecular bases of central plasticity. Anodal polarization resulted in a massive increase in c-Fos protein-like IR in neurons of the cingulate, piriform, frontoparietal cortices, and hippocampus ipsilateral to the polarization. The effects were dependent upon the duration and intensity of currents applied. The time-dependent induction of c-Fos protein-like IR was maximal at 1 h, became weaker by 6 h, and almost returned to the baseline within 24 h following polarization. When MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-di-hydro-5H- dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate], a noncompetitive antagonist for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, was injected intraperitoneally, the induction of this nuclear protein was reduced or completely blocked in both hemispheres, except around the polarized point itself, as a function of the time and dosage. These results suggest that the proto-oncogene c-fos is rapidly and transiently activated in the brain following anodal polarization and this activation is mediated by NMDA receptors.
