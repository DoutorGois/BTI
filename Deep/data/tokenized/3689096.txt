The finding of marked disorganization of the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer in the brains of schizophrenic patients has recently been reported. The present study was undertaken to determine whether similar abnormalities could be found in the brains of a population of schizophrenic patients, most of whom were never exposed to neuroleptics. Though statistical analysis of 2808 pyramidal cells failed to reveal significantly greater disorganization in a group of seven alleged schizophrenic brains than in brains of age-matched, nonpsychotic controls, the data suggest a relationship between the degree of pyramidal cell disarray and the severity of behavioral impairment due to psychosis. The implications and pitfalls in interpreting these findings are discussed.
