OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of curcumin on the expressions of AKT (serine-threonine kinase, AKT, also known as PKB) and p-AKT (phosphated serine-threonine kinase, p-AKT) in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice of the AD model. METHOD: Three-month-old APP/PS1 double transgenic mice were randomly divided into the model group, the rosiglitazone (10 mg kg-1 . d-1) group, and high (400 mg . kg-1 d-1), medium (200 mg . kg-1 d-1) and low (100 mg kg-1 d-1) dosecurcumin groups. Non-transgenic mice of the same age and background were selected as the control group ( n = 12). After all of the six groups were intragastrically administered for consecutively three months, the protein expressions of AKT and p-AKT in hippocampus CA1 area were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULT: The results of immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of AKT and p-AKT positive cells in hippocampus CA1 area significantly decreased in the model group (P <0. 05 and P < 0. 01). Compared with the model group, AKT and p-AKT positive cells of hippocampus CA1 area increased obviously in the rosiglitazone group and high and medium dose curcumin group (P <0.05 or P <0.01) ,especially the medium dose group (P <0.01). The results of Western blot were consistent with that of immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSION: Curcumin can recover the decreased AKT and p-AKT cells in hippocampus CAl area of APP/PS1 double transgenic mice of the AD model, suggesting that curcumin may regulate AKT and its phosphorylation process, as well as PI3K/AKT insulin signal transduction pathway, and show the anti-AD effect.
