Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is associated with increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and brain edema, which lead to the deterioration of patient prognosis. Resveratrol serves a neuroprotective role in I/R injury, and this role may be associated with its antioxidative effects. However, resveratrol's mechanism of action in cerebral I/R injury remains to be fully understood. In order to investigate the effect of resveratrol in cerebral I/Rinduced injury, male SpragueDawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: The shamoperation group, the I/R group and the edaravone and resveratrol groups (I/R + E and I/R + R groups). Infarct volume was evaluated by 2,3,5tripenyltetrazolium chloride staining, brain edema was evaluated by the water content in the reperfused brain and malondialdehyde (MDA) was measured by the thiobarbituric acid method. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were measured using the Total Superoxide Dismutase Assay kit. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels in the hippocampus and cortex were measured by ELISA, and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) expression was measured by immunohistochemical staining and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that resveratrol reduced the infarct volume and the incidence of brain edema and reduced neurological deficits. These outcomes were accompanied by reduced levels of MDA, iNOS and AQP4, and increased SOD levels in cerebral I/R injury. In conclusion, resveratrol protected against cerebral I/R injury by ameliorating oxidative stress and reducing AQP4 expression.
