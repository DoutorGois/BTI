Schaffer collaterals (Sch. coll.) projection and perforant path (PP) fibers in the hippocampal slices were stimulated in the presence of 0.8 microM D-[3H]aspartic acid--a marker of glutamergic nerve terminals. The activation of these fibers evoked a frequency and sodium-dependent increase of D-[3H]aspartate uptake. The increase of D-aspartate uptake during Schaffer collaterals stimulation was much higher than during perforant path stimulation. The stimulation of Sch. coll. nerve endings, which was preceded by a high frequency stimulation of these fibers (potentiation), evoked a decrease of D-aspartate uptake as compared to stimulated controls.
