It has been previously reported that Nigella sativa oil (NSO) and thymoquinone (TQ), active constituent of N. sativa seeds oil, may prevent oxidative injury in various models. Therefore, we considered the possible effect of TQ and NSO on lipid peroxidation level following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in rat hippocampus. Male NMRI rats were divided into nine groups, namely, sham, control, ischemia and ischemia treated with NSO or TQ. TQ (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg), NSO (0.048, 0.192 and 0.384 mg/kg), phenytoin (50 mg/kg, as positive control) and saline (10 ml/kg, as negative control) were injected intraperitoneally immediately after reperfusion and the administration was continued every 24h for 72 h after induction of ischemia. The transient global cerebral ischemia was induced using four-vessel-occlusion method for 20 min. Lipid peroxidation level in hippocampus portion was measured as malondialdehyde (MDA) based on its reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) following ischemic insult. The transient global cerebral ischemia induced a significant increase in TBA reactive substances (TBARS) level (p<0.001), in comparison with sham-operated animal. Pretreatment with TQ and NSO were resulted a significant decrease in MDA level as compared with ischemic group (66.9+/-1.5 vs. 297+/-2.5 nmol/g tissue for TQ, 10 mg/kg; p<0.001 and 153.5+/-1.3 nmol/g tissue for NSO, 0.384 mg/kg; p<0.001). Using a reversed-phase HPLC system, the amount of TQ in NSO was also quantified and was 0.58% w/w. These results suggest that TQ and NSO may have protective effects on lipid peroxidation process during IRI in rat hippocampus.
