AIM: To study the relationship between the density of phencyclidine [1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine hydrochloride, Phe] receptor binding sites in brain and thoracic spinal cord (T4-6) and the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). METHODS: The density of Phe binding sites was determined by autoradiography using [3H]Phe in 4-, 8-, 12- and 16-wk-old rats. RESULTS: There were fewer Phe binding sites in the hippocampus and dorsal horn of thoracic spinal cord of SHR at 12 and 16 wk (P < 0.01), when hypertension has established; while at 4 wk of age, before the development of hypertension, more Phe binding sites were found in SHR. As blood pressure began to rise at 8 wk, SHR had more Phe binding sites in hippocampus vs WKY, but no difference was seen between 2 strains in the dorsal horn of thoracic spinal cord. CONCLUSION: Phe receptors might be involved in the genesis of SHR hypertension.
