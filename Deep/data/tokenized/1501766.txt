The basic characteristics of desensitization of the GABAA receptor were investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (three days to four weeks in vitro) using whole cell patch clamp techniques. GABA at 10-500 microM was perfused on to neurons for 30 or 60 s, with 60 s intervals of wash with control bath solution between perfusions. Desensitization, evaluated by peak-to-plateau ratio and time constants of current decay (tau), was dose-dependent and culture age-dependent. Desensitization was observed as early as three days in culture, the earliest time tested. At all ages, higher concentrations of GABA induced both larger and faster desensitization. Desensitization was markedly voltage-dependent and decreased with depolarization; peak-to-plateau ratio went from 6.3 to 1.4 and tau went from 4.6 to 26.8 s when holding potentials were changed from -80 mV to +30 mV. Low concentrations of GABA (1-2 microM) perfused for 2-60 s, which did not induce any current, had no effect on the maximal response nor desensitization produced by a subsequent application of 100 microM GABA. This finding suggests that GABA receptors were not desensitized without first being activated.
