Calmodulin (CaM) is a major Ca2+-binding protein in the brain, where it plays an important role in the neuronal response to changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Calmodulin modulates numerous Ca2+-dependent enzymes and participates in relevant cellular functions. Among the different CaM-binding proteins, the Ca2+/CaM dependent protein kinase II and the phosphatase calcineurin are especially important in the brain because of their abundance and their participation in numerous neuronal functions. Therefore, the role of the Ca2+/CaM signalling system in different neurotoxicological or neuropathological conditions associated to alterations in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration is a subject of interest. We here report different evidences showing the involvement of CaM and the CaM-binding proteins above mentioned in situations of neuronal hyperexcitability induced by convulsant agents. Signal transduction pathways mediated by specific CaM binding proteins warrant future study as potential targets in the development of new drugs to inhibit convulsant responses or to prevent or attenuate the alterations in neuronal function associated to the deleterious increases in the intracellular Ca2+ levels described in different pathological situations.
