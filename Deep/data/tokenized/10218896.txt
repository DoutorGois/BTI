The present investigation concerns 80-90 day-old male rats born from morphine-exposed mothers (2 x 10 mg/kg per day from days 11 to 18 of gestation which showed at birth reduced size and activity of the adrenals). This prenatal treatment did not significantly disturb under resting conditions: (1) the postnatal body growth up to week 10 after birth, (2) the activity of the pituitary gonadal axis (circulating luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T), weight of the testicles and seminal vesicles), (3) the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) (hypothalamic corticoliberin (CRF) content, plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) level, adrenal weight and corticosterone (B) content, plasma B level) as well as Bmax and Kd of mineralocorticoid (type I) and glucocorticoid (type II) receptors to B in both the hippocampus and the hypothalamus. In contrast these rats showed reduced content of adrenals in noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) but increased circulating levels of A.
