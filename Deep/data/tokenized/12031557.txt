D-Serine is an endogenous modulator of brain N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. This study investigates serine transport in brain synaptosomal fractions. Saturable, temperature-dependent uptake of both D- and L-[3H]serine was observed. Alanine was only partially effective in blocking transport, arguing against involvement of system ASC. Inhibitors of the systems A, L and GLY were also ineffective. Saturation studies suggested a submillimolar K(m) for both D- and L-serine. These data suggest the presence of a novel serine transport system in rodent synaptosomes.
