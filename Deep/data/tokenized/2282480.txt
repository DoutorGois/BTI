Golgi examination of neurons of self-stimulation areas of the lateral hypothalamus and substantia nigra-ventral tegmental areas of adult Wistar rats that had experienced self-stimulation for 10 days revealed a significantly higher number of dendritic branching points in the two self-stimulation areas, and also in the hippocampus (CA3 pyramidal neurons) than in inexperienced rats.
