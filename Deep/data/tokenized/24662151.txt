Glucocorticoids are stress hormones that mediate the organism's reaction to stress. It has been previously proposed that the facilitation of emotional aversive conditioning induced by these hormones may involve nitric oxide-pathways. The purpose of the present study was to address this question. For that, male Wistar rats were surgically implanted with slow-release corticosterone (CORT) pellets (21 days) and tested in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task. Additional groups of animals were also submitted to the same treatment conditions and on the 21st day of treatment assayed for GR (glucocorticoid receptors)-nNOS (neuronal nitric oxide synthase) immunoreactivity (GRi-nNOSi) or measurements of plasma CORT. Results showed that CORT treatment induced facilitation of step-down inhibitory avoidance. This same treatment also significantly increased CORT plasma levels and GRi in the medial, basolateral and basomedial amygdala, in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), in the ventral and dorsal dentate gyrus, in the ventral CA1 region and in the dorsal CA1 and CA3 regions. Furthermore, nNOSi and GRi-nNOSi were significantly increased by CORT treatment in the medial amygdala and basolateral amygdaloid complex, in the PVN, subiculum, in the dorsal CA3 region and in the ventral CA1 and CA3 regions. These results indicate that the facilitation of aversive conditioning induced by CORT involves GR-nNOS pathways activation, what may be of relevance for a better understanding of stress-related psychiatric conditions.
