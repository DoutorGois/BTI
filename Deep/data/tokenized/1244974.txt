The incorporation of intraventricularly infected L-[1-3H]fucose into proteins of the hippocampus and visual cortex was studied during the acquisition of a shock-motivated brightness discrimination in rats. The labeling of Tris-soluble proteins from both regions was not significantly changed during learning, whereas solubilized insoluble proteins obtained from the hippocampus revealed an increased fucose incorporation in learned animals. A significant enhanced incorporation into some distinct, slow-moving, carbohydrate-rich protein bands, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was observed in material from CA1 and CA3 sectors as well as from area dentata of the hippocampus formation during acquisition. The corresponding gel bands from the visual cortex exhibited no differences between trained animals and controls. Jointly performed microautoradiography showed an increased fucose incorporation into most areas of the hippocampus in learned animals compared with active and passive controls. The most significant differences were found to occur mainly in substructures consisting of densely packed neuronal cells.
