Dual-probe microdialysis (with HPLC and electrochemical detection) in freely moving rats and single-unit recording in anesthetized rats were used to study the extent to which impulse flow through the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contributes to elevations in nucleus accumbens (NAS) dopamine (DA) evoked by stimulation of the ventral subiculum (VS). During perfusion of artificial extracellular fluid into the VTA, injections of 0.74 microgram of the excitatory amino acid NMDA into the VS elevated accumbens DA to >150% of basal values. During intra-VTA perfusion of either 1 microM tetrodotoxin (which blocks impulse flow) or 1 mM kynurenic acid (which blocks excitatory glutamate receptors), injections of NMDA into the VS failed to elevate accumbens DA. Thus, increased impulse flow through VTA DA neurons, mediated by excitatory glutamate inputs to this region, appears critical for VS stimulation to elevate NAS DA. Increased impulse flow through VTA DA neurons was confirmed using single-unit recording in anesthetized rats. Intra-VS NMDA injections increased the firing rates of 45% (14 of 31), decreased the firing rates of 13% (4 of 31), and had no effect on 42% (13 of 31) of VTA DA neurons. Increases in firing rates were evident within 15 min of NMDA injections, a time at which VS NMDA injections elevate accumbens DA in awake animals. The results of the present experiments identify the VTA as a critical site through which outputs from the VS modulate NAS dopaminergic neurotransmission.
