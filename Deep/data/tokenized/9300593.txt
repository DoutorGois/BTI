The effects of scopolamine on nonspatial working memory were examined in rats with hippocampal lesions and sham operations. Performance was examined using a continuous conditional discrimination task in an operant box. Choice accuracy measured nonspatial working memory. Response bias, delay interval responses, and response probability measured response preference, stimulus control, motivation, and sensorimotor ability. Scopolamine (0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.15 mg/kg) or methylscopolamine (0.1 mg/kg) was injected (I.P.) 15 min prior to behavioral testing. In both control and hippocampal lesioned groups, choice accuracy declined as the delay interval increased. Scopolamine, but not methylscopolamine, produced a dose-dependent impairment of choice accuracy (interaction of Dose x Delay) in both groups. The scopolamine-induced impairment was not different between the control and hippocampally lesioned rats. Response bias, delay interval responses, and response probability were not affected by scopolamine except at the highest dose, which increased delay interval responses. The results suggest that central muscarinic receptors outside the hippocampus are important for working memory of nonspatial stimuli.
