Since kindling produces electrophysiological and morphological changes in the brain area stimulated, it may well affect behavioural functions dependent on the kindled area. Using an 8-arm maze, it was found that hippocampal kindling can induce specific memory deficits in spatial tasks. Reference (long-term) memory as well as working (short-term) memory were impaired. The largest impairment was observed during the period in which generalized convulsions occurred. Working memory but not reference memory impairment was reversible. Hippocampal kindling may be a useful experimental model for investigating behavioural deficits correlated with epileptogenesis.
