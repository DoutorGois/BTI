The aim is to find some switches in the brain and to characterize them if possible as either temporary and requiring some reverberatory process or as more stable and structural. There were five assumptions involved; (a) that the very large population of neurons in the brain could be effectively sampled in a limited set of experiments; (b) that a middle kind of electrodes could direct themselves to a sufficiently stable single unit population to permit extended conditioning experiments: (c) that averaging could be used to eliminate the effects of all unwanted variables that were not correlated with the main auditory signals: (d) that latency mapping would permit the tracing of a signal even through the multiple-channeled pathways of the brain (and would help us to identify switching points; (e) that a middle kind of conditioning (not Pavlovian entirely nor Slinner experiment with the clear CS of a Pavlovian one...
