AIM: To study the protective effects of compound FLZ, a novel synthetic analogue of natural squamosamide, on learning and memory impairment and lesions of the hippocampus caused by icv injection of beta-amyloid(25-35)(Abeta(25-35)) in mice. METHODS: Mice were icv injected with the Abeta(25-35) (15 nmol/mouse), and then treated with oral administration of 75 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg of FLZ once daily for 16 consecutive days. The impairment of learning and memory in mice were tested using step-down test and Morris water maze test. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the expressions of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Bax, and Bcl-2 in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus were measured by biochemical and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively. The pathological damages of hippocampus were observed using a microscope. RESULTS: FLZ (75 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg) significantly attenuated Abeta(25-35)-induced impairment of learning and memory in the step-down test and Morris water maze test. FLZ also reduced pathological damages to the hippocampus induced by Abeta(25-35). Furthermore, FLZ prevented the increase of AChE and Bax, and the decrease of Bcl-2 immunoreactive cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and reduced the increase of MDA content in the hippocampus in mice injected with Abeta(25-35). CONCLUSION: FLZ has protective action against the impairment of learning and memory and pathological damage to the hippocampus induced by icv injection of Abeta(25-35) in mice.
