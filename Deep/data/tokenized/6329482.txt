Mice were treated with [MET(O2)4, D-Lys8,Phe9]ACTH4-9 (ORG 2766, 100 micrograms/kg per day SC) for 10 days. On the tenth day mice were injected with [3H]2-deoxyglucose and its cerebral accumulation determined in 17 brain areas. The combined results of four experiments indicated a significant decrease of the 2-deoxyglucose accumulation in the septum. Changes observed in other brain areas were not statistically significant in the combined analysis of all four experiments. This selective change in the septum is consistent with selective uptake of ORG 2766 in this region, and with the lack of behavioral activity of ACTH in septal lesioned animals. It also suggests that the behavioral activity of this peptide, generally considered to be on arousal, vigilance, and/or selective attention, may be mediated through the septum, a limbic system structure.
