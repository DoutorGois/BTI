Electrical and chemical kindling induces sprouting of the mossy fibre system and potentiation of evoked field potentials in the dentate gyrus. It has been postulated that such changes may also be induced by repeated induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) with tetanic stimulation of the perforant pathway. LTP was induced in rats chronically implanted with stimulation electrodes in the ipsilateral and contralateral angular bundles and with a recording electrode in the ipsilateral dorsal dentate gyrus. The animals were stimulated 10 times on 10 consecutive days but with different tetanization strengths. Sprouting of the mossy fibres terminating in the CA3 region was significantly induced only in the group of 'strongly' tetanized animals, but not in that of 'weakly' tetanized animals, or in low-frequency stimulated animals. Additionally, a novel form of potentiation which was previously found in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindled animals was also observed in the group of 'strongly' and 'weakly' tetanized rats. Differences in duration of this potentiation were found between the two groups of animals tetanized with different strengths. The results further demonstrate that morphological and functional changes in the hippocampus, similar to those seen after kindling, can also occur in an activation paradigm leading to long-lasting synaptic plasticity but not accompanied by seizure activity.
