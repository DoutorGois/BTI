In the present study we examined the long-term effects of neonatal lesion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons induced by intracerebroventricular injections of the immunotoxin 192 IgG saporin. Animals were then characterised behaviourally, electrophysiologically and molecularly. Cognitive effects were evaluated in the social transmission of food preferences, a non-spatial associative memory task. Electrophysiological effects were assessed by recording of cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. In addition, we measured the levels of proteins whose abnormal expression has been associated with neurodegeneration such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 and 2 (PS-1, PS-2), and cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2). In animals lesioned on postnatal day 7 and tested 6 months thereafter, memory impairment in the social transmission of food preferences was evident, as well as a significant reduction of choline acetyltransferase activity in hippocampus and neocortex. Furthermore, similar to what observed in Alzheimer-like dementia, EEG cortical patterns in lesioned rats presented changes in alpha, beta and delta activities. Levels of APP protein and mRNA were not affected by the treatment. Levels of hippocampal COX-2 protein and mRNA were significantly decreased whereas COX-1 remained unaltered. PS-1 and PS-2 transcripts were reduced in hippocampus and neocortex. These findings indicate that neonatal and permanent basal forebrain cholinergic hypofunction is sufficient to induce behavioural and neuropathological abnormalities. This animal model could represent a valid tool to evaluate the role played by abnormal cholinergic maturation in later vulnerability to neuropathological processes associated with cognitive decline and, possibly, to Alzheimer-like dementia.
