The objective of this study was to determine the effects of acute direct exposure to ethanol, hypoxia or ethanol plus hypoxia on K+-stimulated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) efflux (neuronal release minus uptake) in the hippocampus of the near-term fetal and adult guinea-pig. Transverse hippocampal slices were studied in a static-interface system. Exposure in vitro to ethanol or hypoxia involved 10-min incubation with 50 mM ethanol or 10-min incubation in a 95% N2/5% CO2 environment. GABA was quantitated by HPLC. Ethanol did not alter K+-stimulated GABA efflux; hypoxia augmented K+-stimulated GABA efflux three-fold in the near-term fetus and seven-fold in the adult; concurrent exposure to ethanol did not alter the effect of hypoxia. The data demonstrate that, for acute direct exposure to hypoxia and/or ethanol, only hypoxia increases K+-stimulated GABA efflux, the magnitude of which is dependent on the extent of development of the GABA system.
