The GABA levels and turnover rates in various brain areas from 2-month-old rats born to mothers who consumed 20% (v/v) alcohol during 1 month only before pregnancy, were investigated. A decreased level was found in the olfactory tubercules and an increase was observed in the hypothalamus. The turnover rates were reduced in both areas, whereas an increase was observed in the frontal cortex. These results indicate that biochemical alterations may occur in the offspring even if the fetus did not develop under alcoholization.
