MicroRNA alterations have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD mouse models. We now report that miR-206 is upregulated in the hippocampal tissue, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma of embryonic APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The increased miR-206 downregulates the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is neuroprotective against cell death after various insults, but in embryonic and newborn APP/PS1 mice it is decreased. Thus, a specific microRNA alteration may contribute to AD pathology by downregulating BDNF.
