Temporary cerebral ischemia (15 min) produced by "four-vessel occlusion" in the rat causes neurological disorders, changes in behavior (locomotor hyperactivity), and neuronal damage in the neocortex, striatum, and especially the CA1 zone of the hippocampus. We have studied the effects of two calcium overload blockers, flunarizine (50 mg/kg p.o. twice a day) and cinnarizine (100 mg/kg p.o. twice a day), on these alterations. Cinnarizine markedly improved the functional abnormalities of ischemia but had little or no effect upon the neuronal damage. In contrast, flunarizine provided far greater neuronal protection but with less obvious effects upon behavioral parameters. However, there was evidence of sedation 2 h after treating animals with this dose of flunarizine that might have masked any positive effect of the drug on behavior. We conclude that under the present experimental conditions, there is no correlation between the early and late behavioral changes observed following a temporary cerebral ischemic episode and the histological damage observed in certain vulnerable neurons, particularly in the hippocampus, 72 h after the insult.
