The ability of various oximes to antagonize the sarin-induced hypothermia and reactivate phosphorylated acetylcholinesterase was used as an indicator of the central activity of oximes. HI-6, but neither toxogonin nor PAM Cl, antagonized sarin-induced hypothermia and reactivated brain acetylcholinesterase, in particular hypothalamic acetylcholinesterase. The sarin-induced hypothermia appears to be a muscarinic cholinergic action since atropine was also an effective antagonist of sarin-induced hypothermia. Neither HI-6 nor toxogonin antagonized oxotremorine-induced hypothermia, indicating that these oximes do not possess central cholinolytic activity. The results demonstrated that HI-6 penetrated the blood-brain barrier in a sufficient concentration to produce a biochemical and physiological action against sarin poisoning.
