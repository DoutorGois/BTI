The molecular basis of neuroendocrine-specific expression of chromogranin B gene (Chgb) has remained elusive. Utilizing wild-type and mutant Chgb promoter/luciferase reporter constructs, this study established a crucial role for the cAMP response element (CRE) box at -102/-95 bp in endocrine [rat pheochromocytoma (chromaffin) cell line (PC12) and rat pituitary somatotrope cell line (GC)] and neuronal [rat dorsal root ganglion/mouse neuroblastoma hybrid cell line (F-11), cortical and hippocampal primary neurons] cells. Additionally, G/C-rich domains at -134/-127, -125/-117 and -115/-110 bp played especially important roles for endocrine-specific expression of the Chgb gene. Co-transfection of expression plasmids for CREB, activator protein-2 (transcription factor) (AP-2), early growth response protein (transcription factor) (Egr-1) or specificity protein 1 (transcription factor) (Sp1) with the Chgb promoter constructs trans-activated expression of the Chgb gene. Nuclear extracts from either PC12 or F-11 cells formed specific complexes with the Chgb (-110/-87 bp) (CRE) oligonucleotide, which were either supershifted or disrupted by anti-CREB antibodies. In addition PC12 nuclear extracts also formed a specific complex with a Chgb (-140/-104-bp) oligonucleotide containing three G/C-rich regions, which was dose-dependently disrupted by anti-AP-2, anti-Egr-1 or anti-Sp1 antibodies; indeed, any one of these three antibodies completely abolished the complex, suggesting that all three factors bind the region simultaneously, at least in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays documented the binding of the transcription factors CREB, AP-2, Egr-1 and Sp1 to the chromosomal Chgb gene promoter in vivo in PC12 cells within the context of chromatin. We conclude that the neuroendocrine-specific expression of Chgb is mediated by the CRE and G/C boxes in cis and the transcription factors CREB, AP-2, Egr-1 and Sp1 in trans.
