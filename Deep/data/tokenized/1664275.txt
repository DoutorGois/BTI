Autoradiographic distributions of [3H]1,3-di-O-tolylguanidine, [3H]DTG, binding to sigma (sigma) receptors were studied in key human brain regions. High densities occurred in the substantia nigra pars compacta and cerebellum. Pineal and pituitary levels were moderate. In neocortex, binding was high in laminae II-IVA and much lower in the midzone. Moderate binding occurred over hippocampal dentate granular cells and in the striatum. These results differ from those reported for the rodent.
