Failure to appreciate the consequences for stereological work of the simultaneous presence of complex-shaped perforated and disc-like non-perforated synapses in brain tissue results in underestimation of synaptic profile length and overestimation of synaptic density when measured in randomly selected ultrathin E-PTA slices. This problem can be solved by using serial slices and a calculation method which makes no assumptions about synaptic size and shape. A three-dimensional reconstruction is unnecessary.
