Tetanus toxin (TeT), an exotoxin, has been studied to cause tetanus in mammalian brains, and it can block the release of some neurotransmitters and affect seizure propagation. In the present study, we investigated neuronal damage/death and glial changes in the mouse hippocampus after systemic administration (intraperitoneal injection) of TeT 10 and 100 ng/kg. In both the 10 and 100 ng/kg TeT-treated groups, no neuronal death occurred in any subregions of the mouse hippocampus until 24 h post-treatment; however, there were changes in glia in the hippocampus depending on time course and dosage. The morphology of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes and Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia was apparently changed in the 100 ng/kg TeT treated-group compared to the 10 ng/kg TeT treated-group. In the 100 ng/kg TeT treated-group, they were increased in size and their immunoreactivity was distinctively increased from 12 h post-treatment. We also found that their protein levels were increased in the hippocampus at 12 h post-treatment of 100 ng/kg TeT. In conclusion, these results indicate that the systemic administration of 100 ng/kg TeT induced a distinctive microglia changes in the mouse hippocampus without any neuronal death/damage.
