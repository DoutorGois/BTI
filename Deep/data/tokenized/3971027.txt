The light flash evoked potentials were recorded in the hippocamp of cats with transected left optic tract and cerebral commissures. The data obtained show a significant reduction in the response amplitude (by 1.5-2 times) in both hemispheres after unilateral transection of the optic tract. The minimal response amplitude (10-15 times less than normal) was recorded in the left hippocamp of cats with additional transection of the commissures of the endbrain, mesencephalon and diencephalon. In contrast, the latent period of the first and second components of the evoked potential was similar to that in the control group animals. It is suggested that the neocortical commissural visual inputs play the most important role in interhemispheric transmission of visual information to the hippocamp.
