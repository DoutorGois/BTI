By means of instrumental food-procuring technique in chronic experiments on dogs, it was shown that during formation of the reflex to time, two complexly interacting systems of bioelectrical activity appear in the EEG in the form of rapid 28-32 c/s spindles in the neocortex (motor and parietal cortex) and slow (4-7 c/s) activity in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. The involvement of both structures in the mechanisms of voluntary activity is analyzed.
