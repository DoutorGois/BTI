PURPOSE: Diseases such as temporal lobe epilepsy, brain trauma and stroke can induce endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in specific brain areas. During status epilepticus (SE), bone marrow-derived cells are able to infiltrate and proliferate, dramatically increasing at the site of injury. However, it is still unclear whether these cells directly participate in vascular changes induced by SE. METHOD: To investigate the possible role of bone marrow-derived cells in angiogenesis after seizures, we induced SE by pilocarpine injection in previously prepared chimeric mice. Mice were euthanized at 8h, 7d or 15d after SE onset. RESULTS: Our results indicated that SE modified hippocampal vascularization and induced angiogenesis. Further, bone marrow-derived GFP(+) cells penetrated through the parenchyma and participated in the formation of new vessels after SE. We detected bone marrow-derived cells closely associated with vessels in the hippocampus, increasing the density of blood vessels that had decreased immediately after pilocarpine-induced SE. CONCLUSION: We conclude that epileptic seizures directly affect vascularization in the hippocampus mediated by bone marrow-derived cells in a time-dependent manner.
