PC1 and PC2 are two major enzymes involved in the processing of protein precursors directed to the regulated secretory pathway. Whereas transcripts encoding both enzymes are widely distributed in the central nervous system, information regarding the localization of proteins themselves is still lacking. In an attempt to gain insight into the neurobiologic roles of PC1 and PC2, both enzymes were immunolocalized in the rat brain by using C-terminally directed antibodies, which respectively recognize the 87-kDa PC1 and the 75 and 68-kDa PC2 forms. Adjacent sections immunoreacted with PC1 or PC2 antibodies exhibited selective patterns of immunostaining in regions well characterized with respect to their biosynthesis of multiple neuropeptides such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. PC1 signal intensity was generally weaker than that of PC2, although both enzymes displayed extensive overlapping patterns of expression. As assessed by double-labeling experiments at the cellular level, PC1 and PC2 immunoreactive signals were localized within the trans-Golgi network and nerve terminals, in keeping with the biosynthetic pathways of neuropeptides. Immunoreactive fibers were detected in many areas throughout the brain but were particularly densely distributed in the hypothalamus and the brainstem. Both enzymes were also localized within dendrites of numerous neurons, supporting the hypothesis that dendritic neuropeptide maturation and release may occur in a large number of brain regions. Taken together, our results provide new evidence that both convertases are efficiently targeted to the neuronal regulated secretory pathway and are well poised to process protein precursors in biologically active end-products within the mammalian brain.
