Although the syndrome of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) associated with hippocampal sclerosis has been elaborated in recent years, pathogenesis and pathomechanisms are still elusive. Performing protein hunting in hippocampus of patients with MTLE we detected derangement of collapsin response mediated protein-2 (CRMP-2). Hippocampal tissue from controls and MTLEs was taken and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent MALDI-MS-characterisation was applied. The proteomic approach identified 13 spots unambiguously assigned to CRMP-2. Three spots at molecular weight 55 kDa showed a significant decrease in MTLE and other 3 spots at 65 kDa showed deranged in MTLE. Immunoblotting revealed two bands at 65 and 55 kDa in the control group whereas the 55 kDa band was extremely low expressed in MTLE. CRMP-2 is required to induce axonal outgrowth and maintaining neuronal polarity in hippocampal neurons and the significant decrease of this protein may represent or underlie impaired neuronal plasticity, neurodegeneration, wiring of the brain in MTLE and may explain abnormal migration. Therefore, the decrease of CRMP-2 may well contribute to the understanding of the still unclear pathomechanisms involved in MTLE.
