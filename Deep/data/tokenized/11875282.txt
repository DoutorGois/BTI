We have studied by immunocytochemistry, the distribution of DMT-1, a cellular iron transporter responsible for transport of metal irons from the plasma membrane to endosomes, in the normal monkey cerebral neocortex and hippocampus. Light to moderate DMT-1 staining was observed in glial cell bodies in the neocortex, the subcortical white matter, and the hippocampus. Despite light labeling of cell bodies, glial end feet around cortical and subcortical blood vessels were heavily labeled. In the neocortex, the glial cell bodies displayed the morphological features of protoplasmic astrocytes. Labeled glial cells in the subcortical white matter contained dense bundles of glial filaments and were identified as fibrous astrocytes. The observation that DMT-1 was present on astrocytic endfeet suggests that these cells are involved in uptake of iron from endothelial cells. It is possible that the iron could then be redistributed into the extracellular space in the brain parenchyma.
