OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun in the marginal division (MrD) of rat striatum during learning and memory. METHODS: After Y-maze training in rats, the expression of immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun in the MrD was investigated immunocytochemically. RESULTS: After 1 h of Y- maze training, the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins was significantly enhanced in the MrD, where c-Jun protein in particular was more intensely expressed than in other parts of the striatum. The training group showed significantly higher expressions of the 2 proteins than pseudotraining group (P<0.01). In addition, positive expression was also observed in the hippocampus, cingulum cortex and other parts of the brain. CONCLUSION: Immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun in the MrD participate in the signal transduction during learning and memory processes in the courses of Y-maze training of the rats.
