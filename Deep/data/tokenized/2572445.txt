Mechanisms of action of norepinephrine (NE) on dentate gyrus granule cells were studied in rat hippocampal slices using extra- and intracellular recordings and measurements of stimulus and amino acid-induced changes in extracellular Ca2+ and K+ concentration. Bath application of NE (10-50 microM) induced long-lasting potentiation of perforant path evoked potentials, and markedly enhanced high-frequency stimulus-induced Ca2+ influx and K+ efflux, actions blocked by beta-receptor antagonists and mimicked by beta agonists. Enhanced Ca2+ influx was primarily postsynaptic, since presynaptic delta [Ca2+]o in the stratum moleculare synaptic field was not altered by NE. Interestingly, the potentiation of both ionic fluxes and evoked population potentials were antagonized by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV). Furthermore, NE selectively enhanced the delta [Ca2+]o delta [K+]o and extracellular slow negative field potentials elicited by iontophoretically applied NMDA, but not those induced by the excitatory amino acid quisqualate. These results suggest that granule cell influx of Ca2+ through NMDA ionophores is enhanced by NE via beta-receptor activation. In intracellular recordings, NE depolarized granule cells (4.8 +/- 1.1 mV), and increased input resistance (RN) by 34 +/- 6.5%. These actions were also blocked by either the beta-antagonist propranolol or specific beta 1-blocker metoprolol. Moreover, the depolarization and RN increase persisted for long periods (93 +/- 12 min) after NE washout. In contrast, while NE, in the presence of APV, still depolarized granule cells and increased RN, APV made these actions quickly reversible upon NE washout (16 +/- 9 min). This suggested that NE induction of long-term, but not short-term, plasticity in the dentate gyrus requires NMDA receptor activation. NE may be enhancing granule cell firing by some combination of blockade on the late Ca2+-activated K+ conductance and depolarization of granule cells, both actions that can bring granule cells into a voltage range where NMDA receptors are more easily activated. Furthermore, NE also elicited activity-independent long-lasting depolarization and RN increases, which required functional NMDA receptors to persist.
