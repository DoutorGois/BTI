Concentrations of zinc in postmortem serum and four brain regions were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry and instrumental neutron activation analysis, respectively, in nine Alzheimer's disease (AD) and eight control subjects. A statistically significant elevation of zinc serum was observed in AD subjects (136.4+/-66.8 microg/dL) compared with age-matched control subjects (71.1+/-35.0 microg/dL). No significant differences were observed between AD and control zinc concentrations in the amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum, and superior and middle temporal gryi.
