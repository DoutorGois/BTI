We have investigated different stimulus parameters in an attempt to induce long-term depression (LTD) in the CA1 region of adult rat hippocampus in vitro. Whereas 900 stimuli delivered at 1 Hz failed to induce LTD, 900 stimuli when delivered as 450 pairs (50 msec inter-stimulus interval) at 1 Hz induced significant and stable N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent LTD. However, 900 paired stimuli at 1 Hz induced LTD which was only partly blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5).
