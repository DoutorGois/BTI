Morphometric characteristics and free radical oxidation in neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus of male and female rats were studied 1 month after administration of Sustanon-250 in a dose of 8 mg/kg during the pubertal period of ontogeny. The weight of the brain was shown to decrease in males. In both female and male rats, the width of the anterior parietal lobe and the numerical density of neocortical and hippocampal neurons decreased. Sex differences were found in free radical oxidation in the cerebral cortex. The intensity of this process increased significantly in females, but decreased in males.
