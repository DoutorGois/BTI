Unilateral combined transections of the fimbriafornix and angular bundle in adult Fischer 344 rats were used to study the effects of deafferentation on hippocampal expression of calretinin, calbindin D-28k, and parvalbumin. Reflecting the widespread degeneration of synaptic contacts, immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein 6 days after the lesions was increased in lacunosum-molecular and oriens layers of CA1, 2, and 3 in ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus and in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus outer molecular layer. At 21 days the immunoreactivity had decreased to control levels except for a still slightly increased signal in the oriens layer of CA1-3. At 6 and 21 days after the combined lesions the numbers of hippocampal neurons containing calretinin, parvalbumin, and calbindin D-28k was unaltered. The combined lesions abolished calretinin containing terminals in the dentate gyrus inner molecular layer on the deafferentated side. This could be reproduced by single unilateral fimbria-fornix transections, suggesting that the axons of these calretinin positive terminals project to the hippocampus through the fimbria-fornix. The most likely origin of the calretinin positive terminals are neurons in the supramammillary hypothalamic nucleus. Our findings demonstrate that the extensive lesion-induced synaptic rearrangements in the adult hippocampus do not induce degeneration of hippocampal neurons expressing calretinin, calbindin D-28k, and parvalbumin, but do remove calretinin containing terminals which reach their targets in the hippocampus through the fimbria-fornix.
