Immunocytochemical and peptide sequencing studies indicate that the regulatory protein ubiquitin (Ub) is incorporated into the paired helical filaments (PHF) of Alzheimer disease. In this study, we showed that some antibodies raised to PHF recognize epitopes of Ub. Analysis of the Ub sequences recognized by the antibodies raised to PHF, along with the known specificity of several monoclonal antibodies raised to artificial Ub conjugates, indicates the immunochemical representation of Ub residues 34-76 in PHF. The Ub epitopes recognized by antibodies raised to PHF are distinct from those recognized by antibodies raised to artificial Ub conjugates in two respects. First, antibodies that are raised to PHF and that recognize Ub react with PHF equally, whether denatured or not, whereas those raised to artificial Ub conjugates show greater reaction after denaturation. Second, mapping of the epitopes recognized by two monoclonal antibodies to PHF onto Ub indicates a distinction in the Ub residues recognized, compared with monoclonal antibodies raised to artificial Ub conjugates. The proximity of their epitopes to the site of conjugation, as well as their affinity for PHF polypeptides, suggests that the PHF antibodies that recognize Ub may be directed specifically to Ub epitopes defined by the protein conjugated to Ub.
