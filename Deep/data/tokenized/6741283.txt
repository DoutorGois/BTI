On a model of a defensive conditioned reflex with a short delay it was shown in acute experiments in cats that the suppression of noradrenaline (NA) synthesis by diethyldithiocarbamate led to a disturbance of retrieval of electrographic correlates of memory trace, i.e. of conditioned evoked potentials in the hippocampus and central gray matter and of motor component of the conditioned reaction, i.e. conditioned neurographic response of the radial nerve. Simultaneous suppression of both dopamine (DA) and NA syntheses by alpha-methyl-para- thyrosine led to a regional expansion of the disturbances mentioned involving the hippocampus, central gray matter, reticular formation, amygdalar complex, zona, incerta and auditory cortex. Activation of postsynaptic NA-receptors by clonidine and that of post-synaptic DA-receptors by apomorphine produced an antiamnestic effect on the conditioned evoked potential in the amygdalar complex and central gray matter.
