The accumulation of adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) was measured in the preopticanterior hypothalamic area, the cerebral cortex, and the hippocampus of rats exposed to different ambient temperatures: (1) 23 +/- 0.5 degrees C, for 53 h +/- 20 min (control); (2) -10 +/- 1 degrees C, for 53 h +/- 20 min (exposure to low ambient temperature); (3) -10 degrees C for 48 h and 23 degrees C for the following 5 h +/- 20 min (recovery). The capacity to accumulate cAMP was tested by subjecting animals to acute hypoxia, a stimulus which is known to induce a large increase in brain cAMP concentration. In the control condition, hypoxic stimulation increases cAMP concentration in all the brain regions studied. In contrast, during the exposure to low ambient temperature, whilst both the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus show the same levels of accumulation found in the control condition, cAMP accumulation is reduced in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area. However, during the first few hours of the recovery period, the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area is able to reattain the capacity for cAMP accumulation observed in the control condition.
