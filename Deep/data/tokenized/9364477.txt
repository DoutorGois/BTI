The possibility of a P2-receptor-mediated modulation of the release of serotonin in the rat brain cortex was investigated in occipito-parietal slices preincubated with [3H]serotonin and then superfused and stimulated electrically (10 pulses, 1 Hz). Adenosine receptor agonists decreased the stimulation-evoked overflow of tritium at best slightly; the selective A1 agonist N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine caused no change. Several nucleotides had more marked effects: ATP (3-1000 microM), adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (3-300 microM) and P1,P5-di(adenosine-5')-pentaphosphate (3-300 microM) decreased the evoked overflow by up to ca 35%. AMP, alpha,beta-methylene-ATP and UTP produced smaller decreases and 2-methylthio-ATP and UMP caused no change. The inhibition by ATP was attenuated both by the P1-receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulphophenyl)-theophylline (100 microM) and by the P2-receptor antagonist suramin (300 microM) but was not changed by indomethacin (10 microM) and NG-nitro-L-arginine (10 microM). We conclude that the release of serotonin in the rat brain cortex is inhibited through presynaptic P1-receptors (which are not A1) as well as P2-receptors. Inhibition of release via P2-receptors has been previously shown for noradrenaline (brain cortex and hippocampus) and dopamine (neostriatum) and, hence, may be widespread. Differences between transmitter systems exist, however, in the degree of their sensitivity to presynaptic P2-receptor-mediated modulation.
