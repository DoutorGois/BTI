Frequency of clinical and psychological peculiarities of moderate (mild) cognitive impairment (MCI) in cerebral vascular insufficiency (CVI) was studied in 42 patients, mean age 67.7 +/- 7.7 years. Along with neurological examination, a battery of psychiatric and neuropsychological scales and tests was used. MCI was diagnosed in 28 (66.7%) patients. In 20 patients (47.6%), cognitive hypoactivity was most prominent related to impaired neurodynamics and regulation of voluntary activity which may reflect subcortical and frontal lobes functions. In 8 patients (20.1%), there was a prominent memory impairment characteristic of hippocampus lesion. The authors suggest the presence of concomitant neurodegeneration in patients with amnesic MCI.
