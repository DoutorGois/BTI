Evidence suggests that inflammation, an innate immune response facilitating recovery from injury and pathogenic invasion, is positively associated with age-related cognitive decline and may play a role in risk for dementia. Physiological pathways linking the peripheral immune and central nervous systems are outlined, and studies linking inflammation with neurocognitive function are overviewed. We also present recent studies from our laboratory showing that midlife inflammation is related to cognitive function and brain morphology. Finally, potential implications for treatment, future directions, and limitations are discussed.
