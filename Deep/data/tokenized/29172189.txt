The hippocampus is involved in episodic memories of events including time and space. Many studies have focused on the neuronal processing mechanisms underlying spatial cognition and representation in the hippocampus; however, the time-related aspects of memories have only recently become the focus of research. In this review, we first introduce recent reports demonstrating the importance of the hippocampus in the perception of time and then present the hippocampal neuronal dynamics for the representation of time, revealed by large-scale neuronal recording techniques.
