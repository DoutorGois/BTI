Physical training is an important means modifying brain aging. Using behavioral, morphological and biological methods, the present study investigated the effect of prolonged training (running wheel for 8 and 19 months), initiated at 5 months of age, on age-related changes of motor-associated centers in the mouse. The results suggested that a moderate amount of prolonged physical training could modify the age-related degenerative changes of morphology and function of neurons in motor-associated centers and improve the function of neurons through the stimulation of the compensation of neurons.
