We examined the timing of apoptosis and the expression of the DNA repair proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Ku80 in sections of frontal and temporal lobes from patients who had suffered severe brain ischaemia due to a cardiac arrent. In situ end-labelling (ISEL) was used to detect apoptotic cells, and immunohistochemistry to assess PARP and Ku80. ISEL of scattered neurons and glia was demonstrable predominantly during the first 24 h after ischaemia. PARP and Ku80 immunoreactivity increased markedly after cerebral ischaemia, PARP particularly in the regions of greatest susceptibility to hypoxic injury: the CA1 field of the hippocampus and the depths of neocortical sulci. The up-regulation of PARP is in keeping with experimental observations concerning the key role of this enzyme in mediating ischaemic cell death.
