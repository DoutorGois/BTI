Pro- and mature BDNF activate very different receptors and intracellular pathways, potentially leading to either neuronal death or survival. Here we examined the biochemistry of endogenous BDNF in mouse neurons using sensitive reagents and found that pro-BDNF is rapidly converted intracellularly to mature BDNF, the latter being stored and released by excitatory input.
