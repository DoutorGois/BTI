Hippocampal neuronal damage is critical for the initiation and progression of neurocognitive impairment accompanied obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in the development of several hippocampus-related neural disorders. Atorvastatin was reported beneficially regulates TLR4. Here, we examined the effects of atorvastatin on hippocampal injury caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), the most characteristic pathophysiological change of OSAS. Mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia with or without atorvastatin for 4 weeks. Cell damage, the expressions of TLR4 and its two downstream factors myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF), inflammatory agents (tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1beta), and the oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde) were determined. Atorvastatin decreased the neural injury and the elevation of TLR4, MyD88, TRIF, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress caused by CIH. Our study suggests that atorvastatin may attenuate CIH induced hippocampal neuronal damage partially via TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathway.
