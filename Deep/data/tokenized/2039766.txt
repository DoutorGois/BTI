Recent work suggests that protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that has a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, also participates in the sequence of molecular events that underlie learning and memory. By means of electrophysiological, biochemical, and neuro-imaging methods it has been demonstrated that, in the brain, the distribution of PKC changes as a result of memory storage. The changes in distribution occur within the same ensembles of nerve cells that are necessary for the acquisition and performance of various learning tasks in several species. Here we review the data pertaining to a model that has been proposed to account for the participation of PKC as a molecular signal for cotemporal synaptic input during associative learning.
