Hypothermia reduces excitotoxic neuronal damage after seizures, cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury (TBI), while hyperthermia exacerbates damage from these insults. Presynaptic release of ionic zinc (Zn2+), translocation and accumulation of Zn2+ ions in postsynaptic neurons are important mechanisms of excitotoxic neuronal injury. We hypothesized that temperature-dependent modulation of excitotoxicity is mediated in part by temperature-dependent changes in the synaptic release and translocation of Zn2+. In the present studies, we used autometallographic (AMG) and fluorescent imaging of N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-para-toluenesulfonamide (TSQ) staining to quantify the influence of temperature on translocation of Zn2+ into hippocampal neurons in adult rats after weight drop-induced TBI. The central finding was that TBI-induced Zn2+ translocation is strongly influenced by brain temperature. Vesicular Zn2+ release was detected by AMG staining 1 h after TBI. At 30 degrees C, hippocampus showed almost no evidence of vesicular Zn2+ release from presynaptic terminals; at 36.5 degrees C, the hippocampus showed around 20% to 30% presynaptic vesicular Zn2+ release; and at 39 degrees C vesicular Zn2+ release was significantly greater (40% to 60%) than at 36.5 degrees C. At 6 h after TBI, intracellular Zn2+ accumulation was detected by the TSQ staining method, which showed that Zn2+ translocation also paralleled the vesicular Zn2+ release. Neuronal injury, assessed by counting eosinophilic neurons, also paralleled the translocation of Zn2+, being minimal at 30 degrees C and maximal at 39 degrees C. We conclude that pathological Zn2+ translocation in brain after TBI is temperature-dependent and that hypothermic neuronal protection might be mediated in part by reduced Zn2+ translocation.
