It has been reported that depletion of forebrain norepinephrine via 6-hydroxydopamine infusion into the dorsal bundle decreases the rat's ability to selectively attend to relevant stimuli and thus increases the rat's responsiveness to novelty. In this study we measured 6-hydroxydopamine lesion effects on 1) selective attention via the nonreversal shift task and extinction of continuous reinforcement bar pressing and on 2) neophobia via consumption of a novel solution in a familiar environment; exploratory behaviors and consumption of a familiar food in a novel environment; and consumption of familiar and novel foods in a novel environment. Our data do not support a role for the dorsal bundle in selective attention. Our data do support a role for forebrain norepinephrine in neophobia and suggest that the lesion effects on neophobia result from an interaction between novelty of environment and novelty of food.
