We evaluated copy number variation (CNV) for four genes in rat strains differing in nervous system excitability. rpl13a copy number is significantly reduced in hippocampus and bone marrow in rats with a high excitability threshold and stress. The observed phenomenon may be associated with a role for rpl13a in lipid metabolism.
