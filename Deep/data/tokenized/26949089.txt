Zinc finger protein 521 is highly expressed in brain, neural stem cells and early progenitors of the human hematopoietic cells. Zfp521 triggers the cascade of neurogenesis in mouse embryonic stem cells through inducing expression of the early neuroectodermal genes Sox1, Sox3 and Pax6. Fndc5, a precursor of Irisin has inducing effects on the expression level of brain derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampus. Therefore, it is most likely that Fndc5 may play an important role in neural differentiation. To exhibit whether the expression of this protein is under regulation with Zfp521, we overexpressed Zfp521 in a stable transformants of mESCs expressing EGFP under control of Fndc5 promoter. Increased expression of Zfp521 enhanced transcription levels of both EGFP and endogenous Fndc5. This result was confirmed by overexpression the aforementioned vectors in HEK cells and indicated that Zfp521 functions upstream of Fndc5 expression. It is most likely that Zfp521 may act through the binding to its response element on Fndc5 core promoter. Therefore it is concluding that an enhanced expression of Fndc5 in neural progenitor cells is stimulated by Zfp521 overexpression in these cells.
