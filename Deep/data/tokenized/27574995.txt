OBJECTIVE: To test for associations between abnormal respiratory ciliary motion (CM) and brain abnormalities in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) STUDY DESIGN: We recruited 35 infants with CHD preoperatively and performed nasal tissue biopsy to assess respiratory CM by videomicroscopy. Cranial ultrasound scan and brain magnetic resonance imaging were obtained pre- and/or postoperatively and systematically reviewed for brain abnormalities. Segmentation was used to quantitate cerebrospinal fluid and regional brain volumes. Perinatal and perioperative clinical variables were collected. RESULTS: A total of 10 (28.5%) patients with CHD had abnormal CM. Abnormal CM was not associated with brain injury but was correlated with increased extraaxial cerebrospinal fluid volume (P < .001), delayed brain maturation (P < .05), and a spectrum of subtle dysplasia including the hippocampus (P < .0078) and olfactory bulb (P < .034). Abnormal CM was associated with higher composite dysplasia score (P < .001), and both were correlated with elevated preoperative serum lactate (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal respiratory CM in infants with CHD is associated with a spectrum of brain dysplasia. These findings suggest that ciliary defects may play a role in brain dysplasia in patients with CHD and have the potential to prognosticate neurodevelopmental risks.
