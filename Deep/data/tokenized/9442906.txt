The general goal of genetic studies of learning and memory is to develop and test theories that explain the animal's behavior in neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, cellular, and molecular terms. In this review we describe the role that gene targeting and other transgenic techniques have had in the study of mammalian learning and memory. We focus especially on the hippocampus, a brain structure that is thought to be central to the processing and temporary storage of complex information. We also discuss the main issues that confront this young field, as well as our vision for its future.
