The role of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type A and B on the metabolism of dopamine (DA) in discrete regions of the monkey brain was studied. Monkeys were administered (-)-deprenyl (0.25 mg/kg) or clorgyline (1.0 mg/kg) or deprenyl and clorgyline together by intramuscular injections for 8 days. Levels of DA and its metabolites, dihydroxy phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were estimated in frontal cortex (FC), motor cortex (MC), occipital cortex (OC), entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus (HI), hypothalamus (HY), caudate nucleus (CN), globus pallidus (GP) and substantia nigra (SN). (-)-Deprenyl administration significantly increased DA levels in FC, HY, CN, GP and SN (39-87%). This was accompanied by a reduction in the levels of DOPAC (37-66%) and HVA (27-79%). Clorgyline administration resulted in MAO-A inhibition by more than 87% but failed to increase DA levels in any of the brain regions studied. Combined treatment of (-)-deprenyl and clorgyline inhibited both types of MAO by more than 90% and DA levels were increased (57-245%) in all brain regions studied with a corresponding decrease in the DOPAC (49-83%) and HVA (54-88%) levels. Our results suggest that DA is metabolized preferentially, if not exclusively by MAO-B in some regions of the monkey brain.
