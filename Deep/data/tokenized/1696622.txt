Exposure of 7-day-old rats to 7% oxygen/balance nitrogen for 2 h results in selective changes of cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neuronal markers in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum when evaluated 3 weeks after the insult. There is also about a 15% deficiency in brain weight. Treatment with GM1 ganglioside, 50 mg/kg i.p., for 2 days before and for 3 weeks after the hypoxic insult partially corrects the neurodevelopmental abnormalities including the deficiency in brain weight. We conclude that GM1 ganglioside might have therapeutic potential for treating suspected neonatal hypoxia.
