1. Intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) was monitored by means of Fura-2 fluorescence measurements in hippocampal cells in primary cultures from newborn rats. 2. In external media containing 200 microM-DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate and 1 mM-kynurenate, but no added Ca2+, an increase in [Ca2+]i was observed in 30-40% of cells examined in response to quisqualate or L-glutamate. 3. Under such conditions, [Ca2+]i often increased gradually with a latency of a few seconds after application of the agonists. 4. Pre-treatment of the cultured cells with pertussis toxin reduced the extent of quisqualate-stimulated [Ca2+]i increase in Ca2+-free media, but the percentage of the responsive cells was not affected appreciably. 5. It is concluded that quisqualate and L-glutamate can trigger the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores, most likely by activating a glutamate receptor coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein.
