The role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the generation and maintenance of epileptic seizures has been widely investigated, however, little is known of possible separate roles played by NMDARs that contain different NR2 subunits. A better comprehension of how distinct NMDARs subtypes participate in seizure generation and/or diffusion may lead to the development of more targeted pharmacologic strategies to treat epilepsy. Therefore, we have performed an electrophysiologic investigation using a multielectrode array device, on slices comprising entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus, continuously perfused in a Mg(2+) -free medium, with added 4-aminopiridine (4AP; 10-15 mum). Two separate rhythmic patterns of interictal-like activity were generated in EC and hippocampus, with EC seizures entrained to those in CA3, so that a significant degree of cross-correlation occurred. Perfusion with the NR2A-containing NMDAR antagonist [(R)-[(S)-1-(4-bromo-phenyl)-ethylamino]-(2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxalin- 5-yl)-methyl]-phosphonic acid (NVP-AAM077; 50 nm) or Zn(2+) (200 nm), did not affect the rate of interictal-like events in EC and hippocampus; however, it significantly reduced their cross-correlation, causing a substantial decoupling of the two rhythm generators. The same effect was observed with (alphaR,betaS)-alpha-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-beta-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinep ropanol maleate (Ro25-6981; 1 mum), when coapplied with a subthreshold dose of NVP-AAM077. Our results suggest that NR2 subunits may be crucial in entraining cortical networks, leading to recruitment of wider range oscillations during epilepsy. Therefore, a pharmacologic strategy directed onto NR2 subunits may help to limit seizure diffusion and recruitment of potentially entrained oscillatory networks.
