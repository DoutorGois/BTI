mRNAs encoded by genes for the lipid-sensitive mechano-gated K(+) channels TREK-1, TREK-2, and TRAAK were detected in rat brain at different life-cycle stages: 18-day embryos, postnatal days 1, 7, 28, and 60 (adulthood). mRNA expression of TREK-1 or TREK-2 showed no appreciable changes during the development of cortex and hippocampus. TRAAK mRNA expression increased with development and reached an apparent maximum at postnatal day 28 in hippocampus and day 60 in cortex. These data suggest that TRAAK might be important in the development of rat brain.
