Laying down new memories has long been thought to involve interactions between the hippocampus and multiple regions of the neocortex. Functional neuroimaging studies performed over the past four years provide evidence for this proposal. A recent electrophysiological study offers a possible mechanism by which interactions between brain regions take place during memory formation.
