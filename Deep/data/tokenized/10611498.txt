Deficiency in palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT) results in the rapid death of neocortical neurons in human. Very little is known about the developmental and cell-specific expression of this lysosomal enzyme. Here we show that PPT is expressed as a major 2.65 kb and a minor 1.85 kb transcript in the mouse brain. Transcript levels gradually increase between postnatal days 10 and 30. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that PPT transcripts are found widely but not homogeneously in the brain. The most intense signal was detected in the cerebral cortex (layers II, IV-V), hippocampal CA1-CA3 pyramidal cells, dentate gyrus granule cells and the hypothalamus. Immunostaining of PPT was localized in the cell soma, axons and dendrites, especially in the pyramidal and granular cells of the hippocampus, correlating well, both spatially and temporally, with the immunoreactivity of a presynaptic vesicle membrane protein, synaptophysin. In whole embryos, at embryonic day 8, the PPT mRNA expression was most apparent throughout the neuroepithelium, and from day 9 onwards it was seen in all tissues. The expression pattern of PPT suggests its general significance for the brain cells and reflects the response to maturation and growth of the neural networks. Strong PPT immunoreactivity in the axons and dentrites would imply that PPT may not be exclusively a lysosomal enzyme. A notable correlation with synaptophysin would suggest that PPT may have a role in the function of the synaptic machinery.
