Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) strain 67N was inoculated into the sciatic nerve or the right leg crural muscle of rats. In both cases, the virus was isolated first from the caudal half of the spinal cord on day 2 after inoculation, and from the rostral half of the spinal cord and the brain on day 3. The virus titers in the brain reached a maximum when the infected rats developed CNS symptoms on day 5. Using confocal laser scanning microscope, fluorescent positive cells were first found in the lumbar dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord ipsilateral of the inoculated leg on day 3. Antigen positive neurons were found bilaterally in the lumbar DRG and spinal cord on day 4. On day 5 specific fluorescence was observed in the neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, brainstem and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.
