OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Tonifying Shen recipe (TSR) on advanced glycation end products (AGEPs), amyloid-beta peptide (A beta P) in telencephalon and hippocampus of ovariectomized rats. METHODS: Female SD rats, 9 months old, were randomly divided into 3 groups: the sham operation (Sh) group, the ovariectomized (OV) group and the TSR group. Medication via gastrogavage 4 weeks was given after ovariectomy consecutively for 16 weeks. Competitive ELISA and radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to detect AGEPs and A beta P level in rats' telencephalon and hippocampus; florescent assay was used to determine the serum and urinary soluble AGE-peptide level; and also the rats' behavioral alteration and hippocampal morphological change were observed. RESULTS: Compared with those in the Sh group, the correct escape rate in the OV group was significantly lower (P < 0.05), content of A beta P in telencephalon and serum soluble AGE-peptide levels significantly higher (P < 0.05), contents of AGEPs in telencephalon and hippocampal tissue showed an increased tendency, but without significance (P > 0.05), argyrophil stain showed that nerve fiber thickened, senile plaques appeared in temporal cortex. In the TSR group after treatment, contents of AGEPs in telencephalon, A beta P in telencephalon and hippocampus significantly decreased (P < 0.05), the urinary soluble AGE-peptide level significantly increased (P < 0.05) and with markedly improvement of learning memory capability and above-mentioned pathological changes. CONCLUSION: TSR could reduce the accumulation of AGEPs in telencephalon and the contents of A beta P in telencephalon and hippocampal tissue, and improve the impaired ability of learning and memory caused by lack of estrogen. Its mechanism might be based on the elevation in excretion of AGE-peptide via kidney.
