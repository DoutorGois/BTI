The cholinergic innervation of the rat hippocampus proper and fascia dentata was investigated by using a monoclonal antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). At the light microscopic level, thin varicose ChAT-immunoreactive fibers were observed mainly in the vicinity of the pyramidal and granular layers where they formed a fine network around proximal dendrites of pyramidal and granule cells. In addition, many ChAT-immuno-reactive fibers were found in the hilar region and in stratum oriens, radiatum, and lacunosum-moleculare of all hippocampal sectors. Electron microscopic analysis revealed ChAT immunoreactivity in thin unmyelinated varicose axons and terminals which established synaptic contacts. Asymmetric contacts of ChAT-immunoreactive terminals were found on small spines in the dendritic layers of the hippocampus proper and in the molecular layer of the fascia dentata. Symmetric synaptic contacts were formed on the cell bodies of pyramidal and granule cells. Both symmetric and asymmetric synaptic contacts occurred on dendritic shafts. The analysis of serial thin sections, which allows identification of postsynaptic elements, suggests that pyramidal cells, granule cells, and nonpyramidal neurons of the hippocampus receive a cholinergic input.
