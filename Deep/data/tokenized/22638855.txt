We report changes in neuroplastin gene and protein expression in the hippocampus of B4galnt1 null mice, which lacks complex ganglioside structures, compared with that of wild-type mice. Neuroplastin mRNA expression was significantly higher in the hippocampi of B4galnt1 null mice than in wild-type mice. Moreover, Western blot analysis shows increased neuroplastin protein levels of neuroplastin-55 isoform in B4galnt1 null hippocampal homogenates. Immunohistochemistry revealed a substantially different distribution of neuroplastin immunoreactivity in sagittal sections of the hippocampi derived from B4galnt1 null in comparison with those from wild-type mice. Most strikingly, B4galnt1 null mice had relatively little neuroplastin immunoreactivity in the pyramidal layer of CA1 and CA3, whereas wild-type mice had strong neuroplastin staining of pyramidal cells. Results of this study support the hypothesis that alterations of brain ganglioside expression influence the expression of neuroplastin. As both neuroplastin and gangliosides have important roles in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and neurite outgrowth, it will be of particular interest to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between ganglioside composition and neuroplastin transcript and protein expression in the mammalian nervous system.
