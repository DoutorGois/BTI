We studied the effects of single intragastric administration of ladasten in a dose of 50 mg/kg on the time course of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and levels of acetylated histones H3 (Lys9) and H4 (Lys8) in the striatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Ladasten reduced HDAC1 level in rat striatum and hippocampus and modified H3acK9 and H4acK8 levels in various structures of rat brain.
