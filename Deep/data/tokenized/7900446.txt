In the course of a long-term L-DOPA administration (14 days) and 2 weeks after its cessation the activities of some protein enzymes (aminopeptidase, acid phosphatase), neuromediator (MAO, ACE) and oxidative (glutamate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) metabolism were studied by quantitative cytochemical methods in brain motor structures (sensorimotor cortex, caudate nucleus) and in structures not directly related to motor functions (hippocampus) of rats with high and low motor activity. After L-DOPA (madapar) cessation significant changes were revealed in the formation of motor system of the brain, primarily in the group of rats with low motor activity. It is suggested that a decrease in MAO activity after madapar cessation may be responsible for dyskinesia arising after cessation of L-DOPA preparations treatment.
