To investigate the relationship between caspase-3-like protease activity, which has been suggested to be related to apoptosis, and DNA fragmentation, we measured changes in caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation in the hippocampus of gerbils exposed to global ischemia induced by bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries for 5 min. Caspase-3-like protease activity began to increase at day 4 post-ischemia, reached a peak at day 5, and declined thereafter. The levels of DNA fragmentation, evaluated in terms of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and cytosolic nucleosomes, in the ischemic hippocampus began to increase significantly at day 3 after ischemia, reached a peak at day 4, and decreased thereafter. Our data suggest that DNA fragmentation in ischemic hippocampus of gerbils precedes caspase-3-like protease activation. Our results indicate that a caspase-3-like protease-independent apoptotic pathway operates, at least at the onset of neuronal cell death, in the hippocampus of gerbils after global ischemia.
