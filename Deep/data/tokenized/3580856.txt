The effects of intrahippocampal injections of scopolamine and pirenzepine on muscarinic receptor binding were examined by quantitative autoradiographic techniques. Brain slices from animals which had received 7 injections of either scopolamine (n = 5) or pirenzepine (n = 5) over a 22-day injection schedule were compared with slices from 5 saline-injected controls for receptor binding to the whole slice and within selected regions of the brain as measured autoradiographically. The total number of receptors was determined from direct binding assays with 1-[3H]quinuclidinyl-benzilate ([3H]-1-QNB), while the binding of the selective ligands pirenzepine, carbamylcholine, and scopolamine was examined through inhibition studies. The data from the whole slices indicated that pirenzepine-treated animals contained more receptors for [3H]-1-QNB than either saline- or scopolamine-injected controls. Slices from the same animals also displayed a lower affinity for pirenzepine. Slices from scopolamine-injected animals revealed neither an increase in receptor number nor a decrease in antagonist affinity, although the binding of the agonist carbamylcholine was increased. Quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms generated from the slices indicated that the increase in receptor number for pirenzepine-injected animals was predominantly within the cerebral and cingulate cortices. The inhibition by pirenzepine was also lower in these areas in the same group of animals. Agonist inhibition was altered in the central layers of the cerebral cortex and in the pretectal area in scopolamine-treated animals. The results suggest separate mechanisms of drug action and adaptation for pirenzepine and scopolamine.
