The validity of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta(1-42)) intrahippocampal injection, as an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has previously been considered in terms of inflammatory reactivity and neuronal damage. In this work, we have extended the testing of the animal model to vasculature by comparison of selected properties of microvessels in vivo with those in human AD brain tissue. The injection of Abeta(1-42), relative to control PBS (phosphate buffered saline), increased the mean number of microvessels and diminished the mean length of microvessels in the molecular layer of dentate gyrus. The animal model showed Abeta(1-42), but not PBS, injection was associated with abnormalities in morphology of microvessels which were characterized as looping, fragmented, knob-like, uneven, and constricted. In particular, numbers of constricted microvessels, defined as vessels with diameters less than 3 mum, were considerably enhanced for Abeta(1-42), compared to PBS, injection. In comparison, human AD brain demonstrated an elevated number of microvessels with a diminished mean length relative to nondemented (ND) brain. Additionally, microvessel perturbations in AD brain showed a similar pattern of morphological abnormalities to those observed in Abeta(1-42)-injected rat hippocampus. Constricted microvessels were a prominent feature of AD brain but were rarely observed in ND tissue. These results provide the first evidence that a peptide-injection animal model exhibits a commonality in perturbations of microvessels compared with those evident in AD brain.
