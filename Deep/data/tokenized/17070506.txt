Since many nuclear proteins are ectopically localized in the cytoplasm in the vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer disease (AD), we speculated that there is failure of the cytoplasmic-nuclear transport machinery in AD. In support of this notion, we found that importin alpha1, an essential component of cytoplasmic-nuclear transport, is abnormally accumulated in Hirano bodies in vulnerable hippocampal neurons in AD. These data suggest a hindrance in importin-mediated cytoplasmic-nuclear transport in AD.
