Vertically aligned carbon nanofiber (VACNF) electrode arrays were tested for their potential application in recording neuro-electrophysiological activity. We report, for the first time, stimulation and extracellular recording of spontaneous and evoked neuroelectrical activity in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures with ultramicroelectrode VACNF arrays. Because the electrodes are carbon-based, these arrays have potential advantages over metal electrodes and could enable a variety of future applications as precise, informative, and biocompatible neural interfaces.
