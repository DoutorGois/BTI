The serotonin transporter is a member of the monoamine transporter family that also includes transporters of dopamine and norepinephrine. We have used sensitized acceptor emission fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to study the oligomerization of SERT in HEK-MSR-239 cells, RN46A cells and in cultured hippocampal neurons. We were able to show identical FRET efficiencies in cell lines as well as in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, demonstrating that the oligomerization is cell type independent. The results obtained with both FRET approaches are very similar and furthermore, in agreement with previous results obtained by donor bleaching FRET microscopy.
