Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate has recently been isolated from human urine and it was proposed that derivatives of this compound might be related to an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine receptors. In the present study we investigated high-affinity binding of [3H]propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]PrCC) to rat brain membranes. [3H]PrCC binds specifically and with high affinity (half-maximal binding at ca. 1nM) to rat brain membranes. The regional and subcellular distributions of specific [3H]PrCC binding are similar, but not identical, to the distributions of [3H]flunitrazepam or [3H]-diazepam binding. The total numbers of binding sites labelled by [3H]PrCC and [3H]flunitrazepam in rat cerebellum are closely similar, and both ligands bind to cerebellar membranes in a mutually exclusive way. The pharmacological selectivity of [3H]PrCC and [3H]diazepam binding is almost identical. Binding of [3H]PrCC like binding of [3H]diazepam, can be increased in vitro by muscimol, GABA and SQ 20.009. Although subtle differences in binding characteristics were observed, these results indicate that [3H]PrCC and benzodiazepines bind to a common recognition site on benzodiazepine receptors.
