The alpha2-adrenergic receptor (alpha2-AR) is widely distributed in the brain with distinct roles for alpha2-AR subtypes (A, B and C). In this article, data are provided on Activity Regulated Cytoskeleton Associated Protein (Arc) and Zif268 expression in the brain of the alpha2A-AR knockout (alpha2A-AR KO) mouse. These data are supplemental to an original research article examining Arc and Zif268 expression in rats injected with the alpha2-AR antagonist, RX821002 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2015.12.002. [1]).
