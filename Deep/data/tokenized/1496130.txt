1. The effects of chemically induced convulsions, clinically similar to those elicited by electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), on brain regional distribution of neuropeptide Y-, neurokinin A-, substance P- and neurotensin-like immunoreactivities were studied in the rat. 2. Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and bicuculline (BIC) were used to induce grand mal seizures. Rats were divided into three groups receiving one of the following treatments: Saline, PTZ (45 mg/kg) or BIC (1.5 mg/kg). 3. After sacrifice by focused microwave irradiation, brains were dissected, peptides extracted and measured by specific radioimmunoassays. 4. Repeated grand mal convulsions induced by PTZ, in similarity to ECT, markedly increased NPY-LI concentrations in frontal cortex and hippocampus. In contrast to ECT, no changes in NKA- or SP-LI levels were seen. NT-LI was lowered in striatum. 5. Bicuculline effects were more circumscribed: some animals developed grand mal and died while convulsing (peptides not measured), others did not develop generalized seizures and were sacrificed after the fourth treatment. 6. The results demonstrate a similar effect of PTZ and ECT on regional NPY-LI concentrations and raise the possibility that grand mal, regardless of etiology, is necessary for effects on peptides.
