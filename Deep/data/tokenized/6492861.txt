A simple method is described for the construction of electrode arrays consisting of insulated metal wires (33 microns diameter) spaced at small, equal distances (0.1 mm). No specialized instrumentation and techniques are needed, as only simple mechanical tools are sufficient. The electrode arrays are used for field potential recording from in vitro brain slice preparations.
