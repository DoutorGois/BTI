A recent clinical study showed that statins, which are inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, reduced the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animal studies that have employed high cholesterol diet indicate significant relationship between cholesterol level and senile plaque deposition. Here, we investigated the effects of lovastatin on beta-amyloid production and senile plaque deposition in an animal model of AD (Tg2576 mice). As expected, lovastatin treatment reduced plasma cholesterol level in both male and female mice. However, lovastatin enhanced the amounts of beta-amyloid and other beta-secretase derived peptides in females, but not in males. Likewise, lovastatin increased the number of plaques in the hippocampus and cortex of females, but not in males. Lovastatin did not change the amounts of full-length or alpha-secretase processed amyloid precursor protein (APP), or presenilin 1 (PS1) in either sex. Thus, lovastatin lowers cholesterol level in both genders, but enhances beta-amyloid production and senile plaque deposition only in brains of female Tg2576 mice. Our results suggest that low plasma cholesterol levels might be a risk factor for AD in females.
