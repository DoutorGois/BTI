The present study was undertaken to examine whether NKH477, a novel and potent water-soluble forskolin derivative, stimulates adenylyl cyclase and regulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB expression in the rat brain. Administration of NKH477 at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg, but not 0.1 mg/kg, increased levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in a time-dependent manner in frontal cortex and hippocampus. Repeated administration of NKH477 (1.0 mg/kg) for 7 or 14 days also increased levels of cAMP in these two brain regions, indicating that the response does not desensitize with chronic treatment. In addition, administration of NKH477 at the 1 mg/kg dose increased the expression of BDNF and TrkB mRNA in frontal cortex and hippocampus. This effect was observed after single, as well as repeated (7 or 14 days), administration of NKH477. These results demonstrate that NKH477 administration rapidly increases cAMP levels in brain and provides evidence that stimulation of this second messenger system increases the expression of BDNF and TrkB mRNA.
