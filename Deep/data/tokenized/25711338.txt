Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors exert preclinical effects indicative of therapeutic potential (i.e., analgesia). However, the extent to which MAGL and FAAH inhibitors produce unwanted effects remains unclear. Here, FAAH and MAGL inhibition was examined separately and together in a Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC; 5.6 mg/kg i.p.) discrimination assay predictive of subjective effects associated with cannabis use, and the relative contribution of N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate putamen to those effects was examined. Delta(9)-THC dose-dependently increased Delta(9)-THC appropriate responses (ED50 value = 2.8 mg/kg), whereas the FAAH inhibitors PF-3845 [N-3-pyridinyl-4-[[3-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy]phenyl]methyl]-1-piper idinecarboxamide] and URB597 [(3'-(aminocarbonyl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)-cyclohexylcarbamate] or a MAGL inhibitor JZL184 [4-nitrophenyl-4-(dibenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl(hydroxy)methyl)piperidine-1-carboxyl ate] alone did not substitute for the Delta(9)-THC discriminative stimulus. The nonselective FAAH/MAGL inhibitors SA-57 [4-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 2-(methylamino)-2-oxoethyl ester] and JZL195 [4-nitrophenyl 4-(3-phenoxybenzyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate] fully substituted for Delta(9)-THC with ED50 values equal to 2.4 and 17 mg/kg, respectively. Full substitution for Delta(9)-THC was also produced by a combination of JZL184 and PF-3845, but not by a combination of JZL184 and URB597 (i.e., 52% maximum). Cannabinoid receptor type 1 antagonist rimonabant attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of Delta(9)-THC, SA-57, JZL195, and the combined effects of JZL184 and PF-3845. Full substitution for the Delta(9)-THC discriminative stimulus occurred only when both 2-AG and AEA were significantly elevated, and the patterns of increased endocannabinoid content were similar among brain regions. Overall, these results suggest that increasing both endogenous 2-AG and AEA produces qualitatively unique effects (i.e., the subjective effects of cannabis) that are not obtained from increasing either 2-AG or AEA separately.
