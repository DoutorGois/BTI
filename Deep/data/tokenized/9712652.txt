Calcium-evoked dendritic exocytosis (CEDE), demonstrated in cultured hippocampal neurons, is a novel mechanism that could play a role in synaptic plasticity. A number of forms of neuronal plasticity are thought to be mediated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). Here, we investigate the role of CaMKII in CEDE. We find that the developmental time course of CEDE parallels the expression of alphaCaMKII, a dominant subunit of CaMKII. An inhibitor of this enzyme, KN-62, blocks CEDE. Furthermore, 7 d in vitro neurons (which normally do not express alphaCaMKII nor show CEDE) can undergo CEDE when infected with a recombinant virus producing alphaCaMKII. Expression of a constitutively active CaMKII produces dendritic exocytosis in the absence of calcium stimulus, and this exocytosis is blocked by nocodazole, an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization that also blocks CEDE. These results indicate that CEDE is mediated by the activation of CaMKII, consistent with the view that CEDE plays a role in synaptic plasticity.
