In the present study, the temporal and spatial alterations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) immunoreactivity in the gerbil hippocampus after 5 min transient forebrain ischemia were investigated as followed up 7 days after ischemic insult, and the effects of ACTH after ischemic insult were also investigated 4 days after ischemic insult. The ectopic expression of ACTH (1-24 fragments) immunoreactive neurons in the cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) region of hippocampus and hilar region of the dentate gyrus 1 day after the ischemic insult was observed. Judging from the double immunofluorescence study, these neurons contain GABA. Four days after ischemic insult, the ACTH immunoreactivity was localized in CA1 pyramidal cells and glia near the stratum pyramidale, which normally do not express ACTH. In addition, in the saline-treated groups, the percentage of the detected Cresyl Violet positive neurons was 11.2% compared with the sham-operated group 4 and 7 days after ischemic insult. In these groups, the OX-42 immunoreactive microglia were detected in the strata pyramidale, oriens and radiatum. However, in the Org2766 (analog of ACTH)-treated group, 57.8% neurons compared with the sham-operated group were stained with Cresyl Violet 4 and 7 days after ischemic insult. In these groups, the OX-42 immunoreactive microglia were significantly reduced in the stratum pyramidale. These results suggest that transient forebrain ischemia may provoke selective ectopic and enhanced expression of ACTH in the hippocampus, and further suggest that ACTH plays an important role in reducing the ischemic damage.
