To analyze mediatory mechanisms underlying attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and their association with epilepsy, the electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to various centrally applied neurotransmitter agonists were studied in spontaneously hypertensive (SH), kainate-treated (KA), and normotensive (control) rats, with chronically implanted electrodes into the frontal cortex and hippocampus and a cannula into the lateral cerebral ventricle. In SH rats, the baseline EEG showed increased delta and beta2 activity in the hippocampus and decreased alpha/beta1 activity in both brain areas. In KA rats, these delta and alpha/beta1 effects were observed 2 weeks post-kainate, while the beta2 activity increase occurred after 5 weeks in the hippocampus and, to a greater extent, 9 weeks post-injection in both brain areas. In SH rats, NMDA increased delta and decreased alpha/beta1 activity, similar to KA rats 5 weeks post-injection. In SH rats, clonidine augmented theta/beta2 increase in the cortex and alpha suppression in both brain areas, in parallel with induction of beta2 activity in the hippocampus. These beta2 effects were observed 5 and 9 weeks post-kainate. In SH rats, baclofen produced robust delta/theta enhancement and alpha/beta1 suppression in both brain areas, with additional beta2 activity increase in the hippocampus, while muscimol was ineffective in both groups of rats. In KA rats, EEG responses to GABA agonists were similar to those in control. Our results demonstrate sensitization of NMDA receptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors both in SH and KA rats and that of GABAb receptors specifically in SH rats.
