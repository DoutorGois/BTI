MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in different nervous system diseases. We sought to determine the role of miRNAs in isoflurane-induced learning and memory impairment in aged rats. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of 18 month were randomly assigned to control group (exposed to mock anesthesia), 2-hour group and 6-hour group (exposed to 2% isoflurane for 2 and 6 hours respectively). By Morris Water Maze, 6-hour group showed impaired learning and memory ability while 2-hour group not. As shown by miRNA array, control group and 2-hour group showed a similar miRNA expression profile. And 38 miRNAs are differently expressed in 6-hour group compared to the other 2 groups, including 21 up-regulated miRNAs and 17 down-regulated miRNAs. And 4 of the differentially expressed miRNAs were validated independently by qRT-PCR. Let-7d was downregulated in 6-hour group. Additionally, we demonstrated that amyloid precursor protein (APP) was a direct target of let-7d by Fluorescent report assay. Increased expression of APP and amyloid-beta (Abeta) were found in the hippocampi of 6-hour group. Downregulation of let-7d might contribute to isoflurane-induced learning and memory impairment through upregulating its target APP, and increasing the production of Abeta subsequently.
