To estimate stable behavioural peculiarities, an individual varying choice of greater or better appetite reinforcement depending on the time of instrumental motor response was used with cats. A decisive role in realisation of the response choice is played by the influence of motivational structures of hypothalamus and amygdala on formal areas of neocortex typical for "impulsive" (fast reacting) cats, and interaction of the frontal cortex--hippocampus system for the animals with delayed pressing of the lever to obtain their preferred food, i.e. manifesting the ability of "self-control".
