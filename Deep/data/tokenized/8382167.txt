The activity of some enzymes associated with peroxide metabolism and cytochrome oxidase activity was measured in cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus from brains of rats aged either 4, 15, or 27 months. Cytochrome oxidase activity was greatest in the cortex, but no significant age-related changes in the activity of cytochrome oxidase, superoxide dismutase, or glutathione peroxidase were found in any of the brain areas. In contrast, glutathione reductase activity increased as a function of age in all regions. In general, the activity of catalase fell on maturation of the animal to adulthood and then showed a trend to increase with age.
