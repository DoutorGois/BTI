Synaptosomal D-aspartate has been used as a marker for glutamate neurons in control and in postmortem Alzheimer's disease brains. This technique shows a marked (60%) decrease of the glutamate uptake site in cortical and hippocampal regions. There were no significant changes in subcortical regions. We interpret these results as indicating loss of, or damage to, cortical glutamatergic innervation. These losses probably represent the biochemical correlate of pyramidal neuron damage in Alzheimer's disease.
