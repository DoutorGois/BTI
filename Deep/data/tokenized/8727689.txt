The influence of cholecystokinin-like peptide, ceruletide, on EEG and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) was studied in nine cats. The cats were bearing electrodes implanted in the auditory cortex, hippocampus, reticular formation and cerebellum. Reference drugs used were haloperidol and neostigmine. The hippocampus showed the strongest effect of ceruletide, whereas the cerebellum was virtually unresponsive. The amplitude of AEPs was increased by peptide, an effect lasting up to 21 days which, according to amplitude frequency analysis (AFC) was due to an augmented theta response. The latter possibly indicates increased signal transfer to, or through, the brain structure in question, particularly in the hippocampal neurons. The effects of haloperidol and neostigmine did not reflect those of ceruletide and lasted only a few hours.
