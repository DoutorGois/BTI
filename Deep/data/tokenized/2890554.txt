The murine Hox 1.3 gene is one of six homeo box genes clustered on chromosome 6. Our analysis of Hox 1.3 cDNA and genomic clones indicates that the gene is organized into two exons and encodes a 270-amino-acid homeo domain protein. The predicted protein is rich in serine, glycine, and proline residues, and its homeo domain is identical to the Hox 2.1 domain. During embryogenesis, the gene is maximally expressed at midgestation but is also expressed to a lesser extent in many adult tissues possessing different cell lineages. Hox 1.3 transcripts are also present in cultured fibroblasts. The Hox 1.3 protein accumulates in the nuclei of nonconfluent cultured fibroblasts but is greatly diminished in contact-inhibited nongrowing cells. Thus, the expression of the Hox 1.3 gene correlates with growth in embryos and cultured cells. Paradoxically, it is also expressed in certain subsets of postmitotic, fully differentiated neurons, most notably the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum, the pyramidal and dentate neurons of the hippocampus, and the motor neurons of the spinal cord. This complex pattern of expression suggests that Hox 1.3 may provide a function required by many cell types in addition to any role it may have in morphogenesis.
