This study reports the mRNA levels of some excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in response to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The study was performed in 3-month-old and 18-month-old animals to analyze the possible role of age in the I/R response of these transporters. The I/R resulted in a reduced transcription of both the neuronal EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier-1) and the neuronal and glial GLT-1 (glial glutamate transporter 1), while the glial GLAST1a (l-glutamate/l-aspartate transporter 1a) transcription increased following I/R. The changes observed were more striking in 3-month-old animals than in 18-month-old animals. We hypothesize that increases in the GLAST1a mRNA levels following I/R insult can be explained by increases in glial cells, while the GLT-1 response to I/R mirrors neuronal changes. GLAST1a transcription increases in 3-month-old animals support the hypothesis that this transporter would be the main mechanism for extracellular glutamate clearance after I/R. Decreases in EAAC1 and GLT-1 mRNA levels would represent either neuronal changes due to the delayed neuronal death or a putative protective down-regulation of these transporters to decrease the amount of glutamate inside the neurons, which would decrease their glutamate release. This study also reports how the treatment with the anti-inflammatory agent meloxicam attenuates the transcriptional response to I/R in 3-month-old rats and decreases the survival of the I/R-injured animals.
