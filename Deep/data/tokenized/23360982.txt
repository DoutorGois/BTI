Both synaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) have been shown to be critical for nuclear calcium signals associated with transcriptional responses to bursts of synaptic input. However the direct contribution to nuclear calcium signals from calcium influx through NMDA receptors and VOCCs has been obscured by their concurrent roles in action potential generation and synaptic transmission. Here we compare calcium responses to synaptically induced bursts of action potentials with identical bursts devoid of any synaptic contribution generated using the pre-recorded burst as the voltage clamp command input to replay the burst in the presence of blockers of action potentials or ionotropic glutamate receptors. Synapse independent replays of bursts produced nuclear calcium responses with amplitudes around 70% of their original synaptically generated signals and were abolished by the L-type VOCC blocker, verapamil. These results identify a major direct source of nuclear calcium from local L-type VOCCs whose activation is boosted by NMDA receptor dependent depolarization. The residual component of synaptically induced nuclear calcium signals which was both VOCC independent and NMDA receptor dependent showed delayed kinetics consistent with a more distal source such as synaptic NMDA receptors or internal stores. The dual requirement of NMDA receptors and L-type VOCCs for synaptic activity-induced nuclear calcium dependent transcriptional responses most likely reflects a direct somatic calcium influx from VOCCs whose activation is amplified by synaptic NMDA receptor-mediated depolarization and whose calcium signal is boosted by a delayed input from distal calcium sources mostly likely entry through NMDA receptors and release from internal stores.
