UNLABELLED: Biphalin is a dimeric opioid peptide that exhibits affinity for three types of opioid receptors (MOP, DOP and KOP). Biphalin is undergoing intensive preclinical study. It was recognized that activation of delta-opioid receptor elicits neuroprotection against brain hypoxia and ischemia. We compare the effect of biphalin and morphine and the inhibition of opioid receptors by naltrexone on survival of neurons in rat organotypic hippocampal cultures challenged with NMDA. FINDINGS: (1) 0.025-0.1 muM biphalin reduces NMDA-induced neuronal damage; (2) biphalin neuroprotection is abolished by naltrexone; (3) reduced number of dead cells is shown even if biphalin is applied with delay after NMDA challenge.
