Tetraethylammonium (TEA) induces long-term potentiation (LTP)-like synaptic enhancement in rat hippocampal slices. To find the genes related to this phenomenon, subtraction screening was performed between the mRNA of TEA-treated slices and that of untreated whole brain. One of the clones induced by the TEA treatment, named as norbin, was expressed only in neural tissues. The predicted protein sequence of norbin consisted of 729 amino acids, and no homologies in the sequence were found with known genes or proteins. Overexpression of norbin in cultured Neuro 2a cells by cDNA transfection induced neurite-outgrowth. Since in the course of neural plasticity the formation of new synapses should occur, the neurite-outgrowth-related protein, norbin, might play an important role in neural plasticity.
