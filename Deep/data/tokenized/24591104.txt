Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulates long-term potentiation (LTP) and ameliorates memory in healthy and diseased brain. Increasing evidence shows that, under physiological conditions, low concentrations of amyloid beta (Abeta) are necessary for LTP expression and memory formation. Here, we report that cAMP controls amyloid precursor protein (APP) translation and Abeta levels, and that the modulatory effects of cAMP on LTP occur through the stimulation of APP synthesis and Abeta production.
