The concentrations of type I and type II adrenocorticosteroid receptors in brain cytosol obtained from adrenalectomized-ovariectomized female mice were measured with five different assay conditions. Among the five brain regions studied, hippocampus had the highest concentration of type I receptors, whereas cerebral cortex had the highest concentration of type II receptors. The value of properly correcting for dexamethasone cross-binding to type I receptors when type II receptors are being assayed was demonstrated using the type II receptor-selective ligand RU28362. A time-course study revealed a transient up-regulation of both receptor classes in most brain regions after adrenalectomy-ovariectomy, with maximal values achieved 3-5 days postsurgery and a reduction to near-intact levels by 16 days postsurgery. A single sc injection of aldosterone given to adrenalectomized-ovariectomized mice produced a profound down-regulation of type I receptors in hippocampal, cerebral cortex, hypothalamic, brain stem, and cerebellar samples, whereas it down-regulated type II receptors only in hippocampal and cerebral cortical samples. A similar injection of RU28362 failed to down-regulate type I receptors in any brain region, but it did reduce the concentration of type II receptors in all brain regions except cerebellum. The actions of aldosterone appear to be mediated solely through type I receptors, since injections of the type I receptor antagonist RU26752 prevented aldosterone-induced down-regulation of both type I and type II receptors, whereas RU26752 had no effect on the down-regulatory actions of RU28362. The ability of aldosterone to down-regulate type I, but not type II, receptors in hypothalamic, brain stem, and cerebellar samples suggests that type I and type II receptors are concentrated in separate populations of cells in these brain regions, whereas in hippocampus and cerebral cortex there is a sufficient degree of colocalization to permit type II receptor down-regulation via the action of aldosterone-type I receptor complexes. We speculate that this action is mediated at least in part at the genomic level by the suppression of type I and type II receptor mRNA synthesis brought about by the interactions of transformed aldosterone-type I receptor complexes with the DNA regulatory elements upstream from the genes for these receptors.
