Recent reports suggest that peptide drugs such as insulin have the potential to serve as therapeutics in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the transport of these drugs to the therapeutic target, the brain, is significantly hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Intranasal administration appears to be an ideal solution for drug delivery to the brain, bypassing the BBB, however the entry of peptide drugs into neuronal and epithelial cells in the olfactory mucosa remains low. In this study, we therefore examined whether intranasal coadministration of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) could improve nose-to-brain drug transport. In both mice and rats, we found that direct transport of insulin into the brain was significantly facilitated when coadministered with amphipathic CPP penetratin, and eventually insulin reached the deeper regions of the brain such as the hippocampus. In the mouse line senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8), spatial learning tests demonstrated that long-term intranasal coadministration of insulin with penetratin improved mild memory loss in the early stages of dementia. In contrast, the severe cognitive dysfunction in the aged SAMP8 mice was preserved despite intranasal coadministration of insulin with penetratin. The immunohistological examination of the hippocampus suggested that enhanced nose-to-brain delivery of insulin had a partial neuroprotective effect but unexpectedly increased amyloid beta plaque deposition. In conclusion, intranasal coadministration of insulin with CPPs has the potential to serve as a therapeutic for mild cognitive dysfunction. To identify suitable pharmacotherapy for dementia with severe pathology, further studies of nose-to-brain delivery of molecularly appropriate biopharmaceuticals are necessary.
