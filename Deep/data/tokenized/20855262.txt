OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of butylphthalide on the expressions of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and P53 in the brain tissue of rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Sixty male adult rats were randomly divided into AD model group, butylphthalide group and control group (n = 20). AD models were established by injecting beta-amyloid protein 1-42 into the hippocampus of rats. Sixty days later, the learning and memory abilities of the rats were evaluated using Y-maze test, and the expressions of PDI and P53 in the brain tissue of the rats were measured by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the rats in AD model group exhibited significantly reduced learning and memory abilities, lowered expressions of PDI in the hippocampus and increased expression of P53 in the cortex (P > 0.01). In comparison with the model group, the rats in the butylphthalide group showed significantly increased PDI-positive cells in the hippocampus and decreased expression of P53 in the cortex (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Butylphthalide improves the learning and memory abilities of rats with experimental AD, the mechanism of which may involve inhibition of P53 expression and enhancement of PDI expression in the brain tissues.
