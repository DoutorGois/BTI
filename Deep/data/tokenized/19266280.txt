The tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is not only a protein, but also a lipid phosphatase that can negatively regulate the serine/threonine kinase Akt. It has been reported that PTEN can be regulated by means of phosphorylation. However, whether PTEN can be regulated by another post-translational protein modification (S-nitrosylation) was not fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the S-nitrosylation of PTEN during transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rat hippocampus. Transient brain ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. Our data show that S-nitrosylation of PTEN was increased significantly after 12 h of reperfusion compared with sham control. Pretreatment with the inhibitor of nNOS (7-NI) and the inhibitor of iNOS could inhibit PTEN's activity and decrease S-nitrosylation of PTEN. Taken together, these results indicate that nitric oxide could regulate PTEN's activity via S-nitrosylation during transient global ischemia in rat hippocampus.
