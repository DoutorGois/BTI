The protective effects of hyperbaric oxygenation following traumatic brain injury have been widely investigated; however, few studies have made systematic comparisons between the different hyperbaric oxygenation manipulations and their corresponding effects. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were observed at 4h, 15d and 75d after traumatic brain injury. The effects of the different hyperbaric oxygenation manipulations on the rats were compared based on morphological, molecular biological and behavioral tests. Our results showed that hyperbaric oxygenation inhibited cell apoptosis in the rat hippocampus and improved their physiological functions. The effects observed in the hyperbaric oxygen-early group were better than the hyperbaric oxygen-delayed group, and the hyperbaric oxygen-early-delayed group demonstrated the best effects among all the groups. Our results showed the hyperbaric oxygenation was recommended early and delayed post-traumatic brain injury and exposure to hyperbaric oxygenation should be prolonged. These findings provide new ideal therapeutic insight for the clinical treatment of traumatic brain injury.
