Intracerebral vasopressin pretreatment impairs acquisition and consolidation, but delays extinction of conditioned avoidance behaviour. The latter effect of the peptide is associated with a pronounced suppression of the incorporation of labelled precursor in total lipids of the hippocampus. Results suggest that memory-improving effects of vasopressin are probably related to alterations of the brain lipid metabolism.
