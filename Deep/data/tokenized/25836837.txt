For in vivo deep tissue imaging, high order wavefront measurement and correction is needed for handling the severe wavefront distortion. Towards such a goal, we have developed the iterative multi-photon adaptive compensation technique (IMPACT). In this work, we explore using IMPACT to perform calcium imaging of neocortex through the intact skull of adult mice, and to image through the highly scattering white matter on the hippocampus surface.
