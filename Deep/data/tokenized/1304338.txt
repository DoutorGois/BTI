In Alzheimer's disease, all ganglio-series gangliosides (GM1, GD1a, GD1b and GT1b) were found to be decreased in temporal and frontal cortex, and nucleus basalis of Meynert. In addition, in Alzheimer's disease simple gangliosides (GM2, GM3) were elevated in frontal and parietal cortex, possibly correlating to accelerated lysosomal degradation of gangliosides and/or astrogliosis occurring during neuronal death.
