Dopamine via interaction with its receptor is known to be involved in the behavioral and endocrine actions in the mammalian brain. Behavioral effects produced by ethanol appear to be due to its actions on the dopaminergic system. In the present study using in situ hybridization histochemistry and RNase protection assay, the effect of prolonged ethanol intake on the expression of D2 dopamine receptor mRNA was examined in the rat brain. Specific D1 and D2 receptor mRNA signals were detected in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and amygdaloid complex of the rat brain. Within the hypothalamus, the level of receptor mRNA was low in most nuclei with a somewhat higher level in the arcuate nucleus. Only the supurachiasmatic nucleus showed moderate to dense dopamine receptor mRNAs. Prefrontal cortex showed hybridization signals but their intensity was very low. A considerable amount of D2 mRNA was localized in the substantia nigra but D1 mRNA was not. Ethanol (10%) intake for 5 weeks increased both the density of hybridization signal and number of cells expressing D2 dopamine receptor mRNA in the caudate putamen, and nucleus accumbens, but not in the olfactory tubercle. RNase protection assay revealed about a 1.5-fold increase in the D2 dopamine receptor mRNA level in the corpus striatum. These results provide a basis for the involvement of dopamine D2 receptor expression in alcoholism.
