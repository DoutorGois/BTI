Fatty acid (FA)-sensitive neurons are present in the brain, especially the hypothalamus, and play a key role in the neural control of energy and glucose homeostasis including feeding behavior, insulin secretion and action. Subpopulations of neurons in the ventromedial and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei are selectively either inhibited or activated by FA. Molecular effectors of these FA effects include ion channels such as chloride, potassium or calcium. In addition at least half of the FA responses in ventromedial hypothalamic neurons are mediated by interaction with FAT/CD36, a FA translocator/receptor that does not require intracellular metabolism to activate downstream signaling. Recently, an important role of lipoprotein lipase in FA sensing has also been demonstrated not only in hypothalamus, but also in the hippocampus and striatum. Finally, FA overload might impair neural control of energy homeostasis through enhanced ceramide synthesis and may contribute to obesity and/or type 2 diabetes pathogenesis in predisposed subjects.
