We studied cytoarchitectonics of the hippocampus in 101/HY and CBA mice on brain sections stained after Nissl and Timm. In CBA mice, the structure of hippocampus was normal. In 10/HY mice, stratum pyramidale in field CA3 was "splitted" and the density of pyramidal neurons was decreased. Abnormalities were also found in the zone of suprapyramidal projections of mossy fibers (sp-ME), i.e., terminals of axons of the fascia dentata granular cells on the apical dendrites of pyramids. If in CBA mice the sp-MF zone was normal, i.e., looked like a vast compact formation or dense ordered bundle, in 101/HY mice, the sp-MF zone represented a group of scattered, diffuse, and interrupted bundles of varying length, some of which were incorporated in stratum pyramidale. Possible causes of the described morphological abnormalities are discussed, as well as their relation to specific features of biology, behavior, and neurological status of 101/HY mice.
