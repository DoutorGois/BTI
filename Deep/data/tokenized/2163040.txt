A non-calcium-dependent chloride channel of conductance 62 pS, found in isolated inside-out patches of cultured fetal rat hippocampal neurons, is described. The channel does not require the presence of any neurotransmitter to be active and probably plays a part in maintaining the normal resting membrane potential.
