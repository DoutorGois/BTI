A dose of 30 ml/kg of 8.5% solution of sodium chloride was intraperitoneally injected into ddY mice and time course observations were conducted. Colloidal carbon was infused 6 hr after injection and distribution of carbon in the brain was observed. A transient increase in hematocrit value, serum osmotic pressure and ascites was observed 1 hr arter injection. Distribution of colloidal carbon in the brain showed less penetration of the basal ganglia. Histopathological examination of the brain showed degeneration of pyramidal cells in hippocampus 6 hr after injection. Electron microscopical examination revealed intracytoplasmic microvacuoles, swollen mitochondria and dilated cisternae in rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum of pyramidal cells. It was suggested that serum viscosity was increased by rapid transport of water from blood into the peritoneal cavity or urine, due to the high osmotic pressure of hypertonic saline injected, resulting in a decrease in blood flow and ischemic changes in the brain.
