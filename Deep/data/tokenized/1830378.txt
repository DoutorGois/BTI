Regional activity of phosphofructokinase enzyme and the amount of the isoenzyme C in 7 areas of young, adult and aged rats brain have been studied. The phosphofructokinase activity in substantia nigra decreased in adult and aged rats, but the maximum decrease was found in the septum of aged rats. There is a regional distribution of the isoenzyme C in the different areas studied. There was a general decrease in the amount of this isoenzyme in the areas studied with the exception of the hippocampus and the amygdala. The highest decrease was found in the septal area and in the diagonal band of Broca. These results are discussed in relation to the aging in different regions.
