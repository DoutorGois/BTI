Using electron microscopy and the combined oxalate-pyroantimonate technique, free calcium ions were located in the hippocampus of control rats and of those that had undergone status epilepticus induced by L-allylglycine or bicuculline. The validity of this technique was established by the use of the calcium chelating agent ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether), N,N'-tetra-acetic acid and by an X-ray microanalytical technique. In control material, calcium deposits were visible in synaptic vesicles and multivesicular bodies, in parts of the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and in glial and neuronal nuclei. Following 2 h of status epilepticus, cellular pathology included astrocytic swelling, and dark cell degeneration of pyramidal neurons. This was accompanied by a marked increase in the amount of calcium pyroantimonate deposits, particularly in swollen and disrupted mitochondria of CA1 and CA3 basal dendrites, and in selected neuronal cell bodies in the CA1 and CA3-4 regions. We propose that enhanced calcium entry into neurons and consequent overloading of the capacity of mitochondria for calcium sequestration is part of the cytotoxic mechanism leading to selective neuronal loss in the hippocampus in status epilepticus.
