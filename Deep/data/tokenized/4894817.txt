Temporal lobe epilepsy appears to be of increasing concern to psychiatrists, pediatricians and lawyers as an explanation for some aspects of behavior. There is a high incidence of structural abnormality associated with temporal lobe epilepsy, the most common being mesial temporal sclerosis. Depth electrode studies have shown that the most common focus for the clinical seizure is in the hippocampus or hippocampal gyrus. The first line of treatment continues to be attempt at control with anticonvulsant agents. Surgical treatment can be offered, in many instances, when drug therapy has failed.
