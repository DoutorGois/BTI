We review our works on the pharmacological modulation of long-term potentiation (LTP) at guinea pig hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vitro. The magnitude of tetanus-induced LTP at the mossy fiber synapse was augmented by perfusion of slices with several cognitive enhancers, such as bifemelane (1 microM). The mossy fiber LTP was enhanced by somatostatin (0.32 microM) and inhibited in somatostatin-depleted slices from cysteamine-treated guinea pigs. An involvement of the 5-HT3 receptor also showed that granisetron (0.1 microM) enhanced the mossy fiber LTP. The above-mentioned enhancements by perfused agents were commonly reversed, at least in part, by muscarinic antagonists. However, the magnitude of mossy fiber LTP was bidirectionally modulated by muscarinic stimulations of slices with physostigmine or carbachol at different concentrations. The enhancing effects of high-concentration carbachol was antagonized by pirenzepine, and in contrast, the inhibition by low-concentration carbachol was antagonized in the presence of AF-DX116. When guinea pigs were preinjected with the cholinotoxin AF64A, the magnitude of LTP was decreased in the slices prepared from AF64A-treated animals. These results suggest that endogenous acetylcholine dominantly plays facilitatory roles through muscarinic M1 receptors in the induction of mossy fiber LTP. The pharmacological characterization of mossy fiber LTP may be of help to the evaluation of cognitive enhancers at a neuronal circuit level.
