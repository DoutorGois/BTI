This study was designed to determine whether focal cerebral ischemia alters the expression of the immunoproteasomal (i-proteasomal) subunits. Transient cerebral ischemia significantly increased the expression of the i-proteasomal subunits, 20S beta1i (LMP2) and beta5i (LMP7) in the parietal cortex and hippocampus. This alteration was associated with a remarkable increase in ubiquitinated proteins. It is likely that the postischemic induction of the i-proteasome plays an important role in coping with the damaged proteins and thus may have an important effect on neuronal survival and death.
