The uptake of fluorescent stilbene derivatives including 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) was shown to occur from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid in the adult albino rat. SITS was found to be internalized in select populations of neurons, especially pyramidal neurons in layers V and VI of neocortex, granule, hilar and pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus, Purkinje neurons of the cerebellar cortex and predominantly large multipolar neurons in the oculomotor nuclei, lateral vestibular nucleus, red nucleus and the medial gigantocellular brainstem reticular formation neurons. The extent and quality of labeling of neuronal somata, dendrites and axons can be exploited with this technique to produce selective, 'Golgi' type labeling in the nervous system. The methods utilized are fast, economical, long lasting and compatible with fluorescence tracers and immunofluorescence techniques.
