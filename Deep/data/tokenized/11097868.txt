2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related substances are ubiquitous environmental pollutants causing a wide variety of pathological alterations, with the most severe being progressive anorexia and body weight loss. These features suggest a possible involvement of the nervous system and neuroendocrine-related organs including the pituitary gland. However, so far there is little evidence for direct effects of TCDD on these areas. In the present study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single oral dose of TCDD (10 microg/kg) and euthanized 1, 3, or 28 days after treatment. The expression of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) were analyzed in different brain regions and pituitaries using semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Relative levels of CYP1A1 mRNA and protein were dramatically increased in the pituitary. A significant increase in CYP1A1 mRNA was also detected in all the brain regions examined including olfactory bulb, striatum-caudate, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and substantia nigra. The increase in the expression was time-dependent with the highest level observed 1 day after TCDD treatment. The AHR and ARNT mRNAs were detected in the same areas but in contrast to CYP1A1 the changes in AHR and ARNT mRNA expression were limited to the 28-day time point. The present results provide evidence for the presence of CYP1A1, AHR, and ARNT in the central nervous system and in the pituitary, suggesting that TCDD may exert a direct effect on these regions.
