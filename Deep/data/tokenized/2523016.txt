The significance of beta-endorphin for drug dependence was explored by measuring the levels of beta-endorphin-immunoreactivity (beta E-IR) in plasma and parts of pituitary and brain of rats self-administering heroin or cocaine as compared to animals offered saline. Rats that had intravenously self-administrated heroin for 5 consecutive daily sessions of 6 h, and were decapitated immediately after the last session, showed a decreased concentration of beta E-IR in the anterior lobe (AL) of the pituitary while rats that had taken cocaine showed a decreased concentration of beta E-IR in the septum. Rats that had self-administrated heroin or cocaine and were decapitated 18 h after the last session, showed an increased concentration of beta E-IR in plasma and decreased concentrations in the AL of the pituitary and in specific areas of the brain limbic system, i.e. nucleus accumbens, septum, hippocampus and rostral striatum. The finding that self-administration of both the opiate heroin, inducing psychic and physical dependence, and the non-opiate cocaine, inducing psychic but not physical dependence, is accompanied by similar changes in beta E-IR concentrations particularly in limbic brain structures, and that these effects are present 18 h but not immediately after the last session, suggests that beta E and related peptides in limbic brain regions may represent a neurochemical correlate for psychic dependence on drugs.
