Experiments on 73 rats with electrochemotrodes implanted into the dorsal portion of the left hippocamp showed that allopurinol (A) injected intraperitoneally in a dose of 25 and 50 mg/kg decreased the activity of the penicillin-induced epileptogenic foci in the hippocamp and significantly increased the content of serotonin (S) in their area at the 40th minute of the epileptogenesis. Thus, all this provided evidence in favour of a shift in tryptophan metabolism toward an elevated S production that inhibited the development of the epileptic process. A is suggested for clinical use in treating patients with epilepsy, especially in those cases that are resistant to common therapy.
