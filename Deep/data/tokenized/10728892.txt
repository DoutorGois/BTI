We have demonstrated previously that stimulation of hippocampal corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors enhances, whereas stimulation of CRF receptors in the lateral intermediate septum impairs learning, as indicated by fear conditioning. Here, we report that the action of CRF within the hippocampus and lateral septum require muscarinic and D2 receptors, respectively.
