11 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-HSD) catalyses the reversible metabolism of corticosterone to inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone. At least two isoforms exist. 11 beta-HSD-1, the first to be characterised and the only isoform for which a cDNA has been isolated, is highly expressed in liver, kidney and hippocampus. The activity of 11 beta-HSD in rat liver is higher in males, due to oestrogen repression of 11 beta-HSD-1 gene transcription in females. Sexual dimorphism in rodent liver proteins is frequently mediated indirectly via sex-specific patterns of GH release (continuous in females, pulsatile in males). We have now investigated whether this applies to 11 beta-HSD, using dwarf rats (congenitally deficient in GH) and hypophysectomised animals. 11 beta-HSD activity and 11 beta-HSD-1 mRNA expression in liver was significantly lower in control female than male rats (50% and 72% of male levels respectively). These sex differences in the liver were attenuated in dwarf rats, with both males and females showing similar levels of 11 beta-HSD activity to control males. Administration of continuous (female pattern) GH to dwarf male rats decreased hepatic 11 beta-HSD activity (30% fall) and mRNA expression (77% fall), whereas the same total daily dose of GH given in the male (pulsatile) pattern had no effect on hepatic 11 beta-HSD in female dwarf rats. Continuous GH also attenuated hepatic 11 beta-HSD activity (25% fall) and 11 beta-HSD-1 mRNA expression (82% fall) in hypophysectomised animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
