This study was undertaken to evaluate the adaptogenic-like activity of methyl jasmonate (MJ) in mice exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Male Swiss mice were treated with MJ (25-100mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before exposure to UCMS daily for 14 days prior to testing for memory and anxiety. Thereafter, the blood glucose and serum corticosterone levels were estimated using glucometer and ELISA. The brain concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) were estimated using spectrophotometer. Brain histology and the population of healthy neurons in the hippocampal regions were also assessed. MJ reversed anxiety and memory impairment produced by UCMS, which suggest adaptogenic-like property. The reduction in the weight of adrenal gland and liver in MJ-treated groups further indicates adaptogenic activity. It further decreases the blood glucose and serum corticosterone levels in UCMS-mice. Also, MJ decreases the concentrations of MDA and elevated the levels of GSH in the brain of mice exposed to UCMS. Brain histology revealed that MJ attenuated UCMS-induced degeneration and death of neuronal cells in the pyramidal layer of the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Moreover, MJ decreased the population of dead neuronal cells of the pyramidal layer of the CA3 and the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus of the UCMS-mice, which suggests neuroprotection. Taken together, these findings suggest that MJ demonstrated adaptogenic-like activity in mice; which might be related to modulation of serum corticosterone levels, inhibition of oxidative stress and neuroprotection.
