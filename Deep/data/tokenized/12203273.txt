The effect of oral administration of Ginkgo biloba extract at a dose of 90 mg/kg for 7 consecutive days on rat brain beta-adrenergic receptors in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus was studied. Ginkgo biloba treatment induced a significant decrease in the density (B(max)) of beta-adrenoreceptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. It has been suggested that modulation of the beta-adrenergic system is implicated in the favourable effects of Ginkgo biloba extracts on learning and memory.
