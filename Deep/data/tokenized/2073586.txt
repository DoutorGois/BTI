Single and repeated Pentylentetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions are associated with significant changes of A1 adenosine receptors (detected using the radioligand [3H]cyclohexyladenosine, [3H]CHA) in 4 different brain areas of the mouse, namely cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum. In hippocampus and cerebellum, a rapid increase in [3H]CHA binding, by 26% and 30% respectively, was observed 1 h after a single PTZ convulsion. In striatum, on the contrary, a significant decrease by 30% in [3H]CHA binding was seen, whereas in cortex no significant change could be detected. After daily repeated PTZ convulsions, a significant increase of A1 receptors by 26% appeared also in cortex, while the changes of A1 receptors observed in the other brain areas after a single PTZ convulsion were maintained in almost the same range. All the alterations observed were due to changes of the total number of A1 receptors (Bmax) without changes in receptor affinity (Kd). A significant increase in the latency of PTZ seizure (time between the PTZ-injection and the beginning of the seizure) was also observed after repeated PTZ-induced convulsions at the time when the changes in A1 adenosine receptors were noted. Considered together, these results provide further evidence for an A1 receptor-mediated modulation of seizure susceptibility and indicate that specific brain areas may play different roles in this modulation. The binding of [3H]CHA to membranes from different cortical and subcortical areas of the epileptic mutant mouse 'tottering' was not different from that in control animals.
