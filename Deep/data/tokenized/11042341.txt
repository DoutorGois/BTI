A number of studies have shown that mothering style in rodents can produce neuroendocrine, neurochemical and behavioural changes in the adult, although the basic mechanisms initiating this cascade of events still need to be investigated. Long term changes in neuronal function might be due to alterations in the expression of neurotrophins which have been shown to promote neuronal survival, differentiation and function during development, such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). NGF is essential for proper development of sympathetic and neural crest-derived sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system as well as of central cholinergic neurons. In previous studies, using a maternal separation paradigm, we have shown that NGF expression is increased in the dentate gyrus and the hilus of the hippocampus as a result of brief (45 min) maternal separations. In the present study neonatal rats were separated for longer periods of time (up to 3 h) and at different ages during development (9 and 16 days postnatally). Results indicate that the effects of maternal separation on NGF expression are stronger with longer separations and are not restricted to the hippocampal region but can be seen also in other brain areas. Overall these results indicate that external factors, such as the presence/absence of the mother, can modify neurotrophic factor's availability in the brain, thus indicating NGF as a potential player in environmentally-mediated brain plasticity during development.
