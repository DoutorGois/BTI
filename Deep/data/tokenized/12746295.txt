We have developed a model for prenatal hypoxia-ischemia in which muscimol, a selective gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor agonist, administered to newborn rats, induces hippocampal damage. In the neonatal rat brain, activation of GABA(A) receptors leads to membrane depolarization and neuronal excitation. Because of our previous detection of sex differences in this model and the considerable interest in the neuroprotective effects of estradiol in the adult brain, we now investigate the effect of pretreatment with high physiological levels of estradiol in our model of prenatal hypoxia-ischemia. We used unbiased stereology to assess neuron number in the hippocampal formation of control, muscimol-treated, and estradiol- plus muscimol-treated animals. Muscimol decreased neuron number in the hippocampus, with damage exacerbated by pretreatment with estradiol. A hippocampal culture paradigm was developed to mirror the in vivo investigation. We observed elevated cytotoxicity (using the lactate dehydrogenase assay) by 48 h after treatment with estradiol plus muscimol, but decreased cytotoxicity between 2 and 24 h after treatment. To determine whether the actions of estradiol on muscimol-induced damage were via the estrogen receptor, hippocampal cultures were pretreated with ICI 182,780, a selective estrogen receptor antagonist. Treatment with ICI 182,780 blocked the potentiating effect of estradiol on the late period of cytotoxicity, but had no effect on the protective actions of estradiol during the early period of cytotoxicity. There appears to be a biphasic action of estradiol in our model of neonatal brain injury that involves early nongenomic, nonreceptor-mediated protection, followed by late deleterious receptor-mediated effects.
