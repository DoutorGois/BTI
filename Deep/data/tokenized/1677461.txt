The distribution of dopamine D2 receptors in the hippocampal region of the rat, monkey and the postmortem human brain was studied with in vitro receptor autoradiography using the selective salicylamide ligand 125I-NCQ 298. Specific binding was defined in the presence of the D2-selective compound raclopride. In all 3 species, higher densities of specifically bound 125I-NCQ 298 was found in the retrohippocampal structures than in the hippocampus proper. In the rat, layers 1 and 3 of the entorhinal cortex and layer 2 of the presubiculum were found to be rich in specific binding sites. In the monkey, the highest densities were detected in the deep layers (4 through 6) of the entorhinal cortex (EC) and in layer 2 of the presubiculum. Relatively high density of binding was found in the granule cell layer of area dentata. In the human brain, less specific binding was seen as compared to the other two species; the highest densities occurred in the outer layers of the presubiculum and in the hilus of area dentata. These findings show that D2 receptors are present in the hippocampal region and that the retrohippocampal region, including the entorhinal cortex, is enriched in dopamine D2 receptors.
