Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) has been studied extensively. But it is only in recent times that interest in this molecule has shifted to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Schizophrenia, focusing on its role in neurodegeneration and abnormal neurodevelopment. NCAM is important in neurite outgrowth, long-term potentiation in the hippocampus and synaptic plasticity. Reduced as well as increased levels in NCAM have been linked to pathology in the brain suggesting that a shift in the equilibrium may be the key. Hence, increasing our understanding of the role of NCAM in health and disease should clear some of the ambiguity surrounding the molecule and even lead to newer potential therapeutic targets. This review consolidates our current understanding of NCAM, focusing on the consequences of dysregulation, its role in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, and the future of NCAM plus potential options for therapy.
