The neuroprotective effect of vinconate, a novel vinca alkaloid derivative, was examined in a rat model of forebrain ischemia induced by 4-vessel occlusion. Hippocampal cell loss was quantified histologically 3 days after 10 or 15 min of ischemia. Intraperitoneal application of vinconate (25 and 50 mg/kg) 10 min before and immediately after 10 min of ischemia significantly reduced the neuronal cell loss in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus. Protective effect of vinconate against 15 min of ischemia was reduced, but there was still significant protection at the higher dose. Autoradiography using 14C-vinconate showed that the drug easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and distributes in the hippocampus. The result suggests that vinconate prevents ischemic neuronal damage by direct action on the hippocampal CA1 neurons.
