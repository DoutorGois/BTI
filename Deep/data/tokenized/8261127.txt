The contribution of the mammillary region to learning and memory was investigated. It was demonstrated that lesions of this region impair performance on tasks that require memory for spatial information but that the deficit depends both on the amount of damage within the region and the difficulty of the task. A dissociation in the effect of such lesions on performance of comparable spatial and non-spatial memory tasks was shown. In contrast to the deficits observed on spatial memory tasks, the acquisition and retention of a complex non-spatial memory task was not impaired after extensive damage to the mammillary region. Such lesions also did not impair performance in a conditioned taste aversion task. These experiments suggest that the mammillary region may be selectively involved in spatial learning and memory.
