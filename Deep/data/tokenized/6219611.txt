The activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) was reduced in affected areas of brain from patients with Huntington disease (caudate, putamen) and Alzheimer disease (frontal cortex) where choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was low. PDHC was also deficient in an area (Huntington hippocampus) where CAT was not significantly reduced. The activity of fumarase, an inner mitochondrial marker, was normal in all areas examined. The activities of PDHC and CAT correlated well in caudate, putamen, and amygdala but not in hippocampus or frontal cortex. Both total activity and activation of PDHC were below normal in fibroblasts from 4 patients with C-21 trisomy Down syndrome, who are at very high risk to develop Alzheimer disease. However, no abnormality of PDHC was detected in Huntington or Alzheimer fibroblasts. Deficiency of PDHC may play a role in the pathophysiology of Huntington and Alzheimer diseases, although it does not appear to be a primary defect. Loss of tissue oxidative capacity may relate to the reduction in cerebral metabolic rate and blood flow which are characteristic of many dementing illnesses.
