We have previously shown using a water maze task that transient 2 vessel occlusion (T2VO) induced learning deficit in mice and that the deficit was prevented by pre-treatment of mice with chotosan, a Kampo prescription. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the preventive effect of chotosan on T2VO-induced learning deficit. Chotosan administration 1 h before T2VO operation prevented learning impairment. The extract of Uncaria, a major constituent of chotosan, also had a protective effect on learning impairment in T2VO mice, whereas Uncaria-free chotosan had no beneficial effect on maze performance of T2VO mice. The ameliorative effect of chotosan was blocked by pirenzepine, a muscarinic M1 antagonist, but not by mecamylamine, a nicotinic receptor antagonist. Acetylcholine (ACh) content in the hippocampus of T2VO mice was significantly lower than that in the hippocampus of sham-operated control mice. Chotosan and Uncaria administration attenuated T2VO-induced reduction of ACh levels in the brain. These results suggest that the preventive effect of chotosan on transient ischemia-induced learning impairment is mainly attributable to the effect of Uncaria and that the ameliorative effect is mediated by stimulation of muscarinic M1 receptor.
