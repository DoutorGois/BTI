Alzheimer disease (AD) affects mainly people over the age of 65 years, suffering from different clinical symptoms such as progressive decline in memory, thinking, language, and learning capacity. The toxic role of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) has now shifted from insoluble Abeta fibrils to smaller, soluble oligomeric Abeta aggregates. The urgent need for efficient new therapies is high; robust models dissecting the physiopathological aspects of the disease are needed. We present here a model allowing study of four cytopathic effects of Abeta oligomers (AbetaO): oxidative stress, loss of synapses, disorganization of the neurite network, and cellular death. By generating a solution of AbetaO and playing on the concentration of and time of exposure to AbetaO, we have shown that it was possible to reproduce early effects (oxidative stress) and the long-term development of structural alterations (death of neurons). We have shown that 1) all toxic events were linked to AbetaO according to a specific timing and pathway and 2) AbetaO were probably the key intermediates in AD pathogenesis. The present model, using Abeta peptide solution containing AbetaO, reproduced essential neuropathological features of AD; the effects involved were similar whatever the kind of neurons tested (cortical vs. hippocampal). By using a single system, it was possible to embrace all toxic mechanisms at defined times and concentrations, to study each involved pathway, and to study the effects of new molecules on the different neurotoxic pathways responsible for development of AD.
