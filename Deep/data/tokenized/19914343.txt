Identification of the compounds preventing the biochemical changes underlying the epileptogenesis process is of great importance. We have previously shown that myo-inositol (MI) administration reduces kainic acid (KA) induced seizure scores. MI treatment effects on biochemical changes triggered by KA induced status epilepticus (SE) were investigated in the present study. After SE one group of rats was treated with saline, whereas the second group with MI. Control groups received either saline or MI administration. Changes in the amounts of following proteins were studied in the hippocampus and neocortex of rats: GLUR1 subunit of glutamate receptors, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and heat shock protein 90. No changes were found 28-30h after experiments. However on 28th day of experiment the amounts of GLUR1 and CaMKII were strongly reduced in the hippocampus of KA treated animals but MI significantly halted this reduction. Obtained results indicate anti-epileptogenic features of MI on biochemical level.
