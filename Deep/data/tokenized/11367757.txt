In the present study, both cell-attached and inside-out patch-clamp techniques were used to detect the effects of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on 42 pS delayed rectifier potassium channels in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons of new-born SD rats. The results indicated that after application of 1.0 and 10.0 nmol/L E2, the open probabilities of K+ channels were decreased from (67.4 +/- 18.2)% to (41.2 +/- 12.5)% and from (56.3 +/- 15.8)% to (13.2 +/- 12.6)% respectively, the open frequencies were reduced from (43.40 +/- 6.7) Hz to (27.68 +/- 9.1) Hz and from (38.19 +/- 10.1) Hz to (15.79 +/- 3.5) Hz respectively. Meanwhile, there was a shortening of the mean open time and a lenghtening of the mean close time of the channels. The above results suggest that E2 has suppressive effects on the activities of the channels, which might be exerted through a direct action on the cellular membrane.
