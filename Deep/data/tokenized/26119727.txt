About 90% of patients with brain metastases have impaired neurocognitive function at diagnosis and up to two-thirds will show further declines within 2-6 months of whole brain radiotherapy. Distinguishing treatment effects from progressive disease can be challenging because the prognosis remains poor in many patients. Omitting whole brain radiotherapy after local therapy in good prognosis patients improves verbal memory at 4 months, but the effect of higher intracranial recurrence and salvage therapy rates on neurocognitive function beyond this time point is unknown. Hippocampal-sparing whole brain radiotherapy and postoperative stereotactic radiosurgery are investigational techniques intended to reduce toxicity. Here we describe the changes that can occur and review technological, pharmacological and practical approaches used to mitigate their effect in clinical practice.
