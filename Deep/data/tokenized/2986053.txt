Following high frequency discharges of CA3 neurons, a long-lasting potentiation (LLP) of the CA1 neuronal population spike results. Subsequent to a transient increase in the firing rate of CA3 neurons produced by the application of DL-homocysteate on the soma in the presence of normal medium but not in the presence of Ca2+ -free (Mn2+ -containing) medium, the threshold for antidromic activation in the CA1 area of the neuron was increased for a prolonged period of time. Since the induction of the presynaptic terminal excitability reduction as well as LLP of the CA1 population spike are Ca2+ -dependent, a cause-and-effect relationship may exist between these two processes.
