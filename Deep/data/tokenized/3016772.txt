The effects on Hole-Board behavior of histamine (HA) microinjected into different parts of the hippocampus and the effects of pyrilamine (PYR, an H1-histamine antagonist), ranitidine (RAN, an H2-histamine antagonist) or alpha-fluoromethyl-histidine (alpha-FMH, an irreversible inhibitor of the HA synthetizing enzyme) injected into the hippocampus on behavior were studied. Forty five nMol of HA were injected stereotaxically into the dorsal or ventral hippocampus. Five min later, Hole-board behavior was measured. It was observed that HA inhibited locomotion and rearing only in the rats injected into the ventral hippocampus. In other experiments, animals were microinjected into the ventral hippocampus with 135 nMol of PYR or RAN in 1 microliter of saline solution. Ten min later, they were microinjected with 45 nMol of HA. Hole-board exploratory activity was measured 5 min thereafter. Results showed that both PYR and RAN were effective in counteracting the inhibitory effect of HA on locomotor activity, but only RAN was able to block the inhibitory action of HA on rearing behavior. Head-dipping frequency was not affected by these treatments. In rats microinjected with 20 nMol of alpha-FMH, increased scores of locomotion were observed but the other behaviors (head-dipping frequency, grooming and rearing) were not affected. The present results support the hypothesis that HA in hippocampus may be exerting a regulatory role on behavior by interaction with H1 and H2 receptors.
