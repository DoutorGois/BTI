Cholinergic synapses can be identified in immunocytochemical preparations by the use of monoclonal antibodies and specific antisera to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine (ACh) and a specific marker for cholinergic neurons. Electron microscopic studies demonstrate that the fibers and varicosities observed in light microscopic preparations of many brain regions are small-diameter unmyelinated axons and vesicle-containing boutons. The labeled boutons generally contain clear vesicles and one or more mitochondrial profiles. Many of these boutons form synaptic contacts, and the synapses are frequently of the symmetric type, displaying thin postsynaptic densities and relatively short contact zones. However, ChAT-labeled synapses with asymmetric junctions are also observed, and their frequency varies among different brain regions. Unlabeled dendritic shafts are the most common postsynaptic elements in virtually all regions examined although other neuronal elements, including dendritic spines and neuronal somata, also receive some cholinergic innervation. ChAT-labeled boutons form synaptic contacts with several different types of unlabeled neurons within the same brain region. Such findings are consistent with a generally diffuse pattern of cholinergic innervation in many parts of the central nervous system. Despite many similarities in the characteristics of ChAT-labeled synapses, there appears to be some heterogeneity in the cholinergic innervation within as well as among brain regions. Differences are observed in the sizes of ChAT-immunoreactive boutons, the types of synaptic contacts, and the predominant postsynaptic elements. Thus, the cholinergic system presents interesting challenges for future studies of the morphological organization and related function of cholinergic synapses.
