Functional brain imaging in humans is beginning to reveal a network of brain regions that subserve topographical learning: the medial parietal lobe, the posterior cingulate gyrus, occipitotemporal areas, the parahippocampal gyrus and the right hippocampus. These findings illuminate the patient lesion literature where all of these brain regions have been implicated at one time or another in cases of topographical disorientation. Once topographical information is acquired, the neuroanatomy that supports its use from either episodic or semantic memory is similar to that activated during encoding. The specific contributions of extrahippocampal regions within the topographical memory system are being revealed, such as the role of the right parahippocampal gyrus in object-in-place encoding. The right hippocampus is clearly involved in processing spatial layouts over long as well as short time-courses, and participates in both the encoding and the retrieval of topographical memory. The ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex is recruited when information in the topographical memory system is not sufficient to produce direct navigation to a goal place.
