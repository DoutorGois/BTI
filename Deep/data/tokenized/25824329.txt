The novel effects of artoindonesianin O, a dietary phenolic compound from mulberry, were investigated on oligomer Abeta42-, NMDA- or okadaic-acid-induced neurotoxicity and the restorative effect on the oligomer Abeta42-induced synapses dysfunction using rat hippocampus neuron cells in vitro. The phenolic compound of AIO can exert neuroprotection by blocking oligomer Abeta42- or NMDA-induced neurotoxicity and okadaic-acid-induced tau protein hyperphosphorylation through inhibiting the expression of kinase p-ERK1/2. Meanwhile, it is also beneficial to synaptic plasticity. These interesting results strongly suggest that AIO, which is rich in abundant sources of mulberry and other fruits, is suitable and possible candidate for the development of general food type neuroprotection on AD by protecting against brain damage and memory impairment.
