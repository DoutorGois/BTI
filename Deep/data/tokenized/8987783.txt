The adenosine A3 receptor is expressed in brain, but the consequences of activation of this receptor on electrophysiological activity are unknown. We have characterized the actions of a selective adenosine A3 receptor agonist, 2-chloro-N6-(3-lodobenzyl)-adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (Cl-IB-MECA), and a selective A3 receptor antagonist, 3-ethyl-5-benzyl-2-methyl-4-phenylethynyl-6-phenyl-1, 4-(+/-)-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate (MRS 1191), in brain slices from rat hippocampus. In the CA1 region, activation of A3 receptors had no direct effects on synaptically evoked excitatory responses, long-term potentiation, or synaptic facilitation. However, activation of A3 receptors with Cl-IB-MECA antagonized the adenosine A1 receptor-mediated inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission. The effects of Cl-IB-MECA were blocked by pretreatment with MRS 1191, which by itself had no effect on A1 receptor-mediated responses. The presynaptic inhibitory effects of baclofen and carbachol, mediated via GABA(B) and muscarinic receptors, respectively, were unaffected by Cl-IB-MECA. The maximal response to adenosine was unchanged, suggesting that the primary effect of Cl-IB-MECA was to reduce the affinity of adenosine for the receptor rather than to uncouple it. Similar effects could be demonstrated after brief superfusion with high concentrations of adenosine itself. Under normal conditions, endogenous adenosine in brain is unlikely to affect the sensitivity of A1 receptors via this mechanism. However, when brain concentrations of adenosine are elevated (e.g., during hypoxia, ischemia, or seizures), activation of A3 receptors and subsequent heterologous desensitization of A1 receptors could occur, which might limit the cerebroprotective effects of adenosine under these conditions.
