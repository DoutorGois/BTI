The El (epileptic) mouse is a model of hereditary sensory precipitated temporal lobe epilepsy. We compared vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity (VIP-LI), somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SS-LI), and gamma-aminobutyric acid-like immunoreactivity (GABA-LI) in the mid-hippocampal region of El and C57BL/6 mice. Specific interneuron populations with VIP-LI and GABA-LI were elevated in the El mice, whereas SS-LI populations were unchanged. These neurochemical alterations may be contributing to the epileptic predisposition of El mice.
