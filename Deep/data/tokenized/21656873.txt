Putative control of encoding and retrieval processes have been linked to communication between the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the hippocampus. Moreover, correlations between the LPFC (e.g., MFG) and hippocampus have predicted individuals' ability to inhibit memory retrieval. Anatomically, differences in volume of the hippocampus have been related to changes in long-term episodic memories. Although the relationship between these ideas is clear, few studies have examined the association of how anatomy may affect the role of control over brain regions involved in distint memory processes. The current study sought to examine hippocampal volume and its relationship to LPFC control over the hippocampus. Using an automated cortical/subcortical segmentation technique (FIRST) on brain imaging gata from the Think/No-Think task, we show that hippocampal volume is associated to changes in both enhancement and inhibitory processes of memory retrival.
