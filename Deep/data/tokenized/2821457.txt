The effect of the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective agent (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) has been studied on synaptic events in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. MK-801 blocked selectively the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission, which can be recorded in response to single shock stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway in the absence of added Mg2+ to the perfusate. MK-801 also prevented the induction of long term potentiation, which is normally produced in this pathway by high frequency stimulation in the presence of Mg2+.
