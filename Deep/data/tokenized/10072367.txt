In many parts of the vertebrate central nervous system, inputs of distinct types confine their synapses to individual laminae. Such laminar specificity is a major determinant of synaptic specificity. Recent studies of several laminated structures have begun to identify some of the cells (such as guidepost neurons in hippocampus), molecules (such as N-cadherin in optic tectum, semaphorin/collapsin in spinal cord, and ephrins in cerebral cortex), and mechanisms (such as activity-dependent refinement in lateral geniculate) that combine to generate laminar specificity.
