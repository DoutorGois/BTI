The gene DISC1 (Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1) is a leading candidate gene for schizophrenia. In this issue, Duan et al. (2007) present evidence implicating DISC1 in the maturation and integration of newly generated neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus. Surprisingly, DISC1 appears to have opposite effects on neurogenesis during development and in adulthood.
