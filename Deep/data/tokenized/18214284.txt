The dynamics of dopamine and norepinephrine contents in the dorsal hippocampus of rats immunized with a dopamine-BSA conjugate was studied during immobilization stress by mean of the microdialysis technique. Immunization with dopamine conjugate was accompanied by intensive production of antibodies against dopamine in rat blood and a tendency toward an increase in dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus even in the basal state (before stress exposure). Under stress conditions, dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus of immunized rats significantly increased. In control rats, stress was accompanied by a significant increase in norepinephrine content in the dorsal hippocampus. The observed peculiarities in dopamine and norepinephrine contents in the dorsal hippocampus of rats immunized with a dopamine conjugate were typical of active animals more resistant to emotional stress.
