Rats submitted to one, two, or seven sessions of exploration to a new environment (habituation) or exposed to an inhibitory avoidance training showed different degrees of anxiety, evaluated by the elevated plus-maze test. Also, the brain regional levels of benzodiazepine (BDZ)-like molecules in rats submitted to one, two, or seven sessions of habituation were differentially decreased with respect to nontrained rats. The percentage of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze for each group correlates with the data of decrease in the BDZ-like immunoreactivity in amygdala (r = 0.77, p < 0.0005), hippocampus (r = 0.68, p < 0.0005), and septum (r = 0.57, p < 0.005). These results suggest that the limbic system responds to anxiogenic experiences by changing the BDZ-like molecule levels in relation to the degree of anxiety and/or stress that accompany these experiences.
