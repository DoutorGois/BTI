We compared the content of high molecular microtubule-associated protein-2 and its phosphorylation by cAMP- and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases in the brain of DBA/2J and C57Bl/6 inbred mice. The revealed differences in protein content and phosphorylation can be attributed to the mechanisms mediating audiogenic seizures in DBA/2J mice and to differential sensitivity of these inbred lines to seizure-inducing factors.
