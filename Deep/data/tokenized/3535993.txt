Ependymins are goldfish brain glycoproteins exhibiting a specifically enhanced rate of synthesis when the animals adopt a new pattern of swimming behavior. With specific antisera against ependymins it has become possible to look for ependymin-like immunoreactivity in other animal species, both qualitatively by immunofluorescence staining and quantitatively by radioimmunoassay. Ependymin-like immunoreactivity was detected not only in other fish but also in rat brain. In the rat radioimmunoassay measurements were highest for the hippocampal formation and for cultured neurons derived from the embryonic hippocampus. Immunofluorescence staining was performed on various cell culture systems derived from rat brain, in order to establish which cell type contains the antigen. Only neuronal cell populations reacted with the anti-ependymin antisera. Cells derived from embryonic rat brain hippocampus which resembled pyramidal neurons stained particularly bright for ependymin-like immunoreactivity. The antigenic material was distributed throughout the cytoplasm including the neuronal extensions. Various neuron-specific antisera have been used to counterstain the cells containing ependymin-like immunoreactivity.
