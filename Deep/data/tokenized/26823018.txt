Intracellular transport involves the regulation of microtubule motor interactions with cargo, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Septins are membrane- and microtubule-binding proteins that assemble into filamentous, scaffold-like structures. Septins are implicated in microtubule-dependent transport, but their roles are unknown. Here we describe a novel interaction between KIF17, a kinesin 2 family motor, and septin 9 (SEPT9). We show that SEPT9 associates directly with the C-terminal tail of KIF17 and interacts preferentially with the extended cargo-binding conformation of KIF17. In developing rat hippocampal neurons, SEPT9 partially colocalizes and comigrates with KIF17. We show that SEPT9 interacts with the KIF17 tail domain that associates with mLin-10/Mint1, a cargo adaptor/scaffold protein, which underlies the mechanism of KIF17 binding to the NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B). Significantly, SEPT9 interferes with binding of the PDZ1 domain of mLin-10/Mint1 to KIF17 and thereby down-regulates NR2B transport into the dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Measurements of KIF17 motility in live neurons show that SEPT9 does not affect the microtubule-dependent motility of KIF17. These results provide the first evidence of an interaction between septins and a nonmitotic kinesin and suggest that SEPT9 modulates the interactions of KIF17 with membrane cargo.
