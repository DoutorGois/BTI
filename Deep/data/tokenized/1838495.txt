Although clinical use of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists will involve prolonged drug administration, knowledge of the functional consequences of chronic NMDA receptor blockade is limited. Local cerebral glucose utilisation was measured in conscious rats in 74 discrete brain regions after chronic administration of (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801) (0.5 mg/kg i.p.). Chronic treatment with MK-801 caused small, significant changes in glucose use in 4 of the 74 brain areas; parietal cortex (-13%), frontal cortex (-10%), subthalamic nucleus (-14%) and nucleus accumbens (-17%). These focal alterations in glucose use were not associated with changes in ligand binding to various sites within the NMDA receptor complex (i.e. agonist recognition site, glycine site, ion channel site) which were assessed autoradiographically. The acute effects of MK-801 on glucose utilisation were significantly enhanced after chronic MK-801 in 7 brain regions (e.g. frontal and parietal cortices) and attenuated in 6 brain regions (e.g. nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex). Neither local enhancement nor attenuation of the acute response to MK-801 was due to alterations in ligand binding to sites within the NMDA receptor complex. The data clearly indicate that the functional consequences of NMDA blockade are altered after chronic MK-801 treatment in an anatomically organised, though complex manner. These adaptive functional changes after chronic MK-801 treatment cannot be attributed readily to alterations in the NMDA receptor complex in affected regions.
