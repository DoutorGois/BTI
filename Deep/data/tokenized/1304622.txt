Synaptosomal membrane fluidity, lipid peroxide (LPO) and cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were examined in various brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex) of amygdala-kindled rats. At 24 h after the last seizure, a significant increase of membrane fluidity was observed in all the regions examined, whereas the LPO level was significantly decreased in the four regions with enhanced activity of cytosolic SOD. At 7 days after the last seizure, membrane fluidity was decreased only in the hippocampus. At 6 weeks after the last seizure, there were no changes in membrane fluidity between control and kindled rats. These results suggest that membrane fluidity and lipid peroxidation are modulated transiently by a kindled seizure, but not at a steady state of kindling with enduring seizure susceptibility.
