The effect of intra-hippocampal (dentate gyrus) microinjections of the benzodiazepine, midazolam (10 micrograms per site, bilaterally), was examined in the Vogel conflict test in serotonin depleted rats (pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine). p-Chlorophenylalanine and midazolam, when given separately, significantly disinhibited rat conflict behavior. Midazolam retained its anticonflict potency in the p-chlorophenylalanine pretreated animals. These and other data indicate: (i) the specific involvement of limbic serotonin in emotional control, (ii) a dissociation of the effects of serotonin depletion and intra-hippocampal benzodiazepine on conflict behavior, and (iii) the important role of the hippocampus in processing emotional input.
