Focusing on the hippocampal CA1 region, effects of peripheral gonadal and adrenal steroids on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were immunohistochemically evaluated in male and female adult rat brains after adrenalectomy (ADX), gonadectomy (GDX), and administration of estradiol (E2) and/or corticosterone (CS). In ADXed male rats, the hippocampal nuclear GR decreased and turned back to the cytoplasm, whereas in females, nuclear localization persisted even after ADX. In GDX+ADXed female rats, the GR was dispersedly translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as well as in GDX+ADXed males. The dispersed cytoplasmic GR was again translocated into the nucleus by administration of CS. In addition, administration of a small dose of E2 for 4-13 days was found to sufficiently recover the nuclear location of GR in GDX+ADXed rat brains, whereas medium-to-large doses could not do this. Also, a longer administration more strongly enhances the nuclear GR location and expression. The present study provided strong immunohistochemical evidence that the sexually dimorphic effects of ADX on hippocampal GR are attributable to gonadal hormones, and that E2 is implicated in the effects in inversely-dose- and directly-duration-dependent manner. Taken together, intriguing gonadal and adrenal crosstalk is considered to play some important role in regulating hippocampal GR morphology and to have a possibly crucial influence on stress-related disorders such as depression.
