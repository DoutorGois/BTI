In this study, we investigated the effects of 2,2'-dithienyl diselenide (DTDS), an organoselenium compound, against seizures induced by kainic acid (KA) in rats. Rats were pretreated with DTDS (50 or 100 mg/kg) by oral route 1 h before KA injection (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). Our results showed that DTDS (100 mg/kg) was effective in increasing latency for the onset of the first clonic seizure episode induced by KA, as well as in decreasing the appearance of seizures and the Racine's score. DTDS also caused a decrease in the excitatory electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, resulting from KA exposure in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats. Besides, elevated reactive species (RS) and carbonyl protein levels and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity in hippocampus of rats treated with KA were ameliorated by DTDS (50 and 100 mg/kg). Lastly, as evidenced by Cresyl-Violet stain, DTDS (100 mg/kg) elicited a protective effect against KA-induced neurodegeneration in rat hippocampus 7 days after KA injection. In conclusion, the present study showed that DTDS attenuated KA-induced status epilepticus in rats and the subsequent hippocampal damage.
