1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-5-aminoacridine (THA; tacrine) reportedly improves cognitive deficits in certain individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The present study describes increased glucose oxidation and acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis by mouse brain slices after THA treatment. THA increased [U-14C]glucose decarboxylation and ACh formation in a concentration-dependent manner in hippocampal slices (50 nM less than 50 microM less than microM). In striatal and cortical slices, 50 microM THA effectively elevated the oxidation of glucose and its incorporation into ACh. Thus the efficacy of THA treatment on Alzheimer patients may be partially related to increased ACh synthesis and oxidative metabolism.
