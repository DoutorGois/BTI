INTRODUCTION: Exposure to low doses of O3 leads to a state of oxidative stress. Some studies show that oxidative stress can modulate both the CNS and systemic inflammation, which are important factors in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate changes in the frequency of Th17-like cells (CD3(+)CD4(+)IL-17A(+)), the concentration of IL-17A in peripheral blood, and hippocampal immunoreactivity to IL-17A in rats exposed to low doses of O3. METHODS: One hundred eight male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 6 groups (n=18) receiving the following treatments: control (O3 free) or O3 exposure (0.25ppm, 4hours daily) over 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days. Twelve animals from each group were decapitated and a peripheral blood sample was taken to isolate plasma and mononuclear cells. Plasma IL-17A was quantified using LUMINEX, while Th17-like cells were counted using flow cytometry. The remaining 6 rats were deeply anaesthetised and underwent transcardial perfusion for immunohistological study of the hippocampus. RESULTS: Results show that exposure to O3 over 7 days resulted in a significant increase in the frequency of Th17-like cells and levels of IL-17A in peripheral blood. However, levels of Th17/IL-17A in peripheral blood were lower at day 15 of exposure. We also observed increased IL-17A in the hippocampus beginning at 30 days of exposure. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that O3 induces a short-term, systemic Th17-like/IL-17A effect and an increase of IL-17A in the hippocampal tissue during the chronic neurodegenerative process.
