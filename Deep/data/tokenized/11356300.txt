Using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures we have investigated the actions of Interleukin-1 (IL-1) in a number of injury paradigms. Low concentrations of IL-1 potentiated hypoxia-induced neurodegeneration whilst high concentrations had no effect. In contrast, higher concentrations of IL-1 were strongly neuroprotective in models of combined oxygen/glucose deprivation and N-methyl-D-aspartate toxicity, but no potentiation was observed at low IL-1 concentrations. Both protective and toxic effects of IL-1 were fully antagonized by IL-1 receptor antagonist. These data demonstrate that the effects of IL-1 on neuronal injury are complex, and may be directly related to the injury paradigm studied.
