The distribution patterns of cystatin C and apolipoprotein E (apo E) were studied immunocytochemically in the gerbil hippocampus before and after 5 min ischemia. In the controls, cystatin C was distributed mainly in astrocytes. In addition, a large number of dots positive for cystatin C were observed around the outlines of neuronal perikarya in the CA1 subfields. One day after ischemia, cystatin C-positive stainings outlining neuronal cell bodies disappeared. On the fourth day, intense stainings for cystatin C appeared in atrophied pyramidal neurons and these stainings in neurons disappeared by the 14th day. A remarkable increase in the number of cystatin C-positive astrocytes occurred on the fourth day and thereafter these spread over the whole of the CA1 subfield. Apo E was also distributed in astrocytes in the control specimens. From the fourth day, extra- and/or intracellular distribution of apo E-immunoreactivities was noted in the stratum pyramidale. Apo E-positive astrocytes disappeared transiently on the fourth day and then reappeared and increased remarkably by the 14th day. These findings indicate that cystatin C and apo E are involved in the degeneration process of brain neuronal cells.
