Using radioligand binding assay, the effects of (-), (+) clausenamide on N-methyl-D-asparate(NMDA) receptor were studied in synaptic membrane, hippocampus and cerebral cortex in rats. The Bmax and KD values of NMDA receptor in mouse brain were measured with Scatchard plot method. Results showed that there was no specific binding of (-), (+) clausenamide to NMDA-receptor. However, higher Bmax values were observed in (-) clausenamide-treated rats than the control group, but no effect on KD value. (+) Clausenamide treatment showed no effect on Bmax and KD values. The findings suggest that the pharmacologic actions of clausenamide depends on its chirality. Up regulation of NMDA-receptor induced by (-) clausenamide is helpful to elucidate its nootropic mechanism.
