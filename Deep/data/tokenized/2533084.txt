Cholinergic slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (slow EPSPs) can be elicited by presynaptic tetanic stimulation in brain slices obtained from rat neostriatum or guinea pig hippocampus. Slow EPSPs are generated by a reduction of a K-leak-conductance. In hippocampal neurons slow EPSPs are amplified by the reduction of an outward current termed IAHP through the activation of a second muscarinic receptor subtype. While hippocampal slow EPSPs might be involved in information processing across hippocampal pathways, muscarinic modulation in the neostriatum consists of a presynaptic tuning of nicotinic fast synaptic transmission.
