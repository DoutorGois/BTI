The relative amounts of arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) govern the different functions of the brain. Their brain levels depend on structures considered, on fatty acid dietary supply and the age of animals. To have a better overview of the different models available in the literature we here compared the brain fatty acid composition in various mice models (C57BL/6J, CD1, Fat-1, SAMP8 mice) fed with different n-3 PUFA diets (deficient, balanced, enriched) in adults and aged animals. Our results demonstrated that brain AA and DHA content is 1) structure-dependent; 2) strain-specific; 3) differently affected by dietary approaches when compared to genetic model of PUFA modulation; 4) different in n-3 PUFA deficient aged C57BL6/J when compared to SAMP8 mouse model of aging. From these experiments, we highlight the difficulty to compare results obtained in different mouse models, different strains, different brain regions and different ages.
