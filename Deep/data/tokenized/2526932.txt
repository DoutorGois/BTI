Conditions were chosen for optimal demonstration of ATPases in brain slices by a modified method of Wachstein and Meisel, and the reaction was shown to obey the Bouguer-Beer laws, confirming that ATPase activity can be determined quantitatively in single cells by cytophotometry. In rats in a state of relative physiological rest specific activity of both Na+, K+-ATPase and Mg++-ATPase in gliocytes of the hippocampus and dorsal raphe was found to be considerably higher than in neurons. Deprivation of the paradoxical phase of sleep of the rats for 24 h led to a significant increase in Na+, K+-ATPase activity in hippocampal neurons and to a decrease in its activity in gliocytes of the hippocampus and dorsal nucleus raphe. It is suggested that these changes in Na+, K+-ATPase activity may be due to some extent to a change in excitability of neurons and depolarization of the glia when sleep is disturbed.
