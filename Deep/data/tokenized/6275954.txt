The properties of the synchronously activated radiatum fiber-CA1 synaptic population were examined with the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. Periodic fluctuations in synaptic transmission and in the enhancement of synaptic transmission were observed with periods ranging from 8 to 20 s. Such periodic fluctuations did not arise from fluctuations in afferent radiatum fiber activity. The period and amplitude of the cyclic variations in the enhancement of synaptic transmission were found to be altered with repeated electrical stimulation of the radiatum fibers. These results reflect cooperative synaptic actions which must be taken into consideration in the delineation of the mechanisms of potentiation.
