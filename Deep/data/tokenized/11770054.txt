The hippocampus is generally thought to play a modulating role in the timing of conditioned responses in classical trace conditioning. One hypothesis is that the hippocampus stores a memory trace of the conditioned stimulus (CS) during the stimulus-free period. Cellular recordings, however, do not show any obvious CS storage. This article examines this issue by using a biologically plausible model of the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Simulations of the model reproduce both behavioral and physiological experimental data. On the basis of neural codes that develop in the model, the authors hypothesize that the hippocampus functions as a time-indexed encoding device for the CS and not as a CS storage buffer. Specifically, the CS initiates a sequence of neural activity during the trace interval that only indirectly represents the CS. The model yields 2 predictions: Some cells will increase in activity only during the trace interval, and some unconditioned stimulus (US)-coding cells will shift in time and fire before US onset.
