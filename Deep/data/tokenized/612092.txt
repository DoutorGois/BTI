Activity of 65 hippocampal single units was recorded during an instrumental feeding behaviour in three rabbits. Different neurons fire or change their spontaneous activity in one or more behavioural acts, which constitute the consecutive behaviour. In one or the other behavioural act single unit discharges occur both after and before some intermediate results. Participation of hippocampus in organization of the consecutive behaviour is discussed.
