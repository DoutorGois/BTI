The mRNAs encoding the flip and flop isoforms of the glutamate receptor subunits GluR1 and 2 were detected and quantified by in situ hybridization in the hippocampal formation of rats following acute (6h) or chronic (6h daily for 21 days) restraint stress. The GluR1 flip mRNA was slightly reduced in CA1 after chronic stress and the GluR2 flip mRNA was increased in the dentate gyrus (DG), CA4, and CA3 after acute stress. There were no changes in the mRNA encoding the flop isoforms of either GluR1 or 2 in the hippocampus. In entorhinal cortex, the GluR1 flip mRNA was significantly increased after both acute and chronic stress, while the flop isoform increased only after chronic stress. The GluR2 flip mRNA was slightly increased after acute and chronic stress. However, no changes were found for the flop isoform of GluR2. These results suggest that different assembly of AMPA receptors subunits and isoforms may underlie, in a different way, the neuronal plastic changes induced by specific type and intensity of stressful stimuli.
