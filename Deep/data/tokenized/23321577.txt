The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the tactile/handling stimulation (H) and environmental enrichment (EE) in well-nourished (C - 16% of protein) and malnourished (M - 6% of protein) rats tested in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) at 36 and 37 days of age. The results showed higher exploration of the open arms in the EPM in M as compared with C animals, as well as lower index of risk assessment behaviors, and EE, but not H, reversed the alterations produced by malnutrition in the EPM. Biochemical analysis showed higher levels of corticosterone in M when compared with C rats. The non-stimulated animals presented higher levels of polyamines in the hippocampus when compared with the stimulated ones in both diet conditions. It is suggested that both the lower anxiety levels and the lower risk-assessment behaviors in the EPM, as well as the higher levels of corticosterone, can be due to alterations in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as the result of early protein malnutrition.
