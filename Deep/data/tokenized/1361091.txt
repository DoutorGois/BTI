We examined changes in the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive fibers following 5 min of cerebral ischemia in gerbils using an immunohistochemical method 1, 3 and 30 days after ischemia. Almost all CA-1 pyramidal neurons were lost 3 days after ischemia, whereas noradrenergic fibers were maintained 30 days after ischemia. The present study demonstrated that TH-immunoreactive fibers and cells were resistant to transient ischemia, and that there was no sprouting or hyperactivity in noradrenergic systems after ischemia.
