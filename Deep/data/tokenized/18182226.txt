Kinins may play a relevant role in epilepsy. In the present study, we evaluated the hippocampal expression of the remaining kinin receptor in B1 (B1KO) and B2 (B2KO) knockout mice strains during the development of pilocarpine epilepsy model. After pilocarpine injection, animals had their behavior parameters monitored to determine different phases of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) progression. Hippocampal mRNA expression was evaluated using specific primers for kinin receptors by Real Time-PCR. B1KO hippocampus from acute, silent and chronic phases showed no differences in B2 receptor mRNA expression when compared to control. An increased B1 receptor mRNA expression in treated B2KO hippocampus (0.97+/-0.12, acute; 0.86+/-0.09, silent; and 0.94+/-0.11, chronic phase; p<0,001) when compared to control (0.12+/-0.03) was observed. Behavioral and neurochemistry parameters suggest that kinin B1 receptor is fundamental to development of epilepsy on pilocarpine-induced model.
