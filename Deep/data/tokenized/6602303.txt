Acute electrophysiological experiments on lizards Ophisaurus apodus show that stimulation of both thalamic n. dorsolateralis anterior and medial forebrain bundle elicited short latency responses in the hippocampal cortex resembling in topic and patterns responses evoked by sensory stimuli in the same structure. Ample lesion of n. dorsolateralis anterior and of medial forebrain bundle suppressed up to a complete block conduction of sensory (visual, somatic, audiovibratory) and tectal impulses to the hippocampal cortex. A conclusion is made that n. dorsolateralis anterior and medial forebrain bundle are the main, if not the only route for conducting these sensory impulses to the hippocampal cortex in lizards.
