The aims of the study were to investigate whether the level of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) (1-40) was increased in brain of diabetic rats and whether the increase was associated with dysfunction of P-glycoprotein at the blood-brain barrier. A diabetes-like condition was induced by single administration of 65 mg/kg streptozotocin via i.p. injection. Abeta (1-40) levels in brain of the diabetic rats were measured using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The in vivo brain-to-blood efflux and blood-to-brain influx transport of [(125)I]-labeled human amyloid-beta-peptide (hAbeta) (1-40) were measured using the brain efflux index and brain permeability coefficient-surface area product, respectively. [(14)C]inulin served as a reference compound. The results showed that Abeta (1-40) levels significantly increased in temporal cortex and hippocampus of the diabetic rats. The brain remaining percentage of [(125)I]hAbeta (1-40) in diabetic rats significantly increased at 30 min after intracerebral microinjection, accompanied by decrease of the brain efflux index. Pretreatment of P-glycoprotein inhibitors verapamil or cyclosporin A significantly increased the brain remaining percentage of [(125)I]hAbeta (1-40). The brain permeability coefficient-surface area product of [(125)I]hAbeta (1-40) was increased in diabetic rats, accompanied by increased Abeta (1-40) levels in plasma. The present study demonstrated that a diabetic state could increase Abeta (1-40) levels in brain, which might be explained, at least in part, by the decline in brain-to-blood efflux of Abeta (1-40) due to deficient cerebral P-glycoprotein function in diabetic rats.
