To elucidate the effects of aging accompanied with hypertension on brain nucleic acid, we measured both the DNA and RNA contents of six specific brain regions in adult (5-6 months old) and aged (18-22 months old) female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Although no statistical difference was observed in the RNA content, the DNA content did tend to increase in the hippocampal CA1 of aged SHR (4.24 +/- 0.55 ng/microgram protein, mean +/- SD, n = 6) in comparison to that of adult SHR (3.21 +/- 0.71 ng/microgram protein, n = 4). Hence, aged SHRs showed a significant decrease in the RNA to DNA ratio in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus (3.79 +/- 0.61) compared to adult SHR (5.27 +/- 0.81). On the other hand, no other regions, except for the dorsolateral region of the striatum, showed any difference in the RNA/DNA ratio between aged and adult SHR. We therefore conclude that subtle changes in the nucleic acid occur in vulnerable regions of the brain in aged SHRs.
