We showed that differences in learning capacity between DBA and C57Bl/6 mice correlates with differences in slow afterhyperpolarization amplitude in hippocampal CA1 pyramid neurons. In DBA mice learning capacity is lower, but the amplitude of slow afterhyperpolarizations higher than in C57Bl/6 mice.
