The incorporation of [14C]valine into acid-insoluble brain material from rats living in enriched and restricted environment, respectively, was studied. Quantitative estimations showed higher incorporation into brain protein of frontal, entorhinal, cerebellar and visual cortex and the hippocampus in enriched environment animals compared to restricted environment animals. This finding was confirmed by autoradiography.
