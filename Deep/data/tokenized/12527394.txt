The expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on the surface of cells is intimately linked to in vivo graft survival. It has been previously shown that the conditionally immortalized temperature-sensitive Maudsley hippocampal clone 36 (MHP36) neural stem cells show good long-term graft survival and do not elicit an acute immunological response following transplantation. Here we report that MHP36 cells express both MHC class I and class II antigens when grown in culture under proliferative conditions (33 degrees C), whereas cells with a differentiated morphology in the non-proliferative (37-39 degrees C) condition express low to undetectable levels of either MHC molecules. However, morphologically undifferentiated cells persisting under non-proliferating conditions continued to express both MHC antigens. The downregulation of MHC antigens upon differentiation following cell transplantation could therefore contribute to the graft survival of MHP36 cells.
