Microinjection of ibotenic acid into medial septum of rats decreased choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) activities in hippocampus and retarded the learning of a spatial memory task in the radial-arm maze. Administration of MK-771, a stable TRH analog, to such animals restored HACU activity in hippocampus to normal levels. Daily treatment of rats with MK-771 prior to maze running also restored the animals' learning ability. MK-771 did not enhance hippocampal HACU activity or maze performance in sham-lesioned rats. These results suggest that MK-771 reversed the ibotenic acid-induced memory deficit by restoring septohippocampal cholinergic function. MK-771 and other TRH analogs may represent novel agents for improving memory deficits produced by cholinergic insufficiency in Alzheimer's disease.
