The present study examined the effects of krill-derived phosphatidylserine (Krill-PS) on the learning and memory function and the neural activity in rats with trimethyltin (TMT)-induced memory deficits. The rats were administered vehicle (medium-chain triglyceride: MCT) or Krill-PS (50, 100 mg/kg, p.o.) daily for 21 days. The cognitive improving efficacy of Krill-PS in TMT-induced amnesic rats was investigated by assessing the Morris water maze test and by performing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) immunohistochemistry. The rats with TMT injection showed impaired learning and memory of the tasks and treatment with Krill-PS produced a significant improvement of the escape latency to find the platform in the Morris water maze at the 2(nd) and 4(th) day compared to that of the MCT group (p<0.05). In the retention test, the Krill-PS+MCT groups showed increased time spent around the platform compared to that of the MCT group. Consistent with the behavioral data, Krill-PS 50+MCT group significantly alleviated the loss of acetylcholinergic neurons in the hippocampus and medial septum compared to that of the MCT group. Treatment with Krill-PS significantly increased the CREB positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 area as compared to that of the MCT group. These results suggest that Krill-PS may be useful for improving the cognitive function via regulation of cholinergic marker enzyme activity and neural activity.
