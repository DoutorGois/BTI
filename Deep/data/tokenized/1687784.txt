Repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS) treatment (once per day for 7 days) produced a significant increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity, GTP-cyclohydrolase activity and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels in the locus ceruleus and hippocampus from 1 to 4 days after the last treatment. These changes may be responsible for, or contribute to, the antidepressant effect of ECS treatment.
