Hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) is a potent inhibitor of the high-affinity choline uptake system (HACU). Here we report on the biochemical characterization and autoradiographic distribution of [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding sites in rat brain, confirming and expanding results from previous studies. The binding of [3H]HC-3 to striatal membranes was specific, to a single site, sodium-dependent, saturable, and of high-affinity, Kd values being about 3 nM for striatum, 5 nM for the hippocampus and 12 nM for neocortex. [3H]HC-3 specific binding exhibited a pharmacological profile suggestive of physiologically relevant interactions and fully comparable to that reported for HACU. The uneven distribution of [3H]HC-3 binding sites exhibited a high degree of correspondence with the reported distribution of HACU and other enzymatic presynpatic cholinergic markers. The punctual differences between our study and previous works on [3H]HC-3 binding are analysed. We conclude that [3H]HC-3 labelling may be used as a selective and quantifiable marker of the cholinergic presynaptic terminals in close relationship with HACU.
