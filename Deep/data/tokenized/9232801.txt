In mammals, the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) family of enzymes is assembled from the products of four regulatory and two catalytic subunit genes, all of which are expressed in neurons. Specific isoforms of PKA display differences in biochemical properties and subcellular localization, but it has been difficult to ascribe specific physiological functions to any given isoform. The recent development of gene knockout and transgenic mouse models has allowed for a more integrated examination of the in vivo roles of specific PKA isoforms in gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and behaviour.
