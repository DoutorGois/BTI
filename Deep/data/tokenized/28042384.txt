Glutamate- (Glu-) induced excitotoxicity plays a critical role in stroke. This study aimed to investigate the effects of APN on Glu-induced injury in HT22 neurons. HT22 neurons were treated with Glu in the absence or the presence of an APN peptide. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay, while cell apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL staining. Levels of LDH, MDA, SOD, and GSH-Px were detected using the respective kits, and ROS levels were detected using dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Western blot was used to detect the expression levels of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2. In addition to the western blot, immunofluorescence was used to investigate the expression levels of SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha. Our results suggest that APN peptide increased cell viability, SOD, and GSH-Px levels and decreased LDH release, ROS and MDA levels, and cell apoptosis. APN peptide upregulated the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1alpha, and Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax. Furthermore, the protective effects of the APN peptide were abolished by SIRT1 siRNA. Our findings suggest that APN peptide protects HT22 neurons against Glu-induced injury by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and activating SIRT1-dependent PGC-1alpha signaling.
