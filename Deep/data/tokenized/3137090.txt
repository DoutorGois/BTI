The antiepileptic activity of GABA-mimetics (phenibut, sodium valproate and aminooxyacetic acid/AOAA/) was studied in experiments on the model of hippocampal penicillin-induced epilepsy in rats. The effects of the drugs were studied in experiments with a mirror epileptogenic focus which forms in the hippocampus contralateral to the penicillin-damaged hippocampus. All the drugs suppressed the activity of the epileptogenic focus after injections in the focus region. At systemic administration of the drugs the antiepileptic activity was found only with sodium valproate and AOAA. Phenibut enhanced the antiepileptic effect of sodium valproate and the toxic effects of AOAA at parenteral administration.
