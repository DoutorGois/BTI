Trans-ACPD, a cyclic analogue of glutamate, has been studied for its influence on field potentials and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the CA1 layer. Being applied in concentration 50 microM and above, trans-ACPD completely and reversibly inhibited excitatory postsynaptic field potentials but has no effect on EPSCs. Trans-ACPD in the same concentration reversibly reduced the amplitude of antidromic population spike in the CA1 layer, but has an insignificant effect on antidromic population spike in the CA3 layer.
