Antibodies against brain proteins were identified in the plasma of cancer patients and are defined to cause paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. The profiles of brain-directed antibodies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are largely unknown. Here, for the first time, we compared autoantibodies against brain proteins in NSCLC (n = 18) against those present in age-matched non-cancer control subjects (n = 18) with a similar life-style, habit, and medical history. Self-recognizing immunoglobulin (IgG) are primarily directed against cells in the cortex (P = 0.008), hippocampus (P = 0.003-0.05), and cerebellum (P = 0.02). More specifically, IgG targets were prominent in the pyramidal, Purkinje, and granule cell layers. Furthermore, autoimmune IgG signals were localized to neurons (81%), astrocytes (48%), and endothelial (29%) cells. While cancer sera yielded overall higher intensity signals, autoantigens of 100, 65, 45, 37, and 30 kDa molecular weights were the most represented. Additionally, a group of 100 kDa proteins seem more prevalent in female adenocarcinoma patients (4/5, 80%). In conclusion, our results revealed autoantigen specificity in NSCLC, which implicitly depends on patient's demographics and disease history. Patients at risk for lung cancer but with no active disease revealed that the immune profile in NSCLC is disease-dependent.
