In this study, we used GM2/GD2 synthase knockout (GM2/GD2-/-) mice to examine the influence of deficiency in ganglioside "a-pathway" and "b-pathway" on cognitive performances and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Eight-week-old GM2/GD2-/- male mice showed a longer escape-latency in Morris water maze test and a shorter latency in step-down inhibitory avoidance task than wild-type (WT) mice. Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampal slices from GM2/GD2-/- mice showed an increase in the slope of EPSPs with reduced paired-pulse facilitation, indicating an enhancement of their presynaptic glutamate release. In GM2/GD2-/- mice, NMDA receptor (NMDAr)-dependent LTP could not be induced by high-frequency (100-200 Hz) tetanus or theta-burst conditioning stimulation (CS), whereas NMDAr-independent LTP was induced by medium-frequency CS (20-50 Hz). The application of mono-sialoganglioside GM1 in the slice from GM2/GD2-/- mice, to specifically recover the a-pathway, prevented the increased presynaptic glutamate release and 20 Hz-LTP induction, whereas it could not rescue the impaired NMDAr-dependent LTP. These findings suggest that b-pathway deficiency impairs cognitive function probably through suppression of NMDAr-dependent LTP, while a-pathway deficiency may facilitate NMDAr-independent LTP through enhancing presynaptic glutamate release. As both of the NMDAr-independent LTP and increased presynaptic glutamate release were sensitive to the blockade of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (L-VGCC), a-pathway deficiency may affect presynaptic L-VGCC.
