The role of gap junction coupling in generation of carbachol-induced theta-like activity (TLA) in hippocampal formation (HPC) slices was investigated in this study. Two gap junction (GJ) blockers, carbenoxolone (100 microM) and quinine (100 microM), were tested. Both GJ blockers abolished cholinergically induced theta-like activity and related cell discharges. Abolishing effects were observed after 40-45 min of drug perfusion. These effects were found to be slowly and partially reversible. Our results provide evidence for the contribution of gap junction communication in mechanisms of neural synchrony, underlying the production of theta oscillations in limbic cortex maintained in vitro.
