Degeneration of the central white matter is described in old dogs. The presence of ubiquitin-immunoreactive free granules and intracytoplasmic globules in glial cells and macrophages, together with galacerebroside-immunoreactive precipitates and lipofusion storage, point to the likelihood of a primary myelin degeneration with deposits of non-degraded ubiquitin-protein conjugates and complex galactolipids.
