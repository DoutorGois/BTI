The different actions exerted by pallidum and caudate nucleus on electrically induced epileptic activity of hippocampus were analyzed. Caudate appeared to inhibit hippocampal after discharges duration (HAD) while the globus pallidus exerted a facilitatory effect on HAD duration. Both effects were maximal when conditioning stimulation immediately preceded hippocampal test stimulation. The results are discussed considering reciprocal functional connections of the two striatal structures.
