In vitro superfusion of rat hippocampal slices with isatin changed the population spikes. Isatin perfusion produced two clear effects. 50 microM isatin it increased the amplitude of the population spike in the CA1 evoked by stimulation of stratum radiatum. This effect was readily reversible. 100 microM isatin decreased the population spike amplitude with minimal effect on its latency. High initial response were more suppressed. This effect on the population spike amplitude was not eliminated even after 1 h of washing with saline. The data obtained suggest that isatin-induced electrophysiological changes are involved into the anticonvulsant effect of isatin.
