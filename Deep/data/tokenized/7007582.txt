A new method of measuring catecholamine (CA) sulfate permitted us to detect its presence in rat brain for the first time. The procedure consisted of separating the CA sulfate from the free CA by alumina adsorption followed by passage through Dowex, and measuring the CA sulfate by a radioenzymatic assay in the presence of a sulfatase. This method permitted demonstration of the presence of dopamine sulfate, and occasionally, of norepinephrine and epinephrine sulfate in the hypothalamus, striatum, and hippocampus of rat brain.
