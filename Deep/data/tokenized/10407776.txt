In organotypic corticostriatal and hippocampal slice cultures from rat brain, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid but not glutaric and glutaconic acids induced neurodegeneration by activation of NMDA receptors. Electrophysiological investigations (Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing glutamate receptors; rat mixed cortex culture) revealed no direct interaction of 3-hydroxyglutaric acid with glutamate receptors. We speculate that 3-hydroxyglutaric acid induces a mild energy deprivation that interferes with the voltage-dependent Mg(2+)-block of NMDA receptors.
