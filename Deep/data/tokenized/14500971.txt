Neuroscientists have long sought to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of the memories needed to learn, for example, a motor task. In his Perspective, Linden discusses new work (Koekkoek et al.) suggesting that long-term depression in Purkinje cells mediated by protein kinase C signaling is responsible for motor memory in a task called associative eyelid conditioning.
