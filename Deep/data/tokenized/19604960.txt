The latency, duration of feeding and number of feeding periods recorded from rats after noradrenaline injection to the hippocampus show little change after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injections to the substantia nigra. It is suggested that 6-hydroxydopamine-induced weight losses result from non-specific effects of injection because increased durations for grooming, decreased latencies for resting and short periods of feeding follow injection.
