Calbindin modulates intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics and synaptic plasticity. Reduction of hippocampal calbindin levels has been implicated in early-life stress-related cognitive disorders, but it remains unclear how calbindin in distinct populations of hippocampal neurons contributes to stress-induced memory loss. Here we report that early-life stress suppressed calbindin levels in CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons, and calbindin knockdown in adult CA1 or DG excitatory neurons mimicked early-life stress-induced memory loss. In contrast, calbindin knockdown in CA1 interneurons preserved long-term memory even after an acute stress challenge. These results indicate that the dysregulation of calbindin in hippocampal excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons conveys susceptibility to stress-induced memory deficits. Moreover, calbindin levels were downregulated by early-life stress through the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1-nectin3 pathway, which in turn reduced inositol monophosphatase levels. Our findings highlight calbindin as a molecular target of early-life stress and an essential substrate for memory.
