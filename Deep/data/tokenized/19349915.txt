Nogo-66, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, possess axon growth-inhibiting properties by binding with the Nogo-66 receptor. Recent studies have shown that Nogo-66 inhibits neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and the neurite outgrowth of the neurons differentiated from NPCs. However, the effects of MAG on the differentiation and proliferation of NPCs are unclear. We found that NPCs derived from the hippocampus of embryonic rats expressed Nogo-66 receptor and MAG-Fc, which mimics the function of MAG, inhibited the differentiation of NPCs into neurons but promoted differentiation of NPCs into astrocytes. Furthermore, MAG-Fc inhibited the neurite outgrowth of the neurons differentiated from NPCs. Our results suggest that MAG can inhibit the neuronal differentiation of NPCs.
