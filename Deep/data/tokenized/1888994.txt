Earlier research has established that repeated amphetamine administration can interact synergistically with the processes responsible for the genesis of kindled seizures after intermittent electrical stimulation of the amygdala. In this study, the effects of amphetamine preexposure on primary hippocampal kindling, secondary kindling of the contralateral amygdala, and rekindling of the original hippocampal focus were evaluated. It was shown that amphetamine treatment did not modify kindling rates when electrodes were situated in the dorsal hippocampus. However, transfer kindling of the contralateral amygdala evolved after fewer afterdischarges, and rekindling of the dorsal hippocampus progressed significantly faster in amphetamine-pretreated animals. The effects of amphetamine on ventral hippocampal kindling were also determined, and it was found that although epileptogenesis developed more rapidly relative to the dorsal region of this structure, kindling rates were not affected by amphetamine preexposure. These results were related to the possibility that the amygdala might have a unique function in the relationship between kindling- and stimulant-induced sensitization effects.
