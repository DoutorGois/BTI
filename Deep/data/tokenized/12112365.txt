A low concentration (10 nM) of adenosine potentiated hippocampal neuronal activity via A(2a) adenosine receptors without affecting presynaptic glutamate release or postsynaptic glutamatergic conductance. Adenosine inhibited glutamate uptake through the glial glutamate transporter, GLT-1, via A(2a) adenosine receptors. In addition, adenosine stimulated GLT-1-independent glutamate release from astrocytes, possibly in response to a rise in intracellular Ca(2+), via A(2a) adenosine receptors involving PKA activation. Those adenosine actions could lead to an increase in synaptic glutamate concentrations responsible for the potentiation of hippocampal neuronal activity. The results of the present study thus represent a novel neuromodulatory pathway with a glial contribution, bearing both inhibition of GLT-1 function and stimulation of glial glutamate release, as mediated via A(2a) adenosine receptors.
