Pentylenetetrazole kindling (but not a single pentylenetetrazole injection) induced caspase-3 activation in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of rats as well as neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. The number of neurons in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus decreased significantly, whereas no apoptotic nuclei could be detected. The results support a possible non-apoptotic involvement of caspase-3 in brain plasticity.
