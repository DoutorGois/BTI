Activity of choline acetylase (ChAT) was measured in basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei and in projection sites of these cells in the hippocampus and cortex of young rats and of aged rats who showed impaired performance on the radial arm maze. Decreased ChAT activity was found in the vertical diagonal band nucleus, the dentate gyrus and striatum of aged rats.
