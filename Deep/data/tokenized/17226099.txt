The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a single intrastriatal injection of hypoxanthine, a metabolite accumulated in Lesch Nyhan disease and possibly involved in its neuropathology, on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, as well as on some parameters of oxidative stress, namely chemiluminescence (an index of lipid peroxidation), total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter--TRAP (an index of total antioxidant capacity of the tissue) and total thiol protein membrane content, in striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats. Results show that hypoxanthine significantly decreased Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity and TRAP while increased chemiluminescence in all ipsislateral structures tested. However, no effect on total thiol protein membrane content was detected. We suggest that hypoxanthine induces oxidative stress in all cerebral structures studied (striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex) and that the reduction of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity was probably mediated by reactive oxygen species.
