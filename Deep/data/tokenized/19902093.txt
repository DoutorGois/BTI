In vitro radioligand assay revealed interaction of afobazole with sigma(1)-receptors (Ki=5.9x10(-6) M). Translocation of sigma(1)-receptors from the endoplasmic reticulum to the outer membrane was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Experiments were performed on the model of HT-22 immortalized hippocampal cells after incubation with afobazole in a concentration of 10(-8) M.
