This study reports the expression of the ubiquitous 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase gene (PFKFB3) (PFK-2/FBPase-2) in different stages of rat brain development. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that ubiquitous PFK-2/FBPase-2 is expressed in rat brain from embryonic to adult life and shows a transient increase 1 day before birth, coincident with the maximum concentration of Fru-2,6-P(2) and PFK-2 activity. The levels of brain PFK-2/FBPase-2 gene expression as well as the enzymatic activity and the concentration of Fru-2,6-P(2) appear to be remarkably constant during adult life, without significant differences in the brain hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum or striatum areas.
