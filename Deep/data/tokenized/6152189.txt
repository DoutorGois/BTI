The present study measures the content of dynorphin B in the rat hippocampus, and localizes the dynorphins within the intrinsic hippocampal neuronal circuitry. The level of dynorphin B, which is representative of the prodynorphin-derived peptides, was markedly depleted by intrahippocampal injection of colchicine, which destroyed the great majority of the hippocampal granule cells and the associated mossy fiber pathway. The hippocampus contralateral to the injection demonstrated a slight, non-significant rise in dynorphin B levels after colchicine. Entorhinal cortical lesions ablating the perforant pathway input to the hippocampus did not significantly alter dynorphin B levels in the hippocampus. Unilateral fimbrial transection caused a small but significant increase in dynorphin B on the side of the lesion relative to the unlesioned side, but neither side was significantly different from control.
