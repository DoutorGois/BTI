The objective of the study was to evaluate the caffeic acid (CA) effects against the oxidative stress (OS) observed during seizures. Wistar rats were intraperitoneally treated with either 0.9% saline (control), CA (4 mg/kg), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, pilocarpine group), or the association of CA (4 mg/kg) plus pilocarpine (400 mg/kg). The thiobarbituric-acid-reacting substances and the hippocampal nitrite content were significantly increased (89 and 94%, respectively) in pilocarpine group when compared with control. There were marked decreases in lipid peroxidation level (43%) and nitrite content (45%) in CA group when compared with pilocarpine group. There were no marked alterations in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in pilocarpine group; however, the SOD and CAT activities were significantly increased (35 and 51%, respectively) after CA pretreatment. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that OS was indeed generated in hippocampus. CA pretreatment can reduces the OS produced by seizures.
