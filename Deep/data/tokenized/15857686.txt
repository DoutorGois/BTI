Ca(2+)-dependent mechanisms are important in regulating synaptic transmission. The results herein indicate that whole-cell perfusion of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) agonists greatly enhanced excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes in postsynaptic hippocampal CA1 neurons. IP(3)R agonist-mediated increases in synaptic transmission changed during development and paralleled age-dependent increases in hippocampal type-1 IP(3)Rs. IP(3)R agonist-mediated increases in EPSC amplitudes were inhibited by postsynaptic perfusion of inhibitors of Ca(2+)/calmodulin, PKC and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Postsynaptic perfusion of inhibitors of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) Ca(2+)-ATPases, which deplete intracellular Ca(2+) stores, also enhanced EPSC amplitudes. Postsynaptic perfusion of the IP(3)R agonist adenophostin (AdA) during subthreshold stimulation appeared to convert silent to active synapses; synaptic transmission at these active synapses was completely blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). Postsynaptic IP(3)R-mediated Ca(2+) release also produced a significant increase in spontaneous EPSC frequency. These results indicate that Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores play a key role in regulating the function of postsynaptic AMPARs.
