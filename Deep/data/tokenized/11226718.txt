The effects of hippocampal treatment with a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) antisense to the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor gamma2 subunit on neuropeptide Y (NPY) were studied. Adult male Wistar rats were treated with unilateral intrahippocampal infusion of gamma2 subunit antisense ODN for 5 days. Rats infused with mismatch ODN and naive rats served as controls. Brain sections were analysed for levels of NPY mRNA by in situ hybridisation, NPY-immunoreactivity (NPY-ir) by means of immunocytochemistry, and specific NPY binding sites by in vitro receptor autoradiography. Following infusion of antisense ODN, a marked increase in cytoplasmic NPY-ir was observed in hilar neurones of the fascia dentata. Further, intense NPY-ir was visualised in the mossy fibres and in cell bodies of the entorhinal cortex and throughout the neocortex. High levels of NPY mRNA were detected in the same cortical areas of antisense treated rats. A very large increase was observed in the piriform and parietal areas. NPY gene expression also occurred in the granular cell layer, in which no NPY mRNA could be detected in normal animals. The level and distribution of cells displaying high levels of NPY mRNA differed among animals, perhaps as a result of the distinct anatomical location of ODN infusion. Finally, hippocampal levels of NPY specific binding increased, suggesting that NPY neurotransmission is markedly increased. These findings are reminiscent of reported changes in the expression of NPY mRNA and immunoreactivity in conditions of increased neuronal excitation and support the usefulness of the present animal model for the study of epileptic phenomena.
