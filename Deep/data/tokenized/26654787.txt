In a longitudinal mouse study we evaluated whether diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can monitor microstructural changes after administration of the neuromodulating drug EPO and whether erythropoietin (EPO) has an effect on cognitive performance. Twelve mice (2 groups with 6 mice each) were scanned in a 7T Bruker Biospin animal scanner with a highly resolved DTI sequence before and 16 days after intraperitoneal injections of EPO or saline. All mice underwent behavioral testing (Morris water maze) and histologic evaluation of hippocampal and corpus callosum cell proliferation and oligodendrogenesis. Whole brain DTI analysis showed significant Trace, RD and AD decrease within the dentate gyrus, subiculum, primary motor, somatosensory, and supplementary somatosensory areas and FA increase in the hippocampus, corpus callosum, and fimbria fornix in EPO treated mice only. ROI-based DTI analysis showed significant Trace and RD decrease and FA increase only in the corpus callosum of EPO treated mice, whereas in the dentate gyrus significant Trace, RD, and AD decrease occurred in both, EPO- and control-group. Behavioral tests showed that EPO treated mice performed better and learned faster than controls. Histologically, the number of BrdU-positive nuclei and optical density of DCX-labeled juvenile neurons significantly increased within the dentate gyrus, corpus callosum and fimbria fornix and the number of NG2-positive oligodendrocyte progenitors in corpus callosum and fimbria fornix, respectively. In conclusion we were able to monitor microstructural changes with DTI and showed EPO treatment-related alterations correlating with enhanced dentate gyrus and corpus callosum cell proliferation and better learning capabilities.
