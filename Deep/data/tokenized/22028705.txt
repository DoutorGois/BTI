Decrease of GABAergic transmission has been proposed to improve memory functions. Indeed, inverse agonists selective for alpha5 GABA-A-benzodiazepine receptors (alpha5IA) have promnesiant activity. Interestingly, we have recently shown that alpha5IA can rescue cognitive deficits in Ts65Dn mice, a Down syndrome mouse model with altered GABAergic transmission. Here, we studied the impact of chronic treatment with alpha5IA on gene expression in the hippocampus of Ts65Dn and control euploid mice after being trained in the Morris water maze task. In euploid mice, chronic treatment with alpha5IA increased IEGs expression, particularly of c-Fos and Arc genes. In Ts65Dn mice, deficits of IEGs activation were completely rescued after treatment with alpha5IA. In addition, normalization of Sod1 overexpression in Ts65Dn mice after alpha5IA treatment was observed. IEG expression regulation after alpha5IA treatment following behavioral stimulation could be a contributing factor for both the general promnesiant activity of alpha5IA and its rescuing effect in Ts65Dn mice alongside signaling cascades that are critical for memory consolidation and cognition.
