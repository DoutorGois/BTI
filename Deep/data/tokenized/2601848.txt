The uptake and retention of radioactivity was measured in discrete areas of rat brain at different times after i.v. injection of [14C]2-deoxyglucose or [6(-14)C]glucose, in unrestrained rats. In most brain regions, the accumulation of radioactivity from the two compounds was similar when a 30-min survival period for [6(-14)C]glucose was compared to a 45-min survival period for [14C]2-deoxyglucose. However, at those times, autoradiographic images of the hippocampus and piriform cortex appeared distinctly different for [14C]2-deoxyglucose and [6(-14)C]glucose. Relatively more radioactivity accumulated from [14C]2-deoxyglucose, compared to [14C]glucose, in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus and in layer 4 of the isocortex. In contrast, relatively more radioactivity accumulated from [6(-14)C]glucose, compared to [14C]2-deoxyglucose, in the molecular and granule cell layers of the dentate gyrus, the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus, and in layer 2 of the piriform cortex. When rats were killed 5 min after injection of [6(-14)C]glucose, the relative neuroanatomical distribution of radioactivity was similar to the 30-min survival period, except in layer 4 of the isocortex, where relatively more radioactivity was present at the early time. When rats were killed 5 min after injection of [14C]2-deoxyglucose, in 20 of 24 brain regions examined, the absolute and relative amounts of accumulated radioactivity were similar when compared to that of the 45-min survival period. In contrast, the absolute and relative amounts of radioactivity were significantly greater for the 5-min compared to the 45-min survival period, in the CA1 pyramidal cell field, dentate gyrus, and layer 2 of the piriform cortex. For those regions, the appearance of autoradiograms prepared from rats killed 5 min after administration of [14C]2-deoxyglucose is remarkably similar to the appearance of autoradiograms prepared from rats killed 5 or 30 min after injection of [6(-14)C]glucose. Possible mechanisms are discussed to explain the observed differences in the accumulation of radioactivity in discrete brain regions after injection of [6(-14)C]glucose and [14C]2-deoxyglucose at the different survival times examined.
