The authors report the results of memory and learning ability investigations in a patient treated with hippocampotomy (uncotomy) for severe epileptic seizures. In the seeg investigations the changes were most pronounced in the hippocampus. In psychological investigations before the operation deep disturbances of verbal memory with unchanged (normal) level of mental efficiency were found. After stereotaxic treatment epileptic seizures disappeared completely, the patient completed a vocational school and started working. Follow up examinations during 6 years after the operation failed to demonstrate any decrease in mental efficiency. The impairment of verbal memory and learning ability was decreased significantly.
