'Population' afferent spike and 'population' EPSP were recorded with extracellular microelectrodes in slices of hippocampal tissue maintained in vitro. Calcium concentration was changed in the bathing solution, and calcium activity ([Ca2+]0) was measured in interstitial fluid of the slice with ion-selective microelectrodes. Synaptic transfer was a non-linear continuous function of [Ca2+]0. Deviation of [Ca2+]0 by 0.1 mM from the 1.2 mM control level caused a change of approximately 15% in the slope of the input-output function.
