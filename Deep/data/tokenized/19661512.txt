A Gram-positive-staining, motile, rod-shaped, endospore-forming bacterium (BFLP-1( T)) was isolated from faeces of wild long-snouted seahorses ( Hippocampus guttulatus) captured in north-west Spain (Toralla, Galicia). Strain BFLP-1(T) grew at 10-30 degrees C and pH 5.5-9 (optimally at 20 degrees C and pH 7.2) and with 0-7 % (w/v) NaCl (optimally with 2 % NaCl). The G+C content of the DNA was 48.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain BFLP-1(T) was a member of the genus Bacillus and was most closely related to Bacillus herbersteinensis D-1,5a(T) (96.6 %), B. shackletonii LMG 18435(T) (96.0 %) and B. isabeliae CVS-8(T) (95.9 %). Chemotaxonomic data (peptidoglycan type, meso-diaminopimelic acid; major menaquinone, MK-7; predominant fatty acids, anteiso-C(15 : 0 ), anteiso-C(17 : 0) and C(16 : 1 )omega11c; major polar lipids, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unknown aminoglycophospholipid) supported the affiliation of strain BFLP-1(T) to the genus Bacillus . Comparative analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and chemotaxonomic and phenotypic features indicated that strain BFLP-1(T) represents a novel species within the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus galliciensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is BFLP-1( T) (=DSM 21539(T) =LMG 24668(T)).
