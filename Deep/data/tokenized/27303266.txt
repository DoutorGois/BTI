Sleep deprivation (SD) affects spatial memory and proliferation in the dentate gyrus. It is unknown whether these deleterious effects persist in the long run. The aim of this study was to evaluate the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of neural progenitors as well as spatial memory 21 days after suffering SD. Sixty-day old male Balb/C mice were exposed to 72-h REM-SD. Spatial memory, cell fate, apoptosis and expression levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) were evaluated in the hippocampus at 0, 14, and 21 days after SD or control conditions. After 21-days recovery period, memory performance was assessed with the Barnes maze, we found a significant memory impairment in SD mice vs. control (94.0 +/- 10.2 s vs. 25.2 +/- 4.5 s; p < 0.001). The number of BrdU+ cells was significantly decreased in the SD groups at day 14 (controls = 1.6 +/- 0.1 vs. SD mice = 1.2 +/- 0.1 cells/field; p = 0.001) and at day 21 (controls = 0.2 +/- 0.03 vs. SD mice = 0.1 +/- 0.02 cells/field; p < 0.001). A statistically significant decrease was observed in neuronal differentiation (1.4 +/- 0.1 cells/field vs. 0.9 +/- 0.1 cells/field, p = 0.003). Apoptosis was significantly increased at day 14 after SD (0.53 +/- 0.06 TUNEL+ cells/field) compared to controls (0.19 +/- 0.03 TUNEL+ cells/field p < 0.001) and at 21-days after SD (SD mice 0.53 +/- 0.15 TUNEL+ cells/field; p = 0.035). At day 0, IGF-1R expression showed a statistically significant reduction in SD animals (64.6 +/- 12.2 units) when compared to the control group (102.0 +/- 9.8 units; p = 0.043). However, no statistically significant differences were found at days 14 and 21 after SD. In conclusion, a single exposition to SD for 72-h can induce deleterious effects that persist for at least 3 weeks. These changes are characterized by spatial memory impairment, reduction in the number of hippocampal BrdU+ cells and persistent apoptosis rate. In contrast, changes IGF-1R expression appears to be a transient event. Highlight Sleep deprivation affects spatial memory and proliferation in the dentate gyrus. To date it is unknown whether these deleterious effects are persistent over a long period of time. We analyzed the effects of sleep deprivation in the hippocampus after 21 days of recovery sleep. Our findings indicate that after sleep recovery, the detrimental effects of SD can be observed for at least 2 weeks, as shown by a reduction in memory performance, changes in the hippocampal cellular composition and higher apoptotic rate over a long period of time.
