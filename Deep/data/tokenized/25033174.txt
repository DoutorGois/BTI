ATP-gated P2X receptors are widely expressed in the nervous system, but their physiological roles are not fully understood. New insights from Pougnet et al. (2014) in this issue of Neuron show that postsynaptic P2X receptors may be activated by ATP released from astrocytes and function to downregulate synaptic AMPA receptors in hippocampal neurons.
