The purpose of our project was to analyse membrane-bound proteins in Haloperidol-treated rats with clear Parkinson type motor inhibitions. Membrane-bound protein was chosen because the main sites of functional changes in the Parkinson syndrome may be the plasma membrane and postsynaptic membranes of nerve cells. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Haloperidol for 67 days. The areas analyzed were the hippocampus and the caudate nucleus. The electrophoretic analyses were done by the method of Ballou (1974) as further elaborated by Booth (1977). Double-labeling analysis of 7 protein fractions after gel electrophoresis showed the presence of a 50 000-dalton protein in fraction 3 of the caudate nucleus (see block diagrams) in the haloperidol-treated animals but not in the hippocampus material.
