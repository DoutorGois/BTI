In prion diseases, the normal prion protein (PrP(c)) undergoes a conformational change that results in the abnormal form, named scrapie prion protein (PrP(sc)). The visual system of rodents provides a relatively simple neuronal model in which the cell bodies of neurons are confined to the retina and the axons constitute the optic nerve. We investigated by Western blot the profile of PrP(c) in the optic nerve and retina of normal hamsters and mice. We found that in the optic nerve the amount of PrP(c) is significantly higher than in the retina. A less abundant non-glycosylated band was observed in retinas compared with the optic nerve and brain. Similar results were found in the gray and white matter from normal mice and hamsters. After stereotaxic injection of ME7 or 139A in the superior colliculus, a visual target area, the proportion and glycopattern of PrP changed in the retina and optic nerve throughout the course of the disease. Similar results were found in the gray and white matter at terminal stage of scrapie after injection of ME7 and 139A in the dorsal hippocampus. This is the first time that changes in the distribution and glycopattern of PrP have been described in an in vivo model of prion diseases.
