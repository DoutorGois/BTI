Calcium was localized ultrastructurally with the use of the modified oxalate-pyroantimonate reaction in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. Ten-minute ischemia (incubation with anoxic and glucose-free medium) followed by 30 min reoxygenation resulted in mitochondrial calcium sequestration and ultrastructural damage. The addition of the adenosine receptor antagonist, theophylline, worsened the ischemia-induced morphological changes and particularly exaggerated the Ca2+ loading in the postsynaptic dendrites. In contrast, adenosine protected against ischemia-induced changes. The results suggest that adenosine exerts its neuroprotective action largely by maintaining intracellular calcium-homeostasis.
