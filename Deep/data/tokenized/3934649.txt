The effect of TRH on 5-HT1 receptors in the rat brain was investigated. A crude membrane preparation was incubated at 37 degrees C for 15 min with or without TRH prior to [3H]5-HT binding assay. TRH at 100 nM increased the number of 5-HT1 receptors significantly (approximately 20%) in the limbic forebrain and the hippocampus without altering their affinity. As this concentration of TRH is close to its dissociation constant (2 nM and 51 nM in the limbic forebrain, 11 nM in the hippocampus), this effect is probably of physiological relevance. This finding seems to support a pharmacological finding of others that the anti-convulsion effect of TRH may be related to increased serotonergic transmission.
