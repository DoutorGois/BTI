Hypothalamic and hippocampal lipid composition in sudden death from coronary heart disease is studied. Thin-layer chromatography was the main method of biochemical analysis. Disorders in the lipid component of hippocampal cytostructures involved mainly the cholesterol fractions. Metabolic disorders in the hypothalamus involved the phospholipid metabolism. The above-mentioned biochemical changes were paralleled by ultrastructural abnormalities. Analysis of the data demonstrates a probable metabolic basis of a central mechanism of sudden cardiac death.
