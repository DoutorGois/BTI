Systemic (ip) injection of dizocilpine maleate (DM, 0.1 and 0.5 mg.kg-1) increased the levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid but did not bring about any noticeable change in the dopamine (DA) level in the striatum and limbic area. DM also increased the levels of norepinephrine in the limbic area and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the hippocampus. Amphetamine increased DA level and reduced DOPAC level in the striatum and limbic area. The behavioral manifestations revealed that DM predominantly evoked circling behavior and ataxia. The results indicate that the mechanism of the behavioral effect of DM may be different from that of amphetamine.
