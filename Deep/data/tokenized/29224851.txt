Allergic asthma during early life period has been reported to be associated with neurochemical and behavioral disorders, including anxiety and depression. We aimed to determine the effects of exercise on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors as well as lung and hippocampus oxidative stress in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized juvenile rats. Animals were divided into 4 groups including control (non-exercised and non-sensitized), Exe (exercise and non-sensitized); OVA (non-exercised and OVA-sensitized); and OVA+Exe (exercised and OVA-sensitized). The rats were subjected to chronic OVA sensitization followed by 4 weeks of treadmill exercise training. Compared to the control group, the OVA group had an increase in anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, lung inflammation, and oxidative stress index in the lung and hippocampus. Compared to the OVA group, the OVA+Exe group had a decline in anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, lung inflammation, and oxidative stress index in the lung and hippocampus. No significant difference in terms of the above-mentioned parameters, were found between the control group and the Exe group. Exercise decreased depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in OVA-sensitized juvenile rats; this effect might have been mainly mediated by improvement in antioxidant system.
