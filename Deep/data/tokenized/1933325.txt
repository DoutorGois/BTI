The heterosynaptic effects induced by a brief afferent tetanization in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were investigated in the guinea pig hippocampal slice preparation using extracellular recording technique. At a brief interval (5 ms) between a single stimulation of the test afferents and the tetanus evoked in the conditioning afferents, a long-lasting (greater than 1 h) potentiation of the test field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) initial slope and amplitude was observed. This potentiation was occluded by prior homosynaptic tetanization of the test afferents, suggesting that it represents long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, in the dentate gyrus, a single activation of a single test EPSP suffices to induce LTP when coinciding in time with a brief tetanus to other afferents. When not temporally paired with the test stimulation, i.e. at longer test-conditioning intervals (greater than 50 ms), the conditioning tetanus also elicited a long-lasting potentiation of the test field EPSP. This potentiation was, however, seen as a prolongation of the rising phase with no change in the field EPSP initial slope, and may represent a potentiation distinct from LTP.
