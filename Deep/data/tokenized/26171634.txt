Biological activities of soybean saponins are dependent on their metabolism by gut microbiota, which generate absorbable bioactive metabolites. Therefore, to enhance the pharmacological effect of soybean, we fermented defatted soybean powder (SP) with Lactobacillus pentosus var. plantarum C29 and measured its protective effect against scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mice using the passive avoidance, Y-maze and Morris water maze tasks. Fermentation increased soyasapogenol B, genistein and daidzein content of soybean and enhanced the protective effect of soybean against scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Additionally, compared with the exthanol extract of soybean, fermented SP (FSP) increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampi of scopolamine-treated mice. Furthermore, FSP inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in vitro and ex vivo. These findings suggest that C29 fermentation might increase the ameliorating effect of soybean against memory impairments by inhibiting AChE activity and increasing BDNF expression.
