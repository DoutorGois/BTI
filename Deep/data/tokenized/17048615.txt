OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effects of Denghuang injection on cerebral infarction in animal. METHOD: The study evaluated the protective effects of Denghuang injection on cerebral infarction through 3 experiments: 1. ligating the arteria cerebri media of dog; 2. blocking the internal carotid artery of rat; 3. ligating the common carotiol artery of gerbil. RESULT: The results showed Denghuang injection could reduce the cerebral infarction area after the dog's arteria cerebri media was ligated, and also could restrain the AKP&CK increase. The injection could reduce the cerebral infarction area of rat after the internal carotid artery was bloked by thrombus, and the mark of behavior and nerve symptom was better than that in the control group. Denghuang injection could obviously reduce the water content in pallium of gerbil after the common carotiol artery was ligated, and also could increase the amount of living pyramidal neuron in hippocampus, and reduce the MDA&LDH increase in pallium slurry. CONCLUSION: Denghuang injection can obviously protect animal on cerebral infarction.
