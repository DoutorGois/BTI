Riparin III (Rip III) is an alcamide isolated from Aniba riparia that has presented effects of antidepressant and anxiolytic activities in acute stress behavioral models. The trial's goal was to investigate the activity of Rip III in mice exposed to corticosterone-induced chronic depression model. Swiss female mice, 22-25 g, were distributed in following experimental groups: control group (vehicle1: saline containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide and 0.1% Tween-80, SC+ vehicle 2: distilled water emulsified with 2% Tween-80, PO); stressed group (corticosterone, 20 mg/kg, SC, + vehicle 2, orally); Rip III group (50 mg/kg, orally); and fluvoxamine (Flu) group (50 mg/kg, orally). The mice were exposed to the behavioral tests, and posteriorly, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels were assessed in hippocampal samples. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by one-way anova, followed by Newman-Keuls test. Both administrations of Rip III and Flu significantly reduced the immobility time in tail suspension and forced swimming tests after 21 days without affecting locomotor function. There was also an increase in BDNF protein levels in the mice hippocampus. These findings further support the hypothesis that Rip III could be a new pharmacological target for the treatment of mood disorders.
