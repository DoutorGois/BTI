There are few efficacious interventions to combat morphine dependence. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) are emerging as important modulators of neuronal function. They have been shown to be involved in cellular protective mechanisms against a variety of toxic stressors. This study was designed to investigate the effects of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a pharmacological inducer of Trx-1 and Hsp70, on morphine-induced hyperlocomotion, rewarding effect, and withdrawal syndrome. Trx-1 and Hsp70 expression was increased in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, and nucleus accumbens of mice after GGA treatment. GGA administration reduced morphine-induced motor activity and inhibited conditioned place preference. GGA markedly attenuated the morphine-naloxone-induced withdrawal signs, including jumping, rearing, and forepaw tremor. Furthermore, the activation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein and the expression of DeltaFosB and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 were decreased in the nucleus accumbens by GGA treatment after morphine withdrawal. In the nucleus accumbens, GGA enhanced morphine-induced expression of Trx-1 and Hsp70 after morphine withdrawal. These results suggest that strengthening the expression of Trx-1 and Hsp70 in the brain by using noncytotoxic pharmacological inducers may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for morphine dependence. GGA could be a safe and novel therapeutic agent for morphine dependence.
