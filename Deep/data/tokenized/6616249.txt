In Golgi and electron microscopic studies, dentate granule cell axon initial segments were revealed to be fasciculated in the granule cell layer and to receive many synapses. Combined Golgi-EM studies indicated that the presynaptic elements of these synapses might be beaded string-like axon collaterals of some type of basket cell.
