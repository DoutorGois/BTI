Three new mRNA responses were found in the hippocampus of the adult male rat after entorhinal cortex lesions (ECL) that induce synaptic reorganization. Hippocampus cDNA libraries were screened by a subtractive hybridization strategy designed to detect ECL-induced mRNAs. Partial sequencing showed clones with similarities to mouse vimentin, ferritin, and polypeptide 7B-2. A sequence similar to mouse SNAP-25 sequence was also detected. Using a mouse SNAP-25 probe, rat SNAP-25 mRNA increased in the hippocampus after ECL.
