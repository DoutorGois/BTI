Asymmetries in muscarinic receptor binding were investigated in the hippocampus of female rats by in vitro autoradiography. Coronal sections from 18 brains were incubated with the muscarinic receptor antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate, the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist [3H]pirenzepine, or the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist [3H]AF-DX 384. Binding of these radioligands was higher on the right than the left side of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus in almost every brain confirming hemispheric asymmetry at the neurochemical level. The ovarian hormone, estradiol, did not alter the asymmetry in muscarinic binding. Neurochemical asymmetries within hippocampal subfields may have implications for physiological and behavioral functions.
