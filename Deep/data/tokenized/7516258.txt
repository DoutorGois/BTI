The time course of c-fos protein expression after hypoxia was examined in rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex using an immunohistochemical method. The rats were exposed to in vivo hypoxia for 30 min in a chamber containing 5% O2 and 95% N2. Immediately after the treatment, c-fos protein-like immunoreactivity was observed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The change was transient, and the density of immunoreactive cells returned quickly to a control level 3 h after the exposure. However, the density of positive cells was again increased 1 day after hypoxia and reached the maximum 7 days after. In the cerebral cortex, on the other hand, no change was detected in the pattern of staining at any time, with an exception on 21 days after hypoxia. At this period, positively stained neurons were significantly increased in both density and intensity throughout the entire extent of the cerebral cortex including the cingulate gyrus. These results clearly indicate that hypoxia induces different patterns of c-fos protein expression among various regions of the brain. The biphasic pattern seen in the dentate gyrus as well as the delayed expression in the cerebral cortex may be related to delayed neuronal damages induced by hypoxia.
