The present study examined the distribution of the high molecular weight (HMW) tau protein isoform in the nervous system by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Some of the biochemical properties of this 110 kDa tau protein were explored, including its heat stability, phosphorylation and partitioning with cold/Ca2+ stable vs. soluble microtubules. Qualitative western blot analysis revealed that HMW tau is preferentially expressed in neurons with peripherally projecting axons. For example, this isotype was present in sciatic nerve, ventral and dorsal roots, trigeminal nerve, vagus nerve, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord, but was present in only trace amounts in CNS regions. Another tau isoform of slightly smaller size (90-100 kDa), termed mid-molecular weight (MMW) tau, was present in abundant quantity in optic nerve samples and detectable in several other CNS regions, including hippocampus and cerebellum. The 110 kDa HMW tau as well as MMW tau and the other tau isoforms were found to be heat stable proteins. The HMW and MMW tau isoforms preferentially partitioned with the cold and Ca+2 insoluble tubulin fraction, but the association of HMW tau with stable microtubules was very susceptible to proteolysis. Dephosphorylation of fresh tissue with alkaline phosphatase produced no apparent shift in the mobility of HMW tau on SDS-PAGE but did alter the mobility of other brain tau isoforms, including MMW tau. Immunocytochemical staining with tau-1 antibody in the DRG, which contains HMW tau but no other tau isotypes, showed localization to mainly small neurons and was not altered by dephosphorylation of the histological sections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
