In the hippocampal formation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, both focal and diffuse deposits of Abeta peptides appear in a subregion- and layer-specific manner. Recently, pyroglutamate (pGlu or pE)-modified Abeta peptides were identified as a highly pathogenic and seeding Abeta peptide species. Since the pE modification is catalyzed by glutaminyl cyclase (QC) this enzyme emerged as a novel pharmacological target for AD therapy. Here, we reveal the role of QC in the formation of different types of hippocampal pE-Abeta aggregates. First, we demonstrate that both, focal and diffuse pE-Abeta deposits are present in defined layers of the AD hippocampus. While the focal type of pE-Abeta aggregates was found to be associated with the somata of QC-expressing interneurons, the diffuse type was not. To address this discrepancy, the hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice was analysed. Similar to observations made in AD, focal (i.e. core-containing) pE-Abeta deposits originating from QC-positive neurons and diffuse pE-Abeta deposits not associated with QC were detected in Tg2576 mouse hippocampus. The hippocampal layers harbouring diffuse pE-Abeta deposits receive multiple afferents from QC-rich neuronal populations of the entorhinal cortex and locus coeruleus. This might point towards a mechanism in which pE-Abeta and/or QC are being released from projection neurons at hippocampal synapses. Indeed, there are a number of reports demonstrating the reduction of diffuse, but not of focal, Abeta deposits in hippocampus after deafferentation experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate in neurons by live cell imaging and by enzymatic activity assays that QC is secreted in a constitutive and regulated manner. Thus, it is concluded that hippocampal pE-Abeta plaques may develop through at least two different mechanisms: intracellularly at sites of somatic QC activity as well as extracellularly through seeding at terminal fields of QC expressing projection neurons.
