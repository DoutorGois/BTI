PURPOSE: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) is the most frequent pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. It has been associated with febrile seizures (FS) in childhood. Its aetiology remains unclear but genetic factors are involved. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the main lipoprotein secreted in brain. It has a critical immunomodulatory function, influences neurotransmission and it is involved in repairing damaged neurons. ApoE 4 is an isoform of ApoE with altered protein function, previously associated with refractoriness and early onset epilepsy. This study was undertaken to determine if ApoE isoforms are risk factors for MTLE-HS and influence clinical characteristics. METHODS: A group of 188 MTLE-HS patients (101 F, 87 M, mean age = 44.7 +/- 11.6 years, 100 with FS antecedents) was studied and compared with a group of 342 healthy individuals in a case-control genetic association study. Data were analysed with Pearson Chi-squared Test or Student's t test, as appropriated. RESULTS: No differences in ApoE 4 allelic frequencies between MTLE-HS patients and controls or between MTLE-HS subgroups were observed. Nevertheless, ApoE 4 carriers had an earlier MTLE-HS onset (11.0 +/- 7.9 years in ApoE 4 carriers vs. 14.4 +/- 11.2 years in ApoE 4 non-carriers p < 0.05). Additionally, we observed that MTLE-HS patients with FS antecedents had a statistically significant early disease onset (11.5 +/- 8.7 years in FS(+) vs. 16.0 +/- 12.1 years in FS(-), p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ApoE 4 and FS may not participate directly in etiopathogenic mechanisms of MTLE-HS but could hasten the disease development in predisposed individuals.
