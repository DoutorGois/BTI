The present study investigated the changes in the expression of regulators of G-protein-coupled signaling proteins RGS2, 7 and 8 in gerbil hippocampus to better understand alterations of G-protein-coupled receptors signaling after cerebral ischemia. In situ hybridization revealed a transient, robust early increase in RGS7 mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus after ischemia. RGS8 mRNA expression started to increase at a later time point in the CA3 region but no changes were found for RGS2. Our results show a subtype-, time-, and subregion-specific regulation in mRNA expression of RGS proteins after cerebral ischemia in gerbil hippocampus.
