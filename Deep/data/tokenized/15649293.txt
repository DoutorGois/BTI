1. It has been suggested that hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and diabetes participate in the onset and development of dementia. 2. To understand cognitive dysfunction in metabolic syndrome, the relationship between the plasma and the hippocampus regarding fatty acid composition and lipid peroxidation was estimated in genetically hypertensive and obese SHR/NDmcr-cp rats (SHR-cp) aged 7-9 and 18-20 weeks. 3. Levels of total fatty acids and lipid peroxide in the plasma were much higher (by 200-500%) in SHR-cp compared with age-matched control rats (Wistar-Kyoto rats). However, in the hippocampus these levels were not significantly different between the two groups of rats. 4. Levels of hippocampal lipid peroxide in both groups increased significantly with ageing. 5. These results indicate that, in SHR-cp, lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus would not be affected even if plasma levels of fatty acids and lipid peroxide increased markedly, when ageing is not a predicative factor.
