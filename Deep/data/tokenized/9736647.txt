Cell cultures were used to analyze the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in the development of synaptic transmission. Neurons obtained from embryonic day 18 (E18) rat hippocampus and cultured for 2 weeks exhibited extensive spontaneous synaptic activity. By comparison, neurons obtained from E16 hippocampus expressed very low levels of spontaneous or evoked synaptic activity. Neurotrophin treatment produced a sevenfold increase in the number of functional synaptic connections in the E16 cultures. BDNF induced formation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, whereas NT-3 induced formation of only excitatory synapses. These effects were independent of serum or the age of the glia bed used for the culture. They were not accompanied by significant changes in synaptic-vesicle-associated proteins or glutamate receptors. Treatment of the cultures with the neurotrophins for 3 d was sufficient to establish the maximal level of functional synapses. During this period, neurotrophins did not affect the viability or the morphology of the excitatory neurons, although they did produce an increase in the number and length of dendrites of the GABAergic neurons. Remarkably, only BDNF caused an increase in the number of axonal branches and in the total length of the axons of the GABAergic neurons. These results support a unique and differential role for neurotrophins in the formation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the developing hippocampus.
