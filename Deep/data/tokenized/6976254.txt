This paper presents 3 examples of cavum vergae, a normal variant in cranial computed tomography (CCT) and pneumoencephalography. The CCT appearance of cavum vergae is illustrated in both axial and coronal planes, and the means of distinguishing cavum vergae from cavum velum interpositum and cystic lesions of the third ventricle by reference to normal anatomical landmarks is discussed.
