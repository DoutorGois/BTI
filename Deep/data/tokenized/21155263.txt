AIM: To evaluate the effects of different doses of zinc on the expression of metallothionein isoforms in stressed hippocampal neurons in vitro. METHODS: The cell stress model was developed by corticosterone. The cultured hippocampal neurons were assigned to seven groups as follows: control group, zinc deficiency group, and their corresponding stressed groups, as well as three different levels of zinc complementarity groups. RESULTS: In zinc deficiency group, the expressions of metallothionein and MT-1 mRNA, MT-3 mRNA were downregulated. On the other hand, inductions of metallothionein and it's mRNAs in stressed zinc complementarity group were increased. In addition, the levels of supernatant IL-6 and NO were increased clearly in zinc deficiency group and corticosterone stressed groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that zinc deficiency may decrease while zinc complementarity increase the expressions of metallothioneins and MT-1 mRNA, MT-3 mRNA in stressed hippocampal neurons in vitro.
