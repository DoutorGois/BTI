In vivo microdialysis combined with measurements of 45Ca efflux from pre-labelled rat hippocampus has been utilised in our laboratory to demonstrate NMDA-evoked 45Ca2+ release to dialysate, reflecting calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR). In the present study we attempted to reproduce this phenomenon in the rabbit hippocampus. Application of 1 mM NMDA to dialysis medium induced a decrease in Ca2+ concentration in dialysate, as a result of extracellular Ca2+ influx to neurones. The release of 45Ca2+ was not observed, instead a decrease in 45Ca2+ efflux rate from the NMDA treated rabbit hippocampus was noted, along with release to dialysate of prostaglandin D2, taurine and phosphoethanolamine. All these effects, reflecting different steps of intracellular calcium signalling, were insensitive to 100 microM dantrolene and 50 microM ryanodine, RyR modulators known to interfere with NMDA-evoked 45Ca2+ release in the rat hippocampus. Thus, although the results of this study demonstrate the role of extracellular Ca2+ influx to neurones in NMDA-evoked generation of Ca2+ signal in the rabbit hippocampus, the activity of CICR was not detected.
