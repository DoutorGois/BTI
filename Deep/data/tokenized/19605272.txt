The acute effect of ACTH and corticosterone on catecholamine concentration of individual brain nuclei has been examined. ACTH significantly increased the noradrenaline (NA) content in the locus coeruleus, and decreased it in the ventromedial and arcuate nuclei. No change was observed after ACTH in the dopamine (DA) concentrations of the mentioned areas and in the catecholamine level of the mamillary body, hippocampus, medial habenular nucleus and of the pituitary. Corticosterone increased the NA content of the supraoptic nucleus and the NA and DA levels in the median eminence, while it did not affect the amine concentrations in the locus coeruleus.
