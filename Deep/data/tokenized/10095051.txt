We have recently reported that dextromethorphan attenuates the neurotoxicity induced by kainic acid in a dose-related fashion. Pretreatments with dextromethorphan (50 mg/kg, p.o. x2) significantly reduced the activator protein-1 DNA-binding activity and the Fos-related antigen-immunoreactive protein induced by kainic acid (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in the CA1, but not the CA3 or the dentate gyrus sector of the rat hippocampus. Paradoxically, dextromethorphan itself caused an elevated activator protein-1 DNA-binding activity and Fos-related antigen-immunoreactive protein in the CA1 region which lasted for at least 4 days. The results suggest that the CA1 area is the critical site for mediating the putative neuroprotective effect induced by dextromethorphan.
