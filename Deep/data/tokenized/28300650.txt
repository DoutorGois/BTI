Fibromyalgia (FM) is a complex syndrome characterized by chronic widespread pain, hyperalgesia, and other disabling symptoms. Although the brain response to experimental pain in FM patients has been the object of intense investigation, the biological underpinnings of painful after-sensations (PAS), and their relation to negative affect have received little attention. In this cross-sectional cohort study, subjects with FM (n = 53) and healthy controls (n = 17) were assessed for PAS using exposure to a sustained, moderately painful cuff stimulus to the leg, individually calibrated to a target pain intensity of 40 of 100. Despite requiring lower cuff pressures to achieve the target pain level, FM patients reported more pronounced PAS 15 seconds after the end of cuff stimulation, which correlated positively with clinical pain scores. Functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed reduced deactivation of the medial temporal lobe (MTL; amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus) in FM patients, during pain stimulation, as well as in the ensuing poststimulation period, when PAS are experienced. Moreover, the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal measured during the poststimulation period in the MTL, as well as in the insular and anterior middle cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices, correlated with the severity of reported PAS by FM patients. These results suggest that the MTL plays a role in PAS in FM patients. PERSPECTIVE: PAS are more common and severe in FM, and are associated with clinical pain and catastrophizing. PAS severity is also associated with less MTL deactivation, suggesting that the MTL, a core node of the default mode network, may be important in the prolongation of pain sensation in FM.
