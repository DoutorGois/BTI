The calcium-diacyglycerol activated protein kinase (C kinase) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity, and possibly in long-term potentiation (LTP). We have found that phorbol esters, which activate this protein kinase, increase the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPCs) in hippocampal cell cultures. An analysis of distributions of these miniature synaptic currents shows that amplitudes, and thus postsynaptic function, are not influenced by phorbol esters. Synaptic transmission is therefore enhanced by phorbol esters at a presynaptic locus. The method of analysis employed here is applicable to a broad range of situations involving modification of synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system.
