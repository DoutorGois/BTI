The release of endogenous amino acids from hippocampal CA1 subslices under basal conditions and the release evoked by high potassium (50 mM K+) depolarization was studied during kindling epileptogenesis. Emphasis was put on the release of the amino acid neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Kindling was induced by tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer-collaterals/commissural fibers of the dorsal hippocampus of the rat. The calcium-dependent GABA release in the presence of high K+ was significantly increased (40-46%) in fully kindled animals, 24 h after the last seizure, in comparison to controls. At long-term, 28 days after the last seizure, the calcium-dependent GABA release was still significantly increased (45-49%). An increased release of GABA in kindled animals was still found when GABA uptake was blocked by nipecotic acid. In contrast, no significant alterations were encountered in the basal or high potassium induced release of the excitatory amino acids aspartate and glutamate. These results suggest that kindling epileptogenesis is accompanied by a specific and long-lasting enhancement of GABA exocytosis which may lead to a desensitization of the GABA receptor, and thus determine the increase of seizure sensitivity.
