Cortical spreading depression (CSD) protects hippocampal and cortical neurons from an otherwise lethal ischemic insult delivered days later. The present study was undertaken to evaluate changes in the expression of BDNF following CSD, distinct from lesion effects and its possible involvement in delayed ischemic tolerance. CSD was elicited by KCl application and a cortical lesion was made by hyperosmolar NaCl application. BDNF mRNA was examined by in situ hybridization and Northern blot up to 7 days post-CSD. BDNF protein content was measured by ELISA. In the cortex, BDNF protein was mildly elevated despite minimal increases of mRNA in the NaCl lesion group. CSD specifically up-regulated BDNF mRNA at 4 h, followed by a delayed secondary increase at 2-3 days. BDNF protein exhibited smaller biphasic increases at 24 h and 3-7 days post-CSD which were significantly higher than the NaCl lesion group. In the hippocampus, BDNF protein levels showed a delayed decrease in both groups independent of mRNA changes, but CSD specifically delayed this decrease. Thus, CSD can alter BDNF levels independent of lesion effects. The increased BDNF following CSD in the cortex is consistent with the involvement of BDNF in cortical ischemic tolerance. BDNF could not, however, be directly related to ischemic tolerance in the hippocampus.
