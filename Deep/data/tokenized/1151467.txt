The authors studied the morphological sequelae of 15 minutes of cerebral oligemia (20 torr cerebral perfusion pressure) and complete cerebral ischemia produced by raised intracranial pressure in rabbits. Ischemic cell change was present in five of seven ischemic animals; it was most extensive in the striatum and hippocampus, with only a few ischemic nerve cells in the thalamus and neocortex. The brains of control and oligemic animals were normal. These results indicate the following: 1) ischemia is a more severe insult than oligemia; 2) compression ischemia results in a pattern of damage that differs from that produced by other types of ischemia; and 3) the method used to reduce cerebral perfusion pressure is an important factor in determining the pattern and extent of brain damage produced.
