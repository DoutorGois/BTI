Based on a novel analytical method for analyzing short-term plasticity (STP) of the CA1 hippocampal region in vitro, a screening tool for the detection and classification of unknown chemical compounds affecting the nervous system was recently introduced [1], [2]. The recorded signal consisted of evoked population spike in response to Poisson distributed random train impulse stimuli. The developed analytical approach used the first order Volterra kernel and the Laguerre coefficients of the second order Volterra model as classification features [3]. The biosensor showed encouraging results, and was able to classify out of sample compounds correctly [2]. We have taken an exploratory step to investigate the advantage of introducing a third order model [4]. DAP5, an NMDA channel blocker, did not show major changes in the second order kernel and in its corresponding Laguerre coefficients. Data were reanalyzed using a third order model. DAP5 showed discernable changes in the third order kernel as well as in the some of the corresponding Laguerre coefficients. Hence, the third order Volterra based model has the potential to improve the sensitivity and the discriminatory power of the proposed bioassay.
