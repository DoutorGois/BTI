Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) has been linked to the mechanisms of stress, mood regulation, and the effects of antidepressants. The functions of the GSK3beta isoform have been extensively investigated, but little is known about the alpha-isoform, although they may functionally related. In a recently established modified swim test with a third delayed swim exposure, brain GSK3beta mRNA expression positively correlated with floating behaviour on the third test. A two-week-long pretreatment regime with imipramine (7.5mg/kg/day) or thiamine (200mg/kg/day), which is known to have antidepressant properties, reduced the GSK3beta over-expression and decreased floating behaviour on Day 5. GSK3alpha mRNA levels were measured in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex on Days 1, 2 and 5. GSK3alpha expression was decreased in the prefrontal cortex on Day 2 and increased on Day 5. In this model, GSK3alpha mRNA changes were prevented by imipramine or thiamine treatment. There was a significant correlation between the expression of the two isoforms in the prefrontal cortex on Day 2 in untreated group. These results provide the first evidence for the potential involvement of GSK3alpha in depressive-like behaviours and as a target of anti-depressant therapy. Furthermore, the correlations suggest some cross-talk may exist between the two GSK3 isoforms.
