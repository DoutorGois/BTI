Neuronal apoptosis in neurodegenerative diseases is correlated with inflammatory reactions. The beneficial or detrimental role of apoptosis in neuroinflammation is unclear. In this study, we injected beta-amyloid peptide into the rat cortex for induction of neuroinflammation in hippocampus. We observed an increase in TNF-alpha as an inflammatory cytokine and caspase3 and TUNEL-positive cells as apoptotic marker. As far as ability of TNF-alpha to induce apoptosis or activate NF-kbeta, the question is what will happen if the balance between two pathways is disturbed by inhibition of apoptosis. Using caspase inhibitors, we inhibited apoptosis and assessed NF-kbeta, Hsp 70 (a hallmark of cancer), cmyc (proto-oncogene) and p53 (tumor suppressor protein). There was an unexpected decrease in NF-kbeta while Hsp70 and cmyc upregulated and p53 decreased. These results imply that inhibition of apoptosis due to increased susceptibility to abnormal mitosis may not provide a reliable strategy for treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.
