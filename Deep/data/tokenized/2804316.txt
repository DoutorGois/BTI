In free behavior experiments on cats it has been shown, that the intraperitoneal injection of delta-sleep-inducing peptide (100 mg/kg) may change organization of the pathology integration-epileptic discharges did not spread all the structures simultaneously. The slow-waves were registered in central medium of the thalamus and nucl. caudati. The epileptic discharges were registered first in visual and auditory cortex, hippocampus. After that they were observed in the motor cortex, nucl. caudati and centrum medianum of the thalamus.
