The phosphorylation state of tau-protein is crucial for the regulation of neuronal microtubule organization. Functional conclusions on tau-protein require an accurate assessment of phosphorylated sites. Therefore, the in vivo distribution and postmortem preservation of some phospho-epitopes on tau-protein were examined in the rat brain under different fixation and preparation conditions. Detection of tau-protein with a phosphorylation-independent antiserum revealed both axonal and somatodendritic localizations, which were not influenced by a postmortem interval of 30 min. The phospho-epitopes recognized by 12E8, AT8, and PHF-1 were mainly localized in the somatodendritic compartment. The binding sites of AT8 and PHF-1 were rapidly dephosphorylated postmortem, whereas the Tau-1 epitope was unmasked in the somatodendritic region. The axonally located phospho-epitope of AT270 and the nuclear epitope of AT100 were still detectable after a postmortem interval of 30 min. Postmortem dephosphorylation and inhibition of this process by PP1 and/or PP2A was further demonstrated on Western blot. In conclusion, rapid processing of tau-protein is essential for the correct assessment of investigations on phospho-isoforms.
