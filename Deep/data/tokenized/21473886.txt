OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of neuregulin 1beta (NRG1beta) on the neuronal apoptosis and the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins in experimental dementia model rats. METHODS: Thirty adult healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and treated group consisting of 10 rats, respectively. The experimental dementia models were established by injecting beta-amyloid protein 1-40 (Abeta1-40) stereotactically into the left lateral ventricle, and treated by injecting NRG1beta into right lateral ventricle. The cognitive capacity of rats was evaluated with Y-electric maze. The neuronal apoptosis was counted by TUNEL assay. The expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax were determined with immunohistochemistry assay and double immunofluorescence labeling. RESULTS: The cognitive ability in model group rats decreased, along with the number of neuronal apoptosis and the expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax increased significantly than those in control group (P < 0.05). After treatment with NRG1beta, the cognitive ability of rats improved, the number of neuronal apoptosis reduced and the expression of Bcl-2 increased while Bax decreased significantly than those in model group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: NRG1beta could inhibit neuronal apoptosis by regulating the expressions of Bcl-2/Bax to improve the capacity of learning and memory in experimental dementia rats.
