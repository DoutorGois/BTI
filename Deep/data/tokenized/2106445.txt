Focal brain injury in mice induced c-fos mRNA and protein in neurons throughout the damaged neocortex, including the piriform and the entorhinal cortices, as well as in nonneural brain cells (e.g., glia, pia, ependyma). The pattern of c-fos induction after injury suggested that injury led to spreading depression which then led to c-fos induction in neurons. Human neurons in the temporal cortex and hippocampus also showed c-fos protein induction after neurosurgical trauma. The c-fos mRNA and protein induction in mouse neurons was prevented by the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine but only partially inhibited by the voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonist nifedipine and the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine. The c-fos protein induction in nonneural brain cells after injury was not affected by these drugs. Thus, induction of c-fos in neocortical neurons after focal brain injury is partly NMDA receptor mediated.
