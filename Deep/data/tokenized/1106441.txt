A modified stereotaxic surgical and implantation technique for animal EEG studies in rabbits is described. The use of a stereotaxic "socklet unit" with a minimum of operational equipment, high accuracy, simple handling, and good tissue compatibility permits the repetition of EEG studies in the same animal with a large number of electrodes and over a period of several months. For example for this technique an experimental arrangement for recording visually evoked potentials is described. The importance of a careful selection of the experimental animals, of maintaining constant test conditions, and of the selecting of test parameters as a prerequisite for assessing induced alterations is emphasized and discussed.
