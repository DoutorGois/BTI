Several antidepressant treatments enhance serotonergic neurotransmission. The present electrophysiological studies were undertaken to assess the effect of mianserin and indalpine, two antidepressant drugs with different pharmacological profiles, on serotonergic neurotransmission. In a first series of experiments, the responsiveness of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to microiontophoretic applications of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was assessed following mianserin, imipramine (5 mg/kg/day IP) or saline administration for 14 days. At 48 h after the last dose of mianserin, responsiveness to 5-HT was increased whereas that to NE and GABA was not modified. The degree of sensitization to 5-HT was the same as that produced by imipramine. Acute IV administration of mianserin (up to 10 mg/kg) did not decrease the firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons. In a second series of experiments, long-term administration of indalpine (5 mg/kg/day IP for 14 days) did not modify the responsiveness of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to microiontophoretically applied 5-HT, NE and GABA whereas imipramine treatment (5 mg/kg/day IP) increased selectively their sensitivity to 5-HT when compared to indalpine-treated rats. In keeping with its potent reuptake-blocking property, acute IV indalpine produced a marked decrease in the firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons (ED50 0.33 mg/kg). The firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was assessed following 2-, 7- and 14-day treatments with indalpine (5 mg/day IP). After 2 days, the firing rate of 5-HT neurons was greatly reduced, after 7 days it had recovered partially and after 14 days it had returned to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
