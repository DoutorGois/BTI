With the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) predicted to increase substantially over the coming decades, the development of effective biomarkers for the early detection of the disease is paramount. In this short review, the main neuroimaging techniques which have shown potential as biomarkers for AD are introduced, with a focus on MRI. Structural MRI measures of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe are still the most clinically validated biomarkers for AD, but newer techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging offer great scope in tracking changes in the brain, particularly in functional and structural connectivity, which may precede gray matter atrophy. These new advances in neuroimaging methods require further development and crucially, standardization; however, before they are used as biomarkers to aid in the diagnosis of AD.
