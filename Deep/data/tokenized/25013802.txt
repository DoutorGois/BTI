Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and most common form of dementia that leads to memory impairment. In the present study we have examined the protective effects of Borago officinalis (borage) extract on Amyloid beta (A beta)-Induced memory impairment. Wistar male rats received intrahippocampal (IHP) injection of the A beta (25-35) and borage extract throughout gestation (100 mg/kg). Learning and memory functions in the rats were examined by the passive avoidance and the Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. Finally, the antioxidant capacity of hippocampus was measured using ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. The results showed that A beta (25-35) impaired step-through latency and time in dark compartment in passive avoidance task. In the MWM, A beta (25-35) significantly increased escape latency and traveled distance. Borage administration attenuated the A beta-induced memory impairment in both the passive avoidance and the MWM tasks. A beta induced a remarkable decrease in antioxidant power (FRAP value) of hippocampus and borage prevented the decrease of the hippocampal antioxidant status. This data suggests that borage could improve the learning impairment and oxidative damage in the hippocampal tissue following A beta treatment and that borage consumption may lead to an improvement of AD-induced cognitive dysfunction.
