The involvement of various neurotransmitter receptors in the brain in the regulation of spatial behavior is a focus of interest for many cognitive neuroscientists. Active allothetic place avoidance (AAPA) task have been demonstrated to require spatial mapping and cognitive coordination and is highly dependent upon hippocampus. The present study was designed to evaluate the role of beta-adrenergic receptors in the modulation of locomotor and spatial behavior in this task. Four doses of centrally active beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (5, 20, 25 and 30 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to testing in the place avoidance task. Four daily sessions were pursued, each lasting 20 min. A dose of 25 mg/kg was found to induce a deficit in spatial behavior (measured by number of entrances into the shock sector) without altering locomotion; lower doses were without effect. The highest dose (30 mg/kg) impaired both locomotion and avoidance behavior. The results suggest that beta-adrenoceptors are involved in the regulation of behavior in the place avoidance task and that it is possible to dissociate the effect of propranolol on the spatial performance and locomotion in the AAPA using dose-selection.
