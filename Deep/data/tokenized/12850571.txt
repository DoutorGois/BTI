The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of signal transduction mediators that regulate a host of cellular activities, including cell growth and proliferation, and differentiation and survival, via sequential phosphorylation and activation of a cassette of three protein kinases. MAPKs are also recruited when the brain undergoes synaptic plasticity and remodeling (e.g., during induction of long-term potentiation, learning and memory consolidation). The activities of some of these kinases are altered in response to various acute stimuli such as ischemic insult, visceral pain and electroconvulsive shock. In the present study we used immunoblotting techniques to examine the effects of acute and repeated restraint stress on the phosphorylation state of three MAPKs, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase Erk1/2, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) and p38 MAPK, in different brain regions. A single exposure to 30 min of restraint stress-elevated phospho-Erk1/2 (P-Erk1/2) levels in all three brain regions examined (hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex), but did not alter the phosphorylation pattern of the other two MAPKs in any region. In marked contrast, exposure to restraint for 11 days (30 min/day) reduced the levels of all three MAPKs, but only in the prefrontal cortex. The results are compared to the reported effects of acute and chronic stress on other biochemical and functional measures.
