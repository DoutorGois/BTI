Mycotoxins are commonly encountered natural products, and are capable of poisoning animals or humans that inhale mold particles from mycotoxin-contaminated foods. Ochratoxin A (OTA) is produced by Aspergillu ochracus and Penicillium verrucosum, and is often found in cereals and agricultural products. Although previous studies have focused on the potent nephrotoxicity and renal carcinogenicity of OTA, more recent studies suggest that it accumulates in the brain and causes oxidative stress and DNA damage in various brain regions and neuronal populations. In the present study, we undertook to investigate the potential harm caused by environmental exposure to OTA in terms of its effects on neuronal cell viability and proteome profiles. OTA was found to significantly reduce the viabilities of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, as assessed by lactic dehydrogenase release into culture media. Generation of reactive oxygen species was detected in OTA-treated SH-SY5Y and HT22 cells, however, caspase activation and increase in p53 phosphorylation were only detected in HT22 cells, and the expressions of several proteins were found to be significantly altered after treating HT22 cells with OTA. Valosin containing protein, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, Atp5b protein, nucleophosmin 1, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta isoform, ornithine aminotransferase, prohibitin, and peroxiredoxin 6, which have been suggested to be implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, were up-regulated. Our findings suggest that coordinated regulations of molecular networks are involved in the OTA-induced cytotoxicity and that proteome response can be an indicative for neurodegeneration.
