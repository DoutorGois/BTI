Interactions between noradrenergic and cholinergic receptor signaling may be important in some forms of learning. To investigate whether noradrenergic and cholinergic receptor interactions regulate forms of synaptic plasticity thought to be involved in memory formation, we examined the effects of concurrent beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptor activation on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region. Low concentrations of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO) and the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol had no effect on the induction of LTP by a brief train of 5 Hz stimulation when applied individually but dramatically facilitated LTP induction when coapplied. Although carbachol did not enhance ISO-induced increases in cAMP, coapplication of ISO and carbachol synergistically activated p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42 MAPK). This suggests that concurrent beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptor activation enhances LTP induction by activating MAPK and not by additive or synergistic effects on adenylyl cyclase. Consistent with this, blocking MAPK activation with MEK inhibitors suppressed the facilitation of LTP induction produced by concurrent beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptor activation. Although MEK inhibitors also suppressed the induction of LTP by a stronger 5 Hz stimulation protocol that induced LTP in the absence of ISO and carbachol, they had no effect on LTP induced by high-frequency synaptic stimulation or low-frequency synaptic stimulation paired with postsynaptic depolarization. Our results indicate that MAPK activation has an important, modulatory role in the induction of LTP and suggest that coactivation of noradrenergic and cholinergic receptors regulates LTP induction via convergent effects on MAPK.
