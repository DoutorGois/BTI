Experimental evidence indicates that metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors of the mGlu1 and mGlu5 subtypes play a differential role in models of cerebral ischemia and that only mGlu1 receptors are implicated in the pathways leading to postischemic neuronal injury. The localization of mGlu1 receptors in GABA-containing interneurons rather than in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells that are vulnerable to ischemia has prompted experimental studies that have demonstrated mGlu1 receptor antagonist agents attenuate postischemic injury by enhancing GABA-mediated neurotransmission, thus providing a new viewpoint on the neuroprotective mechanism of these pharmacological agents. In view of the recent discovery of a functional interaction between group I mGlu receptors and the cannabinoid system in the modulation of synaptic transmission, we propose a novel mechanism that predicts that the neuroprotective effects of mGlu1 receptor antagonists on CA1 pyramidal cells are mediated by a mechanism that overcomes the "synaptic circuit break" operated by endocannabinoids on GABAergic transmission.
