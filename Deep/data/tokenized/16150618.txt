We previously proposed the hypothesis that calpain activation played an important role in long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in hippocampus. Two forms of calpain are predominant in brain tissues, calpain 1 (mu-calpain), activated by micromolar calcium concentration and calpain 2 (m-calpain), activated by millimolar calcium concentration in vitro. In the present study, we tested the role of calpain 1 in LTP and in learning and memory using calpain 1 knock-out mice. Changes in learning and memory were assessed using both context and tone fear conditioning. No differences in freezing responses were observed between the knock-out and the wild-type animals during the acquisition phase of the training, eliminating the possibility that the knock-out animals could be differentially affected by the foot shock. Likewise, no differences in freezing responses elicited by either the context or the tone were observed during the retention phase. No differences in short-term potentiation (STP) or LTP were observed in hippocampal slices from the knock-out and matched wild-type mice. Several interpretations might explain these negative results. First, it is conceivable that calpain 2 plays a more dominant role in neurons, and that calpain 1 makes a minor contribution as opposed to its suspected predominant role in the hematopoietic system. Alternatively, it is conceivable that some as yet unknown compensatory mechanisms take effect, and that calpain 2 or another calpain isoform substitutes for the missing calpain 1.
