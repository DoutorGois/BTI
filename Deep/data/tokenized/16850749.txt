To explore the effect of [Ca2+]i and neuronal mitochondria transmembrane potentials in hippocampus of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infected mice, newborn Balb/c mice were randomly divided into two groups: a virus inoculated group and a control group. After 56 days, single cell of hippocampus was isolated, and mitochondria transmembrane potentials and the intracellular free calcium level [Ca2+]i in hippocampus were measured by means of flow cytometry (FCM). Compared with the control group, the mitochondria transmembrane potentials was decreased (P<0.01) and the intracellular free calcium level [Ca2+]i was increased (P<0.01) in inoculated group. The dysfunction of [Ca2+]i and mitochondria transmembrane potentials in hippocampus may play an important role in the functional disorders in CMV-infected CNS.
