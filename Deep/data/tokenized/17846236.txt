Persistent infection following in utero exposure to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) early in gestation is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality in cattle industries worldwide. The brain is a primary target of persistent infection. In the current study, the types of cells infected and topography of viral antigen expression were examined in brain sections from 9 BVDV persistently infected crossbred calves, all less than 1 year of age, by immunohistochemical staining using the 15C5 primary monoclonal antibody. BVDV antigen was detected in the brains of all persistently infected calves. A variety of cell types was infected, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendroglia, blood vessel-associated cells (pericytes, perivascular macrophages, smooth muscle cells), and cells in the leptomeninges (blood vessel-associated cells). Conclusive demonstration of viral antigen in vascular endothelial cells was elusive. The intensity and distribution of viral antigen staining in neurons were highly variable. Viral antigen staining was most consistent and intense in thalamic nuclei, most notably in dorsal and medial nuclear groups, followed by the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, basal nuclei, and piriform cortex. Staining in other brain areas was often less intense and inconsistent. The variability in the intensity and topography of viral antigen in the brain may explain the heterogeneity in the clinical manifestations of BVDV-induced disease. Additionally, infection of the brain in persistently infected calves may underlie or at least contribute to endocrine disturbances and immunologic deficits that are protean manifestations of BVDV-induced disease.
