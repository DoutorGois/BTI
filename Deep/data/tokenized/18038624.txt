Cognitive processes and functional state of mitochondria in brain structures of Wistar rats were studied after intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid, an agonist of glutamate receptors. A single administration of 0.25 microg kainic acid into the dorsal part of the left and right hippocampi affected task retrieval and decreased inhibition of unrewarded responses. The injection of 0.75 microg kainic acid induced recurrent seizures and completely disorganized animal behavior. The functional state of mitochondria, as an important marker of excitotoxicity, was studied after intrahippocampal injections of kainic acid in the same doses. Kainic acid at 0.25 microg proved to activate the oxidative phosphorylation in hippocampal mitochondria. A higher (epileptogenic) dose of kainic acid inhibited mitochondrial respiration in the frontal cortex, but had an insignificant effect on mitochondrial respiration in the hippocampus. The disturbed interaction between the hippocampal system and frontal cortex after kainic acid administration can be the main factor of the revealed cognitive dysfunctions.
