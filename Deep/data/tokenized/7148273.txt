The norepinephrine content of neocortex, hippocampus, and adrenals of adult male Wistar rats was estimated. In normal rats an asymmetrical right-left-distribution of the norepinephrine content was found. Neocortex and hippocampus showed a contralateral, neocortex and adrenals an ipsilateral ratio. Chronic stress cancelled this right-left asymmetry of norepinephrine distribution. In brain the levelling appeared earlier than in adrenals.
