In rat brain, the presence of pregnenolone and progesterone, not attributable to peripheral glandular sources, has been demonstrated and thus the two compounds can be classified as neurosteroids. In vitro experiments have shown the conversion of pregnenolone, a 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-ene steroid, into progesterone, a delta 4-oxo steroid, thus demonstrating a 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4 isomerase (3 beta-HSD) enzymatic activity. The conversion of 3 beta-hydroxy-delta 5-derivatives into the corresponding delta 4-oxo steroids by 3 beta-HSD is an essential step in the biosynthesis of all steroid hormones in endocrine glands. To date, four isoforms of 3 beta-HSD have been characterized in the rat. We report here the selective expression of a 3 beta-HSD isoform in rat brain. An in situ hybridization study, using an oligonucleotide common to the 4 known isoforms, demonstrated 3 beta-HSD mRNA in neurons of the olfactory bulb, striatum, cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, septum, habenula, hippocampus and cerebellum. The cerebellum showed the highest level of 3 beta-HSD mRNA corresponding to a transcript of 1.8 kb. Nucleotide sequencing of PCR-amplified cDNA fragments from cerebellar mRNA indicated the expression of an isoform of 3 beta-HSD cDNA very closely related to the isoform I expressed in the adrenals and gonads. Further evidence for the expression of 3 beta-HSD gene in the brain was demonstrated utilizing anti-peptide 3 beta-HSD antibodies which revealed an immunoreactive protein of approximately 45 kDa in the cerebellum. Our results demonstrate for the first time the expression of the enzyme 3 beta-HSD in the brain, at both the mRNA and protein levels. Since several neuroactive neurosteroids are substrates or products of the 3 beta-HSD enzymatic activity, our findings offer new possibilities to study the regulatory mechanisms governing their biosynthesis in the brain.
