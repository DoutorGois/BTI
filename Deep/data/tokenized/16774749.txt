There is increasing evidence that neuronal cell death induced by seizures occurs via extrinsic (death receptors) and intrinsic (mitochondria) pathways. Caspase-8 cleaves Bid, which releases cytochrome c, bridging the "extrinsic" and "intrinsic" pathways. Cleavage of Bid may amplify caspase-8-induced neuronal cell death following seizures. In the present study, we explored the effect of an inhibitor of caspase-8 (z-IETD-fmk) on the release of Smac/DIABLO and cytochrome c from mitochondria. Rats received intra-amygdaloid injection of kainic acid (KA) to induce seizures for 1 h. The seizures were then terminated by diazepam (30 mg/kg). The damaged and surviving neurons in hippocampus were observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cresyl violet staining, the expression of caspase-8, Bid, XIAP, caspase-9, cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO were detected with immunofluorescence and Western blot. The cleavage of caspase-8 and Bid increased at 0 h, cytosolic fraction of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO increased by 2 h, cleavage of caspase-9 was detected by 4 h, TUNEL-positive neurons appeared at 8 h and reached a maximum at 24 h following administration of diazepam in the ipsilateral CA3 subfield of hippocampus. Inhibition of caspase-8 significantly decreased neuronal cell death, accompanied by reduction of t-Bid, cleaved caspase-9 and cytosol cytochrome c. Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria was not affected. These results suggest that seizures can lead the translocation of cytochrome c into the cytosol, and the activation of caspase-8 occurs upstream the mitochondria release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. Inhibition of caspase-8 attenuated neuronal cell death following seizures by decreasing mitochondria release of cytochrome c but not Smac/DIABLO.
