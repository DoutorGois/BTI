The hippocampus has unique access to neuronal activity across all of the neocortex. Yet an unanswered question is how the transfer of information between these structures is gated. One hypothesis involves temporal-locking of activity in the neocortex with that in the hippocampus. New data from the Matthew E. Diamond laboratory shows that the rhythmic neuronal activity that accompanies vibrissa-based sensation, in rats, transiently locks to ongoing hippocampal theta-rhythmic activity during the sensory-gathering epoch of a discrimination task. This result complements past studies on the locking of sniffing and the theta-rhythm as well as the relation of sniffing and whisking. An overarching possibility is that the preBotzinger inspiration oscillator, which paces whisking, can selectively lock with the theta-rhythm to traffic sensorimotor information between the rat's neocortex and hippocampus.
