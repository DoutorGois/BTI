The biophysical mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated in identifiable and monosynaptic excitatory inputs to hippocampal neurons. The results provide the first insights into the conductance changes that are responsible for the expression of LTP. Both current- and voltage-clamp measurements of the mossy fiber synaptic response in pyramidal neurons of region CA3 were made with a single-electrode-clamp system. The excitatory postsynaptic response was pharmacologically isolated by bathing hippocampal slices in saline containing 10 microM picrotoxin, which blocks the synaptic inhibition that normally accompanies the experimentally evoked mossy fiber response. LTP was induced by tetanically stimulating the mossy fiber input for 1 s at 100 Hz. Before and 20 min to 1 h after inducing LTP, we attempted to measure the mean excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude, intrasomatic current-voltage relationship to a step (RN) or alpha function (AN) current waveform, membrane time constant (tau m), spike threshold (T50), peak excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude (IP), synaptic conductance increase (delta G), and synaptic reversal potential (VR); but adequate assessments of all eight of these were not always obtained for every cell that was studied. The induction of LTP increased the mean (+/- SE) EPSP amplitude form 10.5 +/- 1.4 mV during the control period to 16.8 +/- 2.4 mV after the induction of LTP (n = 14; P less than 0.05). This change was not accompanied by increases in the mean value of RN (63 +/- 11 M omega before and 61 +/- 11 M omega after induction; n = 8; P greater than 0.05); AN, which approximates the effective synaptic input resistance at the soma (10.0 +/- 1.50 M omega before and 10.5 +/- 1.60 M omega after; n = 10; P greater than 0.05); or tau m (22 +/- 2 ms before and 20 +/- 2 ms after; n = 8; P greater than 0.05). There was no significant change in T50, which was also assessed with an alpha function current waveform (1.48 +/- 0.11 nA before and 1.49 +/- 0.10 nA after; n = 6; P greater than 0.05). The mean value of IP increased from 1.1 +/- 0.2 nA during the control period to 1.8 +/- 0.3 nA after inducing LTP (n = 15; P less than 0.05). Similarly, delta G increased from 30 +/- 4 nS before to 47 +/- 4 nS after induction (n = 10; P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
