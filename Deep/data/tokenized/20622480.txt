Previously, we observed that electroacupuncture (EA) at ST36 (Zusanli) and GV20 (Baihui) enhanced cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the rat dentate gyrus. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms of EA in this effect. For this, we applied EA at ST36 and GV20 of Wistar rats (13-week-old) once a day for 3 weeks. Application of EA at these acupoints significantly increased the number of phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB)-immunoreactive cells in the dentate gyrus. In addition, EA significantly increased the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pCREB protein in the dentate gyrus. The administration of K252a, an inhibitor of BDNF receptor, significantly reduced cell proliferation in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus. These results suggest that EA significantly increased neuroblast plasticity via pCREB and BDNF activation in the dentate gyrus.
