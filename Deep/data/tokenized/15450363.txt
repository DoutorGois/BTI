In order to investigate the role of erythropoietin (EPO) in the hippocampus, we studied the effect of EPO on nitric oxide (NO) production in the rat hippocampus using brain microdialysis. The dialysis probe was stereotaxically inserted into the rat hippocampus 24 h before the dialysis experiment. The perfusion fluid (Krebs-HEPES buffer, pH 7.4) was collected at 15-min intervals under freely moving conditions and NO metabolites (NOx) in the perfusate were immediately measured using a NOx-analyzing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)system. Following the collection of four fractions, 1 microl of EPO (10(-10) M, 10(-8) M and 10(-6) M) or vehicle (saline) was gently injected into the hippocampal tissue. The perfusion fluid was collected for 3 h after the injection. The NOx levels were unchanged by the injection of vehicle alone. After the injection of EPO, NOx levels gradually increased. The EPO-induced increase in NOx levels was significant at 10(-6) M EPO. The EPO-induced increases in NOx levels were eliminated in the presence of anti-EPO antibody. The increase in NOx levels induced by EPO was blunted by nicardipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, but not by MK-801, an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These findings, taken together, suggest that EPO increased NO production in the rat hippocampus by activating voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, but not through NMDA receptors.
