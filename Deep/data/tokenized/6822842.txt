Microsomal thiol S-methyltransferase (TMT) of rat brain catalysed the methylation of dithiothreitol (Km = 84 microM) and other thiol compounds using S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor (Km = 3.7 microM). With increasing polarity of thiol substrates there was a decrease in the maximal velocities of reaction and an increase in the apparent Km values. TMT was found to be unevenly distributed amongst various brain regions, with highest activities in the medulla oblongata and the hippocampus.
