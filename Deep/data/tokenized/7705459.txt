The effects of somatostatin on the impairment of working memory induced in rats by blockade of hippocampal muscarinic M1 or NMDA receptors were examined, using a three-panel runway task. Both the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1.0 microgram/side) and the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CPP ((+/-)-3(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonoic acid) (32 ng/side) significantly increased the number of working memory errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points), when injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus. This effect of intrahippocampal pirenzepine on working memory was alleviated by concurrent injection of 0.32 microgram/side somatostatin. However, concurrent somatostatin (0.1 or 0.32 microgram/side) had no significant effect on the intrahippocampal CPP-induced increase in working memory errors. These results suggest that somatostatin ameliorates the impairment of working memory resulting from hippocampal muscarinic M1 receptor blockade, possibly through activation of cholinergic functions.
