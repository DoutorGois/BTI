The ventral subiculum (vSub) has been implicated in a wide range of neurocognitive functions, including responses to fear, stress, and anxiety. The vSub receives dense noradrenergic (NE) inputs from the locus coeruleus (LC), and the LC-NE system is heavily implicated in attention and is known to be activated by stressors. However, the way in which the neurons in the vSub respond to activation of the LC-NE is not well understood. In this study, the direct LC innervation of the vSub was investigated. The effect of norepinephrine (NE) on single vSub neurons was examined using microiontophoresis combined with electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats, and this response compared with the effect of electrical stimulation of the LC. Iontophoretic NE inhibited all vSub neurons tested, whereas LC stimulation inhibited 16% and activated 38% of neurons. Inhibition was mediated primarily by alpha-2 receptors, whereas activation was mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, this effect was not mediated via the LC-basolateral amygdala (BLA) pathway, because BLA inactivation did not block LC stimulation-evoked activation of the vSub. These results indicate that the LC-NE system is a potent modulator of vSub activity. Based on these findings, stress-induced activation of the LC-NE system is expected to evoke inhibition and activation in the vSub, both of which may contribute to stress adaptation, whereas an imbalance of this system may lead to pathological stress responses in mental disorders.
