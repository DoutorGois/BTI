To assess the morphological changes of the hippocampus in Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients we used radial atrophy mapping, a mathematical modeling method sensitive to subtle differences in hippocampal shape. T1-weighted high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) scans were acquired from 14 LBD and 28 controls of similar age and gender, and were compared to those of 28 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) described previously. MR images were normalized by linear (12 parameter) transformation to a customized template. The hippocampal formation was isolated by manual tracing. Group differences were assessed with algorithms that average hippocampal shapes across subjects, using three-dimensional parametric surface mesh models. In LBD patients, significant tissue loss amounting to 10-20% was found in the hippocampal subregions corresponding to the anterior portion of the CA1 field on both sides, along the longitudinal midline in the dorsal aspect within the CA2-3 field, and in the subiculum and presubiculum. The direct comparisons between LBD and AD patients showed that this pattern of local atrophy is different from that characteristic of AD. LBD pattern of hippocampal atrophy might be related to the peculiar neuropathology of the disease.
