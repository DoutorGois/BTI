The elevated expression of the c-fos protooncogene has been proposed to be a marker of cell activation leading to a long term cellular response. In this communication we compared the c-fos mRNA accumulation in the hippocampus (i.e. postsynaptic cells) and entorhinal cortex (i.e. presynaptic cells) following high (tetanic) and low frequency electrical stimulation of the perforant path. Using Northern blot analysis we have found that high frequency stimulation elevates c-fos expression in both hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and the increase of c-fos mRNA levels in the entorhinal cortex is less pronounced, but longer lasting, than in the hippocampus. Slight increase of c-fos mRNA levels has been also observed in low frequency treated animals in the entorhinal cortex, but not in the hippocampus. These findings raise the question about differences in mechanisms involved in c-fos activation in both parts of the brain after stimulation which evokes long term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic efficacy.
