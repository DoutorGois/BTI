Acute and chronic nicotine exposure in rats is associated with an increase in brain acetylcholine (ACh) transmission. The acquisition of choline for neuronal ACh synthesis occurs primarily via two pathways; first, free choline is transported from the blood across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or second, from synaptic choline generated by either hydrolysis of non-bound ACh or membrane phosphatidylcholine catabolism. To determine if nicotine-induced cholinergic demand is associated with increased choline transport rates into brain, we measured BBB choline transport in naive and S-(-) nicotine exposed rats (acute and chronic, 4.5 mg/kg/d for 1, 14, 21 and 28 d; osmotic minipumps) using the in situ rat brain perfusion technique. No significant changes in choline uptake after acute or chronic nicotine exposure were observed in whole brain or cortex. Of considerable interest was a significant decrease in regional brain choline uptake measured in the hippocampus after chronic nicotine exposure (28 d). Our data suggest that the increased ACh transmission observed after nicotine exposure does not correlate with increased blood-to-brain transfer of choline. Considering these data and previous literature reports, we propose that the additional free choline required under conditions of nicotine exposure (for ACh synthesis) is primarily recruited from membrane phospholipid metabolism.
