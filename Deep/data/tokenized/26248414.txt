OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of polydatin on learning and memory and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) kinase activity in the hippocampus of rats with chronic alcoholism. METHODS: Forty rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: control group, chronic alcoholism group, low and high polydatin group. The rat chronic alcoholism model was established by ethanol 3.0 g/(kg . d) (intragastric administration). The abstinence scoring was used to evaluate the rats withdrawal symptoms; cognitive function was measured by Morris water maze experiment; Cdk5 protein expression in the hippocampus was detected by immunofluorescence; Cdk5 kinase activity in the hippocampus was detected by liquid scintillation counting method. RESULTS: The abstinence score, escape latency, Cdk5 kinase activity in chronic alcoholism group rats were significantly higher than those of control group (P < 0.05). The abstinence score, escape latency in high polydatin group rats were significantly lower than those of chronic alcoholism group (P < 0.05); Cdk5 kinase activity in high and low polydatin group rats was significantly lower than that of chronic alcoholism group( P < 0.05); immunofluorescence showed that the Cdk5 positive cells of chronic alcoholism group were significantly increased compared with control group (P < 0.05), and the Cdk5 positive cells of polydatin groups were significantly decreased compared with chronic alcoholism group ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Polydatin-reduced the chronic alcoholism damage may interrelate with regulation of Cdk5 kinase activity.
