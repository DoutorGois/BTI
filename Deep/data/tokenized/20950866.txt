Mice deficient in classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) have aberrations in neurodevelopment. The consequences of upregulated neuronal MHCI expression have not been examined. We found that transgenic C57Bl/6 mice that are engineered to express higher levels of self-D(b) on their CNS neurons have alterations in their hippocampal morphology and retinogeniculate projections, as well as impaired neurorepair responses. Thus, enhanced neuronal classical MHCI expression can lead to aberrations in neural circuitry and neurorepair. These findings complement a growing body of knowledge concerning the neurobiological activities of MHCI and may have potential clinical relevance.
