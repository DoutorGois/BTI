In vitro quantitative autoradiography of [3H]muscimol binding was used to examine the developmental pattern of GABA(A) receptor expression in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMN) of Long-Evans rats. Peak levels of [3H]muscimol binding were observed in the VMN on postnatal day 14 (PN14), binding levels were significantly lower in the VMN at earlier (PN0 and PN7) and later (PN70) ages. The developmental pattern of [3H]muscimol binding observed in the VMN differed from that seen in the hippocampus where binding was found to increase progressively from PN0 to PN14 and was maintained at high levels in adulthood. Although the profile of GABA(A) receptor expression in the developing VMN undergoes considerable modification during the critical period for sexual differentiation, no significant differences in [3H]muscimol binding were observed between male and female animals at any developmental age.
