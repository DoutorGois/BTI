Conditioned switching-over of homogeneous (alimentary) conditioned reflexes was elaborated in intact rats and in rats with simultaneously lesioned hippocampus and amygdala; time of the day served as switching stimulus. The operated rats showed higher values of intersignal and conditioned motor activity and easier conditioned switching-over than intact animals. It is suggested that the lesion of the amygdala enhances the effect of accelerated elaboration of the switching-over observed in animals with lesioned hippocampus, due to the elimination of competing (non-alimentary) motivations.
