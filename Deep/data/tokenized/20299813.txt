BACKGROUND: Synaptic plasticity is believed to be the major cellular basis for learning and memory. Protein phosphorylation is a key process involved in changes in the efficacy of neurotransmission. In long-term changes synaptic plasticity is followed by structural plasticity and protein de novo synthesis. Such mechanisms are believed to build the basis of hippocampal learning and memory investigated in the Morris water maze (MWM) task. To examine the role of dephosphorylation during that model for spatial learning, we analyzed protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) expression in the hippocampus of mice at various stages of the task and in two groups with different learning abilities. METHODS: Mice were trained for 4 days with four trials each day in the MWM. For gene expression hippocampi were prepared 1, 6 and 24 h after the last trial of each day. PP1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: The task requirements themselves affected expression levels of both PP1 and BDNF. In contrast to BDNF, PP1 was differentially expressed during learning. Poorly and well performing mice differed significantly. When performance was poor the expression level of PP1 was higher. CONCLUSION: Present results add further in vivo evidence that not only phosphorylation but also dephosphorylation is a major mechanism involved in learning and memory. Therefore, inhibition of hippocampal phosphatase activity might improve learning and memory.
