OBJECTIVE: To observe the influence of lead exposure on the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in different brain regions of rat. METHODS: By establishing a series of rat models exposed to different low levels of lead (drinking water containing 0.025%, 0.050%, 0.075% of lead acetate) during developing period, NOS activities in hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex and brain stem were studied. RESULTS: On the 21st day after birth, NOS activities in hippocampus of three levels of lead exposed groups [(1.53 +/- 0.20), (1.66 +/- 0.23), (1.88 +/- 0.32) U/mg pro respectively], and in cerebellum [(0.87 +/- 0.24), (0.85 +/- 0.09), (0.91 +/- 0.18) U/mg pro respectively] were significantly lower than those of control group [(2.36 +/- 0.18), (1.41 +/- 0.18) U/mg pro, respectively, P < 0.01]. NOS activities in cerebral cortex of 0.075% group [at 7, 14, 21 d of age [(1.29 +/- 0.14), (1.03 +/- 0.15), (0.69 +/- 0.10) U/mg pro] were significantly lower than those in control group [(2.54 +/- 0.31), (1.64 +/- 0.22), (1.24 +/- 0.14) U/mg pro respectively], and 0.025% group [(2.42 +/- 0.19), (1.59 +/- 0.17), (1.27 +/- 0.12) U/mg pro respectively], and 0.050% group [(2.56 +/- 0.53), (1.77 +/- 0.19), (1.24 +/- 0.10) U/mg pro respectively, P < 0.05]. There were no significant differences among control, 0.025%, and 0.050% groups (P > 0.05). Lead exposure had no influence on NOS activity in brain stem at the same age (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: NOS activities in hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral cortex were inhibited by low level lead exposure and the degree of the effect was related to Pb exposure time and/or level of Pb exposed.
