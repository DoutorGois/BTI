Microinjection of low doses of kainic acid, a neurotoxic analogue of glutammate, in different brain areas (striatum, hippocampus, substantia reticularis pontis) induces neuronal damages in injected and distant areas. Particularly severe neuronal damages have been observed in striatum and CA3 hippocampal area; neuronal degeneration has also been observed in substantia nigra following kainic acid infusion into the substantia reticularis pontis.
