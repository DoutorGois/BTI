This essay illustrates the appearances of sections of the normal hippocampus and adjacent temporal lobe on high-resolution heavily T2-weighted fast spin-echo MR images and correlates them with histologic sections. We found that this MR examination showed the detailed anatomy of the normal hippocampus in a much shorter time than is possible with conventional spin-echo techniques. The information provided in this essay can be used as a baseline for distinguishing between normal and abnormal hippocampi in a variety of disease states.
