Eight kynurenic acid analogues were bath-applied to rat hippocampal slices while recording extracellular synaptic field potentials and the potencies of these analogues for inhibition of these responses were compared to that of kynurenic acid. Quinaldic acid, 4-hydroxyquinoline, 4-hydroxypicolinic acid, L-kynurenine and picolinic acid inhibited evoked field potentials, but were at least 15-fold less potent than kynurenic acid in all pathways tested. Xanthurenic acid was inactive in the pathways tested. Quinolinic acid and dipicolinic acid showed signs of agonist activity with IC50's of approx. 400 microM and 2500 microM, respectively. These studies show that the 2-carboxy group and the 4-hydroxy moiety are essential for the antagonist activity exhibited by kynurenate. They also show that the unsubstituted second aromatic ring greatly enhances the affinity of kynurenate for these receptors and that substitution in at least one position on this aromatic ring abolishes activity.
