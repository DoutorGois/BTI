Proper structuring of neural connections in the hippocampus is mediated by cell adhesion molecules, membrane-linked proteins involved in cell recognition and stabilization of cytoarchitecture. Modulated expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) at the synapse permits plasticity required for both learning and memory. Polysialylation of NCAM, particularly the synapse-specific 180 kDa isoform (NCAM180), allows hippocampal neurons to alter their neuronal connections during learning acquisition and memory consolidation in mature brain. These activity-dependent changes in NCAM expression represent a sensitive target for neurotoxicity. Trimethyltin (TMT), a potent hippocampal neurotoxicant, alters total NCAM expression in whole mouse hippocampus and impairs learning in rodents. To investigate the expression of polysialylated NCAM following TMT administration, Swiss-Webster mice were injected (i.p.) with 2.0 or 3.0 mg TMT/kg and sacrificed 6 hrs to 7 days later. Immunocytochemical staining for polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) revealed marked reduction of staining of hippocampal dentate granule cells 6-72 hours after TMT treatment. Partial recovery of hippocampal polysialylated NCAM was observed after 7 days. Immunoblot data indicated that loss of PSA-NCAM expression paralleled reductions seen in NCAM180 and markers of cytoskeletal integrity. Assays for proteolytic activity in hippocampus revealed rapid, reversible protease activation which correlated temporally with the reduction of NCAM180 and PSA-NCAM. Proteolytic degradation following hippocampal injury may serve to disrupt NCAM-mediated adhesion. Protracted loss of polysialylated NCAM in dentate gyrus following injury may serve as a useful marker in toxicant-induced learning disorders.
