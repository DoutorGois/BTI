Excitotoxic damage represents the major mechanism leading to cell death in many human neurodegenerative diseases such as ischemia, trauma and epilepsy. Caused by an excess of glutamate that acts on metabotropic and ionotropic excitatory receptors, excitotoxicity activates several death signaling pathways leading to an extensive neuronal loss and a consequent strong activation of astrogliosis. Currently, the search for a neuroprotective strategy is aimed to identify the level in the signaling pathways to block excitotoxicity avoiding the loss of important physiological functions and side effects. To this aim, PTEN can be considered an ideal candidate: downstream the excitatory receptors activated in excitotoxicity (whose inhibition was shown to be not clinically viable), it is involved in neuronal damage and in the first stage of the reactive astrogliosis in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated the involvement of PTEN in excitotoxicity through its pharmacological inhibition by dipotassium bisperoxo (picolinato) oxovanadate [bpv(pic)] in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, obtained by intraperitoneal injection of kainate in 2-month-old C57BL/6J male mice. We have demonstrated that inhibition of PTEN by bpv(pic) rescues neuronal death and decreases the reactive astrogliosis in the CA3 area of the hippocampus caused by systemic administration of kainate. Moreover, the neurotoxin administration increases significantly the scanty presence of mitochondrial PTEN that is significantly decreased by the administration of the inhibitor 6 hr after the injection of kainate, suggesting a role of PTEN in mitochondrial apoptosis. Taken together, our results confirm the key role played by PTEN in the excitotoxic damage and the strong anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective potential of its inhibition.
