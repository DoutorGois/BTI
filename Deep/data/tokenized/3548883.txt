Immunohistochemical localization of calcineurin, a calmodulin-stimulated phosphatase, was examined in the rat hippocampus by using a monoclonal antibody VD3 which is specific for the A subunit (61 kDa) of calcineurin. The stratum lucidum, where the mossy fiber terminal forms giant synaptic boutons, showed strong immunoreactivity.
