PKMzeta has been proposed to be essential for maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory (LTM). However, recent data from PKMzeta-knockout mice has called this role into question. Instead, the other atypical isoform, protein kinase C iota/lambda (PKCiota/lambda), has emerged as a potential alternative player. Therefore, the nature of the "memory molecule" maintaining learned information remains uncertain. Here, we report knockdown (KD) of PKCiota/lambda and PKMzeta in the dorsal hippocampus and find deficits in early expression and late maintenance, respectively, during both LTP and hippocampus-dependent LTM. Sequential increases in the active form of PKCiota/lambda and PKMzeta are detected during LTP or fear conditioning. Importantly, PKMzeta, but not PKCiota/lambda, KD disrupts previously established LTM. Thus, PKCiota/lambda and PKMzeta have distinct functions in LTP and memory, with PKMzeta playing a specific role in memory maintenance. This relaying pattern may represent a precise molecular mechanism by which atypical PKCs regulate the different stages of memory.
