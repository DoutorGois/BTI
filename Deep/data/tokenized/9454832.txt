To determine their roles in the assembly of glutamatergic postsynaptic sites, we studied the distributions of NMDA- and AMPA-type glutamate receptors; the NMDA receptor-interacting proteins alpha-actinin-2, PSD-95, and chapsyn; and the PSD-95-associated protein GKAP during the development of hippocampal neurons in culture. NMDA receptors first formed nonsynaptic proximal dendrite shaft clusters within 2-5 d. AMPA receptors were diffuse at this stage and began to cluster on spines at 9-10 d. NMDA receptor clusters remained partially nonsynaptic and mainly distinct from AMPA receptor clusters until after 3 weeks in culture, when the two began to colocalize at spiny synaptic sites. Thus, the localization of NMDA and AMPA receptors must be regulated by different mechanisms. alpha-Actinin-2 colocalized with the NMDA receptor only at spiny synaptic clusters, but not at shaft nonsynaptic or synaptic clusters, suggesting a modulatory role in the anchoring of NMDA receptor at spines. PSD-95, chapsyn, and GKAP were present at some, but not all, nonsynaptic NMDA receptor clusters during the first 2 weeks, indicating that none is essential for NMDA receptor cluster formation. When NMDA receptor clusters became synaptic, PSD-95 and GKAP were always present, consistent with an essential function in synaptic localization of NMDA receptors. Furthermore, PSD-95 and GKAP clustered opposite presynaptic terminals several days before either NMDA or AMPA receptors clustered at these presumptive postsynaptic sites. These results suggest that synapse development proceeds by formation of a postsynaptic scaffold containing PSD-95 and GKAP in concert with presynaptic vesicle clustering, followed by regulated attachment of glutamate receptor subtypes to this scaffold.
