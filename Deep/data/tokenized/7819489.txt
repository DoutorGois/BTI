Apparatus and methods were developed to enable mechanically facilitated cell-cell electrofusion to be performed. The apparatus and methods mechanically place cells in contact before fusion. The key component of this fusion system was a newly developed fusion chamber. The chamber was composed of two functionally identical electrodes that were housed in a multi-layer structure. The layers functioned as support for the electrodes. They also allowed adjustment of the distance between opposing electrode faces. The electrodes were constructed in a manner that allowed cells to be deposited, by vacuum, onto each face. Electrode faces were positioned at a predetermined distance from each other to mechanically force cell-cell contact between the deposited cells. Fusion was induced by delivering direct current pulses to the juxtaposed cells. Fusion products were detected and quantitated by flow cytometry. Details of the chamber design and a protocol for using the fusion chamber are given. Mechanically facilitated cell-cell electrofusion was demonstrated by using the chamber to produce fusion products from like fusion partners. The practical applicability of the chamber was demonstrated by fusing unlike cell types. Mechanically facilitated cell-cell electrofusion is not specific to the cells used in this study; the chamber can be adapted for use with other cell types.
