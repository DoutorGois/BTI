OBJECTIVE: To investigate the delayed alteration of hippocampus proteome after anesthesia with isoflurane in adult and aged rats. METHODS: Ten 8-month-old SD rats were randomly divided into group C adult and group I adult (5 in each group), and another ten 22-month-old SD rats were randomly divided into group C aged and group I aged (5 in each group).The rats in group I adult and group I aged received 2 h anesthesia with 1.2% isoflurane. The rats in group C adult and group C aged inhaled 40% oxygen for contrast. The hippocampal proteome of each rat was measured by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The vital signs of the rats in group I adult and group I aged were stable. There were 878+/-34 protein spots in group C adult, 864+/-49 protein spots in group I adult, 834+/-47 in group C aged, and 819+/-24 in group I aged. There were 12(4/8)different protein spots between group I adult and group C adult. There were 11(3/8)different protein spots between group I aged and group C aged. All of the protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. Most of the different proteins were related to metabolism, anti-oxidation, and signal conditioning of synapse. CONCLUSION: Isoflurane may cause the alteration of hippocampal proteome in rats, which is age-related.
