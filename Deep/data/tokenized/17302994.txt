AIM: To investigate the effect of jujuboside A (JuA) on modulating gene expression in the hippocampus. METHODS: The spontaneous activity of mice was monitored, and the differential display polymerase chain reaction was adapted to screen differentially-expressed genes modulated by JuA in the mouse hippocampus. RESULTS: JuA significantly decreased the total activity intensity (P<0.01 vs control) at a dosage of 80 mg/kg, and the genes MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase3 (Mark3) and retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein1 (Rpgrip1) were upregulated by JuA in the mouse hippocampus. CONCLUSION: JuA had an inhibitory effect on the spontaneous activity of the mice, and JuA regulated the transcription of Mark3 and Rpgrip1 in the mouse hippocampus.
