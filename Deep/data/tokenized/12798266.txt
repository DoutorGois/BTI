The role of brain somatostatin (SST) on memory function after olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) was investigated by using the passive-avoidance task and immunohistochemical analyses in mice. The present study indicated that the learning and memory-related behaviour was impaired on the 7th and 14th day, but not on the 1st day after OBX. The impairment of learning and memory-related behaviour on the 14th day after OBX was dose-dependently reversed by intracerebroventricularly administered SST (1 microg per mouse). To ascertain the correlation between SST in mouse brain and the impairment of learning and memory-related behaviour induced by OBX, the immunohistochemical distribution of brain SST was determined by fluorescence intensity using two-dimensional microphotometry. The intensity of SST fluorescence was low in the hippocampus on the 14th day after OBX in comparison with Sham controls. These results suggest that SST in the hippocampus is related to the impairment of learning and memory-related behaviour induced by OBX.
