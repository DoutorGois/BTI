In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest antiepileptic properties for NPY. In this study, the pharmacology of these effects was examined and compared in different rat models of seizures. Agonists for Y(1), Y(2) and Y(5) receptors reduced seizure-like activity in hippocampal cultures. Intracerebral injection of NPY or Y(5) agonists reduced the expression of focal seizures produced by a single electrical stimulation of the hippocampus. Conversely, NPY agonists increased the duration of generalized convulsive seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol. These results suggest that NPY reduces seizures of hippocampal origin through activation of Y(5) receptors. They also point to probable modulatory effects of NPY in brain structures other than the hippocampus, involved in initiation, propagation or control of seizures.
