Our previous studies suggested that a direct hippocampo-cerebellar projection might exist in the chicken. To confirm such a presumption of hippocampo-cerebellar interactions, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as a retrograde tracer to be injected into the white matter of the folia VI-VIII of the cerebellum in young and adult chickens. In another set of experiments, young chickens were subjected to electrolytic lesions of the hippocampal formation (HF), especially the ventromedial portion, and the cerebellum was observed with the electron microscope to find neuronal degeneration in the HF. Following injections of HRP into the cerebellum, a large number of labeled neurons were found in the area APHm-APHim of the HF in the young and adult chickens. As a result of the electrolytic lesions of the APHm-APHim in the HF, many large degenerated nerve fibers were found in the white matter in the vicinity of the lateral nucleus of the cerebellum, and some small degenerated fibers were found in the white matter of the folia VI-VIII. In the cerebellar cortex of folia VI-VIII, degenerated axonal terminals occurred in both the molecular and Purkinje layers, but not in the granular layer. In the lateral nucleus, some dark degenerating axonal terminals were recognized to connect with the perikarya of neurons of this nucleus. The present experiments demonstrate that the APHm-APHim of the HF directly projected to the cortex of folia VI-VIII and the lateral nucleus of the cerebellum in young chickens.
