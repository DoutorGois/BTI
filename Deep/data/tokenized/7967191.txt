N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), electroencephalography (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in 19 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy during interictal stage. MRI demonstrated abnormal signal in mesial temporal lobe (hippocampus) in 10 of 19 patients and 123I-IMP SPECT showed a hypoperfusion area in 15 of 19 patients. When compared with EEG and MRI data, disagreement of the affected area was observed in 3 cases. In comparison of EEG and 123I-IMP SPECT data, disagreement of the affected area was observed in 6 cases. Although there were no disagreement in comparison of MRI and 123I-IMP SPECT. We made a reprojection data parallel to the hippocampus in 123I-IMP SPECT. These data demonstrated obviously a hypoperfusion area around the hippocampus. In cases within one month from seizure attack, wide hypoperfusion area was showed on 123I-IMP SPECT in comparison of abnormal signal area on MRI. It could be considered that a reprojection data parallel to the hippocampus was useful to know extent of hypoperfusion area in temporal lobe epilepsy.
