The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of two periods of life, namely P28 and P360, on the changes in interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) immunoreactivity (-ir) in the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, DG) and amygdala (central-CeA, medial-MeA) caused by acute and repeated open field (OF), or by forced swim (FS) exposition. Rats were divided into groups: non-stressed, exposed to acute (one-time for 15 min) and chronic stressors (21 days for 15 min daily). We found IL-1beta-ir in the control group to be higher in P360 than in P28. In P28, under OF and FS exposure, IL-1beta-ir in the CeA remained unaltered but increased in the MeA and in the hippocampus after acute and chronic stress. In P360 no changes were observed in the IL-1beta-ir level after acute and chronic stimulation. These data demonstrate that only the levels of IL-1beta-ir in juvenile rat brains are affected by FS and OF. Additionally, there was no significant difference between FS and OF stimulation in IL-1beta-ir.
