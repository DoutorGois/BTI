To isolate genes differentially expressed in the rat brain cortex and cerebellum, a subtractive cDNA cloning procedure requiring only small quantities of poly(A+) RNA, followed by differential screening, was used. Two novel genes, MK and 3L7, with cortex- and cerebellum-specific expression were identified. These genes displayed different expression patterns in the brain cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus during postnatal development.
