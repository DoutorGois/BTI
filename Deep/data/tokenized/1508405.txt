Release of endogenous norepinephrine was detected in guinea pig hippocampal slices using a radioligand displacement assay. Focal electrical stimulation released endogenous norepinephrine and caused a calcium-dependent reduction in specific [3H]propranolol binding at beta-adrenergic receptors in the brain slice. The mu-opioid agonist PL017 decreased norepinephrine release, and the inhibition by PL017 could be blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone. Endogenous opioid peptides concomitantly released by tissue stimulation also decreased norepinephrine release in a naloxone-sensitive manner. These results support the hypothesis that endogenous opioids can regulate excitability in the hippocampus by presynaptic modulation of norepinephrine release.
