Hippocampal (relational memory) and prefrontal cortex (PFC; working memory) impairments have been found in patients with schizophrenia (SP), possibly due to a dysfunctional connection between structures. Neuroanatomical studies that describe reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the uncinate fasciculus support this idea. The dysconnection hypothesis in SP was investigated by examining frontotemporal anatomical connectivity (uncinate fasciculus FA) and PFC-hippocampal memory and their relationship with each other and everyday functioning. PFC-hippocampal memory was examined with two working-relational memory tasks: transverse patterning and a virtual Morris water task. SP exhibited a performance deficit on both tasks and had lower FA in bilateral uncinate fasciculus than healthy volunteers. Lower frontotemporal anatomical connectivity was related to lower working-relational memory performance, and both predicted worse everyday functioning.
