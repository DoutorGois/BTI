Corticosterone induces neuroanatomical and neurochemical changes in the hippocampus that are associated with cognitive impairments. In the present study corticosterone induced cell death in primary hippocampal neurons cultured in Neurobasal + B27 medium. Insulin prevents neuronal cell death induced in a concentration dependent manner. The neuroprotective effect of insulin was reversed by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3 kinase) inhibitor, whereas the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD98059, an upstream blocker of MAPK had no effect. Western blot analyses showed that insulin induced the activation of protein kinase B (Akt). These results suggest that insulin can prevent neuronal cell death induced by corticosterone in hippocampal neurons by modulating the activity of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway.
