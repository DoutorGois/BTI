Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia associated with progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Extracellular beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a major constituent of senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Abeta deposition causes neuronal death via a number of possible mechanisms such as increasing oxidative stress. Therefore therapeutic approaches to identify novel Abeta aggregate reducers could be effective for AD treatment. Using a Trx-His-Abeta biochemical assay, we screened 11 synthetic indolylquinoline compounds, and found NC009-1, -2, -6 and -7 displaying potential to reduce Abeta aggregation. Treating Tet-On Abeta-GFP 293 cells with these compounds reduced Abeta aggregation and reactive oxygen species. These compounds also promoted neurite outgrowth in Tet-On Abeta-GFP SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, treatment with above compounds improved neuronal cell viability, neurite outgrowth, and synaptophysin expression level in mouse hippocampal primary culture under oligomeric Abeta-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, the tested NC009-1 significantly ameliorated Abeta-induced inhibition of hippocampal long-term potentiation in mouse hippocampal slices. Our results demonstrate how synthetic indolylquinoline compounds are likely to work as chemical chaperones in Abeta-aggregation reduction and neuroprotection, providing insight into the possible applications of indolylquinoline compounds in AD treatment.
