We examined hippocampal contribution to remote spatial memory in older adults by correlating their performance on tests sensitive to hippocampal damage with their description of routes they traversed many times or only once, and with their map-like knowledge of downtown Toronto. We found that performance on table-top tests of spatial location (Smith and Milner (1981) Neuropsychologia 19:781-793) and on paired-associate learning, and the number of Internal Details on the Autobiographical Interview (Levine et al., (2002) Psychol Aging 17:677-689), all correlated significantly with the number and type of perceptual details used in describing routes one has traversed, but not with map-like knowledge of Toronto. No significant correlations were found with performance on tests of frontal function (WCST, phonemic fluency, and backward digit span). We conclude that the hippocampus is implicated in vivid re-experiencing of a familiar route, but not with map-like knowledge of a large-scale environment. These findings are interpreted as consistent with Multiple Trace Theory's prediction that it is the degree of detail of a retrieved memory that is crucially dependent on the hippocampus.
