Depolarization induced in rat hippocampal slices by a high concentration of extracellular K+ leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein MAP2. The comparison of the major phosphopeptides derived from in situ and in vitro phosphorylated MAP2 suggests the implication of calcium-dependent protein kinases, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II and protein kinase C, in the up-phosphorylation of MAP2. In particular, a peptide containing the tubulin-binding domain of the MAP2 molecule may be phosphorylated by protein kinase C. As the association of MAP2 with the cytoskeleton may be regulated by phosphorylation, we suggest that changes in the phosphorylation level of MAP2 might be involved in synaptic remodelling in hippocampal neurons.
