Participation of the hippocampus in morpho-functional systems of delayed spatial choice and differentiation of trace reflexes to time was shown in 2 macaco rhesus by the method of phase-correlational analysis. Application of 0.05 per cent solution of amysyl into the hippocampus disturbed the behaviour of monkeys, probably, as a result of desintegration of entire morpho-functional system regulating spatial-temporal sequence of nervous processes of delayed behavioural act.
