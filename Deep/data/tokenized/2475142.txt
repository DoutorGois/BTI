The contents of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their primary acid metabolites were assayed in ten brain regions of the selectively bred high-alcohol drinking (HAD) and low-alcohol drinking (LAD) lines of rats. Compared with the LAD line, the contents of 5-HT and/or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were approximately 10-20% (p less than 0.05) lower in several brain regions of the HAD line (cerebral cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, septal nuclei, hippocampus and hypothalamus). The levels of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid were also 10-20% lower in the nucleus accumbens and anterior striatum (p less than 0.05) of the HAD animals. These data are in agreement with previous findings that comparatively lower levels in 5-HT and DA systems are associated with high-alcohol drinking in rodents and support the involvement of certain 5-HT and DA pathways in the mediation of alcohol drinking behavior.
