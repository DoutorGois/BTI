Since the inflammatory process develops after transplantation to the brain, we sought to determine the presence of cytokines following a surgical trauma to the brain of an adult mouse. We report the early and marked presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 alpha in neuronal somata of the striatum following a surgical injury to the hippocampus. The expression of cytokines later extends to neuronal cells of the hippocampus, thalamus, cerebral cortex, brain stem, and cerebellum and to glial cells of the corpus callosum. By contrast, these cytokines are not expressed by neuronal cells following injury to other regions, such as the striatum, cerebellum, and cortex. This study suggests a possible role for certain neurons in the brain's early reaction to a penetrating injury.
