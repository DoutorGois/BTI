The dentate gyrus (DG) has distinct roles along its dorso-ventral axis. In the mouse, we recently demonstrated that dorsal DG (dDG) stimulation enhances exploratory behavior (Kheirbek et al., 2013). Dopamine (DA) release in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc), which belongs to the reward system, could be a key target of dDG mediating this motivation-related behavior. Here, an optogenetic stimulation of either ventral (vDG) or dDG granule cells was coupled with NAcc DA release monitoring using in vivo microdialysis. Only dDG stimulation enhanced NAcc DA release, indicating differential interconnections between dDG and vDG to the reward system.
