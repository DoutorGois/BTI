Prolyl endopeptidase-like immunoreactivity (PEP-LI) was detected and compared with amyloid beta-peptide-like immunoreactivity (A beta-LI) in the brains of senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM). Granular structures of PEP-LI in the hippocampus appeared progressively, and age- and strain-dependently to form deposits which distributed morphologically similar and closely to those of A beta-LI. These results suggest that PEP has functional relevance to amyloidgenesis in brains of SAM.
