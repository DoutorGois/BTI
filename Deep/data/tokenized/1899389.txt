A recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) was used to express functional Drosophila Shaker H4 K+ channels in primary cell cultures from rat heart (atrial and ventricular myocytes, fibroblasts), autonomic ganglia (SCG neurons) and CNS (hippocampal neurons, cerebral astroglia). In most cells the expressed currents possessed the typical characteristics of the native Drosophila muscle A currents; a few cells showed evidence of hetero-oligomers with new properties. The maximum current density corresponded to a channel density of 2-3/microns 2. Voltage recordings in heart cells showed altered action potential waveforms after successful infection. VV vectors thus are useful for studying altered excitability and cell-specific processing of ion channel proteins.
