Brain-specific chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan (PG) DSD-1-PG/6B4-PG/phosphacan isolated from neonatal mouse brains exhibits neurite outgrowth-promoting activity toward embryonic rat and mouse hippocampal neurons in vitro through the so-called DSD-1 epitope embedded in its glycosaminoglycan side chains. Oversulfated CS variants, CS-D from shark cartilage and CS-E from squid cartilage, also possess similar activities. We have proposed that the neuritogenic property of the DSD-1 epitope may be attributable to a distinct CS structure characterized by the disulfated D disaccharide unit [GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)]. In this study, we assessed neuritogenic potencies of various oversulfated dermatan sulfate (DS) preparations purified from hagfish notochord, the bodies of two kinds of ascidians and embryonic sea urchin, which are characterized by the predominant disulfated disaccharide units of [IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)] (68%), [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S)] (66%) plus [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S)] (5%), [IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc (6S)] (>90%), and [IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S)] (74%), respectively. They exerted marked neurite outgrowth-promoting activities, resulting in distinct morphological features depending on the individual structural features. Such activities were not observed for a less sulfated DS preparation derived from porcine skin, which has a monosulfated disaccharide unit [IdoUA-Gal-NAc(4S)] as a predominant unit. The neurite outgrowth-promoting activities of these oversulfated DS preparations and DSD-1-PG were eliminated by the specific enzymatic cleavage of GalNAc-IdoUA linkages characteristic of DS using chondroitinase B. In addition, chemical analysis of the glycosaminoglycan side chains of DSD-1-PG revealed the DS-type structures. These observations suggest potential novel neurobiological functions of oversulfated DS structures and may reflect the physiological neuritogenesis during brain development by mammalian oversulfated DS structures exemplified by the DSD-1 epitope.
