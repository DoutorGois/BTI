Previous studies show that stress cross-sensitizes with or alters amphetamine (AMPH) effects in male rats; however, few studies include females. We investigated combining daily restraint stress (21 days for 6 h/day) with chronic AMPH (10 injections every other day) on locomotor activity, exploratory activity in an open field and object recognition, a memory task, in female rats. A synaptic protein, synaptophysin, was also quantified by radioimmunocytochemistry (RICC) in brain to determine possible mechanisms for behavioral changes. Beginning at 5 days after cessation of treatments, AMPH increased locomotion, modified exploration, impaired object recognition, and increased serum corticosterone (CORT) levels. Stress did not alter these parameters but blocked AMPH effects on exploration and object recognition, potentiated AMPH-dependent locomotor effects, and did not alter increased CORT levels. AMPH treatment decreased synatophysin expression in the hippocampus. In the caudate nucleus, the AMPH group showed increased synaptophysin expression which was reversed by stress. These results in females corroborate previously shown cross-sensitizations between stress and AMPH for locomotion in males and demonstrate that chronic stress counteracts AMPH-dependent impairments in recognition memory. Stress may counteract AMPH effects on the memory task by blocking both the induction of AMPH anxiety-like effects and neuroplastic changes in the caudate nucleus of female rats.
