Two potent glutamate antagonists, NBQX and GYKI 52466, that act selectively on non-NMDA receptors, have been tested for anticonvulsant activity in 3 models of reflex epilepsy (sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice and in genetically epilepsy-prone rats and photically-induced myoclonus in Papio papio) and in amygdala kindled rats. Both compounds potently but transiently suppress reflexly-induced epileptic responses. GYKI 52466 also reduces behavioral seizures and afterdischarge duration in amygdala kindled rats, but with a lower potency than it suppresses reflex epilepsy. These data are similar to earlier results with antagonists acting selectively on NMDA receptors; they do not support a specific involvement of enhanced AMPA receptor sensitivity as a major factor in the expression of kindled seizures.
