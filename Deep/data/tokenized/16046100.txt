The ketogenic diet (KD) increased the expression of calbindin-D(28k) (CB) in the interneurons of the hippocampus compared with the normal diet (ND)-fed mice. Also, 2 days after kainic acid (KA) administration, numerous CB-expressing astrocytes were found in the KD-fed mice compared with those of the ND-fed mice. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of the KD on the KA-induced toxicity may be, in part, mediated via an increased expression of CB.
