Soluble proline endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) activity was measured by a fluorometric assay in eight human brain areas (caudate nucleus, lateral globus pallidus, medial globus pallidus, substantia nigra-zona compacta, substantia nigra-zona reticulata, frontal cortex-Brodmann area 10, temporal cortex-Brodmann area 38, and hippocampus), in 10 control and 10 Huntington's disease brains. An abnormally low activity (22% of control activity) was found in the caudate nucleus of Huntington's disease brains; significantly decreased activity was also detected in the lateral globus pallidus and medial globus pallidus (37% and 40% of control, respectively).
