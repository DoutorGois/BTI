The present study was conducted to explore whether or not manganese effect on brain monoamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.4) is subject to hereditary genetic amplification. Mice of both sexes were given manganese through four generations, and the enzyme activity was measured in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and hippocampus of each of the generations except for the third, whose activity we were not in a position to measure. Intrinsic enzyme activity was highest in the cerebellum, and was followed by those in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus. The activity in the hippocampus was the lowest. Manganese administration greatly stimulated the activity in the cerebellum. However, as generation succeeded, the level of susceptibility to manganese gradually declined. Manganese concentration in pooled suborgan fractions proved to be, in every case, higher in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus and lower in the hypothalamus. No indication was found that the manganese effect is genetically inherited.
