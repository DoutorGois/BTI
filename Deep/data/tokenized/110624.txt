In chronic experiments on monkeys and cats, the effects of intracerebral micropolarization modulating memory processes, on the mV potential of cerebral structures, were studied. A connection was revealed between trace fixing and processes of systemic kindling on the one hand, and the following stabilizing of mV potential, on the other hand. The data obtained suggest that the distant changes of the mV potential reflect a general "tuning" of cerebral systems, are realized by means of specialized regulatory neuronal networks and connected with shifts in metabolic processes.
