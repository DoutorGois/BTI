Dendritic recordings of the rat hippocampal formation were used to assess the ability of ethanol to inhibit the induction of synaptic plasticity due to bath application of the K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA). Brief application of TEA resulted in the enhancement of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope by an average of 26 +/- 3% over the pre-TEA baseline. However, coapplication of TEA and ethanol (100 mM) resulted in enhancement of only 10 +/- 2% of the EPSP slope. These data suggest that LTP (long-term potentiation) due to the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is also inhibited by ethanol.
