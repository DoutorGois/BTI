BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is not completely clear and therapies are limited now. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the possible pathogenesis and preventive approach of CIRI through analyzing changes of aspartate (Asp), glutamate (Glu), mitochondrial calcium (MCa), calmodulin (CaM), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and ultramicropathology in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of ischemic susceptible injured regions and the effect of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside (GM1) in the rat model of CIRI. METHODS: Contents of Asp, Glu, MCa, CaM, and MDA in hippocampus and cerebral cortex tissues were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography, atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and ordinary spectrophotometer, respectively, changes of ultramicrostructure in neurons of the hippocampus CA1 region and frontal cerebral cortex were observed by a transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: Contents of Asp and Glu in hippocampus and cerebral cortex tissues of CIRI groups significantly decreased and contents of MCa, CaM, and MDA significantly increased than those in control groups, and the ultramicrostructure in neurons of the hippocampus CA1 region and frontal cerebral cortex revealed a significant damaged change, and GM1 significantly ameliorated changes of Asp, Glu, MCa, CaM, and MDA contents in hippocampus and ultrastructural changes in neurons of the hippocampus CA1 region and frontal cerebral cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further support that the abnormal release and/or reuptake of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, the disordered calcium homeostasis and the excessive production and/or reduced elimination of reactive oxygen species contribute to the pathogenesis of CIRI, and GM1 can partially prevent these pathogenesises to exert the protective effect on CIRI.
