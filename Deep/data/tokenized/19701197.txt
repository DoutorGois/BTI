The transcriptional program that controls adult neurogenesis is unknown. We generated mice with an inducible stem cell-specific deletion of Neurod1, resulting in substantially fewer newborn neurons in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Thus, Neurod1 is cell-intrinsically required for the survival and maturation of adult-born neurons.
