The literature concerning the developmental neuropathology of organotins is reviewed. To date, neuropathological effects have been convincingly demonstrated for trimethyltin (TMT) and triethyltin (TET). Both compounds may damage the developing CNS; however they have different cellular targets. TMT is a neuronotoxin which damages areas of the limbic system, cerebral cortex, and brainstem. TET is a myelinotoxin which causes massive myelinic edema by yet undetermined mechanisms. Neuronal death is also seen following TET intoxication during the neonatal period, possibly as a result of elevated intracranial pressure. The neuropathological features of TMT and TET intoxication during early life are presented. Neurochemical and behavioral alterations resulting from congenital and/or neonatal exposure to organotins are also discussed.
