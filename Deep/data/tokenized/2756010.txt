The effect of epileptogenic lesion of amygdala on spatial working memory was examined in rats after unilateral (U, n = 9) or bilateral (B, n = 8) injection of 1 or 0.5 mu of 0.2% kainate into the amygdaloid complex. Another group of unilaterally lesioned rats (T, n = 9) received 8 days after kainate injection grafts of embryonal (E 20) amygdala into the damaged region. Twelve days after lesion the three experimental groups and an unoperated control group (C, n = 11) were trained during three weeks in the aversively motivated 8-arm radial water maze (RWM). Training decreased incidence of errors/8 choices from the initial 2.3 to 1.2 in the lesioned rats and to 0.4 in the controls. Transplantation did not enhance RWM acquisition but restored the symmetrical pattern of choices and normalized the emotionality of lesioned animals. Retraining the RWM task 3 months later revealed significant savings in the control group but not in the transplanted group. Histology showed in addition to large lesion at the injection site also distant lesions in the ipsilateral hippocampus, thalamus and neocortex and in the unilaterally injected rats also in the contralateral amygdala. Healthy, well integrated transplants found in 6 out of 9 transplanted rats reduced the incidence of remote lesions (particularly in the contralateral hemisphere). Performance of individual animals reflected the state of the transplant. It is concluded that the impairment of spatial working memory is due not only to destruction of amygdala but also to diffuse damage of the limbic system. The slowly developing seizure-induced distant lesions can be partly prevented by embryonal grafts.
