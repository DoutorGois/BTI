EFHC1, a gene mutated in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, encodes EFHC1, a protein with three DM10 domains and one EF-hand motif. We recently demonstrated that this molecule is a microtubule-associated protein (MAP) implicated in neuronal migration. Because some controversies persist about the precise localization in the CNS, we studied the neuroanatomical distribution of EFHC1 in mature and developing mouse brain. In the adult, low mRNA expression was detected in several brain structures such as cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum. At E16, EFHC1 mRNA was shown to be expressed in cortex and not only in cells lining ventricles. Using a purified polyclonal antibody, EFHC1 staining was observed in all cortical layers, in piriform cortex, in hippocampus and in Purkinje cells of cerebellum. In the cortex, the majority of EFHC1 positive cells correspond to neurons, however some glial cells were also stained. In agreement with a previous study, we demonstrated strong EFHC1 expression in cilia of ependymal cells lining cerebral ventricles. Moreover, at E16, the protein was observed at the borders of brain ventricles, in choroid plexus, but also, although to a lesser extent, in piriform and neocortex. In these latter structures, the pattern of expression seems to correspond to the extensions of the radial glia fibers as demonstrated by BLBP immunostaining. Finally, we confirmed that EFHC1 was also expressed and co-localized with the mitotic spindle of neural stem cells. These results confirm that EFHC1 is a protein with a likely low expression level in mouse brain but detectable both in adult and embryonic brain supporting our previous data and hypothesis that EFHC1 could play an important role during brain development. As discussed, this opens the door to a new conceptual approach viewing some idiopathic generalized epilepsies as developmental diseases instead of classical channelopathies.
