Administration of corticoliberin to dorsal hippocampus through implanted chemotrodes decreased the number of positive salivary conditioned and unconditioned reflexes, enhanced their variability, reduced motor activity and food excitability, decreased the pulse and respiration rate, enhanced the contents of cortisol, vasopressin, catecholamines in the blood of dogs. Behavioral, vegetative and endocrine shifts induced by corticoliberin, varied in their duration and markedness. This was particularly obvious in endocrine phenomena.
