Dbn1 is a newly discovered gene in the drebrin gene family of mice. Previous studies have reported that Dbn1 is specifically expressed in the mouse brain suggesting its potential role in brain development. However, a detailed analysis of Dbn1 expression during mouse brain development has not been demonstrated. Here, we describe the expression pattern of Dbn1 and the coexpression of Dbn1 and actin during the development of the mouse brain from embryonic day 14 (E14) to adulthood and during the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs), as determined using immunohistochemistry, double-labeling immunofluorescence, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. During mouse brain development, Dbn1 expression level was high at E14, attenuated postnatally, reached its highest point at postnatal day 7 (P7), and showed a very low level at adulthood. Imaging data showed that Dbn1 was mainly expressed in the hippocampus, ventricular zone, and cortex, where NSCs are densely distributed, and that the intracellular distribution of Dbn1 was predominantly located in the cytoplasm edges and neurites. Moreover, the signal for colocalization of Dbn1 with actin was intense at E14, P0, and P7, but it was weak at adulthood. During NSC differentiation, Dbn1 mRNA expression increased after the onset of differentiation and reached its highest point at 3days, followed by a decrease in expression. The imaging data showed that Dbn1 was increasingly expressed in the extending neurites in accordance with the cell morphological changes that occur during differentiation. Furthermore, obvious colocalization signals of Dbn1 with actin were found in the neurites and dendritic spines. Collectively, these results suggest that Dbn1 may play a key role in mouse brain development and may regulate NSC differentiation by filamentous actin.
