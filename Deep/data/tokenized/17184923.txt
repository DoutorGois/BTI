We investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), an endocrine disrupter on learning behavior and synaptic functions. Specifically, we determined the activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and related kinases that play an essential role in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus in mice that were prenatally exposed to DES. Treatment with DES resulted in increased CaMKII autophosphorylation and Ca(2+)-independent activity in the hippocampus and cortex of male mice. Impaired passive avoidance correlated with this increased CaMKII autophosphorylation, as did the enhanced early phase of LTP (E-LTP) in hippocampus. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to DES induces deficits in passive avoidance responses as a result of increased CaMKII activity and hippocampal LTP.
