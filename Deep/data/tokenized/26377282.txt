BACKGROUNDS: Valproic acid (VPA) has been reported to have survival and neuroprotective effects in a cardiac arrest rat model. This study was designed to investigate the effect of VPA combined with therapeutic hypothermia (HT) in an asphyxial cardiac arrest rat model. METHODS: Rats were subjected to 6 minutes of asphyxial cardiac arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed and then the randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups (normal saline [NS]/normothermia [NT], VPA/NT, NS/HT, and VPA/HT). Hypothermia (32.5 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C, 4 hours of HT and 2 hours of rewarming) or NT (37 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C for 6 hours) was applied, and VPA (300 mg/kg) or NS was administered immediately after the return of spontaneous circulation. Neurologic deficit score was measured, and a tape removal test was performed for 3 days. Histologic injury of hippocampus was evaluated. RESULTS: Valproic acid significantly improved neurologic deficit score at 48 and 72 hours in the NT-treated rats and at 72 hours in the HT-treated rats (all P < .05). Although the latency and success rate were not significantly different between the VPA/NT and NS/NT groups, the VPA/HT group showed significantly lower latency and higher success rates compared to the NS/HT group (P < .05). The histologic injury score in the hippocampal CA1 sector was significantly lower in the VPA/NT group than the NS/NT group (P < .05) and showed a tendency to be decreased in the VPA/HT group compared with the NS/HT group (P = .06). CONCLUSION: In an asphyxial cardiac arrest rat model, administration of VPA improved neurologic outcomes and added a neuroprotective effect to HT.
