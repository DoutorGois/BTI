Cytokines have been shown to be induced following a variety of central nervous system (CNS) insults, and may play a role in the pathophysiological sequelae of CNS injury. In the present study, we characterized the regional expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA in specific brain regions following experimental lateral fluid-percussion traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 42) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and subjected to lateral fluid-percussion brain injury of moderate severity (2.4 atm.) centered over the left parietal cortex, or 'sham' treatment (anesthesia and surgery without injury). Animals were sacrificed at 1, 6 and 24 h post injury, brains were removed, and tissue samples of left (injured) parietal cortex (LC), corresponding area in the contralateral right cortex (RC), cortex adjacent to injured parietal cortex (LA), corresponding adjacent area in the right cortex (RA), left hippocampus (LH) and right hippocampus (RH) were prepared. Total RNA was isolated and Northern blot hybridization was performed and the quantity of brain tissue IL-1 beta mRNA is presented as percent relative radioactivity of IL-1 beta positive macrophage RNA which was loaded on same gel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
