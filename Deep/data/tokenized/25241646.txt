Increasing evidence demonstrates that local inflammation contributes to neuronal death following cerebral ischemia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activation has been reported to exhibit many pharmacological effects including anti-inflammatory functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate on the behavioral dysfunction induced by global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (GCI/R) injury in rats. The present study showed that fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal death, and improved memory impairment and hippocampal neurogenesis after GCI/R. Fenofibrate administration also inhibited GCI/R-induced over-activation of microglia but not astrocytes and prevented up-regulations of pro-inflammatory mediators in hippocampus. Further study demonstrated that treatment with fenofibrate suppressed GCI/R-induced activations of P65 NF-kappaB and P38 MAPK. Our data suggest that the PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate can exert functional recovery of memory deficits and neuroprotective effect against GCI/R in rats via triggering of neurogenesis and anti-inflammatory effect mediated by inhibiting activation of P65 NF-kappaB and P38 MAPK in the hippocampus, which can contribute to improvement in neurological deficits.
