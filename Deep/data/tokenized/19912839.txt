Multiple and specific DNA-protein interactions are demonstrated within a 3.8-kb DNA fragment encompassing the rat preprotachykinin A (PPT) promoter. The majority of the interactions observed were present in all cell extracts examined. However, one site of interaction that occurs 3' of the major transcriptional start displays a neuronal specificity in its tissue distribution. This site is located approximately at the intron 1/exon 1 boundary. The protein that recognizes this site was present in extracts from neuronal tissue (cerebellum, hippocampus, and spinal cord) and was also present in the PC 12 cell line which is derived from a rat pheochromocytoma. Binding to this 3' element was not observed in extracts from spleen and the nonneuronal-derived cell lines HeLa and 293.
