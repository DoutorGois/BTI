Intracerebroventricular injection of glycine elevated the level and synthesis rate of acetylcholine and the activity of choline acetyltransferase in the striatum. Administration of strychnine alone did not change these parameters, but pretreatment with strychnine abolished the stimulatory effect of glycine on the cholinergic system of the rat striatum. Separate or combined administration of strychnine and glycine did not affect the striatal acetylcholinesterase activity. The drugs did not produce any changes in the cholinergic system indices in the hippocampus.
