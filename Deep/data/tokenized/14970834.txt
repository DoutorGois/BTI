Cytokines are a large and diverse group of polypeptides that are rapidly released in response to tissue injury, infection, and inflammation. Besides their effects in the periphery, cytokines also affect the central nervous system (CNS). There has been increasing interest in the potential role of cytokines in the behavioral features of depressive disorders. One cytokine that might be a candidate for a role in the etiology of depression is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF mRNA has been detected in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and basal forebrain nuclei. The role of LIF in the CNS has not been fully elucidated. Based upon the hypothesis that cytokines might have a role in depression, the present study characterized the behavior of mice with a targeted disruption of the LIF gene (LIF knockouts) in the forced swim test, an animal model used to measure depressive-like behavior and the response to antidepressants. It was found that LIF knockout mice show reduced immobility in the forced swim test, suggesting that LIF might have a potential role in the etiology of some forms of depression.
