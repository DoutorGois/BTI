The purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of ischemia on postischemic metabolic activity of the brain. Furthermore, the effect of preischemic application of neuroprotective agents such as flunarizine or phencyclidine on postischemic local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was examined. Forebrain ischemia in the rat was performed for 10 min with bilateral carotid clamping, administration of trimethaphan and blood withdrawal to obtain a mean arterial blood pressure of 40 mm Hg. LCGU was determined 7 days after ischemia by injecting 14C-deoxy-D-glucose in saline solution. A significant increase in LCGU in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus was found 7 days after ischemia, whereas preischemic administration of flunarizine or phencyclidine inhibited this increase. Alterations in LCGU of other brain regions were insignificant.
