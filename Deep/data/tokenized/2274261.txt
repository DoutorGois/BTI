The calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PARV) is supposed to have a protective function under conditions of experimental seizure and hypoxia in a subgroup of GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the adult rat hippocampus. Here we studied the appearance of PARV immunoreactivity in rat hippocampal non-pyramidal cells during postnatal development in comparison to glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunoreactivity. PARV-immunoreactive neurons were not observed before postnatal day 7 whereas GAD-positive neurons and terminal-like puncta were present at postnatal day 2 (P2) and were frequent around P5. From other studies it is known that all GABAergic neurons are formed prenatally. Our data thus indicate that in the early postnatal period GABAergic non-pyramidal cells are poorly protected by calcium-binding proteins against a pathological calcium influx.
