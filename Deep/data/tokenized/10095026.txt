Opioids are involved in the development of epileptic seizures. Recently, interest has been focused on the role of the kappa-opioid receptor agonists as novel approaches to the treatment of epilepsy. In the present study we investigated the effects of the kappa-opioid receptor agonist enadoline (Ena) on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced seizures, PTZ kindling, shuttle-box performance and hippocampal neuromorphology. Ena injected i.c.v. in doses of 1 and 10 nmol did not affect acute PTZ seizures. In the course of PTZ kindling development, co-treatment (1 nmol) with the kappa-opioid receptor agonist suppressed seizure strength. Eight days after kindling completion the animals received a challenge dose of PTZ. In reaction to challenge, kindled animals which were pretreated with Ena reached significantly lower seizure scores. Kindling resulted in diminished shuttle-box performance. Learning performance in kindled animals pretreated with Ena was not normalised. Kindling resulted in increased glutamate binding. Interestingly, in comparison with the saline/saline group, neither in the Ena/saline nor in the Ena/PTZ treated groups changes in glutamate binding were found. That means that Ena prevented the increase in glutamate binding in the kindled group. In kindled animals significant cell loss in CA1 of the dorsal hippocampus was found and this was efficaciously counteracted by Ena. However, Ena alone did induce similar cell loss compared to kindled animals. It is hypothesised that the effects of enadoline are mainly due to interferences with glutamatergic systems.
