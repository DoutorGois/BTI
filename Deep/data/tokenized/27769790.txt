OBJECTIVE: Previously, we found that the inhaled anesthetic isoflurane up-regulated the transcriptional factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein levels during induction of neurodegeneration in the brain of neonatal rats. Here, we investigated the role of HIF-1alpha and the underlying signaling pathway in the neurodegenration induced by isoflurane in rodent developing brain. METHODS: Primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to isoflurane (0.4mM) for 12h. Neuron injury was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetra-zolium bromide (MTT) test and quantification of lactate dehydrogenaserelease. HIF-1alpha gene expression and transcriptional activity, cleaved caspase-3 and phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma gene expression were quantified. Cytosolic calcium concentration was measured by calcium imagining. The role of HIF-1alpha on juvenile learning and memory impairment induced by isoflurane was studied by fear conditioning and extinction test and Morris water maze test. RESULTS: Isoflurane induced HIF-1alpha gene expression and transcriptional activity in vitro. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of HIF-1alpha or knockdown of HIF-1alpha by shRNA counteracted the neurotoxicity of isoflurane. Ca(2+) signaling pathways involving PLC-gamma activation are required for isoflurane-evoked HIF-1alpha accumulation. Finally, partial deficiency of HIF-1alpha attenuated isoflurane-induced neurodegeneration in developing brain, and alleviated juvenile learning and memory impairment induced by isoflurane. CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha activation via cytosolic Ca(2+) signaling pathway play a role in the mechanism of isoflurane-induced neurodegeneration in neonatal rodents, suggesting HIF-1alpha as a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of the deleterious effects of prolonged exposures to anesthetics.
