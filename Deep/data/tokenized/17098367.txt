Dysfunctional glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive behavior in mice and humans. In accordance with this hypothesis GR overexpressing mice are less susceptible to develop depressive-like behavior when subjected to stressful events. Here, we analyzed GR overexpressing mice for morning and evening content of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the tissue levels of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) in brain areas suspected to be involved in stress adaptation. BDNF concentrations in the hippocampus and amygdala/piriform cortex were significantly enhanced in GR overexpressing mice (by maximally +103%) compared to wildtype animals. Diurnal variations, as detected for NGF in the hypothalamus, for BDNF in the frontal cortex and striatum and for serotonergic function in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus, were not affected by the genotype. In conclusion, GR overexpression-dependent increases of hippocampal and amygdala BDNF content presumably represent a dynamic correlate of enhanced stress resistance.
