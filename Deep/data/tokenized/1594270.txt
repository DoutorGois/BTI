The local anesthetic lidocaine was injected into the dentate gyrus (DG) of alert, unrestrained rats 10 min prior to investigation within the formalin test. Regional anesthesia of the DG resulted in a reduction of pain scores when administered contralateral to the site of subcutaneous formalin injection. The analgesic effect was evident 30-50 min after central infusion. These results provide evidence of the involvement of the hippocampal formation (HF) in pain perception.
