In dogs with electrodes implanted into the brain, a defensive instrumental conditioned reflex (CR) was elaborated to light flashes, stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and caudate nucleus (CN) stimulation. Reproducibility of the learned movement was tested for the contralateral DN, CN, nucleus accumbens (AN) and pallid globe (PG). In the second series the percent of the elicited movements was compared to EPs, appearing in response to signal and testing stimulation. The degree was elucidated of structures participation in motivational, signal and executive links of CR. Low degree of AN participation in the executive CR link (2-nd series) and a high degree of AN and PG participation in the signal link (3-d series) were shown. Thus, intrasystemic CR generalization was more effective than the intersystemic one.
