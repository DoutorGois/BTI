In the mammalian brain, information encoding and storage have been explained by revealing the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity at various levels in the central nervous system, including the hippocampus and the cerebral cortices. The modulatory mechanisms of synaptic excitability that are correlated with neuronal tasks are fundamental factors for synaptic plasticity, and they are dependent on intracellular Ca(2+)-mediated signaling. In the present review, the A-type K(+) (IA) channel, one of the voltage-dependent cation channels, is considered as a key player in the modulation of Ca(2+) influx through synaptic NMDA receptors and their correlated signaling pathways. The cellular functions of IA channels indicate that they possibly play as integral parts of synaptic and somatic complexes, completing the initiation and stabilization of memory.
