The evolution of seizures and postseizure inhibitions in the course of 'rapid kindling' and after the termination of stimulation were studied in rabbits with chronically implanted electrodes (neocortex, dorsal hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus). The amygdala (n = 4) or hippocampus (n = 7) was electrically stimulated every 5 min. Generalized convulsions and wide-spread electrographic epileptic changes together with a striking shortening of postictal refractory periods were produced by this procedure within 2-6 h. In most cases, these epileptogenic effects continued their progression after the termination of stimulation for more than 2-4 weeks. The degree of reduction of postseizure inhibition durations was significantly greater than the degree of increase of generalized motor seizure durations. These may be mediated by mechanisms which facilitate the onset of seizure but do not significantly influence seizure expression.
