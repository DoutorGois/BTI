Nitric oxide (*NO) is a ubiquitous signaling molecule that participates in the neuromolecular phenomena associated with memory formation. In the hippocampus, neuronal *NO production is coupled to the activation of the NMDA-type of glutamate receptor. Although *NO-mediated signaling has been associated with soluble guanylate cyclase activation, cytochrome oxidase is also a target for this gaseous free radical, for which *NO competes with O(2). Here we show, for the first time in a model preserving tissue cytoarchitecture (rat hippocampal slices) and at a physiological O(2) concentration, that endogenous NMDA-evoked *NO production inhibits tissue O(2) consumption for submicromolar concentrations. The simultaneous real-time recordings reveal a direct correlation between the profiles of *NO and O(2) in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampal slice. These results, obtained in a system close to in vivo models, strongly support the current paradigm for O(2) and *NO interplay in the regulation of cellular respiration.
