Phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptor has been implicated in the regulation of the receptor channel. We investigated the effects of transient global ischemia in rats on phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3/dentate gyrus. Transient ischemia induced an increase in the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser831 in the CA1 at 1 h of reperfusion. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Ser845 in neither region was affected by the ischemia. The amounts of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII) and its activated form, but not cAMP-dependent protein kinase subunits, were increased in a crude membrane fraction after ischemia. The results suggest that an activated CaMKII may phosphorylate Ser831 of GluR1 and a consequent phosphorylation of GluR1 may be related to pathogenic events occurring in the vulnerable subfield of the hippocampus after transient global ischemia.
