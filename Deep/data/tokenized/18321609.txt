The effects of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) microinjected uni- or bilaterally into the CA1 hippocampal area of male Wistar rats at a dose of 10, 50 and 100 ng on exploratory behavior were examined. VIP microinjected bilaterally at a high dose (100 ng) significantly decreased the horizontal movements, while at low doses (10 and 50 ng) had no effect on the exploratory activity. Microinjections of VIP into the left hippocampal CA1 area at doses 50 and 100 ng suppressed the exploratory activity, while right-side VIP administration at a dose 100 ng significantly increased horizontal movements compared to the respective controls. Vertical activity was stimulated only by VIP administered into the right hippocampal CA1 area at the three doses used. Neither bilateral nor left injections of VIP induced changes in the vertical movements. The main finding was the presence of hippocampal asymmetry in exploratory behavior to unilateral microinjections of VIP depending on the dose and the microinjected hemisphere.
