Previously, we reported the occurrence of neural stem cells (NSCs) around an area of damage after rat traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it was unclear if this was due to blastgenesis in astrocytes, or to NSCs migrating from the subventricular zone (SVZ). In this study, NSCs were isolated and cultured from cultured type 1 astrocytes taken from newborn rat cortex in which the subventricular zone and hippocampus had been discarded. All cultured type 1 astrocytes showed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunopositivity. Nestin immunopositive spheres were isolated from type 1 astrocytes and cultured in the presence of bFGF and EGF in the medium. Neurospheres differentiated into Tuj1-, GFAP- and A2B5-positive cells after 4 days of culture without bFGF and EGF. These results indicate that isolated neurospheres from brain cortex astrocytes can differentiate into neurons and glia and might contribute to neurogenesis and neuroplasticity.
