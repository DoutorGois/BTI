Adenosine has profound depressant effects upon the electrophysiological activity of the brain, but the adenosine receptor subtypes which mediate these responses are uncertain. In order to resolve this question, we have characterized the effects of two adenosine analogs which differ in their relative potencies at adenosine A1 and A2 receptors. The effects of these adenosine analogs were examined on spontaneous firing rate of Purkinje neurons in the rat cerebellum in situ, in cerebellar brain slices in vitro, and on synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus in vitro. Although the A2 agonist appeared to be more potent with local drug application techniques in situ, our in vitro results suggest that the A1 receptor subtype is involved in the electrophysiological actions of these drugs in both rat cerebellum and hippocampus. Furthermore, these data indicate that the physical properties of some adenosine analogs may reduce apparent drug potencies when they are studied with local application techniques.
