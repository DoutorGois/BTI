Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a master transcription factor that regulates the response to hypoxia and ischemia and induces the expression of various genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (EPO). This study shows the systemic response of increased HIF-1alpha, EPO, and VEGF mRNA and protein. In addition, VEGF expression was increased in neurons and over-expressed in glial cells in a model of neuroexcitotoxicity in the hippocampus, in which rats were neonatally exposed to high glutamate concentrations. Simultaneous increases in HIF-1alpha, EPO and VEGF mRNA in peritoneal macrophages were also observed. Our study is consistent with the hypothesis that these genes exert a protective effect in response to neurotoxicity.
