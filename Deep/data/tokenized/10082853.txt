Several lines of evidence indicate that glucose influences on memory depend on interactions between glucose, glucoregulation and hippocampal cholinergic function. We previously demonstrated that glucose and scopolamine differentially affected memory consolidation for an operant bar pressing task in two closely-related BALB/c mouse strains. Whereas glucose normally improves memory in several animal strains, memory consolidation was not effected by systemic glucose injections in BALB/cANnCrlBR mice. Moreover, these mice were relatively insensitive to the normally observed amnestic effects of scopolamine. We therefore sought to determine whether cholinergic mechanisms in the dorsal hippocampus were involved in such atypical drug effects on memory processing in that strain of mice. In Experiment 1, we examined whether post-training oxotremorine would also atypically influence memory consolidation for an appetitively reinforced operant bar pressing task following microinjection in the dorsal hippocampus. In Experiment 2, we examined the effects of intrahippocampal GABAA drugs on memory consolidation. The non-selective muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine, dose-dependently impaired memory and the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, improved retention in BALB/cANnCrlBR mice. It was concluded that GABA-mediated influences on hippocampal pyramidal output in BALB/cANnCrlBR mice and other strains are similar; but the amnestic effects of oxotremorine from the dorsal hippocampus were opposite to facilitating effects normally observed in other animal strains. Results are discussed relative to possible altered septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission in BALB/cANnCrlBR mice.
