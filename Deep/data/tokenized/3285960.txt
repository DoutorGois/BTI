Tetanization of commissural-CA1 input to the apical dendrites of the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area was found to produce a marked long-term potentiation of the field EPSP. Whereas by concurrent tetanization of the commissural pathway and medial septo-CA1 input, this potentiation was significantly reduced. Thus a negative cooperativity in LTP induction was revealed.
