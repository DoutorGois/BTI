To estimate the frequency of persistent Borna disease virus (BDV) infections of the human central nervous system and to determine which neuropsychiatric disorders might be associated with this viral infection, reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction was used to screen a large collection of autopsy brain samples for the presence of BDV-specific nucleic acids. The presence of BDV RNA was found in 3 brains of persons with psychiatric symptoms and prominent hippocampal degeneration previously reported to be positive by others. However, no BDV RNA was detected in 86 randomly collected brains from persons with various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, affective disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, or from suicide victims or in 52 brains from healthy controls. Furthermore, no BDV-RNA was detected in 16 surgical brain samples from persons with epilepsy-associated hippocampal sclerosis. These results indicate that life-long persistent BDV infections are rare in humans and that such infections may be associated with certain forms of hippocampal degeneration.
