OBJECTIVE: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is well characterized by the accumulated Abeta plaque in hippocampus and cerebral cortex concomitant with markedly reduced study and learning ability. Trehalose, a natural disaccharide, has been shown to have neural protective properties and exhibited therapeutic effects in animal models of several neural degenerative disorders. However, the effect of trehalose on AD pathology remains largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the effects of trehalose in APP/PS1 transgenic mice through behaviour tests and biochemical analyses. KEY FINDINGS: We found that the impaired cognitive and learning ability was improved and Abeta deposit in hippocampus was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that trehalose could be a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of AD.
