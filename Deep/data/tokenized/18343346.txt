We examined the effects of valproic acid (VPA) on hippocampal neurons. Prenatal VPA exposure significantly increased polysialic acid (PSA) expression in the early postnatal mouse hippocampus. Moreover, VPA treatment significantly enhanced PSA expression in primary cultured hippocampal neurons and stimulated neurite growth. Our results suggest that VPA exposure in ovo affects hippocampal development.
