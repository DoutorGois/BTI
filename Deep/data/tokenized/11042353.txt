In the present work we have analyzed by Northern blot, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization the expression of muscarinic receptor subtype mRNAs in rat and chick dorsal root ganglia. Northern blot analysis performed on rat total RNA revealed a strong signal for M(2) while a faint band was observed for M(3) and M(4) subtypes; no signal was evident for M(1) and M(5), while in chick total RNA no signal was detected for any of the analyzed subtypes (M(2), M(3), M(4)). On the other hand, RT-PCR revealed that all muscarinic subtype mRNAs were present both in rat and chick DRG, although the level of their expression may be different. In chick DRG, the presence of various muscarinic subtypes was confirmed by competition binding experiments. In situ hybridization in rat DRG showed that M(3) and M(4) transcripts, similarly to what has been previously described for M(2) mRNA, were preferentially localized in medium-small neurons. Large neurons were usually negative or faintly labelled. No hybridization signal was detected in rat DRG with probes for M(1) and M(5) muscarinic subtypes. The presence of various muscarinic receptors in DRG and their preferential expression in the medium-small sensory neurons suggest their possible involvement in the modulation of nociceptive stimuli transduction.
