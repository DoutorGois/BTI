Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) including beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) (beta-CDSDS) was used to detect cholesterol at the 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB)/aqueous interface in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid cells. The beta-CD acts as a host for SDS (guest). The guest SDS enclosed within the beta-CD cavity was replaced with cholesterol by injecting cholesterol solution into the TEM cell at concentrations greater than 3 muM. The replacement of SDS with cholesterol was confirmed by pH measurement and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SDS excluded from the beta-CD altered the planar orientation of the 5CB confined within the TEM grid cell to a homeotropic orientation. This planar-to-homeotropic transition was observed using a polarized optical microscope under crossed polarizers. This convenient TEM grid cell provides a new method for the selective detection of cholesterol without immobilization of the detecting receptors (enzyme, antibody, or aptamer) or the use of sophisticated instruments.
