The molecular mechanism of the clinical antiepileptic/antimyoclonic action of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is unknown. To explore the possible role of excitatory amino acid receptors, we studied the influence of ACTH and ACTH fragments in vitro on the binding of [3H]MK-801 to rat hippocampus, a region relevant to epilepsy. ACTH-(1-39), ACTH-(1-24), and ACTH-(1-17) displayed micromolar affinities compared to the nanomolar affinity of MK-801, whereas ACTH-(4-10) and four clinically used anticonvulsants were inactive. These findings are not specific for NMDA receptors but conform to the rank order of potency of ACTH fragments at other receptor binding sites.
