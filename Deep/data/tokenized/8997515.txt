Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been well studied for its effects in improving survival and differentiation of the central and peripheral nervous system. In order to understand the developing CNS and the pathogenesis of brain injury, an enzyme immunoassay was employed to detect BDNF protein in the various tissues of developing and adult animals. Increased levels of the BDNF were found in the hippocampus, cerebrocortex, striatum, cerebellum and ventral mesencephalon in 2-week-old rats, compared with that in postnatal day 0 pups. In the adult rat, the highest level of BDNF was detected in the hippocampus (14.5 +/- 0.8 ng/g wet tissue), with a relatively high level also observed in the cerebrocortex and striatum. In peripheral tissues, a substantial amount of BDNF protein was observed in various organs. The changes in BDNF levels in the striatum and the ventral mesencephalon of unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned young adult rats were also examined. Significant increases of BDNF levels were detected during 2 weeks after lesion.
