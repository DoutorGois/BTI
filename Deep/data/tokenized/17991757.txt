The aim of this study was to examine the effects of supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on stress responses in mice subjected to an unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) procedure. Stress-induced modifications in coat and aggressiveness were evaluated, and phospholipid PUFA profiles and monoamine levels were analyzed in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. The results showed that repeated exposure to mild stressors induced degradation in the physical state of the coat, lowered body weight gain, and increased aggressiveness, without any effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation. The UCMS induced a significant decrease in the levels of norepinephrine in the frontal cortex and striatum, and a nonsignificant decrease in the hippocampus. The tissue levels of serotonin (5-HT) were 40% to 65% decreased in the three brain regions studied. Interestingly, the n-3 PUFA supplementation reversed this stress-induced reduction in 5-HT levels. These findings showed that supplementation in n-3 long-chain PUFAs might reverse certain effects of UCMS in cerebral structures involved in stress-related behaviors.
