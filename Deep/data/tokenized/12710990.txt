High densities of mRNAs for three rhythm-related genes, rPeriod1 (rPer1), rPer2, and rClock, which share high homology in Drosophila and mice, were found in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN, however, is not the only brain region that expresses these genes. To understand the distributions and possible physiological roles of these rhythm-related genes, we examined the gene expressions of rPer1, rPer2, and rClock in different brain regions by serial coronal, sagittal, and horizontal brain sections in Sprague-Dawley male rats. Animals were housed in a light-controlled room (lights on from 0600 to 1800 h) and killed at 1000 or 1200 h, which corresponds to Zeitgeber time 4 or 6. Semi-quantitative in situ hybridization with (35)S-riboprobes was used to evaluate mRNA levels. The mRNAs of rPer1, rPer2, and rClock were widely distributed in the rat CNS, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, piriform cortex, SCN, ventromedial hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, hippocampus, mammillary nucleus, pontine nucleus, superior and inferior colliculus, cerebellum, median eminence/pars tuberalis, pineal gland, and pituitary. The expression patterns of mRNAs for rPer1 and rPer2 were almost identical. In contrast, different expression patterns were observed between rClock and rPer1 or rPer2 in several brain regions, including the hypothalamic supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei, the paraventricular zone of the caudate putamen, the superior olivary nucleus, and anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary. These findings suggest that the different expression patterns observed for rPer1, rPer2, and rClock might be due to their different physiological role(s) in those brain regions.
