Tityus serrulatus is the scorpion associated with the most severe cases of scorpion envenoming in Brazil. However, there are no studies reporting the genotoxic effects of this venom in natural or experimental envenomations. It is well known that DNA-damage responses are providing opportunities for improving disease detection and management. In this study was evaluating the genotoxicity of the T. serrulatus venom in different organs (hippocampus, cortex, striatum, blood, heart, lung, liver and kidney) and periods in mice experimentally envenomed. ELISA and the Comet assays were used to quantification of venoms antigens and DNA damage, respectively. Forty-eight Swiss mice were divided into five groups and 0.5 DL50 of T. serrulatus venom (0.90 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally in each animal. Euthanasia was performed by cervical dislocation in the period of 0h (control group) 1h, 2h, 6h and 12h, where it the tissues were removed. The results showed high DNA damage in all structures analyzed, suggesting that T. serrulatus venom presented genotoxic activity or some secondary effect generated by venom injection. In the ELISA test, toxic circulant antigens were verified in practically all organs at the time intervals analyzed. Therefore, the distribution of the venom changes from organ to organ. We conclude that scorpion envenoming affects DNA in all organs analyzed even when the venom concentration is lower or no detectable, DNA damage persists.
