Unilateral ablation of the frontal cortex results in a significant reduction (19.5%) of glutamic acid in the ipsilateral compared with the contralateral substantia nigra. The GABA level in the substantia nigra and both the glutamate and GABA levels in the hippocampus remain unchanged. The results suggest that glutamate is a transmitter in the cortico-nigral fibre tract.
