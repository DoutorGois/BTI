RATIONALE: Withdrawal seizure-prone and withdrawal seizure-resistant mice were selectively bred to exhibit differences in handling-induced convulsion severity during ethanol withdrawal. The glutamatergic system has been implicated in seizure activity as well as ethanol withdrawal symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed L-[3H]glutamate uptake into hippocampal synaptosomes prepared from withdrawal seizure-prone and- resistant mice. METHODS: Glutamate uptake was characterized following repeated handling-induced convulsions, during acute intoxication, and during peak withdrawal following chronic ethanol exposure. RESULTS: Hippocampal synaptosomal L-[3H]glutamate uptake did not differ between convulsion- and ethanol-naive withdrawal seizure-prone and- resistant mice. Furthermore, exposure to convulsions or to a hypnotic dose of ethanol (4 g/kg) did not alter L-[3H]glutamate uptake. However, withdrawal from 72 h of ethanol exposure significantly increased L-[3H]glutamate uptake in both mouse lines as compared to their respective ethanol-naive controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that glutamate uptake is influenced by chronic ethanol exposure similarly in both withdrawal seizure-prone and- resistant mice. The observed increases in glutamate uptake during withdrawal may be associated with compensatory mechanisms triggered by chronic intoxication and are independent of the selected differences for withdrawal severity.
