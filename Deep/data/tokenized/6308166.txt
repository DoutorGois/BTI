Nerve terminals prepared from rat cortex and hippocampus were loaded with seven radioactive putative neurotransmitters (serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, aspartate, glutamate, and taurine). The release of these transmitters, choline acetyltransferase, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase, enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase was monitored during complement-mediated lysis. Three antisera were used: anti-5'-nucleotidase, anti-Chol-1, and anti-rat cerebrum. Anti-5'-nucleotidase serum did not cause the release of any labelled transmitter or of any of the enzymes studied. Anti-Chol-1 serum released choline acetyltransferase and small amounts of enolase and lactate dehydrogenase. Anti-rat cerebrum caused the release of all seven transmitters, choline acetyltransferase, and small amounts of the other three enzymes. It was concluded that 5'-nucleotidase was not present on any of the terminals studied, and that Chol-1 is only present on cholinergic terminals.
