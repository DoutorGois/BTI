A 12h sleep deprivation enhances the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1A receptors in rat hippocampus that recedes with 48h sleep recovery. The depressant effect of applied 5-HT on the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in the CA1 area, is also enhanced in hippocampi of SD rats. Following a 24 or 48h sleep recovery, the increase in the 5-HT effect subsided. These results have implications for therapeutics treating clinical depression.
