Recent studies have shown that alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit mRNA levels are associated with the effects of chronic ethanol exposure as well as genetic selection for ethanol withdrawal seizure sensitivity. We have previously shown that chronic ethanol exposure in rats results in a decrease in the levels of GABAA receptor alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunit mRNAs in cerebral cortex, an increase in the levels of alpha 6 subunit mRNAs in cerebellum and no alteration in alpha 3, GAD, ribosomal RNA or polyA + RNA levels in these regions. Since chronic ethanol administration increases the expression of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding sites in cortex and cerebellum with no effect on other GABAA receptor recognition sites, we hypothesized that the expression of other subunits would be altered in these regions. In addition, since ethanol appears to interact with zolpidem-sensitive GABAA receptors in rat brain, we investigated the effect of chronic ethanol administration on these recognition sites. Chronic ethanol administration increased [3H]zolpidem binding with no effect on levels of GABAA receptor beta 2 and gamma 2 subunit mRNAs. In addition, we examined the levels of NMDAR1 receptor subunit mRNAs since chronic ethanol administration results in increased levels of [3H]MK-801 recognition sites on NMDA receptors. NMDAR1 receptor subunit mRNAs were not altered following chronic ethanol exposure in rat cortex or hippocampus. These studies underscore the specificity of ethanol interactions with these receptors and the importance of understanding the mechanisms of both GABAA and NMDA receptor regulation in elucidating the etiology of ethanol dependence.
