Phenobarbital (PB) (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg), which was administered intraperitoneally to evaluate the effect of it on El mice, inhibited convulsive seizures dose-dependently. On the other hand, microelectrodes were implanted continually into the hippocampus of El mice, after which changes in the neuronal activity caused by a seizure were studied, as well as the effect of PB (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) on the neuronal activity. The neuronal activity increased during the convulsive seizure when compared to the neuronal activity as the mice moved about freely. Further, after the convulsive seizure, five or six groups of bursts were seen periodically. PB reduced the neuronal activity dose-dependently judging by the number of bursts in the initial group of bursts.
