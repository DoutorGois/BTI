In the present study, individual differences in spatial memory in aged Fischer 344 (F344) rats were associated with the extent of G-protein coupling of the M1 muscarinic receptor and the dendritic-to-somal ratio of hippocampal PKCgamma (d/sPKCgamma) immunogenicity. Following testing in the eight-arm radial maze task, 7 young and 13 aged rat brains were sectioned through the dorsal hippocampal formation (HF). G-protein coupling of the M1 receptor was assessed autoradiographically using competition binding studies in the presence and absence of a G-protein uncoupler to determine high (K(H)) and low (K(L)) affinity states for agonist in the HF, neocortex, and amygdala. In aged animals, a relationship between choice accuracy in the maze and K(H), a measure of M1 receptor-G-protein coupling was seen in the dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1, and neocortex. Furthermore, choice accuracy and d/sPKCgamma immunogenicity showed a significant relationship in CA1. Lastly, a correlation was seen in the CA1 of aged animals between K(H) and d/sPKCgamma. These relationships did not hold for the amygdala. Thus, individual differences in a naturally occurring age-dependent disruption of cholinergic-PKCgamma signal transduction is associated with spatial memory dysfunction.
