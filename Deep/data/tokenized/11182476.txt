The chronological accumulation of mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as a potential mechanism in the physiological processes of aging. Cytochrome c oxidase deficient, succinate dehydrogenase positive muscle fibers containing high copy numbers of a mitochondrial DNA mutation are a pathological hallmark of mitochondrial DNA disorders. We show that there is an age-related increase in cytochrome c oxidase-deficient cells in both hippocampal pyramidal neurons and choroid plexus epithelial cells. We suggest that these cells contribute to the cell death and dysfunction in CNS aging.
