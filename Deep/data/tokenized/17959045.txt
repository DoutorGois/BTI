OBJECTIVE: To study the effects on the expression of mGluR5 mRNA and protein levels in primarily cultured hippocampal neurons after lead exposure. METHODS: Primary embryonic rat hippocampal neuronal culture was prepared. On the 3(rd) day of incubation, lead chloride solution was added into medium to produce four different lead exposure levels: 0, 1 x 10(-8) mol/L, 1 x 10(-6) mol/L, 1 x 10(-4) mol/L Pb(2+). After 10 days of incubation, the neurons were collected to measure the alteration of mGluR5 mRNA expression by real-time fluorescent quantity PCR and the expression of mGluR5 in protein level by Western blot. RESULTS: The studies revealed that mGluR5 mRNA expression was down-regulated after lead exposure in a dose-dependent manner. The mGluR5 mRNA expression of the lower lead-exposed neurons (Pb(2+) 10(-8) mol/L), the medium lead-exposed neurons(Pb(2+) 10(-6) mol/L), the higher lead-exposed neurons(Pb(2+) 10(-4) mol/L) were 0.724, 0.421, 0.321 times less than that of the controls, respectively. The Western blot demonstrated that mGluR5 expression in protein level should be decreased after lead exposure. CONCLUSION: The expression of mGluR5 in mRNA and protein levels should be down-regulated after lead exposure at different lead levels in a dose-dependent manner.
