Following long-term treatment with bicuculline and tetrodotoxin (TTX) aimed at modifying synaptic activity in cultured neurons, we used a proteomic approach to identify the associated changes in protein expression. The neurons were left untreated, or treated with bicuculline or TTX, and fractionated by means of differential detergent extraction, after which the proteins in each fraction were separated by means of two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, and 57 proteins of interest were identified by mass spectrometry. The proteins that showed altered expression and/or post-translational modifications include proteins or enzymes involved in regulating cell and protein metabolism, the cytoskeleton, or mitochondrial activity. These results suggest that extensive alterations in neuronal protein expression take place as a result of increased or decreased synaptic activity.
