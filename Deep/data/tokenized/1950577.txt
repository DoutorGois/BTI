The effects of amobarbital (50 mg.kg-1 ip) on the brain concentrations of biopterin, pterin, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) were studied by a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent detector. Amobarbital increased FAD concentrations in 5 brain areas and pterin concentration in the cortex, but decreased biopterin concentrations in the cortex and hippocampus.
