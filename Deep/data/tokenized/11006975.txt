We immunohistochemically studied the distribution of nucleoporin p62 in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of rat brain. Previous reports have shown the presence of p62-immunoreactivity (ir) in the nuclear rim in the non-neuronal cells, but the present study showed that of p62-ir within the nucleus in addition to the nuclear rim in the neuronal cells of the hippocampus and hypothalamic nuclei; in these areas the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) undergoes nucleocytoplasmic translocation determined by ligand. We analyzed the expression of p62-ir after adrenalectomy (ADX). ADX changed the localization of GR-ir from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but did not change the localization or immunoreactivity of p62, suggesting that nucleoporin p62 is stable regardless of intracellular signal transduction between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.
