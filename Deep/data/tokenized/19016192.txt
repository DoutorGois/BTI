The neuroendocrine response to stress in the rat displays gender-specific characteristics resulting from both sex hormone-dependent organization of neuroendocrine regulatory mechanisms and the modulatory action of circulating gonadal steroids. To define the role of gonadal steroid-mediated brain differentiation in the emergence of sex-specific differences in pituitary-adrenal function, and the necessity of physiological gonadal secretions for the manifestation of these differences, we examined the ontogeny of diurnal and stress-induced corticosterone (B) secretion, and suppressibility of the latter by dexamethasone (DEX) in intact male and female rats, and in animals that were subject to neonatal manipulations of the gonadal steroid environment (orchidectomy in males and neonatal estrogenization in females). Further, gene expression of corticosteroid receptors (MR and GR), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) under basal conditions, and following adrenalectomy (ADX) and chronic supplementation with high doses of B, were investigated in adult male and female rats, and individuals of both sexes which have been exposed to alterations of the gonadal steroid milieu during early development. The results demonstrate that: i) gender-specific differences in basal and stress-induced adrenocortical secretion are present at birth, but are still maleable by neonatal alterations of the gonadal steroid environment; ii) gender-specific dichotomy in the sensitivity of the secretory stress response to glucocorticoid feedback becomes fully manifest in adulthood; iii) sex differences in basal adrenocortical secretion become fully expressed only in the presence of intact gonads, whereas, once established by the neonatal hormonal milieu, differential sensitivity of the stress response to glucocorticoids persists in the absence of functioning gonads; iv) neonatal hormone manipulations alter sex-specific characteristics of CRH, AVP, MR and GR gene expression in the brain, and the changes persist in adulthood independently of gonadal secretions; v) regulation of CRH gene expression by glucocorticoids displays gender-specific patterns which are probably established during the period of sex hormone-dependent brain organization and their manifestation does not require physiological gonadal secretions in adulthood.
