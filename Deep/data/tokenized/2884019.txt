Antisera raised against glutamate or aspartate bound to bovine serum albumin were purified by affinity chromatography, and their specificities were verified by immunoblotting and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunohistochemical investigation using materials perfusion-fixed after long flushing demonstrated distinct laminar terminals with glutamate- or aspartate-like immunoreactivity throughout the limbic structures. This technique may offer a valuable tool for revealing the distribution of glutamatergic or aspartatergic nerve terminals.
