Although several advances have occurred over the past 20 years concerning refining the use and administration of electroconvulsive therapy to minimize side effects of this treatment, little progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic or adverse effects. This work was performed in order to determine the level of oxidative damage at different times after the maintenance electroconvulsive shock (ECS). Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) received a protocol mimicking therapeutic of maintenance or simulated ECS (Sham) and were subsequently sacrificed immediately after, 48 h and 7 days after the last maintenance electroconvulsive shock. We measured oxidative damage parameters (thiobarbituric acid reactive species for lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyls for protein damage, respectively) in hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and striatum. We demonstrated no alteration in the lipid peroxidation and protein damage in the four structures studied immediately after, 48 h and 7 days after a last maintenance electroconvulsive shock. Our findings, for the first time, demonstrated that after ECS maintenance we did protocol minimal oxidative damage in the brain regions, predominating absence of damage on the findings.
