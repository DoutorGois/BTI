Schizophrenia is a severely devastating mental disorder, the pathological process of which is proposed to be associated with the dysfunction of dopaminergic transmission. Our previous results have demonstrated slower kinetics of transmitter release (glutamate release in hippocampus and norepinephrine release in adrenal slice) in a schizophrenia model, dysbindin null-sandy mice. However, whether dopaminergic transmission in the nigrostriatal pathway contributes to the pathology of dysbindin-/- mice remains unknown. Here, we have provided a step-by-step protocol to be applied in the in vivo amperometric recording of dopamine (DA) release from the mouse striatum evoked by an action potential (AP) pattern. With this protocol, AP pattern-dependent DA release was recorded from dysbindin-/- mice striatum in vivo. On combining amperometric recording in slices and electrophysiology, we found that in dysbindin-/- mice, (1) presynaptically, AP-pattern dependent dopamine overflow and uptake were intact in vivo; (2) the recycling of the dopamine vesicle pool remained unchanged. (3) Postsynaptically, the excitability of medium spiny neuron (MSN) was also normal, as revealed by patch-clamp recordings in striatal slices. Taken together, in contrast to reduced norepinephrine release in adrenal chromaffin cells, the dopaminergic transmission remains unchanged in the nigrostriatal pathway in dysbindin-/- mice, providing a new insight into the functions of the schizophrenia susceptibility gene dysbindin.
