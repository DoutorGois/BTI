Intracellular recording techniques were used to examine GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus in the post-self sustaining limbic status epilepticus model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Orthodromically evoked, monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in vitro following pharmacological blockade of ionotropic glutamate and GABA(B) receptors. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials from epileptic tissue were kinetically altered relative to controls; both the 10-90% rise-time and width (measured at half-maximum amplitude) were reduced by approximately 50% resulting in significant shortening of duration. The degree of pyramidal cell hyperexcitability, assessed before pharmacological treatment as the number of action potentials evoked by maximum intensity afferent stimulation, correlated significantly with the magnitude of synaptic potential duration reduction determined following blockade of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Bath application of the benzodiazepine type 1 receptor agonist zolpidem reduced post-self sustaining limbic status epilepticus CA1 pyramidal cell hyperexcitability substantially (but not completely) via a marked increase in inhibitory postsynaptic potential area. Post-self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus inhibitory postsynaptic potentials which exhibited the most pronounced shortening were augmented by zolpidem to a greater degree than longer duration synaptic potentials. In contrast, zolpidem-induced augmentation of control inhibitor, postsynaptic potential area was much less robust. It is suggested that a deficiency in post-self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition contributes to a state of partial disinhibition which is a major factor in enhanced CA1 excitability in chronic limbic epilepsy. Possible mechanisms underlying post-self-sustaining limbic status epilepticus kinetic abnormalities are discussed.
