To study the correlation between the spatial cognitive impairment and different subtypes of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) of hippocampus in diabetic mice, we used alloxan (intraperitoneal injection) to induce type 1 diabetes in male Kunming mice and compared the spatial cognitive ability of the model mice with that of control mice through Morris water maze test. Meanwhile, using Western blot, we detected the protein expressions of ER-alpha36, ER-alpha66, caveolin-1, PKCalpha, cAMP-response element binding protein 2 (CREB2), and synaptophysin (Syn) in the hippocampus of the mice. The results showed that on the 3rd and 5th days of training, the ability of spatial learning and memory in the diabetic mice was significantly inferior to that of the control mice (P < 0.05). In the diabetic mice, the protein expressions of caveolin-1 and PKCalpha were decreased (P < 0.05), but ER-alpha66 expression was unaffected, while ER-alpha36 and CREB2 expressions were significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared with those of the control mice. The results suggest that abnormal expression of ER-alpha36 and related signal molecules may be important factors for diabetes-induced spatial cognitive impairment.
