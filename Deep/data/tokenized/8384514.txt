Mouse trisomy 16 is an animal model for Down's syndrome (human trisomy 21). The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to compare passive and active electrical properties of trisomy 16 and diploid mouse 16 fetal hippocampal neurons maintained in culture for 2-5 weeks. There was no significant difference in any mean passive property, including resting potential, membrane resistance, capacitance and time constant. However, in trisomic neurons, the action potential had a 20% significantly slower rising phase and a 20% significantly smaller inward sodium current and inward sodium conductance than did control neurons. The outward conductance was not altered. The ratio of maximum inward conductance to maximum outward conductance was 30% less in the trisomy 16 cells. These results indicate that trisomy 16 hippocampal neurons have abnormal active electrical properties, most likely reflecting reduced sodium channel membrane density. Such subtle differences may influence elaboration of the hippocampus during development.
