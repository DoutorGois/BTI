Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been reported to have neuroprotective properties following excitotoxic, metabolic, and oxidative insults. We report here that another FGF family member, FGF-8 is able to protect rat hippocampal cultures from oxidative stress. The b isoform of FGF-8 protected hippocampal cultures from hydrogen peroxide with an EC50 of approximately 25 ng/ml. In a time course study, using pre-, co-, post-treatment paradigms, we report that bFGF and FGF-8b were neuroprotective when added as a pre-treatment, co-treatment, and even at 2 h post-insult. Using neuronal enriched cultures, we demonstrate that bFGF and FGF-8b neuroprotection partially results from a direct action of the growth factors on neurons. The direct action on neurons may work in concert with normal and FGF-stimulated glial secretion products to give the full FGF protective effect. FGF-8b showed maximal protection at 50 ng/ml, whereas bFGF showed maximal protection at 10 ng/ml. Despite requiring higher concentrations to elicit protection, FGF-8b is able to attain levels of protection equivalent to that of bFGF (attenuation of 75-80% of hydrogen peroxide induced death). We also report that bFGF and FGF-8b are able to protect the human neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-MC, from peroxide-induced LDH release by 50%. From these studies, we conclude that FGF-8b is another member of the FGF family which may show in vivo efficacy for the treatment of oxidative insults, such as stroke.
