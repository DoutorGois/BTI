The role of monoamine oxidase has been shown to be related to some behavioral changes including aggression and cognitive dysfunction. In order to demonstrate the basic expression patterns of monoamine oxidase in the canine brain, we determined the full-length nucleotide sequences of cDNA for canine monoamine oxidase type A (MAOA) and type B (MAOB) genes that were isolated from the canine brain cDNA library. Oligonucleotide primers for PCR were constructed based on the conserved sequences reported thus far for other mammalian species. The nucleotide sequences had open reading frames of 1584 and 1563 bp for MAOA and MAOB, respectively. Both of these genes showed relatively high homology with other species in both nucleotide (> 81%) and deduced amino acid (> 85%) sequences. In Northern blot analyses MAOA mRNA was expressed broadly in various parts of the canine brain, whereas MAOB mRNA was found only in specific brain regions, such as the hypothalamus, hippocampus, brain stem and olfactory bulb. These results suggest that MAOA and MAOB mRNAs have subtype-specific expression patterns in the canine brain.
