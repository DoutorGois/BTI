In this paper we show that gamma oscillations can be elicited by brief (< or = 200 ms) local applications of glutamate in the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal slices. Dentate gamma oscillations show an initial peak frequency of approximately 70 Hz and last for up to 4 min. The network activity involves functional GABA(A) receptors as it is drastically reduced by GABA(A) receptor antagonists. The oscillations can be observed in the whole dentate gyrus-CA3-network and are coherent between the dentate gyrus and area CA3 for variable periods. Thus, long-lasting gamma oscillations can be experimentally induced in the dentate gyrus and are propagated into the hippocampus proper.
