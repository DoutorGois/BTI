The effect of exposure of rats to a complex acoustic signal with ultrasonic components on line structure of synapses of the CA1 field of the hippocampus was studied during a course treatment (two weeks) with broad-spectrum antioxidant Mexidol. Under the same conditions, the time course of food conditioning by a conditioned tone stimulus and acquisition of trace conditioned reflex (time interval counting) were studied in the same rat group. Rats non-exposed to stress against the background of Mexidol and without Mexidol treatment served as control. Analysis of fine structure of the vesicle redistribution in CA1 synapses revealed a reduction of the efficacy of synaptic transmission a day after the exposure to the complex acoustic stimulus. We found a negative effect of the complex acoustic stimulus on conditioning by tone and acquisition of time-counting trace reflex by rats. This effect was shown to be normalized by the course Mexidol treatment. The results suggests the expediency of Mexidol application for prevention of cognitive disorders, which are frequent under stress-inducing conditions.
