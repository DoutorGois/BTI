While neurons containing immunoreactive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) are scattered primarily in the medial septal-diagonal band of Broca-medial preoptic area (mS-dbB-PO) complex, autoradiographic studies have demonstrated dense concentrations of LHRH receptors in the hippocampus. The route by which LHRH is transported to its hippocampal receptors is unknown. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that LHRH-containing neurons in the mS-dbB-PO complex project to hippocampal sites containing LHRH receptors, thereby serving as a source of innervation to these receptors. Large (0.10 microliters) or small (0.02 microliters) volumes of the retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) were injected unilaterally into four separate hippocampal locations in six ovariectomized female rats. In an additional five females, a 0.15 microliter volume of the retrograde tracer fluorogold (FG) was similarly injected. After a five day survival period, the animals were sacrificed. Vibratome sections of the brain were stained for both WGA and LHRH with a dual immunohistochemical technique. Since FG is a fluorescent chromagen, brains of animals injected with FG only required processing for LHRH immunofluorescence. As a positive control, some sections containing retrogradely labeled cells filled with either WGA or FG were processed for choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) immunoreactivity. The WGA and FG injections covered targeted hippocampal sites and neurons containing retrogradely transported WGA or FG were found in abundance in the mS-dbB-PO complex. In accord with previous reports, many CHAT-positive and fewer LHRH-positive neurons were found in this complex. Approximately 5-10% of the CHAT-positive neurons also contained WGA or FG; however, no neurons were found to co-localize LHRH and either of the retrograde tracers. The results indicate that LHRH neurons in the mS-dbB-PO complex do not project directly to hippocampal sites containing LHRH receptors.
