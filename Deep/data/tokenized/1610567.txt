Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression was studied in the hippocampus at various developmental stages in normal rats and following kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure activity. Systemic administration of KA strongly elevated BDNF mRNA levels in all hippocampal subregions after postnatal day 21. In contrast, even though KA induced intense behavioral seizure activity at postnatal day 8, the seizures were not associated with elevations of BDNF mRNA levels, indicating a clear dissociation between behavioral seizures and increases in BDNF mRNA levels and contradicting the view that BDNF mRNA expression is principally regulated by neuronal activity. In the dentate gyrus at postnatal day 13, intense BDNF mRNA expression was limited to a defined area at the border between granule cell and molecular layers, suggesting the possibility that segregation of BDNF mRNA into defined subcellular compartments may play a role in establishing the well-delineated patterns of innervation in the hippocampus.
