Serum amyloid P (SAP) has been shown to be consistently present in all types of amyloid deposits except cerebral lesions of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. We used immunohistochemical methods to demonstrate SAP reactivity in both tangles and plaques, as well as vessels, in lightly fixed frozen tissue sections of hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus from subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal controls. As confirmed by thioflavin S staining, heavy deposition of immunoperoxidase reaction product was evident in Sommer's sector (CA1), the subiculum and entorhinal cortex with both the antisera to SAP used. Serial sections immunostained with antiserum to amyloid A or preimmune rabbit serum showed no evidence for staining in plaques or tangles. These observations provide evidence for extravasation of the protein across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in disease although expression of it by cellular elements within or entering the brain through the BBB cannot be ruled out. Our results also implicate the use of lightly fixed tissue for localization of some antigens by immunohistochemistry in postmortem human brain.
