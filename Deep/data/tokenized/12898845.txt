The purpose of this research was an assessment of protective action of ACTH (4-9) in dexamethasone-induced neurodegeneneration on the base of ultrastructural examinations of hippocampal neurons in the CA3 region. The experiments were carried out on adult Albino Swiss mouse males. The animals were divided into three groups: control group, experimental group 1-dexamethasone 8 mg/kg/24 h for 28 days, experimental group 2-dexamethasone and ACTH (4-9) 50 micrograms/kg twice a week. Results of our investigations show that ACTH (4-9) prevents neurotoxic influence of dexamethasone and its protective action is connected with the ability to inhibit degenerative processes in neurons having a character of apoptosis.
