The distribution, morphology, and ionic conductances of Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA)-labeled cells were examined in the rat hippocampal formation. The heaviest labeling and highest density of labeled neurons were found in the subicular complex. Lighter VVA-labeling and fewer labeled cells were found in hippocampal strata pyramidale, oriens, and alveus. VVA-labeled cells were found to be heterogeneous morphologically, including multipolar, bipolar, and basket-like shapes. The majority of VVA-labeled cells contained GABA and parvalbumin immunoreactivity; thus VVA-labeled cells in the hippocampal formation resemble previously described VVA-labeled neurons in cerebral cortex. Electrophysiological properties of subicular VVA-labeled cells were studied in an acutely dissociated neuron preparation. Dissociated cells were labeled in vitro with VVA coupled either to a fluorescent marker or to small beads. The viability of labeled dissociated cells was confirmed, and identified cells were partially characterized electrophysiologically using whole-cell voltage clamp recording. VVA-labeled cells were electrophysiologically similar to pyramidal cells from the same region, except that the VVA-labeled cells showed only small transient outward currents.
