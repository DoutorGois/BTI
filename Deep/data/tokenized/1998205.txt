Administration of dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL; 0, 20 or 40 mg/kg body wt.) by gavage to rats for 3 consecutive days produced a significant increase in polyamine levels in selected brain areas. At the higher dose of DBTL (40 mg/kg) spermidine levels were raised in pons-medulla, hypothalamus and frontal cortex while spermine levels increased in pons-medulla, hippocampus and frontal cortex regions. At the lower dose (20 mg/kg) only a slight increase in polyamine levels occurred. The observed induction in regional brain polyamines in DBTL-treated rats may lead to disturbances in synaptic function and further enhance its neurotoxic potential.
