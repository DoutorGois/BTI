Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Whether this association is mechanistic remains unclear. Here, we used a mouse model to test the hypothesis that HHcy increases levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) transporters in microvessels that form the blood-brain barrier, elevates Abeta content (Abeta40 and Abeta42) in the brain, and impairs cognitive performance. Mice with HHcy and age-matched, non-HHcy controls (Ctrl) were studied in two age groups: adult (6.2 +/- 0.4 months of age) and old (19 +/- 2.0 months of age). Levels of Abeta transporters, RAGE, LRP1, and Pgp, were not different between HHcy and Ctrl mice. Though there was an increase in overall brain Abeta levels with age, there were no differences between HHcy and Ctrl groups in cortex, hippocampus, or midbrain/diencephalon. Despite the lack of difference in Abeta, old mice with HHcy showed significant cognitive impairment on Morris water maze tests compared with Ctrl mice. We conclude that HHcy leads to cognitive impairment without many of the changes currently thought to be relevant to promoting the AD phenotype.
