Synaptic responses in hippocampal granule cells to stimulation of their afferent fibers from the entorhinal cortex fluctuate with a 24-hour period. The phase of this cycle for rats and monkeys depends on whether the animal is naturally nocturnal or diurnal. In a rat blinded by enucleation, the rhythm persists but drifts out of phase with the rhythm of sighted controls.
