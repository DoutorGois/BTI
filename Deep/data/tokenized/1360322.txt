The selective metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, trans-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD), stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis and elicits a number of electrophysiological responses in the hippocampus. If these effects are mediated by the same receptor subtype, they should undergo parallel developmental regulation. Therefore, we compared the phosphoinositide hydrolysis response and the electrophysiological responses to trans-ACPD at two different developmental stages. Trans-ACPD-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was significantly greater in hippocampal slices from immature (6-11-day-old) rats than from adults. In contrast, trans-ACPD elicited decreases in spike frequency adaptation and in the amplitude of the slow afterhyperpolarization in roughly equal percentages of immature and adult CA1 pyramidal cells. Similar results were obtained using the putative endogenous agonist, glutamate. These data support the hypothesis that certain electrophysiological effects of trans-ACPD are mediated by a metabotropic glutamate receptor that is distinct from the phosphoinositide hydrolysis-linked glutamate receptor.
