The total number of neurons with and without neurofibrillary changes in sectors CA1 to CA4, subiculum, and dentate gyrus of 16 subjects with Alzheimer disease (AD) was estimated. The duration of neurofibrillary changes was calculated on the basis of regressions between the duration of AD and neuronal numbers. In the CA1 and subiculum, it takes 3.4 and 5.4 years, respectively, for an intact neuron affected by neurofibrillary pathology to become a ghost tangle.
