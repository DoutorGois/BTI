Flutamide is a drug with antiandrogen effects that are mediated through androgen receptors (ARs). In this study, flutamide was subcutaneously administered to female rats (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg/day) on gestation Days 16-21 to evaluate effects on memory and learning performance in F1 offspring. Brain sexual differentiation was also evaluated by measuring the volume of the sexual dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) and analyzing levels of androgen receptor (AR) mRNA expression in the prostate, hypothalamus and hippocampus. In F1 offspring exposed in utero to flutamide, evaluation of motor activity, learning performance and spatial perception showed that flutamide tended to exert a dose-dependent increase on the motor activity in F1 males, but no significant differences were identified in the other measurements. Prominent changes in development of the SDN-POA were apparent in males after maturation. Doses of > or =3 mg/kg/day resulted in significantly decreased length and volume of the SDN-POA compared to controls. These differences tended to become more marked at higher doses. Volumes of the SDN-POA did not differ significantly between F1 males and females exposed to flutamide at 30 mg/kg/day. AR mRNA was assayed using the dot-blotting method in F1 animals. In flutamide dose groups, AR mRNA expression tended to be increased in the prostate gland and decreased in the hippocampus. These results might suggest that exposure to flutamide in utero might affect controlling AR expression on a hormonal signal transduction system mediated by testosterone. However, these changes were not clearly correlated to learning performance in male offspring other than motor activity.
