Neuronal reactions in the hippocampus and sensorimotor area were recorded in alert rabbits during conditioning to light flashes of different frequency, reinforced by isochronous electro-cutaneous stimulation. Changes of responses to light flashes (CS) as compared with those to an inhibitory stimulus, were observed in the sensorimotor neurones which reacted to the reinforcement by a convergence or frequency-nonspecific type of response, and in the hippocampal neurones reacting to electro-cutaneous stimulation: they were manifested in imitation by CS action of frequency-nonspecific components of response to reinforcement. The results obtained corroborate the concept of appearance in response to a stimulus of heterogeneous excitation flow: modality-specific and modality-nonspecific, as well as of a substantial role of their convergence in the integration of neurones during fixation and reproduction of information in the CNS.
