Gender differences in spatial navigation have been widely reported in nocturnal rodent species. Here, for the first time we report gender differences in spatial learning and memory of Octodon degus, a long-lived diurnal hystricomorph rodent. In the present study, 16 months old male and female O. degus were tested in the 18-holes Barnes circular maze. The acquisition session consisted of four daily 4 min trials, during 10 days. Seven days later, the retention test was performed. To avoid the effect of hormonal fluctuation on spatial navigation, both the acquisition and the retention tests, were performed in 21-day regular cycling females in a period that corresponds to the diestrus phase of the estrus cycle. At the beginning of the acquisition, female degus were significantly slower than males to find the escape hole, but the situation reversed afterwards. Moreover, during the course of acquisition, females made significantly less reference memory errors, working memory errors as well as omission errors, than males. In both sexes, motivation and learning ceiling effects were reached at days 5-6 of the training. During the acquisition, females used more frequently a spatial strategy, while males preferably applied either serial, random or opposite strategies. The observed cognitive differences between male and female O. degus existed only during the acquisition period but not during the retention, indicating that acquisition and consolidation are differently influenced by gender.
