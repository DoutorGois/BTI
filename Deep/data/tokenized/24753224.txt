The maintenance of established memories has recently been shown to involve the stabilization of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors (GluA2/AMPARs) at postsynaptic membranes. Previous studies have suggested that N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) regulates the stabilization of AMPARs at the synaptic membrane. We therefore disrupted the interaction between GluA2 and NSF in the dorsal hippocampus and examined its effect on the maintenance of object location and contextual fear memory. We used two interference peptides, pep2m and pepR845A, that have been shown to block the binding of NSF to GluA2 and reduce GluA2 synaptic content. Either peptide disrupted consolidated memory, and these effects persisted for at least 5 or 28 days after peptide administration. Following peptide administration and long-term memory disruption, rats were able to acquire new memories. Memory acquisition or consolidation was not impaired when pepR845A was given immediately before the training sessions. Blocking GluA2 endocytosis with the peptide GluA23Y prevented the memory impairment effect of pepR845A. Taken together, our results indicate that the persistence of long-term memory depends on the maintenance of a steady-state level of synaptic GluA2/AMPARs, which requires the interaction of NSF with GluA2.
