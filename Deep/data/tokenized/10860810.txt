Aging is associated with extensive cognitive impairments, although the biochemical and physiological basis of these deficits are unknown. As the hippocampus plays a vital role in cognitive functions, we have selected this tissue to analyze changes in gene expression at two different ages. Array technology is utilized to explore how gene expression in hippocampus is affected by accelerated cognitive impairment in Senescence-Accelerated Mouse (SAM P8) strain. We show that the expression of genes associated with stress response and xenobiotic metabolism are strongly affected at a time when cognitive impairment occurs. Affected genes include those involved both in signaling and chaperone function. The effector and regulator family of chaperones, which play an important role in protein folding, and also the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes that play crucial role in antioxidant systems, show significant changes in gene expression between 4 and 12 months.
