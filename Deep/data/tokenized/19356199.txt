Acetylcholine (ACh) release in the dorsal hippocampus increases during stress, exploration or learning, exhibiting sex-specific 24-h release profile. We review the role of gonadal steroids on the ACh release in the dorsal hippocampus. In our studies, we found that male rats showed higher extracellular ACh levels than females, but gonadectomy decreased ACh levels in both sexes of rats and subsequently eliminated the sex difference. To examine the sex difference under comparable gonadal steroid levels, we implanted steroid capsules after gonadectomy. Oestradiol supplementation maintained circulating oestradiol to the levels in proestrous female rats, whereas testosterone capsules maintained circulating testosterone to the levels similar to intact male rats. Under comparable gonadal steroids levels, ACh levels were sex-specific. Testosterone replacement in orchidectomised rats clearly restored ACh levels, which were greater than ovariectomised testosterone-primed rats. Similarly, oestradiol replacement in ovariectomised rats successfully restored ACh levels, which were higher than orchidectomised oestradiol-primed rats. These results suggest sex-specific activational effects of gonadal steroids on ACh release. To further examine the organisational effect, female pups were neonatally treated with oil, testosterone, oestradiol, or dihydrotestosterone. These rats were bilaterally ovariectomised and a testosterone capsule was implanted at postnatal week 8. Neonatal treatment of either testosterone or oestradiol clearly increased ACh levels, whereas neonatal dihydrotestosterone treatment failed to change levels. These results suggest that: (i) gonadal steroids maintain the sex-specific ACh release in the dorsal hippocampus and (ii) neonatal activation of oestrogen receptors is sufficient to mediate masculinisation of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system.
