The author reviews relevant data on the neuropathology and molecular genetics of schizophrenia. Anatomical alterations are localized mainly in the hippocampus, dorsal thalamus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and involve the morphology and molecular structure of the neurons and synapses. Several susceptibility genes [including COMT, dysbindin, neuregulin, DISCI, RGS4, GRM3, G72, PPP3CC, CHRNA7, PRODH2, Aktl, 5qGABA(A)] having physiological function in the brain have been identified and this supports the view of schizophrenia as a disorder of cerebral synaptic function. NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate transmission may be particularly involved, but disturbances of dopamine and GABA signalling seem to be linked as well. Based on recent data, an agreement is emerging between the roles of the genes on the molecular and synaptic levels and the understanding of the disorder at the neural systems level.
