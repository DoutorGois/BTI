Alterations in 45Ca uptake and retention as well as total intracellular calcium content were measured in hippocampal 'in vitro' slice preparations following the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurones. The results indicate that tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer-commissural input produces a significant increase in the uptake and retention of calcium which parallels LTP of the CA1 population spike response.
