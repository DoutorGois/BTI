In order to study the effects of cypermethrin and permethrin insecticides on the glutamate uptake of rat brain, brain synaptic vesicles and cypermethrin or permethrin were incubated with 3H-glutamate (37 KBq, 1 mumol/L). The radio activity was detected by a liquid scintillation counter. The results showed that cypermethrin and permethrin in the concentration of 10(-9)-10(-4) mol/L could inhibit the high affinity uptake of glutamate in the synaptosomes of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum in a dose-response manner. Cypermethrin was more powerful than permethrin at the same dose. It was concluded that glutamate uptake inhibition might play a vital role in the neurotoxicity induced by pyrethroid insecticides.
