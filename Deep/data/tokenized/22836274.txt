Many studies have reported the roles played by regulated proteolysis in synaptic plasticity and memory, but the role of autophagy in neurons remains unclear. In mammalian cells, autophagy functions in the clearance of long-lived proteins and organelles and in adaptation to starvation. In neurons, although autophagy-related proteins (ATGs) are highly expressed, autophagic activity markers, autophagosome (AP) number, and light chain protein 3-II (LC3-II) are low compared with other cell types. In contrast, conditional knock-out of ATG5 or ATG7 in mouse brain causes neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits. Therefore, this study aimed to test whether autophagy is especially regulated in neurons to adapt to brain functions. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, we found that KCl depolarization transiently increased LC3-II and AP number, which was partially inhibited with APV, an NMDA receptor (NMDAR) inhibitor. Brief low-dose NMDA, a model of chemical long-term depression (chem-LTD), increased LC3-II with a time course coincident with Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) dephosphorylation and degradation of GluR1, an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit. Downstream of NMDAR, the protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor okadaic acid, PTEN inhibitor bpV(HOpic), autophagy inhibitor wortmannin, and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of ATG7 blocked chem-LTD-induced autophagy and partially recovered GluR1 levels. After chem-LTD, GFP-LC3 puncta increased in spines and in dendrites when AP-lysosome fusion was blocked. These results indicate that neuronal stimulation induces NMDAR-dependent autophagy through PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway inhibition, which may function in AMPAR degradation, thus suggesting autophagy as a contributor to NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity and brain functions.
