We sought to construct the adenoviral vector carrying the gene encoding mouse telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTERT), as well as detect its expression and effect on the proliferation of neuronal stem cells. mTERT was amplified by RT-PCR and then the eukaryotic expression vector of pDC-EGFP-TERT was constructed. After DNA sequence analysis, we detected that there were 293 cells transfected with pDC-EGFP-TERT and helper adenovirus plasmid pBHG lox DeltaE1, and three Cre using Lipofectamine 2000 mediation, named Ad-mTERT-GFP, to package adenoviral particles. The Ad-mTERT-GFP was used to infect neuronal stem cells and then the expression and activity of mTERT were detected. In addition, Bromodeoxyuridine labeling test identified the impact of mTERT overexpression on proliferation of neuronal stem cells. The recombinant adenoviral vector confirmed that mTERT was successfully constructed. Overexpression of mTERT stimulated the proliferation of neuronal stem cells both in vitro and in vivo. mTERT overexpression via adenoviral vector carrying mTERT cDNA upregulated the ability of proliferation in neuronal stem cells.
