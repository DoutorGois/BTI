Cholecystokinin (CCK) binding sites were assessed in post-mortem brain membrane preparations from controls and schizophrenic patients. 125I-BH CCK33 specific binding was reduced by 40% (p less than 0.02) in the hippocampus and by 20% (p less than 0.01) in the frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients compared with controls. There were no differences in 125I-BH CCK33 binding between the two groups in the amygdala, temporal cortex or caudate nucleus.
