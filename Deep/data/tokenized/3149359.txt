Epileptic photosensitivity was acquired as a result of kindling in the lateral geniculate body (GL), and a GL-kindled cat pretreated with DL-allylglycine was found to be a useful model of epilepsy for assessing the efficacy of anticonvulsant drugs. In the present study the acute anticonvulsant effects of sodium valproate (VPA) were examined in the GL-kindled cat under DL-allylglycine. An intravenous injection of VPA at 50 mg/kg induced a protective action against photically induced seizures and paroxysmal EEG activities. This protection persisted for up to 4 hours of the observation period and corresponded to plasma concentrations (61 to 123 micrograms/ml) similar to those considered therapeutic in humans. The present findings are consistent with those obtained in other animal models of photosensitive epilepsy, and lend experimental support to the idea that VPA possesses antiepileptic activity in human photosensitive epilepsy.
