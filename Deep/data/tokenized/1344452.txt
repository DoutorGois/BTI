The investigations were aimed at the study of effects of preparations which belong to the benzodiazepine group-Clonazepam (CZ), on total bioelectric activity (EEG) and epileptic discharge induced by electrostimulation of the hippocampus in the experimental animals (awake adult rabbits). Clonazepam was administered both intramuscularly (i.m.) and intravenously (i.v.) at a dose of 0.2-2.5 mg/kg of the body mass. The obtained results show that the administration of clonazepam prolongs the duration and the arrangement of the spindle in the bioelectric activity in rabbits and stops epileptic attacks of the grand mal type.
