In rat hippocampus, the mineralocorticoid receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor bind corticosterone with high affinity. We have studied the association of these receptors with the nuclear matrix both after in vivo and in vitro administration of radiolabelled corticosterone to hippocampus cells. It was found that in vivo 100% and in vitro 60% of the corticosterone that specifically bound to rat hippocampus nuclei was attached to the nuclear matrix. A selective glucocorticoid receptor agonist did not compete for corticosterone binding. This indicates that this binding was mediated by the mineralocorticoid receptor rather than the glucocorticoid receptor.
