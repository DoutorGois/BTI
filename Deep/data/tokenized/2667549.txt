Evidence for different types of memory in mice may lead to development of animal models for human memory disorders and provides informations on neurobiological systems underlying these processes. Series of experiments in mice, using a 8-arm radial maze with or without cholinergic drugs or chronic alcohol consumption supply arguments for multiple memory stores and for cholinergic influence greatest for short-term system. Studies of differential cholinergic activation following training militate for dissociation in time of hippocampal and cortical cholinergic pathways. Age-related memory involvement seems to be associated with an attenuation of central cholinergic activation. Several problems inherent to sensitivity and selectivity of the tasks remain in discussion.
