Neurogenesis occurs in the adult hippocampus and is promoted by various stimulatory factors, such as enriched environments, running exercises, learning and dietary restriction. We have previously shown that the promotion of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus by running wheel exercise is mediated by NMDA receptors. In the present study, we report that dietary restriction enhanced the hippocampal neurogenesis in mice lacking NMDA receptor epsilon1 subunit as well as wild-type mice. This result suggests that the molecular mechanism by which dietary restriction promotes adult neurogenesis may be, in contrast to that of running exercise, independent on the NMDA receptor functions.
