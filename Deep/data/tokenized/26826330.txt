kappa opioid receptor agonists produce aversive effects in rodents, however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been discovered to play a critical role in the modulation of affective behaviors. The present study was undertaken to detect the possible involvement of p38 MAPK in the aversive effects induced by kappa opioid receptor activation. We found that the kappa opioid receptor agonist trans-(+/-)-3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzenacetamid e methanesulfonate salt (U50,488H) produced significant place aversion in mice as measured by the conditioned place preference procedure, accompanied with significant p38 MAPK activation in the amygdala, but not in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Stereotaxic microinjection of the p38 MAPK inhibitor 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridy-l)-1H-imidazole (SB203580) into amygdala significantly inhibited p38 MAPK activation and completely blocked the conditioned place aversion in mice. Thus, these results suggested that activation of p38 MAPK in the amygdala was required to mediate kappa opioid receptor-induced aversive behavior.
