Recording of the PO2 dynamics in the hippocampus and sensorimotor cortex revealed that the level of PO2 changes rather easily and dramatically depending on emotional tension of the organism during different phases of sleep and wakefulness and being, probably, related to the functional shifts occurring in these structures. On the basis of the percentage of periodical constituents of the PO2 oscillations it may be concluded that the functional activity in the dorsal hippocampus is enhanced during active wakefulness and paradoxical phase of sleep (PS); while during passive wakefulness and slow sleep it is depressed. The maximum occurs in the PS and minimum--in the slow sleep.
