Diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate (DFP), an insecticide, is a potent anticholinesterase that binds essentially irreversibly to acetylcholinesterase, resulting in severe, acute neurologic pathology, and less severe, but longer-lasting, delayed neuropathy. We report here on the short-term effects of bath-applied DFP on extracellularly recorded responses from CA3 and CA1 of rat hippocampus. Exposure to 10 microM DFP evokes low amplitude, spontaneous bursts in CA3 generally within 10 minutes, and the bursting does not reverse with washing. The CA1 neuronal population usually bursts synchronously with CA3, but the population events are of low amplitude and sometimes not detectable, implying a differential sensitivity to DFP. These effects were partially blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine, while the cholinergic antagonist gallamine had little effect. Also, the reversible anticholinesterase physostigmine could, within temporal limits, protect slices from DFP's effects, implicating the cholinergic system as the probable mediator in the first stages of DFP-induced epileptogenesis.
