The present study was designed to investigate the possible effects of chronic aluminium exposure on the various aspects of calcium homeostasis in rat brain. Chronic aluminium administration caused significant rise in the intrasynaptosomal calcium levels. The activity of major calcium-expelling enzyme, i.e. Ca2+ ATPase was found to be lowered. Also, the calcium uptake via voltage-operated calcium channels increased significantly. Similar to the increase in intrasynaptosomal calcium, calpain activity was found to be increased. The results presented here, indicate that the toxic effects of aluminium could be mediated through modifications in the intracellular calcium homeostasis, which may lead to impaired neuronal function.
