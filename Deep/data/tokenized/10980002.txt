Previous work has shown that seizure-like activity can disrupt the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). However, how seizure-like event disrupts the LTP induction remains unknown. To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this process better, a set of studies was implemented in area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices using extracellular recording methods. We showed here that prior transient seizure-like activity generated by perfused slices with Mg(2+)-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) exhibited a persistent suppression of LTP induction. This effect lasted between 2 and 3 h after normal ACSF replacement and was specifically inhibited by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphovaleric acid (D-APV) and L-type voltage-operated Ca(2+) channel (VOCC) blocker nimodipine, but not by non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). In addition, this suppressive effect was specifically blocked by the selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor NPC-15437. However, neither Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN-62 nor cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Rp-adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphothioate (Rp-cAMPS) affected this suppressive effect. This persistent suppression of LTP was not secondary to the long-lasting changes in NMDA receptor activation, because the isolated NMDA receptor-mediated responses did not show a long-term enhancement in response to a 30-min Mg(2+)-free ACSF application. Additionally, in prior Mg(2+)-free ACSF-treated slices, the entire frequency-response curve of LTP and long-term depression (LTD) is shifted systematically to favor LTD. These results suggest that the increase of Ca(2+) influx through NMDA channels and L-type VOCCs in turn triggering a PKC-dependent signaling cascade is a possible cellular basis underlying this seizure-like activity-induced inhibition of LTP.
