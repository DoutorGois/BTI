Atorvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering statin that has been shown to exert several pleiotropic effects in the nervous system as a neuroprotective and antidepressant-like agent. Antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin in mice is mediated by glutamatergic and serotoninergic receptors, although the precise intracellular signaling pathways involved are unknown. PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway has been associated to neurobiology of depression and seems to be modulated by some pharmacological antidepressant strategies. The present study investigated the participation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of an acute atorvastatin treatment in mice. Atorvastatin sub-effective (0.01 mg/kg) or effective (0.1 mg/kg) doses in the tail suspension test (TST) was administered orally alone or in combination with PI3K, GSK-3beta or mTOR inhibitors. The administration of PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10 nmol/site, i.c.v) completely prevented the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.). The participation of GSK-3beta in the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin was demonstrated by co-administration of a sub-effective dose of atorvastatin (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) with AR-A014418 (0.01 mug/site, i.c.v., a selective GSK-3beta inhibitor) or with lithium chloride (10 mg/kg, p.o., a non-selective GSK-3beta inhibitor). The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (0.2 nmol/site, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent atorvastatin (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) antidepressant-like effect. These behavioral findings were supported by neurochemical observations, as atorvastatin treatment increased the immunocontent of the phosphorylated isoforms of Akt, GSK-3beta and mTOR in the hippocampus of mice. Taken together, our results suggest an involvement of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta/mTOR signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin in mice.
