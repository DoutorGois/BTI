Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 3.3 mM) partially reversed the hypoxic depression of the evoked population spike recorded from CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. It is known that elevated endogenous adenosine contributes to the hypoxic inhibition of the population spike. Exogenous adenosine (100 microM) inhibited the population spike that had been partially resuscitated by H2O2 during maintained hypoxia. It is concluded that the ability of H2O2 to oppose hypoxic depression does not occur at the level of the adenosine receptor since added adenosine was still effective in inhibiting the evoked potential in the presence of H2O2.
