Long-term potentiation (LTP) can be initiated in CA1, but not in the dentate, region of slices from rats with bilateral subcortical deafferentation at 8 week survival time. At about one week survival time, LTP is present in the CA1 region of all and also in the dentate of about 50% of slices. The results suggest that subcortical cholinergic and catecholaminergic inputs are not required for the LTP in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus.
