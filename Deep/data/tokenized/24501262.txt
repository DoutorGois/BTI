Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disabilities, ataxia, and unusually happy affect. The hippocampal pyramidal cells of Angelman syndrome model mice have altered intrinsic membrane properties, which Kaphzan et al. (Cell Rep 4: 405-412, 2013) demonstrate can be corrected by genetic reduction of the alpha1-subunit of the sodium-potassium ATPase. Intriguingly, this manipulation also restores hippocampal long-term potentiation and learning. In this Neuro Forum, we discuss translational implications of this work and remaining questions left in its wake.
