Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins play an important role in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and the activity of some GPCRs is modulated via RGS protein levels during stress response. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in RGS protein mRNA expressions in the mouse brain after 2h restraint stress. The mRNA level of 19 RGS proteins was analyzed using real-time PCR in six brain regions, which included the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, and pituitary gland, from control and stressed mouse. We found that the level of mRNA of each RGS varied according to brain region and that two to eight RGS proteins exhibited changes in mRNA levels in each brain region by restraint stress. It was also revealed that RGS4 protein amount was consistent with mRNA level, indicating RGS4 protein may have regulatory roles in the acute stress response.
