5 alpha-Pregnan-3 alpha ol-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP) reduced the depolarization-induced loss of GABA and, to a lesser extent, the glutamate-like immunoreactivities from nerve terminals in the in vitro hippocampal slice. Phenobarbital (PB) had similar effects. These results suggest that 3 alpha-OH-DHP affects presynaptic transmitter release, possibly in a barbiturate-like manner.
