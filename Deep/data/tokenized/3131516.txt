The distribution of [3H]kainic acid binding sites was studied in the primate brain using semiquantitative autoradiography. The highest levels of binding were observed in the hippocampal area CA3 and the dentate gyrus. The deep layers of pyriform, cingulate and insular cortex, the central nucleus of the amygdala and the caudate nucleus also displayed high levels of [3H]kainic acid binding. Although these areas receive putative excitatory amino acid-containing afferents, other regions containing a similar input displayed low levels of binding. Some similarities were apparent between the distribution of binding sites and pathological changes in human neurodegenerative disorders such as temporal lobe epilepsy.
