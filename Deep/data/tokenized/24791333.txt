Human nerve growth factor (NGF) mimetic hexamethylenediamide bis-N-monosuccinyl-glicyl-lysine) (GK-2(h)) demonstrates protective activity on immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line HT22 in a concentration up to 10(-13)M against hydrogen peroxide toxicity and in concentration up to 10(-8) M against glutamate toxicity. GK-2(h) dipeptide protects rat PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells in a concentration up to 10(-7) M and protects human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells in a concentration up to 10(-8) against 6-hydroxydofamine-induced damage.
