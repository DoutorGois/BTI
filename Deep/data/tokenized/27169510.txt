An important new study by Kvarta, Bradbrook, Dantrassy, Bailey, and Thompson (J Neurophysiol 114: 1713-1724, 2015) examined the effects of persistent stress and excessive glucocorticoid levels on hippocampal function and emotional behavior in rodents. The authors specifically implicate the temporoammonic pathway as being susceptible to reductions in excitatory function in the context of chronic stress. We discuss the importance of this new finding in the broader context of medication development for major depressive disorder.
