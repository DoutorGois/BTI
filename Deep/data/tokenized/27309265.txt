Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disorder with multiple pathophysiological causes, destructive outcomes, and no available definitive cure. Pelargonidin (Pel), an anthocyanin derivative, is an estrogen receptor agonist with little estrogen side effects. This study was designed to assess Pel memory enhancing effects on the a rat Amyloid Beta25-35 (Abeta) intrahippocampal microinjections model of AD in the passive avoidance task performance paradigm and further evaluate the potential estrogen receptor role on the memory-evoking compound. Equally divided rats were assigned to 5 groups of sham, Abeta intrahippocampal microinjected, Pel pretreated (10 mg/kg; P.O), alpha estrogen antagonist intra-cerebrovascular (i.c.v.) microinjected, and beta estrogen antagonist (i.c.v) microinjected animals. Intrahippocampal microinjections of Abeta were adopted to provoke AD model. Passive avoidance task test was also used to assess memory performance. Pel pretreatment prior to Abeta microinjections significantly improved step-through latency (P<0.001) in passive avoidance test. In alpha and beta estrogen, antagonists received animals, passive avoidance task performance was not statistically changed (P=0.11 & P=0.41 respectively) compared to Pel pretreated and sham animals. Our results depicted that Pel improves Abeta induced memory dysfunction in passive avoidance test performance through estrogen receptor independently related pathways.
