OBJECTIVES: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection can induce neurocognitive complications classified as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). The chitinase family is associated with innate immunity cells and many infectious diseases. METHODS: We analyzed microarray datasets obtained from NCBI in order to verify the expression of chitinase family genes in hippocampus of uninfected rhesus macaques versus those with histopathologic evidence of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Encephalitis (SIVE). Moreover, we have analysed two human microarray datasets to verify the results obtained in macaques hippocampus affected by SIVE. For these studies, we have also used the open source tools Genome-scale Integrated Analysis of gene Networks in Tissues (GIANT) to identify the chitinase genes network. RESULTS: CHIT1, CHI3L1 and CHI3L2 levels were significantly increased in SIVE hippocampus as compared to non-infected control specimens. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between CHIA vs. Brain Viral Load (BVL). These data was confirmed partially in human brain section of HAD/HIVE subjects. Also, we showed that HIV-1 was able to modulate the expression of CHIT1, CHI3L1, CHI3L2 and CHID1 in human macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that chitinase gene expression is altered in SIVE and in HAD/HIVE brain sections and call for more studies examining whether this is a protective immunological reaction or a destructive tissue response to encephalitis.
