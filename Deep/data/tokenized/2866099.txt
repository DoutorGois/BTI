In rat hippocampal slices, sensitivity of CA1 neuronal somata to iontophoretically applied glutamate pulses was reduced subsequent to: (1) a 20 Hz tetanic stimulation of stratum radiatum; (2) an application of N-methyl-DL-aspartate or glutamate or Ca2+. This decreased responsiveness was sometimes followed by an increase. Ca2+ antagonists, verapamil and Mn2+, interfered with the induction of the above changes in sensitivity to glutamate pulses. No correlation was observed between alterations in sensitivity of these neurons to glutamate and changes in synaptically-induced responses. These results suggest that a build-up of CA1 cell Ca2+ could be involved in decreasing the responsiveness (desensitization of receptors?) of the neuron to applied glutamate leading to a compensatory increase in the sensitivity.
