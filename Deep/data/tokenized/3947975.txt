To study the effects of active oxygen on neuronal electrophysiology, hippocampal brain slices were exposed to hydrogen peroxide plus ferrous sulfate which react to produce hydroxyl free radicals. Analysis of extracellularly recorded somatic and dendritic responses to orthodromic stimulation indicated a decrease in both synaptic efficacy and impairment of action potential generation.
