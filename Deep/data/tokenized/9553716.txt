We have isolated and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of canine metallothionein-III (MT-III) cDNA. The predicted amino acid sequence of the canine MT-III showed a high homology (93%, 87% identity) to that of human and mouse MT-III. The canine MT-III had 2 insertions relative to known mammalian MT-I and MT-II: a threonine after the 4th amino acid and a block of 6 amino acids near the carboxyl terminus. Expression of the canine MT-III mRNA was found exclusively in the central nervous system, where neurons in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral cortex showed predominant signals.
