This study was undertaken in order to investigate the role of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II, c-fos, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and nNOS in the cellular processes following a penetrating brain injury. IGF-II mRNA levels, as determined by Northern analysis, were decreased at 4, 8, and 24 h after brain injury, in the lesioned, compared to the contralateral intact hemisphere. Forty-eight and 72 h after the injury, there was no difference between the lesioned and the contralateral intact hemisphere in IGF-II mRNA levels. c-fos mRNA levels followed a parallel, but opposite course: They were increased at 4, 8 and 24 h after the injury, while at 48 and 72 h c-fos mRNA levels in the lesioned hemisphere did not differ from those in the intact. Administration of MK-801 reversed the injury-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA levels. Administration of MK-801 resulted in an increase in IGF-II mRNA in both the intact and the lesioned hemispheres. Brain injury resulted in an increase in nNOS immunopositive cells in the hippocampal formation, which was detectable at 4 and 12, but not 48 h after the injury. These results suggest that IGF-II, c-fos, NMDA receptors and nNOS are involved in the cellular responses to brain injury.
