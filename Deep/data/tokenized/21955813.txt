The aim of this work was to explore the applicable value of (1)H-MRS evaluation on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation by quantitative analysis of metabolite changes in the hippocampal area in AbetaPP/PS1 transgenic (tg) mice. The tg mice (n = 30) aged 12 months were randomized into two subgroups: One receiving NSCs and the other receiving PBS transplantation in the bilateral hippocampal CA1 region. The wild-type mice (n = 15) were used as the control group. (1)H-MRS was performed before transplantation and 6 weeks after transplantation to measure the change of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), myo-inositol (mI), glutamate (Glu), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr) in the hippocampus. Results showed NAA and Glu levels were increased and mI level was decreased in NSC group compared with the PBS group at six weeks after transplantation (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in NAA and Glu (p > 0.05), and there was significant difference in mI (p < 0.05) between NSC and control groups. However, there was no significant difference in Cho before and after transplantation among the three groups (p > 0.05). Histology showed the number of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region increased significantly in the NSC group than those in the PBS group (p < 0.05), and the number of astrocytes significantly decreased in the NSC group compared with the PBS group. Ultrastructure showed that the neurons in the NSC group were morphologically normal. In conclusion, (1)H-MRS can display intracranial metabolite changes before and after NSC transplantation in tg mice and has a applicable value in evaluating the therapeutic effect of NSCs on AD.
