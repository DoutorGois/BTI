Cerebral ischemia was induced in Mongolian gerbils by bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries. Subsequent histological assessment revealed neuronal degeneration in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. A functional behavioral change was reflected in an elevation of motor activity compared with sham-operated animals. The degree of hippocampal damage was positively correlated with the increase in motor activity. It is concluded that alterations in both measures result from the interruption of blood flow to the brain but may be brought about by different mechanisms.
