INTRODUCTION: We attempted to extend findings of a relationship between formal thought disorder and left superior temporal gyrus (STG) volume in schizophrenia by examining two indices of formal thought disorder. METHODS: Three brain regions of interest were selected from magnetic resonance imaging slices in 15 young, right-handed, male schizophrenia patients: the STG, the anterior hippocampus, and the amygdala. Thought disorder was assessed using the Bizarre-Idiosyncratic Thinking (BIZ) scale, a sensitive measure of formal thought disorder based on responses to a standard set of stimuli, and the BPRS Conceptual Disorganization item, a global rating based on a clinical interview. RESULTS: BIZ ratings of thought disorder were significantly correlated with the left STG volume (Spearman r = -.73) and with the right STG volume (Spearman r = -.58). BIZ ratings were not significantly correlated with either the left or right anterior hippocampus or amygdala volumes. The BPRS Conceptual Disorganisation rating was not significantly related to the STG, anterior hippocampus, or amygdala volumes. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the previously reported association between the left STG and formal thought disorder, and suggests that detection of this relationship may be facilitated by use of highly sensitive formal thought disorder assessments.
