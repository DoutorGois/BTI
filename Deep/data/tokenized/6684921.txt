The incorporation of L-[1-3H]fucose into total proteins was measured in hippocampal and striatal slices of dopamine-supersensitive and control rats. Compared with controls, striatal slices of supersensitive animals exhibited an augmented stimulation of L-fucose incorporation by 5 X 10(-5) M dopamine. This result supports former data about a dopamine-receptor mediated regulation of protein glycosylation in the nervous tissue.
