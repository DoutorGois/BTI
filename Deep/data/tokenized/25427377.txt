The aim of the work was the analysis of the changes in a number of labile synaptopodin-positi- ve dendritic spines in parietal cortex and the CA1 field of the hippocampus, which characterize plasticity of intracellular interaction, and of the memorization after short-term repeated immobili- zation stress (daily for 5 minutes, 10 days), both in control rats and in rats subjected to prenatal hypoxia (E14, 7% of O2, 3 hours). There were observed deterioration of short-term and long-term memory, decrease in number labile spines in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (for 17.3 +/- 10.4%; p </= 0.05) and their increase in a molecular layer of brain parietal cortex (for 36.9 +/- 9.2%) at the adult rats with normal embryogenesis after immobilization stress in comparison with control intact animals. At the rats subjected to a prenatal hypoxia, regardless of that, they were ex- posed to an immobilized stress at an adult stage or not, was noted both violation of short-term and long-term memory, and decrease in number labile spines in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (for 22.9 +/- 10.5%) and parietal cortex (for 28.1 +/- 9.3%). The obtained data allow to conclude that the increase of plasticity providing adaptive behavior of animals, takes place in neocortical neuronal networks as a reply to a short-term repeating stress only at normal brain formation during embryo- genesis, while, violation of embryogenesis leads to decrease in plasticity and adaptive opportuni- ties of the nervous system during further ontogenesis.
