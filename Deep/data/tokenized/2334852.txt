Wet dog shaking elicited by systemic administration of kainic acid is eliminated by bilateral destruction of ventral dentate granule cells. In contrast, wet dog shaking induced by naltrexone precipitated abstinence in morphine-dependent rats is unaffected by destruction of ventral dentate granule cells. It is concluded that at least two anatomically distinct brain regions modulate wet dog shaking behavior.
