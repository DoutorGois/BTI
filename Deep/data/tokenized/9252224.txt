The subiculum is the major output region of the hippocampal formation. We have studied pyramidal neurons in slices of rat ventral subiculum to determine if there is a correlation between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity and electrophysiological phenotype. The majority of NADPH-d-positive pyramidal neurons were found in the superficial cell layer (i.e. nearest to the hippocampal fissure) of the subiculum and appreciable NADPH-d activity was absent from pyramidal neurons in area CA1. This distribution of NADPH-d activity was mimicked by that of immunoreactivity for the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Subicular pyramidal neurons were classified, electrophysiologically, as intrinsically burst-firing or regular spiking. After electrophysiological characterization, neurons were filled with Neurobiotin and revealed using fluorescence immunocytochemistry. The slices containing these neurons were also processed for NADPH-d. NADPH-d activity was found in six out of eight regular spiking neurons but was not found in any of 13 intrinsically burst-firing neurons (P=0.0008, Fisher's Exact Test). We conclude that in rat ventral subiculum, NADPH-d activity is present in a proportion of pyramidal neurons and indicates the presence of the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase. Furthermore, amongst pyramidal neurons, NADPH-d activity is distributed preferentially to those with the regular spiking phenotype. The distribution of regular spiking neurons suggests that they may not be present to the same extent in all subicular output pathways. Thus, the actions of nitric oxide may be relatively specific to particular hippocampal connections.
