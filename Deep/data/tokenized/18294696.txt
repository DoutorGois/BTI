We present a cellular neuronal network (CNN) based approach to classify magnetic resonance images with and without hippocampal or Ammon's horn sclerosis (AHS) in the medial temporal lobe. A CNN combines the architecture of cellular automata and artificial neural networks and is an array of locally coupled nonlinear electrical circuits or cells, which is capable of processing a large amount of information in parallel and in real time. Using an exemplary database that consists of a large number of volumes of interest extracted from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images from 144 subjects we here demonstrate that the network allows to classify brain tissue with respect to the presence or absence of mesial temporal sclerosis. Results indicate the general feasibility of CNN-based computer-aided systems for diagnosis and classification of images generated by medical imaging systems.
