Following cerebral anoxia, EC a 55-year-old patient, exhibited a severe and clear-cut pattern of semantic impairments without general intellectual deficit or perceptual difficulty. EC demonstrated a complex neuropsychological picture including a massive visual agnosia and a complete lack of imagery, both of which involved all categories of objects (living and non living) and a category-specific word comprehension deficit limited to animal names. Findings are discussed in the light of the theoretical frameworks currently available in the area of neuropsychology. It is argued that neither the single nor the multiple view of semantics fully succeed in providing a satisfactory account of the data and a tentative interpretation of the whole pattern of impairment is proposed in the general framework of non abstractive conceptions of meaning.
