Aged heterozygous Rolling Nagoya mice carrying Cav2.1alpha1 mutation show deficits with regard to spatial short-term memory using hippocampus-related object location test, but not with regard to nonspatial memory using perirhinal cortex-related object recognition test. In hippocampus, wild-type Cav2.1alpha1 mRNA exhibited lower expression and mutant-type expression was higher in aged heterozygous mice. In perirhinal cortex, there were no significantly different expressions. Alteration of age-dependent expressions of Cav2.1 channels differs in different regions with related effects on behavioral performances.
