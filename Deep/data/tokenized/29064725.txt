OBJECTIVE: Despite the important role of alpha2-adrenoceptors in pain modulation processes, the impact of administration of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist and antagonist on the density of hippocampal alpha2-adrenoceptor-immunoreactive neurons has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of single doses of clonidine and yohimbine on the density of alpha2-adrenoceptor-immunoreactive neurons in rat hippocampus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats received a single dose of clonidine (0.7 mg/kg) alone or 5 min after intraperitoneal (1 mg/kg) and/or intracerebroventricular (5 microg/kg) injection of yohimbine. After histological processing, neurons with alpha2-adrenoceptor immunoreactivity were identified and counted through immunohistochemical analysis of hippocampal regions. RESULTS: Clonidine slightly increased the number of alpha2-adrenoceptor-immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampal subregions compared with the normal saline group. Intraperitoneal injection of yohimbine followed by injection of clonidine significantly increased the number of alpha2-adrenoceptor-immunoreactive neurons in subregions cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3). Intracerebroventricular injection of yohimbine after injection of clonidine significantly reduced the number of alpha2-adrenoceptor-immunoreactive neurons in all hippocampal subregions. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that intraperitoneal administration of alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine increases the density of alpha2-adrenoceptor-immunoreactive neurons in rat hippocampus, while intracerebroventricular injection of yohimbine decreases the density of these neurons.
