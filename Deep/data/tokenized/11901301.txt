The sensitivity of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors which regulate synthesis and release of noradrenaline was investigated in hippocampus, parietal cortex, and hypothalamus of rats treated with clorgyline. After administering a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, the in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity and the noradrenaline content were evaluated. Acute and chronic treatment with clorgyline led to both increases of noradrenaline levels and decreases of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, determined as the accumulation of DOPA. Whereas the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine induced a similar reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the group subjected to the acute treatment and in the control group, it failed to do so after chronic clorgyline treatment. In hippocampal and cortical synaptosomes, a reduction in the sensitivity of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors which regulate [(3)H]noradrenaline release, reflected by the shift to the right of the concentration-effect curves for oxymetazoline, was also found after the repeated treatment. These results indicate a desensitization of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors after chronic treatment with clorgyline.
