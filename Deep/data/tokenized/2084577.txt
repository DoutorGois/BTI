Cholecystokinin (CCK) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) are two peptides with opposite effects on the regulation of feeding behaviour. The possible interaction between these two systems has always been controversial. In this study, rat brain NPY levels were assayed after treatment with CCK 8 S and with a potent CCK agonist (Boc-(Nle 28-Nle 31)-CCK 26-33). CCK 8 S and its agonist analogue (50 micrograms/kg i.p.) both decreased hypothalamic and hippocampal NPY levels. This result suggests a negative relationship between NPY and CCK-peptides which is not surprising given their opposite role in the control of feeding. The hypothalamus and secondarily the hippocampus appear to be the site of this interaction; no change in NPY levels was observed in other brain areas (striatum and cortex). The same pattern of variation was found in the plasma, suggesting a direct release from the brain via a mechanism which remains to be investigated. The effect appeared later with the CCK analogue than with CCK 8 S itself; this is not surprising with regard to other behavioural and biochemical effects of the analogue and provides further characterization of its action.
