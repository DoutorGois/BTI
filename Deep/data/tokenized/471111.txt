The effect of the perforant path stimulation on the CA1 and CA3 neurons was investigated in incubated slices of the guinea pig hippocampus. Spike generation was observed in both fields during stimulation of the perforant path. The majority of the CA1 neurons followed rhythmic stimulation up to 30-80/c. The CA3 neurons responded only to low-frequency stimulation (up to 5/c). The posttetanic potentiation of responses to the perforant path stimulation was observed in both hippocampal fields.
