Recent evidence implicates the endogenous excitotoxin, glutamate (Glu), in several neurologic disorders, including seizure-related brain damage. Ketamine, phencyclidine, and MK-801, which are noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of Glu receptor (but do not antagonize kainic acid receptors) were tested in the present study for their effects on behavioral and/or electrographic seizures and seizure-related brain damage induced by kainic acid. Behavioral seizure activity was reduced by these agents, as was spread of electrographic seizures to neocortex, but seizures recorded from deep brain regions such as hippocampus, piriform cortex, and amygdala were not significantly diminished. All three agents prevented seizure-related brain damage in the amygdala, piriform cortex, thalamus, and CA1 region of the hippocampus but conferred little or no protection in the lateral septum and CA3 region of the hippocampus. The regional selectivity of the neuroprotective effect suggests that NMDA receptors may play a more dominant role in seizure-related brain damage in some brain regions than in others. The ability of NMDA antagonists to prevent seizure-related damage in several brain regions without suppressing seizure activity suggests that in these brain regions persistent seizure activity can be maintained by other transmitter systems, with or without NMDA receptor participation, but that seizure-related brain damage is critically dependent on NMDA receptor participation.
