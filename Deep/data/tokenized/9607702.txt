New evidence indicates that neural activity regulates the expression of trophic factors in the brain but regulation of these molecules by select aspects of behaviour remains solely a fascinating possibility. We report that following training in the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task, the hippocampus and cerebellum of learning rats exhibited an increase in basic fibroblast growth factor messenger RNA. Basic fibroblast growth factor messenger RNA levels were higher during the learning of the task and decreased once asymptotic performance was reached, suggesting an involvement of basic fibroblast growth factor in learning/memory. An active control group, which exercised for the same time as the learning group but the spatial learning component of the task was minimized, exhibited a minor increase in basic fibroblast growth factor messenger RNA. The intensification of the physical activity component of the task by massed or intensive training resulted in greater increases in basic fibroblast growth factor messenger RNA for both learning and yoked groups, but levels of basic fibroblast growth factor messenger RNA in the learning group remained higher than yoked only in the cerebellum. Changes in basic fibroblast growth factor were accompanied by an increase in astrocyte density in the hippocampus in agreement with described roles of basic fibroblast growth factor in astrocyte proliferation/reactivity. Results suggest that learning potentiates the effects of physical activity on trophic factor induction in select brain regions. Trophic factor involvement in behaviour may provide a molecular basis for the enhanced cognitive function associated with active lifestyles, and guide development of strategies to improve rehabilitation and successful ageing.
