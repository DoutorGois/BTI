Ether-a-go-go (ERG) K(+) channel is a channel of potassium inward rectification. ERG channelopathy may be a cause of sudden unwanted death. The purpose of our study is to assess the effect of antiepileptic drugs on the expression of ERG K(+) channel in the hippocampus using seizure resistant (SR) and seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils. As compared to controls, in principal neuron of hippocampus ERG immunoreactivity was significantly decreased after administration of AEDs in SS and SR gerbils. In addition, population spike in response to the second stimulus disappeared, thus population spike amplitude ratio was significantly reduced to zero. These findings indicate that AEDs reduce the expression of ERG channel in the hippocampus of the SR and SS gerbils accompanied by the enhancement of paired-pulse inhibition. In addition, the influence of AEDs on ERG expression in the brain may not be relevant to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
