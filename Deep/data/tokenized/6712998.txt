Stochastic oscillations imitating postsynaptic activity in the excitatory neurons are produced by a nonlinear difference equation which does not contain any sources of noise. The given back inhibition via inhibitory interneurons presents a negative feedback loop due to which oscillations in the model system are realized. By means of variation of parameters of the system the patterns of stochastic oscillations can be changed in wide range of physiologically meaningful patterns of the neuronal activity.
