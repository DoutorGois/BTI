1. M1 muscarinic (3H-pirenzepine) and 3H-L-nicotine binding were measured in the hippocampus of male Wistar rats aged 3-4, 10-11 and 24-25 months. 2. The maximal number of M1 binding sites did not differ between age groups. 3. The dissociation constant of M1 binding was higher in old rats than in young rats. 4. The binding of 3H-L-nicotine did not differ between age groups. 5. The number of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors may be preserved, but the conformation of these receptors in the rat hippocampus may be altered during aging.
