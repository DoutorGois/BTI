Cadmium (Cd) has long been known to induce neurological degenerative disorders. We studied effects of l-theanine, one of the major amino acid components in green tea, on Cd-induced brain injury in mice. Male ICR mice were intraperitoneally injected with l-theanine (100 or 200mg/kg/day) or saline and after one hour these mice were orally administrated with CdCl2 (3.75-6mg/kg). The treatment was conducted for 8 weeks. l-Theanine significantly reduced Cd level in the mouse brain and plasma. Cd-induced neuronal cell death in the mouse cortex and hippocampus were apparently inhibited by l-theanine treatment. l-Theanine also decreased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS, and obviously elevated the levels of glutathione (GSH) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the mouse brain. Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is proposed to be an early event for the evolution of tau pathology, and may play an important role in Cd-induced neurodegeneration. Our results showed that l-theanine significantly suppressed Cd-induced tau protein hyperphosphorylation at Ser199, Ser202, and Ser396. Mechanism study showed that l-theanine inhibited the activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) which contributed to the hyperphosphorylation of tau and Cd-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, l-theanine reduced Cd-induced cytotoxicity possibly by interfering with the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, our study indicated that l-theanine protected mice against Cd-induced neurotoxicity through reducing brain Cd level and relieved oxidative damage and tau hyperphosphorylation. Our foundings provide a novel insight into the potential use of l-theanine as prophylactic and therapeutic agents for Cd-induced neurodegenerative diseases.
