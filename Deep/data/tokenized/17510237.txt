We have previously shown that recombinant human (rh) IGF-I induces cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus of hypophysectomized rats. In the current investigation, we determined the effects of rhIGF-I on proliferation and differentiation in the cerebral cortex. Adult hypophysectomized rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label newborn cells (once a day for the first 5 d), and rhIGF-I was administered peripherally for 6 or 20 d. In the cerebral cortex, the number of BrdU-labeled cells increased after 20 d but not after 6 d of rhIGF-I infusion. This suggests that rhIGF-I enhances the survival of newborn cells in the cerebral cortex. Using BrdU labeling combined with the oligodendrocyte-specific markers myelin basic protein and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase, we demonstrated an increase in oligodendrogenesis in the cerebral cortex. The total amount of myelin basic protein and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase was also increased on Western blots of homogenates of the cerebral cortex, confirming the immunohistochemical findings. Also, we observed an increase in the number of capillary-associated BrdU-positive cells, although total capillary area was not increased. rhIGF-I treatment did not affect cortical astrogliogenesis and neurogenesis was not observed. The ability of rhIGF-I to induce cortical oligodendrogenesis may have implications for the regenerative potential of the cortex.
