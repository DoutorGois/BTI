Tosyl-polyamine derivatives such as N-{4-[4-(guanidinobutylamino)-butylamino]butyl}-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide trihydrochroride (TsHSPMG) have been found to strongly inhibit macroscopic currents through heteromeric N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B) and Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (homomeric glutamate receptor 1) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes on voltage-clamp recording. In the present study, it was found that the inhibition of NMDA receptor activity induced by tosyl-polyamine derivatives was voltage-dependent. Some mutations located in the intracellular region of the channel pore, such as NR1 E621Q and NR2B W607L, reduced the inhibition by tosyl-polyamine derivatives, suggesting that tosyl-polyamine derivatives penetrate deeply into the channel pore of NMDA receptors. The neuroprotective effects of tosyl-polyamine derivatives against cell injury caused by NMDA were investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Addition of 1 microM TsHSPMG to medium ablated the neurotoxicity induced by NMDA, and a similar effect was observed with 30 microM memantine. The neuroprotective effects of tosyl-polyamine derivatives on NMDA-induced seizures in mice were also assayed. Intracerebroventricular or intravenous injection of TsHSPMG (0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg) decreased the seizures induced by intraperitoneal injection of NMDA in mice. These findings indicate that tosyl-polyamine derivatives exhibit neuroprotective effects not only in primary cultured neurons but also in mice.
