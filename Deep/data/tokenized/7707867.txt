Regulation by adrenal steroids of neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA was investigated in hilus of the dentate gyrus, arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus and locus coeruleus (LC) of the adult rat brain. Adrenalectomy (ADX) increased NPY mRNA in hilus but decreased NPY mRNA levels in arcuate nucleus and LC. Using a steroid replacement paradigm previously shown to discriminate between Type I and Type II adrenal steroid receptor mediated effects, it was shown that Type I receptor stimulation by aldosterone prevented the ADX-induced increase of NPY mRNA in hilus, whereas Type II receptor stimulation by Ru28362 prevented the ADX-induced decrease in NPY mRNA in arcuate nucleus and LC. The results for hilus are consistent with evidence for a role of Type I receptors in maintaining levels of a number of gene products associated with neurotransmission. The different regulation in hilus from that in arcuate and LC indicate, along with evidence for regulation of NYP expression by insulin, NGF and cyclic AMP and phorbol esters, that the adrenal steroid regulation of NPY gene expression is part of a complex set of regulatory mechanisms that depend on the brain region and cell type.
