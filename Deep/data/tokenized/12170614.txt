The effect of septal lesions upon the AChE (EC 3.1.1.7) isoenzymic pattern in the hippocampus of the rat brain was studied 1-3 months after surgery by means of polyacrylamide disc electrophoresis. Alterations in the isoenzymic pattern were found in the membrane-bound but not in the soluble fraction of the enzyme. In addition to the two slowly migrating bands seen in the membrane-bound AChE fraction of the normal hippocampus, the fast-migrating isoenzyme becomes visible.
