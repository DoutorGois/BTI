Translation of mRNA in axons and dendrites enables a rapid supply of proteins to specific sites of localization within the neuron. Distinct mRNA-containing cargoes, including granules and mitochondrial mRNA, are transported within neuronal projections. The distributions of these cargoes appear to change during neuronal development, but details on the dynamics of mRNA transport during these transitions remain to be elucidated. For this study, we have developed imaging and image processing methods to quantify several transport parameters that can define the dynamics of RNA transport and localization. Using these methods, we characterized the transport of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial mRNA in differentiated axons and dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons varying in developmental maturity. Our results suggest differences in the transport profiles of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial mRNA, and differences in transport parameters at different time points, and between axons and dendrites. Furthermore, within the non-mitochondrial mRNA pool, we observed two distinct populations that differed in their fluorescence intensity and velocity. The net axonal velocity of the brighter pool was highest at day 7 (0.002+/-0.001 microm/s, mean +/- SEM), raising the possibility of a presynaptic requirement for mRNA during early stages of synapse formation. In contrast, the net dendritic velocity of the brighter pool increased steadily as neurons matured, with a significant difference between day 12 (0.0013+/-0.0006 microm/s ) and day 4 (-0.003+/-0.001 microm/s) suggesting a postsynaptic role for mRNAs in more mature neurons. The dim population showed similar trends, though velocities were two orders of magnitude higher than of the bright particles. This study provides a baseline for further studies on mRNA transport, and has important implications for the regulation of neuronal plasticity during neuronal development and in response to neuronal injury.
