It was shown in experiments in rats that the increase in the level of endogenous acetylcholine induced by galanthamine entails a reduction in Na+, K+-ATPase of neocortical, hippocampal and truncus cerebri microsomes, and in the content of lactic acid in the brain structures in question. Blockage of M-cholinoreceptors with metamisyl is accompanied by the decreased activity of Na+, K+-ATPase in the neocortex and by its elevation in the truncus cerebri. At the same time the content of lactic acid in the cortex rises and that in the truncus cerebri diminishes. No substantial changes in both the biochemical indicators were recorded in the hippocamp. Inhibition of the central N-cholinoreceptors with eterofen reduces the glycolysis intensity in the truncus cerebri and hippocamp. Meanwhile Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the brain structures remains unchanged.
