Hippocampus and temporal cortex are important brain regions, which play distinct, but complimentary roles in mediating learning and memory. Herein, we utilized label-free differential proteome strategy to explore function of normal human hippocampus and temporal cortex in learning and memory. As a result, a total of 5529 and 5702 proteins were identified in hippocampus and temporal cortex, respectively, 516 of which were significantly differential expressed, with abundance span 5 orders of magnitudes. Pathways analysis showed that temporal cortex was involved in growth of axons growth and synapse density regulation, through which could regulate long-term potentiation and long-term retention of trace memory. Hippocampus was involved in regulation of cell survival and cell viability, and regulates neurons proliferation by actin dynamics changes, through which involved in both short-term memory and long-term memory. Four selected differential proteins were further validated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. For the first time, we identified proteins and associated pathways of hippocampus and temporal cortex in human cognition process using proteomic strategy, which would provide references for generating corresponding insights in hippocampus and temporal cortex-related cognitive function.

SIGNIFICANCE: This study explored the potential molecular mechanism of hippocampus and temporal cortex in human cognition function using proteomics strategy, which will offer a baseline reference for further cognitive disorders study and reveal insights into physiology of temporal cortex and hippocampus.
