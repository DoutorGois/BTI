We evaluated whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can stimulate choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the septo-hippocampal pathway of ethylcholine mustard aziridinium (AF64A) and non-AF64A-treated rats. Rats received either AF64A (1.5 nmol/ ventricle) or a sham (non-AF64A-treated) injection into the lateral ventricles. BDNF infusion (at a dose range of 0.1-171 microg) into either the lateral ventricle or hippocampus of AF64A-treated rats for 14 days increased septal ChAT activity (26% and 41%, respectively). BDNF did not reverse the decrease in hippocampal ChAT activity (20-60%) produced by AF64A. BDNF infusion did not change ChAT activity in the septo-hippocampal pathway of non-AF64A-treated rats. Thus, septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons in AF64A-treated rats are sensitive to BDNF while those of non-AF64A-treated rats (normal) are not responsive to this neurotrophin.
