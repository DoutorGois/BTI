The concentrations of purine catabolites in the cerebral interstitial fluid during progression of and recovery from ischemia were studied using brain microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography. Sealed 0.5-mm hollow dialysis fibers were stereotactically implanted into either the cerebral cortex or hippocampus of ketamine anesthetized gerbils and perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 2 microliters/min. Cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. The reflectance spectra of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin at the brain surface were monitored over the scalp to assess ischemia and confirm recirculation. Ischemia caused a rapid, 4.8-fold increase in the extracellular concentration of adenosine. The progressive increase in the concentration of adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine soon after recirculation is particularly interesting. The subsequent decrease in purine compound concentration was rapid for adenosine but more gradual for inosine and hypoxanthine. Calculated K values for adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase were 0.045/min and 0.016/min, respectively. However, no xanthine, uric acid, or purine nucleotides were found in the perfusate. These observations indicated the presence of purine catabolites in the cerebral interstitial space as well as consecutive degradation and recycling involving the interconversion of purine compounds by biochemical metabolic pathways.
