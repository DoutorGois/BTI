We have previously demonstrated that an antibody to phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isozyme, PLC-delta, intensely stained neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was performed to determine if abnormal PLC-delta accumulation might be present in the filamentous inclusions of other neurodegenerative diseases. We found that the anti-PLC-delta antibody stained neuronal inclusions of Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and diffuse Lewy body disease while the inclusions of idiopathic Parkinson's disease lacked PLC-delta accumulation. These results suggest a possible role for PLC-delta interaction in the formation of intraneuronal filamentous inclusions in human neurodegenerative diseases.
