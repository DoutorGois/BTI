The use of small molecule surrogates of growth factors that directly or indirectly promote growth represents an attractive approach to regenerative medicine. With synthetic access to clovanemagnolol, a small molecule initially isolated from the bark of the Bigleaf Magnolia tree, we have examined the small molecule's ability to promote growth of embryonic hippocampal and cortical neurons in serum-free medium. Comparisons with magnolol, a known promoter of growth, reveals that clovanmagnolol is a potent neurotrophic agent, promoting neuronal growth at concentrations of 10 nM. In addition, both clovanemagnolol and magnolol promote growth through a biphasic dose response.
