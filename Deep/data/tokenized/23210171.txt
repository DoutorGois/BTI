Plasticity of the nervous system is determined by the modification of efficacy ofsynaptic transmission: long-term potentiation and long-term depression. Different modern technical approaches such as: registration of ionic currents in single neuron, molecular-genetic analysis, neurovisualization, and others reveal the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. The understanding of these mechanisms, in its turn, stimulates the development of methods of pharmacological correction of different forms of brain pathology such as Alzheimer disease, parkinsonism, alcoholism, aging and others.
