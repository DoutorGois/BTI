The effects of antagonist of alpha2-adrenoceptors yohimbine and their agonist clonidine on Bax and Bcl-XL mRNA levels in neonatal rat brain were studied. Yohimbine decreased Bax mRNA level in the cerebellum, increased the ratio between Bcl-XL and Bax mRNA levels in the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus, and increased Bcl-XL mRNA level in the cortex and hippocampus of 6-day-old-rat pups 24 h after injection. Administration of clonidine 20 min after yohimbine administration abolished its effect on Bcl-XL mRNA level in the hippocampus. The data obtained indicate that the blockade of alpha2-adrenoceptors induces antiapoptotic changes in the developing rat brain, some of which can be abolished after coadministration with the agonist of these receptors.
