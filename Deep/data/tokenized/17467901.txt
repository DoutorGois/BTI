One of the most common chemicals that behaves as an endocrine disruptor is the compound 4,4'-isopronylidenediphenol, called bisphenol-A. In the previous study, we reported that exposure to bisphenol-A induced the abnormality of dopamine receptor functions in the mouse limbic area, resulting in a supersensitivity of drugs of abuse-induced pharmacological actions. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether prenatal and neonatal exposures to bisphenol-A could alter other behavioral abnormalities such as anxiogenic behavior, motor learning behavior, or memory. In the present study, adult female mice were chronically treated with bisphenol-A-admixed powder food from mating to weaning. All experiments were performed using male pups. Here we found that prenatal and neonatal exposures to bisphenol-A failed to induce anxiogenic effects and motor-learning impairment using the light-dark test, elevated plus maze test, and rota-rod test. On the other hand, we found that prenatal and neonatal exposures to bisphenol-A induced the memory impairment using the step-through passive avoidance test. Immunohistochemical study showed the dramatic reduction in choline acetyltransferase-like immunoreactivity, which is a marker of acetylcholine (ACh) production, in the hippocampus of mice prenatally and neonatally exposed to bisphenol-A. These results suggest that chronic exposures to bisphenol-A could induce the memory impairment associated with the reduction in ACh production in the hippocampus.
