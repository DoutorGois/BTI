Chronic electroshock treatment (once daily for 12 days) increases extracellular norepinephrine in the frontal cortex and hippocampus as measured by microdialysis. This chronic treatment produced an elevation of basal norepinephrine overflow into extracellular space while both the first and the twelfth treatments produced a transient increase in norepinephrine overflow of about 40 min. Acutely, desmethylimipramine (10 mg/kg) treatment significantly increased extracellular norepinephrine. While chronic desmethylimipramine (once daily for 10 days) increased basal overflow of norepinephrine in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, the tenth daily administration of desmethylimipramine did not produce a statistically significant increase in extracellular norepinephrine. Both daily electroshock and daily desmethylimipramine produced down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex. Chronic electroshock caused up regulation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus while chronic desmethylimipramine administration did not alter alpha-adrenoceptors in either structure. Depletion of norepinephrine with reserpine or with 6-hydroxydopamine prevented the down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors while depletion of this neurotransmitter did not prevent the electroshock-induced up regulation of alpha-adrenoceptors in the frontal cortex. These data suggest that down regulation of beta-adrenoceptors is mediated through increases in extracellular norepinephrine. In contrast, up regulation of alpha-adrenoceptors appears to be independent of norepinephrine release and does not require the presence of noradrenergic neurons in order to be induced by electroshock.
