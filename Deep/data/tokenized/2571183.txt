The hypothalamus receives neuronal afferents from numerous sources including inputs from limbic structures, such as the amygdala and hippocampus, and from brainstem regions involved in the regulation of the cardiovascular system and other autonomic functions. These afferents using a vast array of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides influence the activity of the hypothalamic neurons which synthesize and secrete the hypothalamic releasing and release-inhibiting factors into the hypophyseal portal circulatory system. The afferents can modulate the activity of the hypothalamic neurons by forming synapses on the neuronal cell body, on the nerve terminals in the median eminence or both. The chemicals most frequently used as neurotransmitters are the biogenic amines, including the catecholamines (norepinephrine, dopamine and epinephrine), serotonin, acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The stimulatory influence of norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine on the secretion of corticotropin (ACTH) in rodents and man will be discussed, whereas GABA exerts an inhibitory effect on the secretion of ACTH in both man and rodents. These effects appear to be mediated by changes in the secretion of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin into the hypophyseal portal circulation. Numerous neuropeptides appear to alter the secretion of ACTH in the rat. We will discuss the stimulatory actions of neuropeptide Y (NPY), angiotensin II, and peptides of immune cell origin on the secretion of ACTH and CRH. The opioid peptides inhibit the secretion of CRH into the portal blood, however, they exert a potent stimulatory effect on prolactin secretion in the rat and man.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
