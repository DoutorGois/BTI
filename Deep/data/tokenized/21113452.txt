beta-Amyloid peptide 1-42 in a concentration of 200 nM impairs induction of long-term posttetanic potentiation of population spike in CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. Application of donepezil, a drug used for the treatment of Alzheimer disease, in a concentration of 1 muM eliminates the suppressive effect of beta-amyloid peptide 1-42 on long-term posttenanic potentiation in the hippocampus.
