The present study describes cholecystokinin (CCK) immunoreactivity (CCK-IR) distribution in the brains of control and colchicine-treated mice. In the brains of control mice, the CCK-IR strongly revealed numerous axons and terminals. Perikarya exhibiting a faint to moderate immunoreactivity were also observed in areas such as cortices, hippocampus, amygdala, septum, and thalamus. The colchicine treatment did not seem to notably affect the brain CCK-IR innervation, but resulted in profound changes of the perikaryal staining. Indeed, the regions, which contained numerous moderately stained perikarya in the control animals, exhibited after colchicine treatment immunoreactive perikarya intensely stained but only in moderate number. This feature obviously appeared in the cortex in which, in addition to strongly stained perikarya, colchicine induced the appearance of numerous CCK-IR hillocks. In the lateral amygdala and thalamus of colchicine-treated animals, the somatic immunoreactivity was considerably decreased. The regions, such as paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which in the control animals did not exhibit any stained perikaryon, showed a high number of strongly stained cell bodies after colchicine treatment. This study, mapping the mouse forebrain CCK-IR, demonstrated a wide distribution of this peptide. Moreover, CCK-IR is spontaneously visible in neurons of untreated mouse in some brain areas previously shown in the rat to exhibit CCK mRNA, but no clear perikaryal CCK-IR even after colchicine treatment.
