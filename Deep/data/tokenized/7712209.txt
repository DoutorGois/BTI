The purpose of this study was to compare the localization in the brain of calcitonin-induced anorexia to the distribution of calcitonin binding sites (as described by others). We, thus, performed an extensive mapping of brain structures to determine those involved in calcitonin-induced anorexia. A significant anorexia is found after injection of calcitonin (15 ng in 0.3 microliters) into several brain areas. Forebrain: lateral septum, lateral part of the anterior commissure, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; hypothalamus: floor of the anterior part of the hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus and adjacent perifornical area; thalamus: nucleus reuniens, an area internal to the mamillo-thalamic tract, and medial geniculate body; other areas: amygdala, lateral hippocampus, and central gray. No significant effect is found in the following areas: forebrain: nucleus accumbens, striatum, and medial septum; hypothalamus: lateral, ventro-medial, dorso-medial, and posterior nuclei; thalamus: centro-medial nucleus, lateral part of the zona incerta, and lateral geniculate body; hippocampus: dorsal and ventral parts; midbrain: central tegmentum, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra. When these results are compared to the distribution of calcitonin binding sites in the brain, two types of discrepancies are found. The first is the absence of effect in areas containing receptors: these areas may be involved in calcitonin-induced behaviors other than food intake. The second is the occurrence of anorexia in areas where no receptors are found: this finding is not easy to explain and raises some speculative hypotheses. In conclusion, calcitonin is active to decrease food intake in several brain areas, the strongest effect occurring in the paraventricular/perifornical area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
