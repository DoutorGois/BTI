Although neural transplantation has made a relatively successful transition from the animal laboratory to human neurosurgery for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the use of human embryonic brain tissue as the source of transplants raises difficult ethical and practical problems. These are likely to impede the widespread use of this otherwise promising therapy across the range of types of brain damage to which the results of animal experiments suggest its potential applicability. Various alternative approaches are reviewed briefly, aimed at developing sources of tissue for transplantation that can be maintained in vitro until needed, so obviating the requirement for fresh embryonic tissue at each occasion of surgery. Particularly promising are conditionally immortalized neuroepithelial stem cell lines in which the immortalizing gene is downregulated upon transplantation into a host brain. We describe experiments from our laboratory with the use of cells of this kind, the multipotent MHP clonal cell lines, derived from the developing hippocampus of a transgenic mouse harbouring a temperature-sensitive oncogene. Implanted into the hippocampus of rats and marmosets with damage to the CA1 cell field, the MHP36 line gave rise to healthy surviving grafts and to essentially complete recovery of cognitive function. Postmortem study of the implanted rat brains indicated that MHP36 cells migrate to the region of damage, adopt both neuronal (pyramidal) and glial phenotypes in vivo, and reconstitute the normal laminated appearance of the CA1 cell field. We have previously shown that, when primary differentiated foetal tissue is used as the source of grafts in rats with CA1 damage, there is a stringent requirement for replacement with homotypic CA1 cells. We interpret our results as showing that the MHP36 cell line responds to putative signals associated with damage to the hippocampus and takes up a phenotype appropriate for the repair of this damage; they therefore open the way to the development of a novel strategy with widespread applicability to the treatment of the diseased or damaged human brain.
