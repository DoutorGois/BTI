The effects of restraint stress on performance of a spatial memory task, the eight arm radial maze, was examined in rats. When stress was given for 6 h/day for 7 days and performance evaluated days 10-13 post stress, no effect on performance was noted; however, daily restraint stress for 13 days caused a small, but significant, enhancement of performance days 10-13 post stress. Stressed rats performed better than controls: their number of correct choices in the first 8 visits was higher than the controls, and stressed rats took fewer total choices to finish the maze than controls. Stress-dependent, enhanced performance does not appear permanent since further maze testing on days 14 and 15 post stress showed no differences between the groups. Performance of the stressed rats significantly correlated with their stress-induced, serum corticosterone levels measured after 6 h of restraint on the last day of restraint, day 13 (r = -0.63, P < 0.05); rats with higher levels of CORT took fewer choices to finish the task. Examination of hippocampal CA3c pyramidal neurons with Golgi techniques showed no effect of stress on the basal or apical dendritic arbors. Since our previous study showed that 21 days of restraint stress is associated with impaired spatial memory performance (10), these results suggest that the duration of stress may differentially affect learning/memory with shorter periods of stress serving an adaptive function while longer durations causing maladaptive changes.
