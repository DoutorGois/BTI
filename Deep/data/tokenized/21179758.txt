AIM: To investigate whether transplantation of neural stem cells can ameliorate learning and memory abilities in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rats. METHODS: Neural stem cells were isolated from dentate gyrus of hippocampus of newborn rats. After labeled with Hoechst33258, neural stem cells were grafted into the hippocampus of AD rats. 2 or 4 weeks post transplantation, the rats underwent behavioral testing using Y-maze trial. Fluorescence observation and immunohistochemistry were used after the rats were sacrificed. RESULTS: Neural stem cells grafted into hippocampus of AD rats could not only survive well, but also possessed the capacity of continuous proliferation and migrate along the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Neural stem cells grafted into hippocampus of AD rats can not only survive well, possess the capacity of continuous proliferation, but also ameliorate memory defects in Alzheimer's disease rats.
