Memory deficits are frequently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder. According to some authors, these memory impairments are a result of hippocampal damage caused by traumatic stress. This article contains a critical review of studies on changes in hippocampal volume and memory performance in posttraumatic stress disorder. We conclude that most studies in this area suffer from methodological weaknesses and therefore do no allow for firm conclusions about the causal linkage among traumatic stress, hippocampal functioning, and memory. Suggestions for future research, circumventing methodological flaws, are given.
