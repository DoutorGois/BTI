PURPOSE: Exercise enhances memory function by increasing neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and circadian rhythms modulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. The circadian rhythm-dependent effects of treadmill exercise on memory function in relation with neurogenesis were investigated using mice. METHODS: The step-down avoidance test was used to evaluate short-term memory, the 8-arm maze test was used to test spatial learning ability, and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine immunofluorescence was used to assess neurogenesis. Western blotting was also performed to assess levels of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, tyrosine kinase receptor B, phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein, early growth response protein 1, postsynaptic density protein 95, and growth-associated protein 43. The mice in the treadmill exercise at zeitgeber 1 group started exercising 1 hour after sunrise, the mice in the treadmill exercise at zeitgeber 6 group started exercising 6 hours after sunrise, and the mice in the treadmill exercise at zeitgeber 13 group started exercising 1 hour after sunset. The mice in the exercise groups were forced to run on a motorized treadmill for 30 minutes once a day for 7 weeks. RESULTS: Treadmill exercise improved short-term memory and spatial learning ability, and increased hippocampal neurogenesis and the expression of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins. These effects of treadmill exercise were stronger in mice that exercised during the day or in the evening than in mice that exercised at dawn. CONCLUSIONS: Treadmill exercise improved memory function by increasing neurogenesis and the expression of synaptic plasticity-associated proteins. These results suggest that the memory-enhancing effect of treadmill exercise may depend on circadian rhythm changes.
