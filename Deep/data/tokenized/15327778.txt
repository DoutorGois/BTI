The mechanism(s) involved in agonist-stimulation of TRPC3 channels is not yet known. Here we demonstrate that TRPC3-N terminus interacts with VAMP2 and alphaSNAP. Further, endogenous and exogenously expressed TRPC3 colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with SNARE proteins in neuronal and epithelial cells. Imaging of GFP-TRPC3 revealed its localization in the plasma membrane region and in mobile intracellular vesicles. Recovery of TRPC3-GFP fluorescence after photobleaching of the plasma membrane region was decreased by brefeldin-A or BAPTA-AM. Cleavage of VAMP2 with tetanus toxin (TeNT) did not prevent delivery of TRPC3 to the plasma membrane region but reduced its surface expression. TeNT also decreased carbachol and OAG, but not thapsigargin, stimulated Ca2+ influx. Importantly, carbachol, not thapsigargin, increased surface expression of TRPC3 that was attenuated by TeNT and not by BAPTA. In aggregate, these data suggest that VAMP2-dependent exocytosis regulates plasma membrane insertion of TRPC3 channels and contributes to carbachol-stimulation of Ca2+ influx.
