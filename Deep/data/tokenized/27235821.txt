Some forms of depression appear to be more related to the glutamatergic system. G-coupled protein receptor 39 (GPR39) is the metabotropic zinc receptor, which may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and in the antidepressant response. Its deficiency abolishes the antidepressant response, which means that GPR39 is required to obtain a therapeutic effect in depression. This raises the possibility that agonists of the zinc receptor may have a role in antidepressant treatment. To explore this possibility we investigated animal behaviour in the forced swim test, the tail suspension test (to assess antidepressant-like properties), the light/dark test and the elevated plus maze test (to assess anxiolytic-like properties), following acute administration of a GPR39 agonist (TC G-1008). We found an antidepressant response (as measured by the forced swim test but not by the tail suspension test) in mice following the GPR39 agonist treatment. Additionally, we observed the opposite results in the light/dark box (decreased overall distance; increased time spent in the lit compartment; decreased time spent in the dark compartment; increased freezing time) and elevated plus maze (no significant changes), which may be a consequence of the sedative effect of TC G-1008. We also found hippocampal GPR39 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) up-regulation following administration of the GPR39 agonist, which may be undiscovered so far as a possible novel agent in the treatment of mood disorders.
