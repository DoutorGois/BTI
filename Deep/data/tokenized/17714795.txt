Clusterin is a protein involved in multiple biological events, including neuronal cytoprotection, membrane recycling and regulation of complement-mediated membrane attack after injury. We investigated the effect of recombinant human clusterin in preclinical models of peripheral neuropathies. Daily treatment with clusterin accelerated the recovery of nerve motor evoked potential parameters after sciatic nerve injury. Prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of experimental autoimmune neuritis rats with clusterin also accelerated the rate of recovery from the disease, associated with remyelination of demyelinated nerve fibers. These data demonstrate that clusterin is capable of ameliorating clinical, neurophysiological and pathological signs in models of peripheral neuropathies.
