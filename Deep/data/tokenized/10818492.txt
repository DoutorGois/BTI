Amyloid beta (A beta) deposits and neurofibrillary pathology are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association of A beta with cerebral vessels is an intriguing feature of AD. While some degree of cerebral A beta angiopathy involving the leptomeninges and intraparenchymal vessels occurs in almost all cases of AD, the proportion of microvessels within a neocortical region containing deposits of A beta peptide is not known. In this study, we examined a cohort of clinically and pathologically evaluated AD cases to assess the percentage of cerebral microvessels in the temporal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus associated with the predominant, A beta 42 form of the peptide. We also assessed whether the distribution and burden of amyloid was related to apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Using double immunostaining methods, we surprisingly found that at least 40% of the microvessels in the two brain regions contained A beta 42 deposits. There was no correlation of such localization with APOE genotype, however, epsilon 4 homozygotes revealed a greater burden of A beta 40. These observations suggest that high proportions of cortical microvessels are associated with A beta 42, which may affect microvascular function.
