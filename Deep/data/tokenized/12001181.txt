This paper reviews the preclinical literature related to the effects of stress on neurobiological and neuroendocrine systems. Preclinical studies of stress provide a comprehensive model for understanding neurobiological alterations in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The pathophysiology of stress reflects long-standing changes in biological stress response systems and in systems involved in stress responsivity, learning, and memory. The neural circuitry involved includes systems mediating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, norepinephrine (locus coeruleus), and benzodiazepine, serotonergic, dopaminergic, neuropeptide, and central amino acid systems. These systems interact with brain structures involved in memory, including hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Stress responses are of vital importance in living organisms; however excessive and/or repeated stress can lead to long-lasting alterations in these circuits and systems involved in stress responsiveness. Intensity and duration of the stressor, and timing of the stressor in life, have strong impact in this respect.
