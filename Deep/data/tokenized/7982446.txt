Incubation of rat hippocampal slices with the synthetic cannabinoid (-)-11-OH-delta 8-dimethylheptyl tetrahydrocannabinol (HU-210) (100 nM) prevented the induction of long-term potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in the CA1 region. However, in slices incubated with its non-psychoactive (+)-isomer HU-211 (100 nM), which is reported to be an NMDA receptor antagonist, high frequency stimulation evoked a long-lasting potentiation, comparable to control slices.
