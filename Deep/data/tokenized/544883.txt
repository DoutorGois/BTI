Hippocampectomized rats were compared with the controls on punishment training in a L-shaped alley. Five measures of running time were taken; startbox latency A (from the placement in the startbox to the door), startbox latency B(from the door to the runway), runway running time, goalbox entry time and goalbox time. The postshock running time of controls was significantly longer than the preshock one in all measures. Hippocampals showed no hesitation in both startbox latencies, but did show hesitation in the other three measures just as the controls did. The controls spent a long time in the startbox from which they were unable to see outside stimuli until reaching the startbox door. These results support the spatial cognition theory of hippocampal function rather than the distant cue theory.
