Noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4, preceded by zimelidine to prevent serotonin depletion, was administered IP to rats behaving in a defensive-submissive manner in a resident-intruder paradigm. Computer-based ethological analysis revealed the decrease of frequency and duration of defensive episodes and marked increase of offensive aggression. This might suggest an increase of aggressiveness and therefore support the notion of an inhibitory role of the noradrenergic system in aggressive behavior independently of the model used. Dramatically changed attitude toward the partner might also result from fear reduction or inadequate responsiveness to environmental factors because DSP-4-treated rats explored more than controls in stressogenic, highly illuminated area. HPLC analysis showed significant reduction of noradrenaline (NA) concentration in amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. Simultaneously there occurred a considerable decrease in dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolite levels. This suggests an attenuated activity of the DA and 5-HT systems that we consider as an effect secondary to NA depletion, which reflects the functional interactions between DA, 5-HT, and NA systems.
