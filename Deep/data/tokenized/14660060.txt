We assessed the effects of a single tail pinch and two chronic stress regimes, repeated and variable, on in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity and on alpha2-adrenoceptor sensitivity in two brain regions. After administering a 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) decarboxylase inhibitor, tyrosine hydroxylase activity, measured as the accumulation of DOPA, and noradrenaline (NA) content were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography. A single tail pinch for 5 min induced an enhancement of DOPA content in hippocampus (28%) and hypothalamus (67%) which was still present 24 h later. This increase could account for the lack of changes in NA content in both regions after the application of this stressor. However, tyrosine hydroxylase activity was unmodified 24 h after exposure to both repeated (5 min of tail pinch, twice daily, for 14 days) and chronic variable stress (one of 5 different stressors, once daily, for 14 days) although there was an enhancement of NA levels in hippocampus (45 and 54%, respectively) and hypothalamus (24.5 and 36%, respectively). The sensitivity of the alpha2-adrenoceptors which regulate [3H]-NA release in hippocampal and hypothalamic synaptosomes was not modified by the acute or chronic stress protocols assayed. The results show that both paradigms of chronic stress had similar effects on the noradrenergic indices evaluated.
