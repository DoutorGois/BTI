An experiment was performed to observe the changes in Raf-1 kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in cultured hippocampal neurons and its correlation with neurons apoptosis induced by intracellular zinc depletion. Cultured hippocampal neurons were exposed to a cell membrane-permeant zinc chelator TPEN (2 microM), and to TPEN plus zinc sulfate (5 microM) for 24 h. Cultures were then processed to detect neuronal viability by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium assay, while apoptosis rate was simultaneously observed by the flow cytometric analysis. Caspase-3, Raf-1, pMEK, pERK1/2, and pCREB protein levels were examined by Western blot assays. The viability in TPEN-incubated neurons was notably decreased, apoptosis rate and expression of caspase-3 significantly increased compared to untreated controls. The significant down-regulation of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway and expression of pCREB were decreased in TPEN-treated neurons. Co-addition of zinc almost completely reversed TPEN-induced alterations described. The results demonstrated zinc-modulated apoptosis and the expression of Raf/MEK/ERK at the protein level in hippocampal neurons. It is possible that zinc depletion-induced apoptosis in cultured hippocampal neurons may be relevant to the changes of Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.
