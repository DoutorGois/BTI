alpha4betadelta GABA(A) receptors (GABARs) have low CNS expression, but their expression is increased by 48h exposure to the neurosteroid THP (3alpha-OH-5alpha[beta]-pregnan-20-one). THP also increases the efficacy of delta-containing GABARs acutely, where GABA is a partial agonist. Thus, we examined effects of THP (100 nM) and full GABA agonists at alpha4beta2delta (gaboxadol, 10 muM, and beta-alanine, 10 muM-1mM), on surface expression of alpha4beta2delta. To this end, we used an alpha4 construct tagged with a 3XFLAG (F) epitope or measured expression of native alpha4 and delta. HEK-293 cells or cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected with alpha4Fbeta2delta and treated 24h later with GABA agonists, THP, GABA plus THP or vehicle (0.01% DMSO) for 0.5 h-48 h. Immunocytochemistry was performed under both non-permeabilized and permeabilized conditions to detect surface and intracellular labeling, respectively, using confocal microscopy. The high efficacy agonists and GABA (1 or 10 muM) plus THP increased alpha4beta2delta surface expression up to 3-fold after 48h, an effect first seen by 0.5h. This effect was not dependent upon the polarity of GABAergic current, although expression was increased by KCC2. Intracellular labeling was decreased while functional expression was confirmed by whole cell patch clamp recordings of responses to GABA agonists. GABA plus THP treatment did not alter the rate of receptor removal from the surface membrane, suggesting that THP-induced alpha4beta2delta expression is likely via receptor insertion. Surface expression of alpha4beta2delta was decreased by rottlerin (10 muM), suggesting a role for PKC-delta. These results suggest that trafficking of alpha4beta2delta GABARs is regulated by high efficacy states.
