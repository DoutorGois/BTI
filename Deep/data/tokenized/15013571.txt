We have evaluated the effect of exercise, Vitamin E and a combination of both on the antioxidant enzymes (AOEs)-superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) along with the products of lipid peroxidation (LP)-malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipofuscin-like auto fluorescent substances (LF-like AFS) in discrete brain regions of rats of 4 (young adults), 8 (old adults), 12 (middle-age) and 22 months (mos) old of age. Hippocampus (HC) showed greater increase in GSH-Px activity than cerebral cortex (CC) to exercise and Vitamin E and was irrespective of the age. A combination of both was effective in the CC of all age groups but not in the supplemented sedentary of 12- and 22-mo-olds. CAT activity increased significantly in the HC of supplemented and trained rats but not in the combination group of any age. SOD increased in both the regions of supplemented trainees. However, old were more benefited in terms of maximal elevation in the HC. Vitamin E reduced MDA content in both regions of adult. LF-like AFS decreased significantly in supplemented sedentary and trainees of all ages. Our results demonstrate that an age-related deficit in AOEs in the CC and HC can be overcome through Vitamin E plus exercise, and further suggests the rationale for looking at these markers of oxidative stress in several age-related neuronal diseases.
