The molecular basis for developing symptomatic epilepsy (epileptogenesis) remains ill defined. We show here in a well characterized hippocampal culture model of epilepsy that the induction of epileptogenesis is Ca2+-dependent. The concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was monitored during the induction of epileptogenesis by prolonged electrographic seizure activity induced through low-Mg2+ treatment by confocal laser-scanning fluorescent microscopy to directly correlate changes in [Ca2+]i with alterations in membrane excitability measured by intracellular recording using whole-cell current-clamp techniques. The induction of long-lasting spontaneous recurrent epileptiform discharges, but not the Mg2+-induced spike discharges, was prevented in low-Ca2+ solutions and was dependent on activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The results provide direct evidence that prolonged activation of the NMDA-Ca2+ transduction pathway causes a long-lasting plasticity change in hippocampal neurons causing increased excitability leading to the occurrence of spontaneous, recurrent epileptiform discharges.
