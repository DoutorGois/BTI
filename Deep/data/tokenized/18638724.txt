11 patients with foreign tissue lesions (FTL) in the temporal lobe associated with complex partial seizures (CPS) were studied. All had lesions clearly definable on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but not seen on computerised tomographic (CT) scans. All cases showed seizure reduction following temporal lobectomy with 10 becoming seizure free. Pathology showed 9 tumours, 1 hamartoma and 1 cavernous angioma. Hippocampus was available for examination in 7 cases, showing abnormalities in 6. Our findings suggest MRI be mandatory in screening patients with CPS and that following surgery, outcome should be excellent.
