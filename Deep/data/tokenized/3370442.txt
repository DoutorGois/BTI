In three breeds of domestic pigeons (fantails, homing pigeons, and strassers) the volumes of fresh, i.e. unfixed tissue of 14 brain structures were determined (telencephalon, diencephalon, nervus opticus, tectum, cerebellum, tegmentum and hyperstriatum accessorium, hyperstriatum ventrale, neostriatum, paleostriatum, hippocampus, septum, regio praepiriformis, bulbus olfactorius). Allometric comparisons that take into account differences in body weight and size were made among these three breeds. The tectum, hippocampus, paleostriatum and especially the neostriatum and olfactory bulb are remarkably larger in homing pigeons. These data are discussed in a functional context, in which the homing ability of homing pigeons is considered.
