Following a previous paper describing how memory appeared in the nervous system in mammalians, during evolution, and how its significant growth led to hominization, the present paper intends to show the prevailing place it occupies in human brain. Memory, an attribute of cortex, is an engraving of neuronal circuits created during information analysis of data input in the cortex. It is created either by repetition of information or by increase in brain activity, under the influence of a central brain system. In the brain of human newborns, immature and unprogrammed, but endowed with a great capacity for learning, the whole organization and programming will be possible through learning and remembering. Communication pathways between functions are memory pathways. Brain becomes a memory machine and every cortical area is a memory territory. Its lesion results in a disturbance corresponding exactly to forgetting what has been stored in that territory.
