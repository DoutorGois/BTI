The paper describes the history of the clinical neuropathology of the epilepsies in the last hundred years from microscopy to molecular neuropathology. The main focus is on the concepts of hippocampal sclerosis and its discussion of causative lesion or consequence of seizures, and the concept of developmental disturbances in respect to general epileptogenicity. Clinical neuropathology remains an important discipline in the future of epileptology and brain research especially in the area of molecular genetics. Neuropathology will help to understand the stages of epileptogenesis and the factors responsible for the progressive nature of the disease.
