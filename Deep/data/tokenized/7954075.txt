Major regions of the rat brain have been examined for the presence of glucose transporters (GLUTs 1-4) and their mRNAs. Both the mRNA and immunoreactive protein for GLUT1 and GLUT3 were found in each brain region (medulla, pons, cerebellum, midbrain, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, parietal cortex). The mRNA and protein for GLUT4 were identified in the cerebellum, but not elsewhere in the brain. GLUT2 protein and mRNA were not detected in any region of the brain. Although GLUT1 and GLUT3 are the major brain glucose transporters, the presence of GLUT4 in the cerebellum suggests that insulin-sensitive glucose uptake may occur in a specific part of the brain.
