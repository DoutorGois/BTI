The release of norepinephrine (NE) in the ventral hippocampus was studied in rats with microdialysis method. The basal release of NE with perfusion of normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was 1.58 +/- 0.37 x 20 microliters-1 sample. The NE concentration increased significantly with perfusion of high potassium (60 mM) ACSF indicating that depolarization-induced release was up to 5 times higher than the basic level. Ketamine (20 mg.kg-1 and 80 mg.kg-1 im) significantly inhibited the depolarization-induced increase of NE, but did not affect the basal release. Neither 5 mg.kg-1 im of ketamine nor MK-801 had any effect on the basic or the depolarization-induced release. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of ketamine on the depolarization-induced NE release was not due to the NMDA channel blocking properties of ketamine.
