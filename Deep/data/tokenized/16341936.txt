In ischemic tolerance experiment, when we applied 5-min ischemia 2 days before 30-min ischemia, we achieved a remarkable (95.8%) survival of CA1 neurons. However, when we applied 5-min ischemia itself, without following lethal ischemia, we found out 45.8% degeneration of neurons in the CA1. This means that salvage of 40% CA1 neurons from postischemic degeneration was initiated by the second pathophysiological stress. These findings encouraged us to hypothesize that the second pathophysiological stress used 48 h after lethal ischemia can be efficient in prevention of delayed neuronal death. Our results demonstrate that whereas 8 min of lethal ischemia destroys 49.9% of CAI neurons, 10 min of ischemia destroys 71.6% of CA1 neurons, three different techniques of the second pathophysiological stress are able to protect against both: CA1 damage as well as spatial learning/memory dysfunction. Bolus of norepinephrine (3.1 micromol/kg i.p.) used two days after 8 min ischemia saved 94.2%, 6 min ischemia applied 2 days after 10 min ischemia rescued 89.9%, and an injection of 3-nitropropionic acid (20 mg/kg i.p.) applied two days after 10 min ischemia protected 77.5% of CA1 neurons. Thus, the second pathophysiological stress, if applied at a suitable time after lethal ischemia, represents a significant therapeutic window to opportunity for salvaging neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region against delayed neuronal death.
