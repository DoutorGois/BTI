Abstract The central release of both oxytocin and vasopressin within the septum and dorsal hippocampus in response to suckling was studied in conscious, freely-behaving lactating rats. Three consecutive 30-min push-pull perfusions were carried out before, during and after suckling (suckled group) or without suckling (control group). As compared to control levels, suckling resulted in a significantly increased oxytocin release within both limbic brain areas (septum: to 140%, dorsal hippocampus: to 1,600%). After removal of the suckling pups, the oxytocin concentration in the final perfusates remained at the stimulation level (septum) or tended to return to control values (dorsal hippocampus). In contrast to oxytocin, the vasopressin perfusate levels did not differ significantly between unsuckled and suckled rats.
