In the last decade, neurophysiological research regarding nociceptive mediation seems to suggest a possible new approach in pain management--zinc applicability. Immunohistochemical studies prove that zinc can be found in central nervous system, inside structures active in nociception. Zinc stabilizes primary afferent C fibers, nervous fibers involved in nociception. However, this phenomenon is probably only true for extreme zinc concentrations--excess or deficit. Electrophysiological studies indicate that zinc inhibits NMDA receptors, while potentiating the activity of non-NMDA receptors. All these are arguments supporting the existence of a role of endogenous zinc regarding pain transmission.
