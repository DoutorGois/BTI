The authors report about 3 new cases of cutaneous-mucosal hyalinosis, or Urbach-Wiethe disease, with cerebral sites. The intracranial calcifications were detected without any neurological presenting features, and were discovered incidentally on radiographs of the skull. The CT examination allows specifying the site of these calcifications, in the gyri of the hippocampus.
