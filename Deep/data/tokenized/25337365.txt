INTRODUCTION: Exposure to 3-4, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) leads to cell death. Herein, we studied the protective effects of ginger on MDMA- induced apoptosis. METHODS: 15 Sprague dawley male rats were administrated with 0, 10 mg/kg MDMA, or MDMA along with 100mg/kg ginger, IP for 7 days. Brains were removed to study the caspase 3, 8, and 9 expressions in the hippocampus by RT-PCR. Data was analyzed by SPSS 16 software using the one-way ANOVA test. RESULTS: MDMA treatment resulted in a significant increase in caspase 3, 8, and 9 as compared to the sham group (p < 0.001). Ginger administration however, appeared to significantly decrease the same (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that ginger consumption may lead to the improvement of MDMA-induced neurotoxicity.
