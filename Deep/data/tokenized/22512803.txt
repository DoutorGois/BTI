The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (Cg25) has been reported to be a node of mood-regulatory networks. Using a responder and a non-responder of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for depression, we examined pre/post-treatment cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the Cg25 and treatment-related CBF changes in cortical/subcortical regions. In the responder, pre-treatment Cg25 perfusion was higher and was decreased after treatment, in addition, CBF was increased in the frontal and parietal regions and decreased in the hippocampus and basal ganglia. Our results suggest that rTMS treatment response may be related to pre-treatment Cg25 activity and modulation of the Cg25 and mood-regulatory networks.
