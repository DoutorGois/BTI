At certain times during gestation, the testes of the fetal macaque produce plasma levels of testosterone (T) that are similar to those of adults. It is thought that testosterone acts on the brain via estrogen and androgen receptors to organize the development of sexually dimorphic neural structures that underlie sex differences in behavior. To test the proposition that there are male-female differences in the occupation of steroid receptor binding sites during fetal development in the cynomolgus macaque, we have compared the uptake of [3H]T and its metabolites in: (1) 5 intact males (plasma T 571.2 +/- 215.5 ng/100 ml); (2) 5 intact females (33.8 +/- 25.2 ng/100 ml); (3) in 5 males orchidectomized in utero (14.6 +/- 5.7 ng/100 ml). About 1 week after fetal gonadectomy or sham-operation, all fetuses were given 500 microCi [3H]T s.c. and were then delivered 60 min later by Cesarean section. Brains were removed and dissected into blocks containing the hypothalamus and preoptic area, amygdala, hippocampus, and midbrain. Samples of cerebral and cerebellar cortex were also obtained. Purified nuclear pellets were prepared by centrifugation through 2 M sucrose and were extracted into ether and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Hypothalamic nuclear concentrations of [3H]E2 in intact males (847 +/- 195 dpm per mg DNA) were significantly lower than those in sham-operated females (2147 +/- 542 dpm per mg DNA) (P less than 0.05), but those in orchidectomized males (2233 +/- 345 dpm per mg DNA) were similar to concentrations in females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
