Many evidence suggest that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) may modulate glutamatergic transmission, hence, these receptors are regarded as potential targets for neuroprotective drugs. Since group III mGlu receptor agonists are known to reduce glutamatergic transmission by inhibiting glutamate release, we decided to investigate the neuroprotective potential of the group III mGlu receptor agonist, (1S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (ACPT-I) against kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. In primary neuronal cell cultures ACPT-I (1-200 muM), applied 30 min-3 h after starting the exposure to KA (150 muM), significantly attenuated the KA-induced LDH release, increased cell viability, and inhibited caspase-3 activity both in cortical and hippocampal cell cultures. The effects were dose-, time- and structure-dependent. The neuroprotective effects of ACPT-I were reversed by (RS)-alpha-cyclopropyl-4-phosphonophenyl glycine, a group III mGluR antagonist. In the in vivo studies, KA (2.5 nmol/1 mul) was unilaterally injected into the rat dorsal CA1 hippocampal region and the size of degeneration was examined by stereological counting of surviving neurons in the CA pyramidal layer. It was found that ACPT-I (7.5 or 15 nmol/1 mul), injected into the dorsal hippocampus 30 min, 1 or 3 h after KA in dose-dependent manner prevented the KA-induced neuronal damage. Moreover, in vivo microdialysis studies in the rat hippocampus showed that ACPT-I (200 muM) given simultaneously with KA (50 muM) significantly diminished the KA-induced glutamate release in the hippocampus. This mechanism seems to play a role in mediating the neuroprotective effect of ACPT-I.
