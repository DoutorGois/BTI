The role of hippocampal noradrenergic inputs in the modulation of corticosteroid receptor expression has been investigated. Adult male rats were given central 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and the expression of hippocampal mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptor mRNA was examined after two weeks by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Expression of MR mRNA was significantly decreased in all subregions of the hippocampus except CA2, but 6-OHDA lesions had no effect on GR mRNA expression. These data reveal differential regulation of the two receptor types by noradrenergic inputs.
