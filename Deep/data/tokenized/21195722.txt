The fish brain grows throughout life, and new cells are added continuously in all major brain areas. As in mammals, the rate of adult brain cell proliferation in fish can be regulated by external factors including environmental complexity and interaction with conspecifics. We have recently demonstrated that the stress experienced by subordinate rainbow trout in social hierarchies leads to a marked suppression of brain cell proliferation in the telencephalon, and that this is accompanied by an increase in plasma levels of cortisol. Corticosteroid hormones are known to suppress adult neurogenesis in mammals, and to investigate whether this is also the case in fish, rainbow trout were fed feed containing either a low or a high dose of cortisol for 6 days. Compared to control animals receiving regular feed, both cortisol treated groups had significantly elevated cortisol levels 24h after the last feeding, with the high group having levels comparable to those previously reported in socially stressed fish. To quantify cell proliferation, immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed to identify actively cycling cells. The density of PCNA-positive nuclei in the telencephalon was reduced by about 50% in both cortisol treated groups. The effect of cortisol on brain cell proliferation did not reflect a general down regulation of growth, as only the high cortisol group had reduced growth rate, and there was no correlation between brain cell proliferation and growth rate in any group. These results indicate that the reduced proliferative activity seen in brains of socially stressed fish is mediated by cortisol, and that there is a similar suppressive effect of cortisol on brain cell proliferation in the teleost forebrain as in the mammalian hippocampus.
