Studies have been made on the effect of GABA mimetics on epileptogenic focus in the hippocamp of growing rats. By the pattern of inhibition of this focus by these drugs, it is possible to evaluate the degree of functional maturation of the activity of GABA receptors, glial and neuronal uptake of GABA, and the activity of GABA-T. Higher sensitivity of GABA receptors in younger animals was found together with a higher functional role of glial uptake in GABA utilization. Functional activity of GABA-T and neuronal uptake of the mediator are of lower physiological significance in younger animals as compared to those in adults.
