The level of opioid peptides in several brain areas and in the pituitary was estimated in WAG/Rij rats, which are considered to be a genetic animal model for human absence epilepsy. In comparison with three groups of non-epileptic controls, these epileptic rats had an elevated level of the proenkephalin-derived peptide Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 in the mesencephalon and striatum, while the level of the prodynorphin-derived peptide alpha-neoendorphin was increased in the striatum and hippocampus. In addition various age- and/or strain-related changes in these peptide levels were found in the hippocampus, thalamus, striatum, frontal cortex and neurointermediate lobe of the pituitary. No difference in the hypothalamic beta-endorphin level were found between epileptic and non-epileptic rats, though strain- and/or age-related changes in the peptide content were detected in both lobes of the pituitary. The increased level of proenkephalin and prodynorphin opioid peptides in brain structures, essential for the appearance of spike-wave discharges, suggests that these opioid systems, but not proopiomelanocortin one, may play a role in absence epilepsy.
