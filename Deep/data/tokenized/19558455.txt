We have shown preferential expression of both mRNA and corresponding protein for myosin VI (Myo6) in the murine hippocampus within 24 h after the extreme traumatic experience, water-immersion restraint stress (WIRS), prior to a drastic decrease in neural progenitor proliferation in the dentate gyrus. Myosin (Myo6) protein levels were significantly increased in hippocampus within 24 h after flashback experience in mice previously exposed to WIRS. Myo6 protein was ubiquitously distributed in discrete mouse brain regions with exceptionally high expression in olfactory bulb, whereas Myo6 protein was expressed in cultured rat astroglia and neurons, in addition to Myo6 mRNA expression by cultured neural progenitors. In mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells endowed to proliferate and differentiate, Myo6 protein was expressed in line with astroglial marker protein expression. Transient over-expression of Myo6 induced a significant decrease in the size of clustered aggregates as an index of self-replication in P19 cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the interaction between Myo6 and the RNA-binding protein, translocated in liposarcoma (TLS), while TLS was predominantly expressed by neurons in the cortex, striatum, cerebellum, and hippocampus. These results suggest that Myo6 may play a pivotal role in the mechanism underlying the suppressed adult neurogenesis after traumatic stress in association with TLS.
