AIMS: To elucidate the role of cerebral serotonin neurotransmission in visceral perception in functional dyspepsia (FD), we observationally examined the regional expression level of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and its correlation with clinical symptoms. MAIN METHODS: FD patients (Rome III criteria; N=9, age range: 36-76years) and healthy controls (N=8, age range: 25-61years) participated in this study. Positron emission tomography scanning with [(11)C]N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine ([(11)C]DASB), which binds specifically to SERT, was used to quantify the binding potential (BPND) of [(11)C]DASB in the midbrain, thalamus, caudate, putamen, amygdala, and hippocampus with reference to co-registered magnetic resonance images. Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS). Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). KEY FINDINGS: BPND of the midbrain (P=0.041) and thalamus (P=0.031) was higher in FD patients than in controls. The BPND values in the midbrain correlated with total GSRS (r=0.663, P=0.004) and abdominal pain (r=0.419, P=0.047) scores. Its values in the thalamus correlated with total GSRS (r=0.423, P=0.044), abdominal pain (r=0.502, P=0.022), and indigestion (r=0.476, P=0.028) scores. Its value in the hippocampus correlated with abdominal pain and state-STAI scores (r=0.528, P=0.017; r=0.428, P=0.043). SIGNIFICANCE: Up-regulation of the SERT level in the midbrain and thalamus may underlie the pathogenesis of FD such as abdominal and psychological symptoms via a brain-gut interaction.
