1. Depolarization-induced elevations of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were examined in slice-cultured hippocampal pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells of the CA3 region by combined intracellular and multisite fura-2 recording techniques. 2. In pyramidal cells, spiking activity induced by depolarizing current pulses (200-800 ms) induced transient elevations of somatic as well as of proximal dendritic [Ca2+]i. The calcium signals from the proximal dendrites were larger in amplitude and decayed much faster than those from the soma. Depolarization of presumed interneurons induced comparable somatic and dendritic calcium transients, which decayed faster than those observed in pyramidal cell somata. 3. The calcium transients of pyramidal cells, but not those of nonpyramidal cells, were associated with a slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP), whose time course was correlated with that of the somatic calcium signal. We conclude that the lack of a sAHP in non-pyramidal cells cannot be explained by the absence of an efficient rise in [Ca2+]i but rather by the absence of the potassium conductance underlying the sAHP in pyramidal cells.
