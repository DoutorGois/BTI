An imbalance in kynurenine pathway metabolism is hypothesized to be associated with dysregulated glutamatergic neurotransmission, which has been proposed as a mechanism underlying the hippocampal volume loss observed in a variety of neurological disorders. Pre-clinical models suggest that the CA2-3 and dentate gyrus hippocampal subfields are particularly susceptible to excitotoxicity after experimental traumatic brain injury. We tested the hypothesis that smaller hippocampal volumes in collegiate football athletes with (n = 25) and without (n = 24) a concussion history would be most evident in the dentate gyrus and CA2-3 subfields relative to nonfootball healthy controls (n = 27). Further, we investigated whether the concentration of peripheral levels of kynurenine metabolites are altered in football athletes. Football athletes with and without a self-reported concussion history had smaller dentate gyrus (p < 0.05, p < 0.10) and CA2-3 volumes (p's < 0.05) relative to healthy controls. Football athletes with and without a concussion history had a trend toward lower (p < 0.10) and significantly lower (p < 0.05) kynurenine levels compared with healthy controls, while athletes with a concussion history had greater levels of quinolinic acid compared with athletes without a concussion history (p < 0.05). Finally, plasma levels of 3-hydroxykynurenine inversely correlated with bilateral hippocampal volumes in football athletes with a concussion history (p < 0.01), and left hippocampal volume was correlated with the ratio of kynurenic acid to quinolinic acid in football athletes without a concussion history (p < 0.05). Our results raise the possibility that abnormalities of the kynurenine metabolic pathway constitute a mechanism for hippocampal volume differences in the context of sports-related brain injury.
