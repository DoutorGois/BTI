The effects of metabolic fragments of [Arg(8)]-vasopressin (AVP), [pGlu(4), Cyt(6)]AVP (AVP(4-9)), and desglycinamide-[pGlu(4), Cyt(6)]AVP (AVP(4-8)) on the growth of hippocampal neurons in culture were investigated in comparison with those of AVP. AVP(4-9) caused a significant increase in filopodial length following 96 h of exposure at concentrations higher than 300 nM. AVP(4-9) was more potent than AVP. AVP(4-8) also induced an increase in filopodial length, but this effect was less than that of AVP. The selective V(1) agonist [Phe(2), Ile(3), Orn(8)]-vasopressin caused a significant increase in filopodial length, whereas the selective V(2) agonist [deamino-Cys(1), D-Arg(8)]-vasopressin showed no such effect. OPC-21268, a vasopressin V(1) antagonist, blocked AVP and AVP fragment-induced increases in filopodial length. However, the V(2) antagonist OPC-31260 showed no such effect. A23187, a representative Ca ionophore, also increased filopodial length, and the A23187-induced increase in filopodial length was potentiated by AVP and AVP fragments. These results indicated that AVP(4-9) and AVP(4-8) increased filopodial length in cultured hippocampal neurons by activating V(1) receptors. Both phenomena induced by AVP(4-9) and AVP(4-8) were associated with intracellular calcium mobilization.
