The possible cerebral cortical circuitry for spatial memory in primates is discussed in light of a conceptual model and clinical as well as animal behavioral data. It is proposed that spatial memory formation begins with the arrival of sensory information in primary sensory areas and involves progressive elaboration through parasensory and higher-order association cortices. The connectivity between the association areas and the paralimbic and limbic regions is viewed as critical to the consolidation process. Finally, the execution of spatial behavior is presumed to involve the post-Rolandic and paralimbic projections to the frontal lobe. It is hoped that this conceptualization may provide a framework for further studies dealing with spatial memory.
