Serotonergic raphe deafferentiation elicits an up regulation of a nM (3H)WB-4101 binding site in rat hippocampus for which norepinephrine displays high affinity and prazosin displays low affinity. Guanine nucleotide affects the nM binding to hippocampal alpha-1 adrenergic receptors. Firstly, Gpp(NH)p, a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, inhibits (3H)WB-4101 binding at 3 nM concentration of the radioligand, the ligand concentration labelling the lower affinity, nM, binding site. Secondly, the addition of Gpp(NH)p causes recovery of the heterogeneity of binding sites lost upon preincubation of the membranes with 100 microM epinephrine, apparently by decreasing the affinity of the nM (3H)WB-4101 binding site for the adrenergic receptors. The phenomenon was still observed in the presence of saturating concentrations of the alpha-2 antagonist, yohimbine, and the beta antagonist, propranolol. The results imply that Gpp(NH)p regulates ligand binding to hippocampal alpha-1 agonist sites. It is likely that agonist and antagonist binding sites for the alpha-1 receptor exist in hippocampus with the agonist site being modulated by serotonin.
