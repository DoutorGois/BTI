This study examined the possible involvement of amino acid release from ventral hippocampus in the establishment and maintenance of kindling in rats. Release of amino acids from ventral hippocampus was measured by microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography. Samples were obtained by microdialysis perfusion of freely moving animals receiving deep prepiriform cortex (DPC) electrical stimulation. Samples of perfusate were collected before, during and after kindling was established. DPC kindling stimulation significantly increased concentrations of glutamate (Glu) and glycine (Gly) in perfusate from ventral hippocampus during kindling. Increased basal release of Glu was evident up to 30 days after the last electrical stimulation. We conclude that release of Glu and Gly in the ventral hippocampus may play an important role during establishment, but not in maintenance of kindling.
