AIM AND METHODS: To study the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on the treatment of cerebral ischemia, and to provide theoretical basis for hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), we examined the effect of 0.15 MPa and 0.25 MPa HBO treatment (60 min/d, for 3 successive days ) on ischemia reperfusion - induced apoptosis in gerbil hippocampus CA1 using TUNEL staining method. RESULTS: The number of neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus CA1 was significantly decreased in HBOT groups(P < 0.01). Neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus CA1 in 0.25 MPa groups were less than that in 0.15 MPa groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: HBOT is effective in reducing neuronal apoptosis and in protecting neurons from injury of ischemia reperfusion, and 0.25 MPa is an appropriate pressure for HBOT.
