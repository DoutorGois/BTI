Hebbian synaptic learning requires co-activation of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. However, under some conditions, information regarding the postsynaptic action potential, carried by backpropagating action potentials, can be strongly degraded before it reaches the distal exhibit Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP)? Recent results show that LTP can indeed occur at synapses on distal dendrites of hippocamal CA1 neurons, even in the absence of a postsynaptic somatic spike. Instead. local dendritic spikes contribute to the depolarization required to induce LTP. Here, a dendritically constrained synaptic learning rule is proposed, which suggests that nearby synapses can encode temporally contiguous events.
