To facilitate common marmoset brain research, we produced a DNA microarray with 7557 probe sets derived from the common marmoset brain. Gene expression profiles in the frontal lobe, hippocampus, cerebellum and amygdaloid nucleus were then analyzed and the top 100 probe sets expressed in each structure were compared. The three lists for the frontal lobe, hippocampus and amygdaloid nucleus were very similar but the probe sets for the cerebellum demonstrated specific differences. Some of the genes specifically expressed in cerebellum were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR to verify the DNA microarray results. Of examined genes, 5 showed extremely strong expression in cerebellum in comparison with the other structures. The results of real-time quantitative PCR were well consistent with the microarray findings, validating our newly developed DNA microarray as a useful tool for brain research with the common marmoset.
