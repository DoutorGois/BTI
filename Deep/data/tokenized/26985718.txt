The hippocampus exhibits theta oscillations when animals navigate. Vass et al. (2016) discovered that theta oscillations are also present when humans are moved through a virtual environment without sensory feedback, indicating that theta oscillations have a general role in spatial cognition beyond sensorimotor processing.
