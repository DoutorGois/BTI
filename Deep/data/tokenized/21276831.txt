Neuropeptide Y (NPY) network effects in hippocampus and frontal cortex and its impact on epileptiform neocortical discharges were investigated in rat juvenile brain slices. NPY (1 muM) reduced amplitudes of paired pulse stimulation in hippocampal brain tissue (p<0.05) whereas NPY (1 nM-2 muM) had no effect in neocortex. Late stage epileptiform activity in the neocortex was unaffected by NPY (1 muM). Our results point to a region dependent effect of NPY with a high impact on hippocampal and minimal impact on neocortical networks.
