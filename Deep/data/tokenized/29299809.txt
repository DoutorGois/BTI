We studied the effect of status epilepticus (SE) on short-term synaptic plasticity. The amplitudes of field potentials in response to extracellular stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals were recorded in hippocampal slices. Subtle modifications were revealed on day 1 after SE, whereas on days 3 and 7 we did not find any differences from the control. These data show that, one day after SE, the probability of a transmitter release in hippocampal synapses decreases that serves as a compensatory mechanism, which prevents seizure activity.
