The phenomenon of detergent insolubility of bovine hippocampal membranes in Triton X-100 was monitored by estimating the presence of phospholipids in the insoluble pellet. This represents a convenient and unambiguous assay and reports the dependence of the extent of phospholipid solubilization on detergent concentration. The advantage of this approach is its ability to accurately determine the extent of detergent insolubility in natural membranes. Importantly, our results show that when suboptimal concentrations of Triton X-100 are used for solubilization, interpretations of the mechanism and extent of detergent insolubility should be made with adequate caution. At concentrations of Triton X-100 that leads to no further solubilization, approximately 44% of phospholipids are left insoluble at 4 degrees C in bovine hippocampal membranes. Cholesterol depletion using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin enhanced phospholipid solubilization at low detergent concentrations but produced no significant change in the amount of insoluble phospholipids at saturating detergent concentration. Progressive solubilization by the detergent resulted in insoluble membranes that contained lipids with higher fatty acyl chain order as reported by fluorescence polarization studies using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). These results suggest that it is the presence of such lipids rather than their association with cholesterol that determines detergent insolubility in membranes.
