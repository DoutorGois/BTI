We have produced controlled local demyelination in Wistar rat fimbriae by injection of microliter quantities of the detergent lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) stereotactically. Six to seven days later the hippocampus and fornix was dissected out en bloc and maintained in vitro for electrical evaluation of conduction through the damaged area. The tissue was then fixed for verification of the lesion by light and electron microscopy. All fimbriae showed a normal conducted action potential with a latency of 0.5 to 1.5 ms when the conduction distance was 4-5 mm. LPC-lesioned fimbriae also showed a later wave with a latency of 4-5 ms. This later wave had the same stimulus-response curve as the primary action potential, but was more sensitive to repeated stimulation. We interpret this wave as evidence of conduction into or through a demyelinated region. LPC-lesioned fimbriae also showed histological evidence of demyelination. This preparation provides an in vitro model for the study of acute local demyelination of central nervous system white matter, such as that induced by multiple sclerosis and other focally demyelinating diseases.
