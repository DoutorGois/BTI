The mitochondrial potential is an essential regulator in cellular physiology and detection of this parameter in living cells is still under discussion. Here we present a protocol which allows the use of rhodamine 123 as a probe for quantifying the mitochondrial potential. To avoid dequenching artefacts the detection area is limited to the area above the nucleus. In co-cultured rat hippocampal astrocytes and neurons, we analysed the mitochondrial accumulation of the cationic fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 (Rh123). Application of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoro-methoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP, 4 micromol/L) together with the ATP-synthase inhibitor oligomycin (Oli, 10 micromol/L) induced an immediate fluorescence increase of Rh123-loaded mitochondria. This effect is due to the well-known fluorescence dequenching caused by the reduction in concentration of Rh123 in the mitochondria after depolarization. However, above the nucleus an increase in fluorescence was registered. Due to the absence of mitochondria in the area above the nucleus this fluorescence increase is most likely caused by the Rh123 release from mitochondria. Pre-treatment of cells with antimycin A abolished the response to FCCP/Oli. Furthermore, a 10-min exposure to 50 mmol/L K+, which causes a plasma membrane depolarization in neurons, did not significantly change the FCCP/Oli-mediated Rh123 release measured above the nucleus of neurons. However, application of 100 micromol/L glutamate enhanced the effect of FCCP/Oli both in astrocytes and neurons. This enhancement is interpreted as an increase in mitochondrial potential above the control potential. Thus, this Rh123 method described here allows a cell type-specific determination of changes of mitochondrial polarization.
