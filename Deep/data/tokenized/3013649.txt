Chronic (10 days) application of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) to male and female rats results in a significant but highly localized decrease in beta-adrenoceptor number. Saturation studies on homogenized tissue revealed a decrease in Bmax in the frontal cortex and hippocampus but not in caudate or cerebellum of both sexes. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis showed the changes in the hippocampus to be in the CA1 and dentate gyrus but not CA3. No effect was seen in caudate, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, cerebellar molecular and granular layers and several thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei.
