In a Sham-controlled study we applied proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at 4.7 T to a model of experimental traumatic brain contusion. The time course of cerebral metabolite changes was monitored in serial investigation in 14 Sprague Dawley rats up to 4 weeks after trauma. 6 animals served as controls. 1H-MRS spectra were acquired from a voxel covering the hippocampus/basal ganglia ipsi and contralateral to the lesion. Metabolites ratios of the injured hemisphere were compared to those ipsilateral in Sham animals and to those of the contralateral side in the trauma animals. NAA/Cr ratio and Glu/Cr ratio, possible markers of neuronal loss, persistently decreased after trauma to a minimum of -40% and -20% versus controls, respectively. One week after trauma Cho/Cr ratio was strongly increased by 73%. This might indicate a high inflammatory activity at that time. Lac/Cr ratio showed long-lasting and continuing increases up to 2000% versus controls as a sign of permanently shifted posttraumatic energy metabolism. 1H-MRS proved to be a useful non-invasive method for in-vivo monitoring of posttraumatic metabolism also in models of brain contusion. In single cases however, accompanying haemorrhage can potentially prevent useful data acquisition.
