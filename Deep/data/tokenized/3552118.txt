In rhesus monkeys, autoradiographic tracing methods, complemented by immunocytochemical and histochemical techniques, were used to delineate pathways by which cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (ndbB) project to forebrain targets. Following injections of [3H]amino acids into these nuclei, 5 major fiber pathways were identified: axons of the nbM and ndbB project medially, principally within the cingulum bundle, to dorsomedial portions of the hemispheres; nbM and ndbB fibers exit laterally beneath the pallidum and striatum, enter the external and extreme capsules, and pass within the corona radiata to terminate in lateral and caudal regions of neocortex; axons coursing ventrally from the nbM project to portions of the temporal lobe, including the amygdala; some fibers pass through the fibrae pass orbitofrontales to the orbitofrontal cortex; and, finally axons of the nbM/ndbB project via the fimbria/rornix and a ventral pathway to the hippocampus. The presence of these 5 radiolabeled pathways arising from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons was confirmed by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry and choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry.
