The role of postsynaptic kinases in the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice. A peptide inhibitor for the catalytic domain of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaM-kinase) was applied through a perfused patch pipette. The inhibitor completely blocked both the short-term potentiation and LTP induced by a pairing protocol. This indicates that the kinase or kinases affected by the peptide are downstream from depolarization in the LTP cascade. The ability to block LTP required that measures be taken to interfere with degradation of the peptide kinase inhibitor by endogenous proteases; either addition of protease inhibitors or modifications of the peptide itself greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the peptide. Protease inhibitors by themselves or control peptide did not block LTP induction. To study the effect of kinase inhibitor on LTP maintenance, we induced LTP in one pathway. Subsequent introduction of the kinase inhibitor blocked the induction of LTP in a second pathway, but it did not affect maintenance of LTP in the first. The implications for the role of kinases in LTP maintenance are discussed.
