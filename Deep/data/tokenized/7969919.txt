Age-related decline of cognition and memory, in humans and other animals, appears to be associated with neuronal loss. Experimental and clinical evidence has shown that the hippocampal formation is one of the brain regions most vulnerable to the ageing process. Because excess of glutamate is neurotoxic to hippocampal neurons, abnormalities in glutamate neurotransmitter function may play a crucial role in neurodegenerative disorders, especially in conjunction with brain ageing. We have used in situ hybridization to study the expression of the two major alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)-selective glutamate receptor subunits, involved in the control of calcium permeability in the young adult and aged rat hippocampus. We show that the levels of messenger RNA encoding the AMPA-selective glutamate receptor subunit-1 (GluR1 or GluRA) and AMPA-selective glutamate receptor subunit-2 (GluR2 or GluRB) are highest in the dentate gyrus, followed by the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields. We also show that the levels of both messenger RNAs decrease differentially with age in all subfields of the hippocampus. Finally, the GluR1/GluR2 messenger RNA ratios increase in the aged hippocampus, particularly in the CA3 subfield, suggesting that altered calcium homeostasis may contribute to age-related neuronal death.
