Since the hippocampus is likely to be a major site of phencyclidine (PCP) action, the effects of various doses of PCP (1.8, 18 or 36 nM) as well as 3.6 nM MK-801 or saline injected directly into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was tested for acquisition of a spatial navigation task (dry land version of a water maze) using a paradigm that assesses short term memory based on learning within a day and long term memory based on learning between days. Results indicated that relative to saline or 1.8 nM PCP injected rats, rats with 18 or 36 nM PCP or 3.6 nM MK-801 injections were impaired in acquisition of the task as measured by increased distances traveled to find the food location between days but not within days. In additional experiments 36 nM PCP or 3.6 nM MK-801 did not produce any deficits in the acquisition of an object discrimination task. It is suggested that PCP through its blocking action of the NMDA receptor in the dentate gyrus or CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus mediates the consolidation of new spatial location information.
