Repeated low-frequency stimulation of the perforant path results in a decrement in the population EPSP and population spike recorded in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. The EPSP decrement is accompanied, however, by an increase in the population spike height/population EPSP slope relation, suggesting that an increase in granule cell excitability also occurs. The present experiments explored the mechanisms of this apparent increase in excitability using standard field potential recording techniques to assess perforant path input/output curves in rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Low-frequency homosynaptic stimulation (512 pulses, 1 Hz) of the perforant path resulted in a decreased spike threshold and overall shift to the left of the function relating population spike height to EPSP slope. These changes were consistently produced, even when granule cell discharge was inhibited by conditioning stimulation of the contralateral hilus. On the other hand, low-frequency heterosynaptic (lateral perforant path) or antidromic (mossy fiber) driving of the granule cells only slightly increased the medial path spike/EPSP relation, and did not alter the spike threshold. The excitability shift accompanying habituation was qualitatively different from that associated with long-term potentiation, but these shifts did not summate. The interpretation which best explains these various results is that granule cell excitability is increased during low-frequency perforant path stimulation by a process of disinhibition, caused by habituation of perforant path excitatory synaptic drive onto feed-forward inhibitory interneurons.
