A substantial number of patients do not respond sufficiently to antidepressant drugs and are therefore often co-medicated with lithium as an augmentative strategy. Since lithium has been demonstrated to affect 5-HT neurotransmission, we examined the effect of acute and subchronic lithium on 5-HT levels after a challenge with citalopram. We found that subchronic administration of lithium increases extracellular 5-HT baseline level and decreases the extracellular 5-HIAA baseline. However, we found no evidence that the effect of acute citalopram on extracellular 5-HT levels is augmented by acute or subchronic lithium.
