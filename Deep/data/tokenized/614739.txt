The authors removed from Lacerta viridis specimens part of the dorsal hippocampus of one telencephalic hemisphere. The animals were sacrificed 110 and 260 days after the operation; 24 hours before the operation on the encephalon, each was dosed with 6--3H thymidine. An examination of the historadiographic slides showed a clear remedial process in the operated area which, 260 days after has renewed in thickness but was still minus its characteristic cellular layer. The area of the telencephalon affected by the remedial process was examined by the authors and they have put forward the hypothesis that in relation to the type of operation performed, said area is localized prevalently in the dorsal hippocampus of the caudal half of the telencephalic hemispherg. The authors have also shown that the remedial procress, though attenuated is still in progress. 260 days after the operation.
