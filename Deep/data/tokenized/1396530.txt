Audiogenic seizures in genetically susceptible rodents are provoked by intense acoustic stimulations which result in a tonic seizure associated with a short flattening of the EEG. These seizures have been shown to involve primarily brainstem structures. Daily exposure to sound for 30-40 days produced a permanent change in the evoked seizure with development of facial myoclonias, rearing and falling, or of tonic-clonic seizures accompanied by high amplitude cortical spike-and-wave discharges. Kindled audiogenic seizures appear similar to seizures kindled from amygdala or hippocampus, suggesting that repeated auditory stimulations cause a progressive propagation of the epileptic discharge toward limbic structures. To verify this hypothesis, the behavioral and EEG development of electrical hippocampal kindling has been studied in 7 non epileptic controls (NE), 8 acoustic susceptible (AS), and 8 audiogenic kindled rats (KAS). The behavioral and EEG development of the electrical hippocampal kindling was similar in the AS and the NE rats. However, 2 animals in the AS group but no controls exhibited behavioral running and bouncing during the course of hippocampal kindling. In the KAS group, the hippocampal kindling was clearly facilitated as compared to NE and AS: behavioral stage greater than or equal to 5 was reached in a mean of 4 stimulations in KAS versus 30 and 22 stimulations respectively in NE and AS groups. This positive transfer phenomenon suggests that during kindling of audiogenic seizures, epileptic discharge spreads from the brainstem to the forebrain and progressively involves the hippocampus.
