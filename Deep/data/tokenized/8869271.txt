Application of Cerebrolysin (0.1 microgram per 1 ml) by a fast microperfusion system induced an inward current of 0.2 to 1 nA in all neurones from newborn mouse hippocampi held at -30 mV membrane potential. Cerebrolysin-induced currents were reduced by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (2 microM) by 65%, by the NMDA antagonist aminophosphovaleric acid (APV, 10 microM) by 27% and by the non-NMDA antagonist cyanonitriquinoxalinedione (CNQX, 10 microM) by 20%. Cerebrolysin dialyzed through a 3.6 kD gut did not induce any transmembrane current but potentiated the response induced by GABA (10 microM) to 135%. We conclude that, in addition to amino acids which activate GABAA, NMDA and non-NMDA receptors, Cerebrolysin also contains a peptide which potentiates the GABAA receptor response.
