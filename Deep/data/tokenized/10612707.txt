Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and is one of the most conserved peptides in evolution, suggesting an important role in the regulation of basic physiological functions, including learning and memory. In addition, experimental studies have suggested that NPY, together with its receptors, may have a direct implication in several pathological disorders, including epilepsy/seizure. NPY-like immunoreactivity and NPY receptors have been shown to be present throughout the brain, but is concentrated in the hippocampus. The hippocampal formation has been repeatedly implicated in the modulation of cognition, as well as the pathogenesis of seizure. This review will concentrate on the hippocampal distribution of NPY, its receptors and the putative role played by this peptide in seizure, together with the regulation of cognitive function associated with learning and memory.
