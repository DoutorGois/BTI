Hypothalamic or hippocampal slices and adenohypophyseal lobes taken from adrenalectomized male rats either intact or with complete hypothalamic deafferentation (CHD) were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer in the presence of either 10-50 nM [3H]corticosterone or [3H]dexamethasone with or without 500-fold excess of unlabeled steroid for 15-60 min. The cell nuclear binding in the hypothalamic slices from the CHD rats, was markedly reduced by approximately 50% but remained unchanged in the hippocampi and in the pituitaries. These results suggest that brain sites outside the mediobasal hypothalamus are important for the regulation of corticosterone binding in the hypothalamus.
