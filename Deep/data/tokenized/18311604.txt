The kynurenine (KYN) pathway, which is initiated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), is a tryptophan (TRP) metabolic pathway. It shares TRP with the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) pathway. In major depression, activation of the KYN pathway may deplete 5-HT. In the present study we investigated the influence of various risk factors for depression, such as ageing, social isolation and psychological stress, on TRP metabolism. Male ICR mice (postnatal day, PND, 21) were divided into two housing conditions, isolation and group housing, reared for 4 weeks (young adult) or 5 months (adult) and exposed to novelty stress. We measured TRP, KYN and 5-HT contents in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and dorsal raphe nuclei to investigate the balance between the KYN and 5-HT pathways. Ageing decreased TRP and KYN and increased 5-HT. Thus, ageing shifted the balance to the latter. In the younger group, social isolation decreased TRP and KYN and increased the 5-HT/TRP ratio, whereas novelty stress increased TRP and KYN and decreased the 5-HT/TRP ratio. Thus, social isolation shifted the balance to the latter, whereas novelty stress shifted it to the former. In the older group, these effects were restricted to specific brain regions. Ageing and social isolation counteracted novelty stress effects on TRP metabolism.
