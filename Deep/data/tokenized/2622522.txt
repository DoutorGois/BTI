Cholecystokinin octapeptide sulfate-like immunoreactivity (CCK-8S-LI) was determined by radioimmunoassay in rat brain areas following injections of pentobarbital, halothane and chloral hydrate. Time-dependent changes in the concentrations of CCK-8S-LI were different between pentobarbital and chloral hydrate in all brain regions studied. After pentobarbital injection, CCK-8S-Li peaked at 30-60 min in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum and substantia nigra; after chloral hydrate injection, CCK-8S-LI peaked at 120 min in the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra. Both anesthetics induced almost the same sleeping times. Halothane inhalation caused increases in the concentrations of CCK-8S-LI in the amygdala and hippocampus. In addition, following intracardial perfusion of saline for 30 min after pentobarbital anesthesia, the concentrations of CCK-8S-LI increased in the nucleus accumbens, and decreased in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that since different anesthetics cause different changes in CCK levels, anesthetics affect studies of these neurons.
