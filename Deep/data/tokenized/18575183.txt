Limbic encephalitis (LE) is frequently associated with malignancy. Non-paraneoplastic LE is less common and in this form, voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies are usually found. However in 2007 the spectrum was further extended by a report on four patients with presumed non-paraneoplastic LE in whom neither VGKC-antibodies nor other antibodies could be found (Samarasekera et al. 2007). Despite immunmodulatory treatment all these patients had severe neurological residual symptoms. Here we describe a further patient in whom extensive diagnostic procedures suggested non-paraneoplastic antibody-negative limbic encephalitis. Although this woman had prolonged status epilepticus during seven weeks, her outcome was excellent.
