A dual probing methodology was implemented so that combined in vivo voltammetric (electrochemical) and in vivo electrophysiological analysis could be carried out concomitantly in two distinct brain regions of the same anaesthetized animal, i.e., cell body such as the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and related terminal region such as the hippocampus, the frontal cortex, and the amygdala. In particular, this methodology allowed: In addition, the dual probing methodology has been applied to verify the original proposal that a combined treatment with a potassium (SK) channel blocker such as apamin and an SSRI (i.e., fluoxetine) could overcome the slow onset of the SSRI upon central 5-HT activity that could be related to the slow onset of its therapeutic action. Briefly, the effect of apamin either alone or followed by fluoxetine upon cell firing in the DRN (in vivo electrophysiology) and concomitantly upon 5-HT levels (in vivo voltammetry) in the amygdala (forebrain structure involved in mood regulation and innervated by ascending 5-HT projections from the DRN) was studied.
