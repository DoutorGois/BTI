Clozapine and haloperidol were tested for their ability to influence the acquisition of kindled seizures following electrical stimulation of the amygdala and ventral hippocampus. While haloperidol pretreatment did not alter kindling genesis from either limbic region, preexposure to clozapine delayed the rate at which kindling evolved. Analysis of the number of seizure behaviors expressed during epileptogenesis revealed that clozapine produced a relative antagonism of seizure development arresting kindling at the stage-3 level. The kindling inhibition was dependent upon the daily administration of clozapine during the kindling process and was not evident after withdrawal from a chronic schedule of clozapine exposure. A subconvulsive dose of pilocarpine (80.0 mg/kg) produced an overall enhancement of kindling rate, a finding consistent with the excitatory role of acetylcholine (ACh) in kindling. Lower doses of pilocarpine (20.0 and 40.0 mg/kg) that did not alter seizure advancement partially antagonized the clozapine-elicited inhibition of amygdaloid kindling. Pilocarpine, however, did not affect the clozapine-induced increase in the number of stage-3 behaviors exhibited during amygdaloid kindling, suggesting that other neurochemical effects of clozapine, not related to its anticholinergic properties, modulate the kindling suppression. Clozapine's unique actions on limbic system sensitization were discussed in relation to its effectiveness as an antipsychotic agent.
