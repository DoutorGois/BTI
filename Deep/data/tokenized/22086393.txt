The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are important for learning and memory as damage to this region produces a persistent amnestic syndrome. Dense connections between the ATN and the hippocampus exist, and importantly, damage to the ATN can impair hippocampal functioning. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a key neurotransmitter in the hippocampus, and in vivo measures of ACh are correlated to learning and memory performance. In the present study, complete lesions of the ATN impaired performance on two measures of hippocampal-dependent learning and memory (spontaneous alternation and delayed alternation) and severely disrupted behaviorally evoked ACh efflux within the hippocampus of adult male rats. In contrast, incomplete ATN lesions did not impair spontaneous alternation performance but did impair delayed alternation performance while blunting hippocampal ACh efflux. Interestingly, ATN lesions of any size did not affect basal concentrations of ACh in the hippocampus. These results demonstrate that the ATN have the capacity to modulate behaviorally relevant neuronal transmission within the hippocampus.
