Using method of in situ hybridization, the effects of subcutaneous injection (s.c.) of formalin (For) into one hindpaw (hyperalgesia) on IL-2R beta mRNA expression in hippocampus (Hip) were studied. In addition, the effects of coadministration of morphine (i.p.) or ACTH (i.p.) with For (s.c.) were studied also. It was found that IL-2R beta mRNA was present in normal rat's Hip, intensely in granular cells of dentate gyrus and CA1-CA4 neurons. Subcutaneous injection of For increased IL-2R beta mRNA from 6 h to at least 24 h, reaching a peak at 12 h. Coadministration with morphine enhanced the effects of For on IL-2R beta mRNA expression, but no significant change was found with coadministration of ACTH. The above results suggest that IL-2R might be involved in pain modulation.
