Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been demonstrated in the pre-clinical and clinical settings to have an antidepressant effect. However, studies on the long-lasting effect of rTMS, especially when the effect is measured after treatment has ceased for a few weeks is lacking. We examined this question in a chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression. We gave 3 weeks of high frequency (15 Hz) rTMS, venlafaxine, or these two treatments combined to a modified CUMS paradigm, and then investigated the prolonged effect of treatments. Behavioral testing (sucrose preference test, open field test, forced swimming test, novelty suppressed feeding test), plasma hormone level, hippocampal BrdU labeling, and amount of related neurotropic factors were used to assess the effects of stress and treatments. Long-term chronic rTMS significantly reversed andehonic-like behavior, increased hippocampus cell proliferation, BDNF protein level, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 compared with CUMS rats two weeks after the cessation of rTMS treatment. However, the changes in plasma hormone level were not sustained for that amount of time. Venlafaxine had no interaction with the physical stimulation. Our results suggest that high frequency rTMS has long-lasting effects, which may have some relationship with neuroplasticity.
