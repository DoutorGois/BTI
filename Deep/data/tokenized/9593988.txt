Using T2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in a pyrithiamin-treated, thiamin deficient (TD) rat model of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), we have observed hyperintensity in the thalamus, hypothalamus, collicular bodies and hippocampus which was enhanced 40 min after a glucose load. Hyperintensity was not evident in these structures in thiamin replete rats receiving glucose nor was it enhanced in TD rats administered 2-deoxyglucose. Residual hyperintensity was still evident in the hippocampus as long as 30 days after thiamin administration and was increased by repeat glucose challenge at that time. These data indicate that the hippocampus is as vulnerable as the thalamus to some persistent pathological change when glucose is metabolised in a state of thiamin deficiency.
