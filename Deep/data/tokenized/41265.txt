The incorporation of (14C)-leucine into the total proteins of the hippocampus is inhibited by high concentrations of cholinergic agonists, with nicotinic substances (such as 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazine) being more effective than muscarinic compounds (such as arecoline and pilocarpine). Under these conditions the incorporation of (3H)-fucose is not influenced.
