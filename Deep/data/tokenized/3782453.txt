In a recent article, Butters (1985) emphasized that involvement of the nucleus basalis of Meynert may be the critical area affected in alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome. Examination of the neuroanatomical pathways between this structure and other neural structures involved in memory (i.e., hippocampus and dorsal medial thalamus) suggests a somewhat different emphasis might be more productive in facilitating understanding of memory processes. The important question is: In what way might the nucleus basalis of Meynert interact with other structures involved in memory processes? Other data also suggest that it will be necessary to emphasize a whole system of brain structures as opposed to one or two small nuclei.
