In the present article we show how studying synaptic mechanisms in hippocampal slice preparations provides information that may be useful in, firstly, the understanding of the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease and, secondly, in the development of novel therapies for dementia. We use several examples, drawn from our own work: (i) The identification of the function of AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. (ii) The discovery of mechanisms that can regulate the activation of NMDA receptors. (iii) The use of transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease. (iv) The identification of a mechanism that can account for the cognitive enhancing effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine. (v) The discovery of a role of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (tau kinase) in synaptic plasticity.
