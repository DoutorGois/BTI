Embryonic stem (ES) cells can generate neural progenitors and neurons in vitro and incorporate into the adult central nervous system (CNS) following transplantation, suggesting their therapeutic potential for treating neurological disorders. However, our understanding of the conditions that direct ES-derived neural progenitor (ESNP) migration and differentiation within different regions of the adult CNS is incomplete. Rodents treated with the chemoconvulsant kainic acid (KA) experience seizures and display hippocampal sclerosis, as well as enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis, similar to pathological findings in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To examine the potential for ESNPs to incorporate into the adult hippocampus and differentiate into hippocampal neurons or glia following seizure-induced damage, we compared the fates of ESNPs after they were transplanted into the CA3 region or fimbria 1 week following KA-induced seizures. After 4-8 weeks, ESNPs grafted into the CA3 region had migrated to the dentate gyrus (DG), where a small subset adopted neural stem cell fates and continued to proliferate, based on bromodeoxyuridine uptake. Others differentiated into neuroblasts or dentate granule neurons. In contrast, most ESNPs transplanted into the fimbria migrated extensively along existing fiber tracts and differentiated into oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Hippocampal grafts in mice not subjected to seizures displayed a marked tendency to form tumors, and this effect was more pronounced in the DG than in the fimbria. Taken together, these data suggest that seizures induce molecular changes in the CA3 region and DG that promote region-specific neural differentiation and suppress tumor formation.
