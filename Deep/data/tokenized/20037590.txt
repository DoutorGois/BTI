We developed a caged GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which, when combined with an appropriate caged glutamate, allows bimodal control of neuronal membrane potential with subcellular resolution using optically independent two-photon uncaging of each neurotransmitter. We used two-color, two-photon uncaging to fire and block action potentials from rat hippocampal CA1 neurons in brain slices with 720-nm and 830-nm light, respectively. Our method should be generalizable to other chemical messenger pairs.
