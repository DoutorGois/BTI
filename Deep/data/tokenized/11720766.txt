To determine the possible therapeutic potential of neural stem cells (NSCs) introduced into the damaged central nervous system, we grafted adult hippocampus-derived NSCs into the hippocampus of rats with transient global ischemia. Transient four-vessel occlusion yielded 90-95% losses of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. In this region, 1-3% of the grafted cells survived; and 3-9% of them expressed NeuN, a neuronal marker. Rats with more than 120 NeuN-positive cells showed partial improvement of impaired spatial learning in a water maze test. These results suggest that NSCs grafted in the ischemic brain are able to differentiate into neurons and to improve spatial recognition.
