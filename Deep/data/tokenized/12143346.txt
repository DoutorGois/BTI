Methods to assess the development of cerebral damage need to be quantitative, reliable, reproducible and safe. They must be acceptable to patients and to a healthy control group, for repeated use and the acquisition and analytical methods must be stable over years. Longitudinal studies are necessary to determine whether secondary cerebral damage occurs as a consequence to the epilepsies. The principal aim of longitudinal studies is to detect physical evidence of brain damage when it occurs. Patient groups will be heterogeneous in this regard and analysis will need to be not only of changes in group means, but also of the number of patients who show significant changes in imaging parameters, that exceed the limits of test-retest reliability. MRI is attractive as a tool to evaluate the presence and development of cerebral damage in patients with epilepsy. MRI is readily available and non-invasive, making it acceptable to patients and controls. MRI volumetry is reliable and reproducible, but the sensitivity of the method to detect subtle abnormalities has not yet been established. Longitudinal studies are ongoing in patients with newly diagnosed and chronic epilepsy, with an inter-scan interval of 3.5 years, using complementary voxel-based and region-based methods that can detect changes in hippocampal and cerebellar volumes of 3% and neocortical volume changes of 1.6%. MR spectroscopy may be more sensitive for detecting abnormalities, but the test-retest reliability is less good. Other MRI tools, such as diffusion tensor imaging, may be useful methods for evaluating secondary cerebral damage acutely and chronically.
