A rapid, simple, and efficient chloroform/methanol-free method of isolating gangliosides is described. The nonionic polyoxyethylene detergent, hexaethyleneglycol mono-n-tetradecyl ether (C14EO6), forms clear micellar solutions in water, but two-phase separation can be achieved by centrifugation in the presence of ammonium sulfate at room temperature. A mixture of pure gangliosides, metabolically labeled gangliosides obtained from cultured hippocampal neurons, and gangliosides from rat cerebellar tissue were quantitatively recovered in the detergent-rich upper (coacervate) phase, with a partition coefficient K > 60. Gangliosides were subsequently separated from the detergent using an Iatrobead column prior to analysis by thin-layer chromatography. The procedure described here is as efficient as other methods of ganglioside extraction, such as that using chloroform/methanol/water/pyridine, but is less time-consuming inasmuch as extraction, purification, and TLC analysis can be completed within 1 day.
