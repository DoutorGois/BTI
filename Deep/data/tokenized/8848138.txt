Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to investigate the distribution of binding of [3H]SCH 23390 to dopamine (D1) and [3H]spiroperone to D2 receptors in regions of the forebrain of the one-day-old domestic chick (Gallus domesticus). High levels of specific binding of the D1 and D2 ligands were found in the striatal regions (paleostriatum augmentatum and lobus parolfactorius) of the one-day-old chick, as reported previously in the pigeon, turtle and rat, whilst binding levels were considerably lower in the pallidum (paleostriatum primitivum), hippocampus and hyperstriatum ventrale. The proportions of D1 and D2 receptor binding in the chick were relatively similar in the striatum and pallidum, apart from the paleostriatum augmentatum, where D2 receptors outnumber those of D1 by a factor of two. Binding of the D1 and D2 ligands to forebrain regions was also investigated 30 min after one-trial passive avoidance training of one-day-old chicks in which the aversive stimulus was a bead coated with a bitter tasting substance, methyl anthranilate. These experiments demonstrated a large and highly significant bilateral increase (compared to control birds) in binding to D1 (but not D2) receptors in the lobus parolfactorius. In this striatal region, equivalent to the caudate-putamen of mammals, previous studies have shown that synaptic and dendritic alterations occur following avoidance training. It is concluded that alterations in dopamine binding may be involved in processes that result in modification of the pecking response in chicks after avoidance training.
