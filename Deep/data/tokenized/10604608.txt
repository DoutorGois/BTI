In our previous work (Semyanov and Godukhin, 1997), we showed that the repeated short-term extracellular K+ (K0+) increases induced long-lasting reduction of the threshold of evoked epileptiform discharges in CA1 hippocampal slices isolated from normal (nonkindled) rats. This state had some features characteristic of traditional in vivo kindling and was described as in vitro kindling-like state (VKLS). The aim of the present investigations was to determine the features of the VKLS development in CA1 slices isolated from electrical hippocampal kindled (nonepileptic) rats and from genetically-prone to audiogenic seizures audiokindled rats. We found that both forms of in vivo kindling occluded the VKLS development induced by the repeated K& increases in CA1 slices. These data provide more evidence that the in vivo kindling and VKLS developments in CA1 region of hippocampus are based on activation of similar cellular mechanisms. It is suggested that the described model of in vitro kindling can be useful for further studies of the cellular-molecular mechanisms of plastic alterations in neurons associated with the start of kindling induced epileptogenesis.
