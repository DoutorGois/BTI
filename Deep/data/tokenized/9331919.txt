We examined the effect of propofol, an injectable anesthetic agent on conflict behavior in a Vogel type conflict test and on release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) in the dorsal hippocampus using an in vivo microdialysis method in rats. Propofol (20 and 40 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently suppressed elevated 5-HT release normally seen in a conflict situation and concomitantly attenuated conflict behavior. These findings suggest that propofol exerts an antianxiety action by inhibiting 5-HT neuronal activity in the dorsal hippocampus.
