cGMP synthesis in cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, the caudate putamen, and the tegmento-pedunculopontine nucleus of the rat was studied during development after birth at P1, P4, P10, and P21, in the adult, and during aging. NO-mediated cGMP synthesis in these neurons was studied using the approach of in vitro incubation of brain slices in combination with cGMP-immunocytochemistry. The percentage of NO-responsive, cGMP-synthesizing cholinergic cells in the septum and diagonal band of Broca decreased from 75% to 6% in adult animals and to 2% in aged ones. In the caudate putamen, this decrease was from 81% to 21% in adult and 11% in aged animals. Cholinergic cells of the tegmento-pedunculopontine nucleus were unresponsive to NO and never showed cGMP-immunoreactivity. In addition, it was observed that the amount of NO-responsive, cGMP-synthesizing cholinergic fibers in the hippocampus declined in parallel with the maturation of the septal-hippocampal cholinergic pathway, whereas in the caudate putamen, this colocalization became complete 2 weeks after birth. It is concluded that the property of NO-mediated cGMP synthesis in the cholinergic nuclei of the forebrain is developmentally regulated after birth and that NO-cGMP signal transduction has a role in establishing cholinergic neuronal connections in the hippocampus and caudate putamen.
