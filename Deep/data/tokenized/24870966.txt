Sevoflurane, the commonly used inhalation anesthetic in children, has been shown to enhance cytosolic calcium levels and induce cognitive impairment in young mice. However, the downstream consequences of the sevoflurane-induced elevation in cytosolic calcium levels and the upstream mechanisms of the sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment remain largely to be determined. Hippocalcin is one of the neuronal calcium sensor proteins, and also binds to postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95). We therefore set out to determine the effects of sevoflurane on the levels of hippocalcin and PSD-95 in vitro and in vivo. Hippocampus neurons from mice and 6-day-old mice were treated with 4.1% sevoflurane for 6 h or 3% sevoflurane 2 h daily for 3 days, respectively. We then measured the levels of hippocalcin and PSD-95, and assessed whether BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, and memantine, a partial antagonist of the NMDA receptor, could inhibit the sevoflurane's effects. We found that sevoflurane decreased the levels of hippocalcin and PSD-95 in the neurons; and decreased the levels of hippocalcin and PSD-95 in the hippocampus of mice immediately after the anesthesia, but only the PSD-95 levels three weeks after the anesthesia. BAPTA inhibited the sevoflurane's effects in the neurons. Memantine attenuated the sevoflurane-induced reductions in the levels of hippocalcin and PSD-95, as well as the sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment in mice. These data suggested that sevoflurane decreased the levels of hippocalcin and PSD-95, which could serve as one of bridge mechanisms between the sevoflurane-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium levels and the sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment.
