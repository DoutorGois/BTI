Proliferating glial elements of 3 to 12-day-old mouse parietal cortex and dentate gyrus were investigated by the electron microscopic autoradiography of 3H-thymidine. The presence in these regions of three types of proliferating glial precursors was verified and related to astrocyte development. Comparing the two areas studied it was concluded that postnatal glial proliferation is independent from neurogenesis and that astroglia is capable of proliferation even in advanced stages of differentiation.
