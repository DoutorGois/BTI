Indirect evidence suggests that dopamine within the brain may participate in the regulation of immune responses both in humans and in rodents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible modulatory role played by specific dopamine D1 receptor subtypes within discrete sites of the brain dopaminergic pathways. Mitogen responsiveness of splenocytes and natural killer (NK) cell activity were measured in rats following microinfusion of SKF 38393, a specific dopamine D1 receptor agonist, into the ventral tegmental area, the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens and the CA1 area of the hippocampus. We report here that microinfusion of SKF 38393 (100 nmol) within the central amygdala increased the proliferative response of splenocytes to concanavalin A (ConA) while it did not modify the proliferative response of splenocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or NK cell activity. On the contrary, microinfusion of SKF 38393 into the nucleus accumbens decreased the proliferative response of splenocytes to ConA and LPS, while NK cell activity remained unchanged. Similarly, microinfusion of SKF 38393 into the CA1 area of the hippocampus decreased the proliferative response of splenocytes to LPS, but not to ConA and did not affect NK cell activity. Finally, microinfusion of SKF 38393 into the ventral tegmental area did not significantly modify the proliferative response of splenocytes to either ConA or LPS and did not affect NK cell activity. All immunological changes evoked through the different areas of the brain following microinfusion of SKF 38393 were prevented by systemic administration of SCH 23390, a specific D1 receptor antagonist.
