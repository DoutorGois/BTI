OBJECTIVE: To investigate the protect effects of Qingkailing injection on mitochondrion membrane potential (MMP) during injury induced by hypoxia-hypoglycemia and reoxygenation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. METHOD: Mitochondrion activity was measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) test. MMP and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured with confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULT: Hypoxia-hypoglycemia cultures for 5 hour and reoxygenation for 3 hour induced intracellular[Ca2+]i and apoptosis rate significantly increased. The effects were increased with the extending time of reoxygenation. MMP and mitochondrion activity declined significantly after 3 hour reoxygenation. The effects were declined with the extending time of reoxygenation. Qingkailing injection might have significantly decrease intracellular [Ca2+]i and apoptosis rate, increase MMP and mitochondrion activity. CONCLUSION: Qingkailing Injection might have significantly inhibit the decline in MMP induced by hypoxia-hypoglycemia and reoxygenation, and had effects of stable it and anti-neuronal apoptosis. The effects might be related to inhibit overload of intracellular free calcium.
