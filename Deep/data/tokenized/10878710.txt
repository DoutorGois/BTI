Recent evidence suggests that HIV-1 Vpr exists in soluble form in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Further, its abundance in the bloodstream, and the CSF, and its activity on other cell types suggest that it could have an effect on brain activity. Using mixed embryonic rat brain cultures as a model to examine the effects of physiological concentrations of extracellular Vpr protein, Vpr-induced cell death was observed. We also observed similar Vpr-induced effects in enriched primary cortical rat astrocytes, as well as in the C6 glioma cell line. Vpr-induced cell death observed in the astrocytic cells appeared to be caused primarily by a necrotic mechanism, although a few apoptotic nuclei were also present. We did not observe Vpr-induced effects on any primary cortical neurons, although we did observe Vpr-induced cell death in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes. Finally, we observed no cell cycle effects due to extracellular Vpr protein. This data points out that different cell types are affected by the toxic effects of extracellular Vpr protein, and that differential toxic effects of extracellular Vpr protein are observed in similar cell types.
