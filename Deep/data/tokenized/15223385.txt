Here, we found that a single intrathecal (i.t.) administration of a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), induced pain-like behaviors in mice. Furthermore, i.t.-administered PDBu caused the increased c-fos-like immunoreactivity in the parafascicular nuclei (PF), amygdala and cingulate cortex (CG), but not hippocampus. These findings suggest that the stimulation of spinal PKC results in an enhancement of neuronal activity in the PF, amygdala and CG associated with hyperalgesia.
