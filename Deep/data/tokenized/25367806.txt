The search for new therapeutic strategies through modulation of glutamatergic transmission using effective neuroprotective agents is essential. Glutamatergic excitotoxicity is a major factor common to neurodegenerative diseases and in acute events such as cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury and epilepsy. We have previously demonstrated that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) preconditioning in mice showed 50 % of protection against seizures and full protection against damage to neuronal tissue induced by quinolinic acid (QA). In this study, cellular and molecular mechanisms involved on NMDA preconditioning and neuroprotection were investigated in mice treated with NMDA 24 h before QA insult. Calcium uptake and D-aspartate release from hippocampal slices obtained from mice treated with NMDA plus QA and not displaying seizures (protected mice) were similar to control (saline) or NMDA preconditioned mice. Increased calcium uptake and glutamate release is evidenced in unprotected (convulsed) mice as well as QA control, demonstrating that calcium and glutamate are involved in NMDA-induced preconditioning. Increased glutamate release evoked by QA was blocked by MK-801, whereas increased calcium uptake was abolished by voltage-dependent calcium channels inhibitors, but not MK-801. NMDA preconditioning is effective in normalizing the deregulation of glutamate transport and calcium homeostasis evoked by QA due to aberrant NMDA receptors activation that culminates in seizures and hippocampal cells damage.
