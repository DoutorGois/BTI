We discuss a biophysical model of synaptic plasticity that provides a unified view of the outcomes of synaptic modification protocols, including: (1) prescribed time courses of postsynaptic intracellular Ca(2+) release, (2) postsynaptic voltage clamping with presentation of presynaptic spike trains at various frequencies, (3) direct postsynaptic response to presynaptic spike trains at various frequencies, and (4) LTP/LTD as a response to precisely timed presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes.
