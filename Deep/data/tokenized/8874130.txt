We investigated the effects of acute p.o. pretraining treatment with an indirect acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, metrifonate, on water maze spatial navigation and passive avoidance behavior. Metrifonate (10-100 mg/kg, orally, p.o.) did not improve the water maze or passive avoidance performance of young intact rats. However, in young rats metrifonate over a broad dosage range (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) was able to alleviate the adverse effects of scopolamine (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist; 0.4 and 2.0 mg/kg in water maze and passive avoidance study, respectively) and medial septum-lesioning on spatial reference and working memory and passive avoidance performance. In old (23-month-old) rats, a defect of water maze and passive avoidance behavior was observed. In old rats, metrifonate improved spatial reference memory function in the water maze and also passive avoidance at 10-30 mg/kg, but the 3 mg/kg dose was ineffective. Very old (27-month-old) rats had a more severe impairment of water maze performance than old rats, and metrifonate 3-30 mg/kg did not improve their spatial navigation. These results show that metrifonate may over a wide range of doses stimulate cognitive functioning, but during advanced aging neurobiological defects develop that may mask some of the therapeutic effects of metrifonate in rats.
