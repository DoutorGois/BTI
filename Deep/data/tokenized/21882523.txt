There are growing evidences that pinocembrin has better neuroprotective effect. In the present study, the effect of pinocembrin on mitochondrial respiratory function was evaluated in global brain ischemia/ reperfusion (4-vessel occlusion, 4-VO) rats. The results showed that pinocembrin improved the respiratory activity of 4-VO brain mitochondria, through increasing ADP/O, state 3 respiration state (V3), respiration control rate index (RCI) and oxidative phosphorylation rate (OPR). And then, the effect of pinocembrin on brain mitochondria was verified in vitro. The results showed that pinocembrin increased ADP/O, state 3 respiration state, respiration control rate index, oxidative phosphorylation rate in NADH/FADH2 dependent respiratory chain and decreased state 4 respiration state (V4) in NADH dependent respiratory chain. Pinocembrin improved ATP content in brain mitochondria in vitro and in SH-SY5Y cells.
