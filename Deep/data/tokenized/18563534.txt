Most of the physiological processes that take place in the organism follow a circadian rhythm. Serotonin is one of the most important neurotransmitters in our nervous system, and has been strongly implicated in the regulation on the mammalian circadian clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). The present study analysed the levels of serotonin over a period of 24 h in the plasma and in different brain regions. The model used was of male Wistar rats, 14 +/- 2 weeks of age (n = 120), maintained under conditions of 12 h light and 12 h dark, and food and water ad libitum. The serotonin levels were measured by ELISA every hour at night (20:00-08:00 h) and every 4 h during the daytime (08:00-20:00 h). Ours results show that the maximum levels of serotonin in plasma were obtained at 09:00 and 22:00 and a minor peak at 01:00 h. In hypothalamus there was a significant peak at 22:00 and two minor peaks at 17:00 and 02:00 h; the same occurred in hippocampus with a significant peak at 21:00, and two secondary peaks at 24:00 and 05:00 h; in cerebellum there were two peaks at 21:00 and 02:00 h, while in striatum and pineal there were peaks at 21:00 h and 23:00, respectively. In conclusion, the higher levels of serotonin were during the phase of darkness, which varies depending on the region in which it is measured.
