Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prevalent disease with significant costs. Although progress has been made in understanding the complex pathobiology of focal lesions associated with TBI, questions remain regarding the diffuse responses to injury. Expression of the transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Trpm4) channel, is linked to cytotoxic edema during hemorrhagic contusion expansion. However, little is known about Trpm4 following diffuse TBI. To explore Trpm4 expression in diffuse TBI, rats were subjected to a diffuse central fluid percussion injury (CFPI) and survived for 1.5h-8wks. The total number of Trpm4+ cells, as well as individual cellular intensity/expression of Trpm4, were assessed. Hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) labeling was performed to evaluate cell damage/death potentially associated with Trpm4 expression following diffuse TBI. Finally, ultrastructural assessments were performed to evaluate the integrity of Trpm4+ cells and the potential for swelling associated with Trpm4 expression. Trpm4 was primarily restricted to astrocytes within the hippocampus and peaked at 6hrs post-injury. While the number of Trpm4+ astrocytes returned to sham levels by 8wks post-CFPI, cellular intensity occurred in region-specific waves following injury. Correlative H&E assessments demonstrated little evidence of hippocampal damage, suggesting that Trpm4 expression by astrocytes does not precipitate cell death following diffuse TBI. Additionally, ultrastructural assessments showed Trpm4+ astrocytes exhibited twice the soma size compared to Trpm4- astrocytes, indicating that astrocyte swelling is associated with Trpm4 expression. This study provides a foundation for future investigations into the role of Trpm4 in astrocyte swelling and edema following diffuse TBI.
