Changes in gene expression after kindled seizures were examined using microdissection of discrete brain areas and Northern and slot blot analyses. Experimental animals were kindled with either of two protocols: (1) a paradigm in which 50 Hz/10 s stimulus trains were delivered every 30 min through hippocampal electrodes (12 stimulations every other day for 4 days) and (2) a traditional approach in which 50 Hz/10 s stimulus trains were given to the hippocampus three times daily for 16 days. Rats were sacrificed 24 h or 30 days after the last kindled seizure. We first examined the possibility that kindling may affect transcription of mRNA for neurotransmitter receptors. We found significant decreases (22-58%) in AMPA/kainate activated glutamate receptor mRNAs (GluR1, -2, -3 mRNAs) in hippocampus, amygdala/entorhinal cortex and in frontoparietal cortex 24 h but not 30 days after rapidly kindled seizures. However, changes in GABA receptor alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4 or beta 1 mRNAs were not observed in any brain region 30 days after traditional kindling or 24 h after rapidly kindled seizures. In addition, we tested whether changes in the expression of proenkephalin could be detected after kindling. We found significant increases (1.7-10 fold) in proenkephalin mRNA in the frontoparietal cortex, hippocampus and in the amygdala/entorhinal cortex 24 h but not 30 days after rapidly kindled seizures. Our findings suggest that changes in glutamate receptor and proenkephalin gene expression are robust, acute sequelae to kindled seizures and may be involved in kindling.
