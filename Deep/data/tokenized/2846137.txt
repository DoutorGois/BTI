We report that CA1 pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampus respond to high intensity afferent stimulation by generating a late depolarizing potential that typically occurs between the early (fast) inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) and the late (slow) IPSP. This potential is reminiscent of the response seen after the application of 4-aminopyridine and can be blocked by bicuculline, indicating that GABAA receptors are involved in its generation.
