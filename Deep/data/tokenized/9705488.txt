We tested whether the primate hippocampus was functionally heterogenous along its anterior-posterior axis. Two monkeys were trained on both a spatial and nonspatial memory task and the incidence of spatial and nonspatial delay activity in the anterior, middle, and posterior hippocampus was noted. Spatial delay activity (activity in the delay period after the sample stimulus on the spatial memory task) was more common in the posterior than the anterior hippocampus, whereas nonspatial delay activity (activity in the delay period after the sample stimulus on the nonspatial memory task) was evenly distributed throughout the hippocampus. Furthermore, delay neurons in the anterior hippocampus exhibited scalloping delay activity, whereas those in the middle and posterior hippocampus did not. These findings suggest that the hippocampus is functionally heterogeneous and that the posterior regions may be more important for processing spatial information, whereas the anterior regions may be more important for directing or coding movements to points in space.
