The molecular basis of memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of senile dementia, is under investigation. In the present study, we have focused on the early hippocampal memory-related changes in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, a well-established mouse model of familial AD. It is well known that molecules like cAMP response element binding (CREB) and binding protein (CBP) play a crucial role in memory consolidation. We analyzed CBP on its transcriptional activity and protein levels, finding a significant downregulation of both of them at 3-month-old mice. In addition, the downregulation of this molecule was associated with a decrease on acetylation levels of histone H3 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, the p-CREB levels, which are important for memory acquisition at 3 months in APP/PS1 mice, were downregulated. Furthermore, we suggest that early neuroinflammation, especially due to the Tnfalpha gene increased expression, could also be responsible to this process of memory loss. Given all the previously mentioned results, we propose that an early suitable treatment to prevent the evolution of the disease should include a combination of drugs, including anti-inflammatories, which may decrease glial activation and Tnfalpha levels, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors that increase cAMP levels.
