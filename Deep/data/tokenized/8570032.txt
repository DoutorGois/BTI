A brief application of the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium induces a long-lasting potentiation in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices (TEA LTP). We report here that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) contribute to this kind of synaptic enhancement, since the mGluR antagonist (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine ((+) MCPG) inhibits TEA LTP with a concentration-dependent component.
