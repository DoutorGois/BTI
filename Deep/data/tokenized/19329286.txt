Recent evidence indicates that curcumin (CUR), the principal curcuminoid of turmeric, exhibits antioxidant potential and protects the brain against various oxidative stressors. The aim of the present study was to examine the modulating impacts of CUR against cognitive deficits and oxidative damage in intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) infused rats. Rats were injected bilaterally with ICV-STZ (3 mg/kg), while sham rats received the same volume of vehicle and then supplemented with CUR (80 mg/kg) for three weeks. After two weeks of ICV-STZ infusion, rats were tested for cognitive performance using passive avoidance and water maze tasks and then sacrificed for biochemical and histopathological assays. ICV-STZ rats showed significant cognitive deficits, which were significantly improved by CUR supplementation. CUR supplementation significantly augmented increased 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malonaldehyde (MDA), thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), protein carbonyl (PC) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG); decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and its dependent enzymes (Glutathione peroxidase [GPx] and glutathione reductase [GR]) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex; and increased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the hippocampus of ICV-STZ rats. The study suggests that CUR is effective in preventing cognitive deficits, and might be beneficial for the treatment of sporadic dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT).
