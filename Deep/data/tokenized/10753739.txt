Recent genetic studies have shown that the signalling factor Wnt3a is required for formation of the hippocampus; the developmental consequences of Wnt signalling in the hippocampus are mediated by multiple HMG-box transcription factors, with LEF-1 being required just for formation of the dentate gyrus.
