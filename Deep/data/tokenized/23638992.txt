BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and Abeta-induced neuronal damage is the major pathology of AD. There is increasing evidence that neuroinflammation induced by Abeta is also involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Fasudil is a Rho kinase inhibitor and has been reported to have neuroprotective effects. In this study, the main purpose is to investigate whether fasudil has beneficial effects on cognitive impairment and neuronal toxicity induced by Abeta. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta1-42 to rats resulted in marked cognitive impairment, severe neuronal damage, as well as increased IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production, and NF-kappaB activation. Administration of fasudil significantly ameliorated the spatial learning and memory impairment, attenuated neuronal loss, and neuronal injury induced by Abeta1-42 . In addition, fasudil inhibited IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production and NF-kappaB activation in the rat brain. CONCLUSIONS: Fasudil can protect against Abeta-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration by suppressing inflammatory response, suggesting that fasudil might be a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of inflammation-related diseases, such as AD.
