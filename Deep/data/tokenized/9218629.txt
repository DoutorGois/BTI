The neurotoxicant trimethyltin (TMT) increases mRNA levels for cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1alpha, and interleukin-6. Cytokines induce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). MMPs and uPA disrupt extracellular matrix. Since matrix damage may play a role in the neuropathological changes seen with TMT toxicity, we determined the effect of TMT on proteolytic enzyme production. Adult rats were injected with 8.0 mg TMT/kg. At different times after TMT injection, tissue samples from frontal lobe and hippocampus were assayed for MMPs and uPA, using gelatin-substrate and casein/plasminogen-substrate zymography. Gelatinase B (92 kDa type IV collagenase) production increased significantly in frontal lobe tissue at 24, 48 and 96 h, and in hippocampus at 48 h compared to saline-injected controls. Gelatinase A (72 kDa type IV collagenase) was significantly decreased at 12 and 24 h in frontal lobe compared to controls. Urokinase-type PA was significantly increased in hippocampus at 12 and 96 h, and in frontal lobe at 96 h compared to controls. Gelatinase B and uPA are up-regulated by TMT in frontal lobe and hippocampus, suggesting that they may contribute to the neuropathology of TMT.
