The effects of 10-chloro-11b-(2'-fluorophenyl)-2,3,5,6,7,11b-hexahydro-7-(2''-hydroxyethyl)benzo [6,7]-1,4-diazepino [5,4-b]oxazol-6-one (MS4101), a new benzodiazepine compound, on evoked potential in cats were examined and compared with diazepam. Though evoked potential in somatic cortex I, motor cortex I and posterior groups induced by tibial nerve stimulation were unaffected by a small dose of MS4101 (1 mg/kg) which did not influence on limbic system, the amplitude of evoked potential in midbrain reticular formation was reduced. The amplitude of evoked potential in amygdala and hippocampus induced by cutaneous nerve stimulation was reduced by MS4101 and diazepam. These two drugs had the same effect on amygdala and difference in the degree of action between these drugs was not observed. Sham rage response following head shake, circling and whine behaviour was observed by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus. The threshold of sham rage response by raised by MS4101 and diazepam.
