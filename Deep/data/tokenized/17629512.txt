The iron-induced model of post-traumatic chronic focal epilepsy in rats was studied by depth-electrode mapping to investigate the spread of epileptiform activity into subcortical brain structures after its onset in the cortical epileptic focus. Electrical seizure activity was recorded in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas, amygdala and caudate-putamen, in rats with iron-induced chronic cortical focal epilepsy. These experiments showed that the epileptiform activity with its onset in the cortical focus synchronously propagated into the studied subcortical brain areas. Seizure behaviours seemed to increase in correspondence with the spread of the epileptic electrographic activity in subcortical areas. Comparison of the cortical focus electroencephalographic and associated multiple-unit action potential recordings with those from the subcortical structures showed that the occurrence and evolution of the epileptiform activity in the subcortical structures were in parallel with that in the cortical focus. The intracerebral anatomic progression and delineation of seizure spread (mapped by field potential (EEG) and multiple-unit action potentials (MUA) recordings) indicated participation of these regions in the generalization of seizure activity in this model of epilepsy. The seizure-induced activation of the hippocampus appeared to evolve into an epileptic focus independent of the cortical focus. The present study demonstrates the propagation of epileptic activity from the cortical focus into the limbic and basal ganglia regions. Treatment of iron-induced epileptic rats with ethosuximide, an anti-absence drug, resulted in suppression of the epileptiform activity in the cortical focus as well as in the subcortical brain areas.
