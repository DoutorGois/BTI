Monoaminergic systems are important modulators of the responses to stress. Stress may influence feeding behavior, and the involvement of monoamines in the control of food intake is well recognized. We investigated the effects induced by chronic-restraint stress, 1 h a day, for 40 days, on eating behavior and on monoamines in distinct brain structures. Increased consumption of sweet pellets, and not of peanuts, was observed. Dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and their metabolites were measured by HPLC-EC. After chronic restraint, the results observed were decreased 5-HT in hippocampus, with increased 5-HIAA/5-HT; decreased 5-HIAA levels in cortex; reduction in DA in hippocampus, and increased levels in amygdala and hypothalamus; HVA increased in cortex, as well as HVA/DA ratio, while DOPAC/DA decreased. HVA decreased in hypothalamus, as well as HVA/DA, and DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA decreased in the amygdala. These results suggest that restraint stress differentially affects the activity of central dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, and this may be related to the effects observed in eating behavior.
