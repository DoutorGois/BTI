Several laboratories have documented an increase in hippocampal nerve growth factor (NGF) levels, measured with biological or immunological assays, within 1-2 weeks following septal lesions or fimbria/fornix transections. In the present study we have determined the increase in NGF-like biological activity in medium conditioned by hippocampal slices at more prolonged times following medial septal lesion. In contrast to reports based on immunological assays, which demonstrate a transient increase in hippocampal NGF, elevated NGF-like biological activity was present in hippocampal slice-conditioned medium up to one year after a medial septal lesion.
