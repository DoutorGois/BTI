It is commonly accepted that glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals form perfectly matched appositions opposite their appropriate receptors and associated binding proteins. However, recent reports indicate that certain synaptic proteins that are commonly used to identify excitatory or inhibitory synapses can be mismatched, particularly during development. In order to construct a more comprehensive scheme of synapse composition during development, we co-immunolabeled for several principle excitatory and inhibitory proteins over the course of synaptogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. We find that although the majority of synaptic appositions are composed of matched clusters of pre- and postsynaptic proteins appropriate for a particular neurotransmitter, many are initially mismatched, even in dendrites receiving both glutamatergic and GABAergic innervation. Over time, the fidelity of GABAergic synapse composition increases such that, despite the persistence of some mismatched components at glutamatergic sites, the incidence of mismatch diminishes at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Activation of either GABA-A or NMDA receptors promotes fidelity at GABAergic sites, but NMDA receptor activation promotes mismatching among glutamatergic synapses. Thus, apposition of pre- and postsynaptic elements can occur independent of neurotransmitter specificity and synaptic activity modifies these associations. Our findings support the idea that synapse maturation occurs in several distinct stages, and that these stages are regulated by a combination of activity-dependent and -independent factors.
