Regulatory RNAs play a key role in the regulation of protein expression patterns in neurological diseases. Here we studied the regulation of miRNAs in a chronic rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The analysis was focused on a putative link with pharmacoresponsiveness as well as the functional implications of the regulation of a selected miRNA. The findings did not reveal a difference in hippocampal miRNA expression between phenobarbital responders and nonresponders. However, when comparing rats following status epilepticus with control rats we identified 13 differentially expressed miRNAs with miRNA-187-3p being most strongly regulated. mRNAs encoding KCNK10/TREK-2 as well as DYRK2 were confirmed as targets of miRNA-187-3p. Expression of the potassium channel protein KCNK10/TREK-2 negatively correlated with hippocampal miRNA-187-3p expression and proved to be upregulated in the chronic phase of the epilepsy model. In conclusion, our data do not suggest a relevant impact of miRNA expression patterns on pharmacoresponsiveness. However, we confirmed regulation of miRNA-187-3p and demonstrated that it impacts the expression of the two-pore domain potassium channel protein KCNK10/TREK-2. Considering evidence from brain ischemia models, KCNK10/TREK-2 upregulation might serve a protective function with a beneficial impact on astrocytic potassium and glutamate homeostasis.
