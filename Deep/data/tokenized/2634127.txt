The amount of autofluorescent granules of nerve cells of the hippocampus and cerebellum in 92 female autopsy cases aged 56-101 was micrometrically compared with regard to their age and grade of dementia. Highly significant differences were found in the amount of pigment between the nerve cells of the granular and pyramidal layers of the hippocampus and between Purkinje cells and dental nuclear cells of cerebellum. No significant difference, however, was observed according to age or to grade of dementia.
