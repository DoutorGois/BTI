30-Day-old male Wistar rats were tested for acquisition and retention of operant conditioned behavior after bilateral subicular lesions made either electrolytically or chemically (ibotenic acid). The acquisition of operant learning was carried out in lesioned rats by assessing the number of sessions required to learn the operant task, whereas the retention test was performed after lesions by assessing performance on a previously learnt operant task. The acquisition of pedal press operant learning was significantly delayed in both types of lesioned rats, without any impairment in the retention of the previously learned task after lesioning. In these animals the cell densities were quantified in cresyl violet-stained sections in different subfields of hippocampus. Following the lesion of subiculum, selective degeneration of CA1 cells without the involvement of other hippocampal subfields was observed. This might be due to the loss of target area (subiculum) through which hippocampus is connected with neocortical and subcortical structures. This, in turn, might have resulted in behavioral deficits. The data suggest that the subiculum might be involved in the acquisition of new information rather than in retention.
