OBJECTIVE: To detect and quantify structural parameters in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of potential use in Alzheimer's disease (AD). STUDY DESIGN: We estimated by stereologic tools the total volume of the EC and subfields EI and ER, the number of neurons and the volume-weighted mean soma volume of layer II neurons. EC morphometric parameters were also assessed in both control and AD cases. RESULTS: In AD, EC volume decreased by 35%, while total number of neurons reached 51%. Also, neuron density had a significant decrease mainly due to change in the EI subfield (31% decrease). The EC showed a decrease in size and a morphology more elliptic and irregular. Moreover, layer II neurons soma size (volume, area, and 1-dimensional parameters) were more rounded. Thus the EC decreases in size and neuron number in AD and minor changes in number per volume were noted. CONCLUSION: These quantitative data can be of value in volumetric MRI studies in AD patients.
