Quantitative cytochemical methods revealed the decrease of MAO activity (substrate--tryptamine) in the hippocampus of L-dioxytryptamine treated August rats genetically predisposed to emotional stress under the effect of delta sleep inducing peptide (DSIP). Activities of aminopeptidase and glutamate dehydrogenase were decreased in n.accumbens while changes of the activities of these enzymes were not significant in the layers III and V of sensomotor cortex and n.caudatus. In all brain structures Ache and MAO (substrate 5-hydroxytryptamine) activities were not influenced by DSIP.
