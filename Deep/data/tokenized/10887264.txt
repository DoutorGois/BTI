In five patients with mesial temporal sclerosis, the authors verified the precision and reproducibility of hippocampal segmentations with deformation-based magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The overall percentage overlap between automated segmentations was 92.8% (SD, 3.5%), between manual segmentations was 73.1% (SD, 9.5%), and between automated and manual segmentations was 74.8% (SD, 10.3%). Deformation-based hippocampal segmentations provided a precise method of hippocampal volume measurement in this patient population.
