The distribution of the messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for neprilysin (EC 3.4.24.11) has been studied by in situ hybridization in the adult rat brain. A markedly heterogenous distribution among various brain regions was found. A strong signal was observed in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, the olfactory tubercle, the caudate putamen, the habenular, anterior pretectal, interpeduncular, red, dorso tegmental, pontine, and vestibular nuclei, the mammillary bodies, the Purkinje cells, and the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle. A large number of areas such as the cortex, the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus, the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory tract, the accumbens and the arcuate nuclei, the superior and inferior colliculi, and a few regions in the thalamus at the mesencephalic level exhibited a moderate or low signal of hybridization. The majority of these regions are also known to contain the neprilysin protein. On the other hand, the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, and the central gray matter, which show a high or a moderate amount of neprilysin, did not contain any neprilysin mRNA. Comparison of the regional distribution of neprilysin mRNA with that of its translation product provides insight into neprilysin neuronal pathways in the central nervous system.
