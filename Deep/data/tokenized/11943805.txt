Tumor necrosis factor receptor-I (TNFRI) and TNFRII are two TNFR subtypes in the immune system, but their roles in the brain remain unclear. Here we present a novel interaction between TNFR subtypes and TNF-alpha in the brain. Our studies on target-depleted TNFR in mice show that TNF-alpha has little effect on hippocampal neurons in which TNFRI, containing an "intracellular death domain," is absent (TNFRI -/-), whereas neurons from TNFRII knock-out mice are vulnerable to TNF-alpha even at low doses. Moreover, little nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) translocation is induced by TNF-alpha in neurons of TNFRI -/-, whereas NF-kappaB subunit p65 is still translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in neurons from wild-type and TNFRII -/- mice. Furthermore, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity is upregulated in neurons from both wild-type and TNFRI -/-, but no alteration of p38 MAP kinase was found in neurons from TNFRII. Results from overexpression of TNF receptors further support the above findings. NT2 neuronal-like cells transiently transfected with TNFRI are very sensitive to TNF-alpha, whereas TNF-alpha is not toxic and even seems to be trophic to the cells with TNFRII overexpression. Last, our radioligand-binding experiments demonstrate that TNF-alpha binds TNFRI with high affinity (K(d) of 0.6 nm), whereas TNFRII shows lower binding affinity (K(d) of 1.14 nm) to TNF-alpha in NT2 transfected cells. Together, these studies reveal novel neuronal responses of TNF-alpha in mediating consequences of TNF receptor activation differently. Subsequent neuronal death or survival may ultimately depend on a particular subtype of TNF receptor that is predominately expressed in neurons of the brain during neural development or with neurological diseases.
