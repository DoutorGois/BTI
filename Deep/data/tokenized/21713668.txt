Kainate receptors are widely distributed in the CNS, but also in the PNS. Dorsal root ganglia are enriched in this subtype of glutamate ionotropic receptors. In addition to their activity as ligand-gated ion channels, kainate receptors exhibit other properties already characterized in other systems, such as hippocampus, i.e., their ability to induce a metabotropic cascade signalling, through G-protein and PKC activation. With a very similar actuation mechanism as formerly described in the CNS, kainate receptors in the DRG also present other differentiated features, such as the Ca(2+) channel blockade and a self-regulation property. The peculiarity of these neurons has served to progress the study of kainate receptors. Nevertheless, many other physiological functions of these receptors remain unclear, as does the related molecular nature of the metabotropic cascade and the involvement of this signalling pathway with sensory transmission of pain.
