A comparative study of the protein composition of the brain structures of rats (premotor area of the cortex, the CA3 region of the hyppocampus, the caudate nucleus, the frontal area of the cerebellum) was carried out by the method of disc electrophoresis in the micro- and macroscale. Protein zones were identified by their relative electrophoretic mobility calculated according to the mobility of the "marker" protein (trypsin inhibitor from soya beans). Both methods revealed no significant differences in the composition of the electrophoretic separation of the brain proteins pointed to the greater resolving capacity of the micromethod.
