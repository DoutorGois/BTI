The role of estrogens in Alzheimer's disease (AD) involving beta-amyloid (Abeta) generation and plaque formation was mostly tested in ovariectomized mice with or without APP mutations. The aim of the present study was to explore the abnormalities of neural cells in a novel mouse model of AD with chronic estrogen deficiency. These chimeric mice exhibit a total FSH-R knockout (FORKO) and carry two transgenes, one expressing the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APPsw, Swedish mutation) and the other expressing presenilin-1 lacking exon 9 (PS1Delta9). The most prominent changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of these hypoestrogenic mice were marked hypertrophy of both cortical neurons and astrocytes and an increased number of activated microglia. There were no significant differences in the number of Abeta plaques although they appeared less compacted and larger than those in APPsw/PS1Delta9 control mice. Similar glia abnormalities were obtained in wild-type primary cortical neural cultures treated with letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor. The concordance of results from APPsw/PS1Delta9 mice with or without FSH-R deletion and those with letrozole treatment in vitro (with and without Abeta treatment) of primary cortical/hippocampal cultures suggests the usefulness of these models to explore molecular mechanisms involved in microglia and astrocyte activation in hypoestrogenic states in the central nervous system.
