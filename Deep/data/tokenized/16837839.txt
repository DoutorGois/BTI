Voluntary exercise such as running induces a dramatic increase in adult stem cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase helps regulate cell proliferation. The role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in exercise-induced cell proliferation in the brain, however, has not been examined. In the present study, exercise for 1 week increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase immunoreactivity in the microvessels of the dentate gyrus. In addition, blocking endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity (via a daily injection of 20 mg/kg L-nitroimidazole ornithine) during exercise reduced the number of cells within the dentate gyrus that were immunoreactive for Ki-67 protein and doublecortin. This study provides the first evidence that endothelial nitric oxide synthase upregulation may modulate exercise-induced granule cell proliferation within the dentate gyrus.
