OBJECTIVE: Behavioral studies of spatial navigation in aging indicate that orientation using an allocentric reference frame (object-centered orientation) is impaired, whereas orientation using egocentric processes (self-centered orientation) is not. It has been proposed that navigational deficits may result from more general alterations of perception and attention or executive functions. The purpose of this study is to assess allocentric and egocentric representation in elderly individuals, and to determine if age-related deficits in spatial navigation are related to an attentional decline. METHOD: We assessed encoding of the position of geometrical shapes, depending specifically on an allocentric or egocentric reference frame, during ERP recording in young and old subjects. RESULTS: Aging was associated with a performance decline in allocentric, but not egocentric, encoding. Both allocentric and egocentric conditions elicited parietal early components P1 and N1, reflecting top-down modulation, and components P2 and N2, reflecting selective attention and stimulus categorization. We observed age-associated effects on N1 and N2 amplitudes and on N2 latency in both spatial conditions. Moreover, impaired allocentric performance in older subjects was associated with a greater P2 amplitude and delayed P2 latency compared with younger subjects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that elderly individuals present with deficits when spatial orientation relies on allocentric representation, and are associated with age-related deficits in spatial attention.
