3H-leucine was injected intraperitoneally to hibernating and awakening sousliks and to those being conscious for one or two weeks. Water-soluble brain protein extracts were separated by disc electrophoresis to determine relative radioactivity of the most acidic fraction which, under similar conditions, corresponds to the nerve-specific protein S-100. It was shown that in the brain cortex and reticular formation, the incorporation of the acidic protein drastically increases on awakening and reaches the maximum value on the 7th day. The high level of 3H-leucine incorporation into the hippocampus of the hibernating animals does not substantially change during the egress from hibernation. This may be related to the fact that during hibernation the hippocampus retains electrical activity.
