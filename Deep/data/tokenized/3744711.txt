This research was an attempt to determine the cerebral areas involved in focal epileptic seizures accompanied by psychic manifestations. Six types of partial seizures involving psychic symptomatology and phonatory seizures were included in the study. Sixty-one clinical records of focal epilepsy, which had been revealed by means of a CT-scan examination, were analyzed and a subsample of 25 patients with psychic symptoms was selected. The scans taken of the lesions were transferred to a six-level standard template built for this purpose. Subsequently, templates of patients with the same type of seizures were superimposed. The critical zones for the seven types of seizures studied are presented. A clear correlation was found between these results and our present knowledge of functional brain organization.
