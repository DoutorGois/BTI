The interactions between migrating interneurons and their environment that lead to stereotypic migration pathways remain largely undefined. We have used time-lapse imaging to record the migratory responses of labeled interneurons to different regions of the migratory pathway in organotypic slice cultures. We tested the hypothesis that the length of the migratory pathway is not equally permissive for interneuron migration, with separate zones of inhibition and attraction. Three different experimental approaches were used to address this issue, including explant cocultures, cortical overlay cultures, and rotation of cortical slices. The results clearly identify the lateral region to be an attractive substrate for interneuron entry at embryonic day 12.5, whereas the medial region at this stage contains a zone of inhibition. This property of the medial neocortex is temporally regulated with switching from inhibition to attraction within 24 h. We suggest that this temporal regulation may provide a mechanism for gating the entry of interneurons into the hippocampus while ensuring that cortical interneurons are properly confined within the neocortical wall. In this manner, interneurons arising from common precursors and sharing common migratory pathways are able to populate different pallial structures.
