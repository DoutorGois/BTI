Previously, the synthesis of a hippocampal 35,000 M(r) protein increased in response to glucocorticoid treatment and a variety of stressors. We now show by immunoprecipitation that this cytosolic protein is glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (E.C.1.1.1.8; GPDH). In addition, four polypeptides encoded by glucocorticoid-induced mRNAs co-migrated with hippocampal protein synthetic products on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, including 35,000 M(r) protein of approximately pl 6.3, that had previously been identified as GPDH by hybrid-selection with a GPDH cDNA clone. The 35,000 M(r) in vitro translation product was also immunoprecipitated with the GPDH antibody. Using radiolabeled hippocampal slices and two-dimensional gel analysis, a 35,000 M(r) polypeptide of approximately pl 6.4 increased five-fold after 30 min of intermittent tail-shock. This protein was found predominantly in the 20,000 x g pellet and did not immunoprecipitate with the GPDH antibody. However, a 35,000 M(r) polypeptide was also found in the cytosol as a minor component after stress, which did immunoprecipitate with the GPDH antibody. Therefore, there are at least two shock-induced 35,000 M(r) proteins, one of which is GPDH. These results establish that increases in GPDH mRNA prevalence and protein synthesis occur in response to both glucocorticoids and stress in the adult rat hippocampus. Based on the increased enzyme activity seen in the nervous system in response to glucocorticoids, dietary restriction, and nerve injury, the induction of GPDH may have functional consequences in cellular adaptation to stress.
