We have examined using immortalized clonal mouse hippocampal cell line (HT-22) whether the environmental estrogenic compound bisphenol A (BPA), like estrogen, has any neuroprotective effect against glutamate and amyloid beta protein-induced neurotoxicity. BPA protects HT-cells against both 5 mM glutamate and 2 microM amyloid beta protein-induced cell death in a dose dependent manner. Optimum protection was attained at 1 microM and 500 nM BPA against 5 mM glutamate and 2 microM amyloid beta protein-induced HT-22 cell death, respectively. Using confocal immunoflourescence microscopy technique, we observed that 20 h of treatment with 5 mM glutamate resulted in intense nuclear localization of the glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in HT-22 cells as compared to control untreated cells. Interestingly, 1 microM BPA treatment for 24 h, followed by 20-h treatment with 5 mM glutamate, resulted in dramatic reduction in GR nuclear localization. We conclude that: (i) BPA mimics estrogen and exerts neuroprotective effects against both neurotoxins used; (ii) BPA inhibits enhanced nuclear localization of GR induced by glutamate; and (iii) HT-22 cells provide a good in vitro model system for screening the potencies of various environmental compounds for their estrogenic activity.
