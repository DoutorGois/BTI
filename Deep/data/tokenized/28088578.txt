The study of spaceflight effects on the brain is technically complex concern; complicated by the problem of applying an adequate ground model. The most-widely used experimental model to study the effect of microgravity is the tail-suspension hindlimb unloading model; however, its compliance with the effect of actual spaceflight on the brain is still unclear. We evaluated the effect of one month hindlimb unloading on the expression of genes related to the brain neuroplasticity-brain neutotrophic factors (Gdnf, Cdnf), apoptotic factors (Bcl-xl, Bax), serotonin- and dopaminergic systems (5-HT2A, Maoa, Maob, Th, D1r, Comt), and compared the results with the data obtained on mice that spent one month in spaceflight on Russian biosatellite Bion-M1. No effect of hindlimb unloading was observed on the expression of most genes, which were considered as risk neurogenes for long-term actual spaceflight. The opposite effect of hindlimb unloading and spaceflight was found on the level of mRNA of D1 dopamine receptor and catechol-O-methyltransferase in the striatum. At the same time, the expression of Maob in the midbrain decreased, and the expression of Bcl-xl genes increased in the hippocampus, which corresponds to the effect of spaceflight. However, the hindlimb unloading model failed to reproduce the majority of effects of long-term spaceflight on serotonin-, dopaminergic systems and some apoptotic factors.
