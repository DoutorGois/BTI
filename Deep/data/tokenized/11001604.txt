MRI was performed in 7 patients with general paresis before or at a very early stage of treatment. A large dose of antibiotics, mainly penicillin, was given to all patients, and the effects of treatment, the patients' outcome, and MRI findings were investigated. Three of the 7 patients had MRI findings of atrophy of the medial temporal lobe including the hippocampus. In the medial temporal lobe atrophy group, a personality change or general dementia remained even after the treatment was completed, and outcome in social functioning was poor. Medial temporal lobe atrophy may be a poor prognostic sign in general paresis.
