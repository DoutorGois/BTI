The content of fatty acids in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was studied in an experiment on Wistar rats of the three age groups (5-weeks, puberal and old- 20-22 weeks) with an induced hypothyroidism (simulation was achieved by a 2 week prior supplement of L-thyroxin and final monitoring of thyroxin levels in serum). It was determined that the major variations of free fatty acids were noticed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus among puberal rats, and somewhat lower shifts in premature (5 weeks) and old animals. The increase of free fatty acids in premature rats was registered in spectrum C17-C22. The increase of linoleic and linolenic acids were registered five times higher in hippocampus. In old rats hyperthyroidism was characterized by more apparent shifts in fatty-acidic content of lipids of neocortex and less apparent in hippocampus.
