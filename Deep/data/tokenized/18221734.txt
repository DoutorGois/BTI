The deposition of highly phosphorylated microtubule-associated tau protein has been observed in ALS with cognitive impairment (ALSci). In these studies, we have examined whether the expression of two candidate protein kinases for mediating tau hyperphosphorylation (GSK3beta or CDK5) are also altered. The expression of GSK, CDK and p25/p35 was assayed in human frontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, cervical (dorsal and ventral) and lumbar (dorsal and ventral) tissue from neurologically intact control (5), ALS (5) or ALSci (5) patients using RT-PCR, Western blot or immunohistochemistry. To assess GSK-3beta activity, we examined GSK3beta, phospho-GSK3beta and phospho-beta-catenin expression. Expression levels relative to that of beta-actin were compared by ANOVA. The expression of GSK, GSK3beta and phospho-GSK3beta was increased in both ALS and ALSci compared to that of the control. This was accompanied by an increased expression of phospho-beta-catenin. No significant difference between control, ALS or ALSci was observed with respect to the expression of CDK5 or p25/p35. Both GSK3beta and phospho-GSK3beta immunoreactive neurons were mainly located in layer II and layer III in the frontal cortex and in layer II in the hippocampus. This was consistent with the previously described distribution of hyperphosphorylated tau bearing neurons in ALS and ALSci. These data suggest that GSK3beta expression is upregulated in ALS and ALSci and that GSK3beta activation is associated with the intraneuronal deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This supports the potential role for GSK3beta as a therapeutic target in ALS.
