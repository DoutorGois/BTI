The present study was undertaken to examine spatial and temporal patterns of oxidative stress rate in the brain of Mongolian gerbils submitted to different duration of global ischemia/reperfusion. The common carotid arteries of gerbils were occluded for 5, 10, or 15 min. We followed the temporal ischemia-induced oxidative stress rate, the most important factor that exacerbates brain damage by reperfusion, starting from 24 h up to 28 days after reperfusion. The spatial ischemia-induced oxidative stress distribution was measured parallely in different brain regions: forebrain cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum. Post-ischemic effects were followed in vivo by monitoring the neurological status of whole animals and at the intracellular level by standard biochemical assays in different brain regions. We measured superoxide production, superoxide dismutase activity, nitric oxide production, index of lipid peroxidation, and reduced glutathione. Our results revealed a pattern of dynamic changes in each oxidative stress parameter that corresponded with ischemia duration in all tested brain structures. The highest levels were obtained in the first 24h after the insult. After that, they slowly returned to nearly control values 28 days after reperfusion (with the exception of SOD activity that returned to control values at fourth day after reperfusion). The most sensitive oxidative stress parameter was index of lipid peroxidation. Our study confirmed spatial distribution of ischemia-induced oxidative stress. Tested brain structures showed different sensitivity to each oxidative stress parameter, although their basal levels were similar. These new findings could be valuable for creation and strategy of post-ischemic therapy.
