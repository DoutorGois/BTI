Analysis of the displacement of 3H-diazepam binding to membranes prepared from the ovine frontal cortex by the triazolopyradiazine CL218,872 yielded a Hill coefficient significantly below unity. By analogy with similar studies of this drug in rat brain this suggested the existence of Types 1 and 2 benzodiazepine receptors. The degree of displacement of 3H-diazepam by CL218,872 (200 nM, Type 1; 800 nM, Type 2) in homogenates of brain regions differed, the rank order being cerebellum greater than parietal cortex greater than frontal cortex congruent to temporal cortex congruent to hippocampus greater than striatum. Displacement of 3H-diazepam by CL218,872 was enhanced by 10(-5) M GABA in the striatum (at 200 nM and 800 nM CL218,872) and cerebellum (at 200 nM CL218,872). Benzodiazepine receptors in the ovine frontal cortex were least sensitive to CL218,872 (200 nM) in young fetuses (54-68 days gestation) and achieved adult levels of sensitivity by late gestation. Finally, the potency of CL218,872 to displace 3H-diazepam was not effected by the 3H-ligand concentration (0.5 nM or 5.0 nM), suggesting that Types 1 and 2 benzodiazepine receptors are not identical to the high and low affinity 3H-diazepam binding sites we have previously identified in the ovine brain.
