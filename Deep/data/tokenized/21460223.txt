Neurotrophins, activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, control neuronal survival and plasticity. Alterations in NGF, BDNF, IGF-1, or insulin signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. We have previously characterized a bigenic PS1xAPP transgenic mouse displaying early hippocampal Abeta deposition (3 to 4 months) but late (17 to 18 months) neurodegeneration of pyramidal cells, paralleled to the accumulation of soluble Abeta oligomers. We hypothesized that PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway could be involved in this apparent age-dependent neuroprotective/neurodegenerative status. In fact, our data demonstrated that, as compared with age-matched nontransgenic controls, the Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3beta was increased in the 6-month PS1xAPP hippocampus, whereas in aged PS1xAPP animals (18 months), GSK-3beta phosphorylation levels displayed a marked decrease. Using N2a and primary neuronal cell cultures, we demonstrated that soluble amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPalpha), the predominant APP-derived fragment in young PS1xAPP mice, acting through IGF-1 and/or insulin receptors, activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, phosphorylated the GSK-3beta activity, and in consequence, exerted a neuroprotective action. On the contrary, several oligomeric Abeta forms, present in the soluble fractions of aged PS1xAPP mice, inhibited the induced phosphorylation of Akt/GSK-3beta and decreased the neuronal survival. Furthermore, synthetic Abeta oligomers blocked the effect mediated by different neurotrophins (NGF, BDNF, insulin, and IGF-1) and sAPPalpha, displaying high selectivity for NGF. In conclusion, the age-dependent appearance of APP-derived soluble factors modulated the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta signaling pathway through the major neurotrophin receptors. sAPPalpha stimulated and Abeta oligomers blocked the prosurvival signaling. Our data might provide insights into the selective vulnerability of specific neuronal groups in Alzheimer disease.
