We found the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv12.2 to be a potent regulator of excitability in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Genetic deletion and pharmacologic block of Kv12.2 substantially reduced the firing threshold of these neurons. Kv12.2-/- (also known as Kcnh3-/-) mice showed signs of persistent neuronal hyperexcitability including frequent interictal spiking, spontaneous seizures and increased sensitivity to the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol.
