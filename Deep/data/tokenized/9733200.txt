Gerbils aged 3 months and 24+ months were subjected to 5 min of global forebrain ischemia and tested in a radial arm maze (1 trial/day, 50 days). Compared with age-matched, sham-operated controls, ischemic animals were impaired on measures of both working and reference memory. Aged animals were impaired on working memory, but not on reference memory, compared with their younger counterparts. Hippocampal CA1 and CA2 regions were significantly and comparably damaged in the 2 ischemic groups but were unaffected by aging. The results suggest that aging and ischemia have functionally similar effects on working memory, but the 2 processes differentially impact reference memory.
