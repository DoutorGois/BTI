BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is often encountered in diabetes, leading to several clinical complications. Our recent results showing an elevated tetrahydrocortisol/tetrahydrocorticosterone ratio in morning urine of diabetic children compared to that of controls suggest an increased nocturnal activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) in the former. QUESTION: We hypothesized that these observations could be explained by a reduced inhibition of hepatic 11beta-HSD1 activity by exogenous insulin owing to its subcutaneous (SC) administration and absence of first hepatic passage. Additionally, we hypothesized that hippocampal 11beta-HSD1 activity might also be impaired by diabetes. METHODS: We therefore measured HPA axis activity and 11beta-HSD1 expression and activity in liver and hippocampus in streptozotocin-induced diabetic juvenile rats treated with SC or intraperitoneal (IP) insulin. RESULTS: Plasma corticosterone levels were elevated in untreated diabetic rats during the resting phase and restored by both types of insulin treatment. The mRNA expression and activity of 11beta-HSD1 were increased in the untreated diabetic group in liver. Although diabetes was controlled equally whatever the route of insulin administration, liver 11beta-HSD1 gene expression and activity was decreased only in the IP group, suggesting that a first hepatic pass is needed for 11beta-HSD1 hepatic inhibition. In hippocampus, 11beta-HSD1 activity was elevated in the untreated diabetic group but restored by both types of insulin treatment. Thus, these data extend our findings in diabetic children by showing impairment of hippocampal 11beta-HSD1 in diabetes and by demonstrating that IP is preferable to SC insulin administration to restore 11beta-HSD1 activity in liver.
