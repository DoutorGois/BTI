Slices of rat hippocampus maintained in a medium containing Mn2+ and lowered Ca2+ concentration, which demonstrably blocked chemical synapses, generated spontaneous bursts of population spikes in all cell body layers after 30-60 min of incubation. Therefore, electrical interactions alone can synchronize neuronal activity in the hippocampus, and they are probably important during epileptiform events.
