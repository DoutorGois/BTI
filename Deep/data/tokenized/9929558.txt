We have analysed whether the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons involves a change in the kinetics of (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (AMPA-EPSCs) or their susceptibility to the AMPA receptor modulator cyclothiazide. AMPA-EPSCs in the CA1 region were evoked by alternate stimulation of two independent Schaffer collateral-commissural inputs of slices of adult rat hippocampus. In the current-clamp mode a strong tetanus (100 Hz, 1 s) applied to one input (input I) induced stable LTP of AMPA-EPSCs in this input, while the control input (input II) remained unaffected. For neither input were EPSC rise time and decay kinetics significantly changed. The application of cyclothiazide prolonged the rise time and the decay time constants of the AMPA-EPSCs in both control and potentiated inputs to the same extent (Input I-rise time: 198+/-8%, decay: 148+/-12%; input II-rise time: 212+/-14%, decay: 144+/-19%; n=8). Furthermore, when present during tetanization cyclothiazide did not occlude LTP, suggesting that cyclothiazide and tetanic stimulation enhance AMPA-EPSCs via independent mechanisms. Our findings argue against changes in (de-)activation or desensitization of AMPA receptors as the molecular basis for the expression of LTP.
