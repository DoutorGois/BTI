Rats with different degrees of microencephaly were obtained by injecting pregnant mothers with methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) at gestational days 13.5 or 16.5. Specific markers for cholinergic (choline acetyltransferase, ChAT), GABAergic (glutamate decarboxylase, GAD), and glutamatergic (D-3H aspartate high affinity uptake) neurons, were measured in several brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, anterior and posterior striatum, medial septum plus nucleus of the diagonal band, globus pallidus) in young and adult microencephalic rats. In adult rats born to mothers injected with MAM at gestational day 16.5 (G16.5) ChAT level was increased in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum but decreased in the septal complex; GAD was decreased in the globus pallidus and, to a little extent, in the hippocampus while D-3H aspartate uptake was decreased in the striatum. One month old rats belonging to the same group showed comparable differences with the exception of larger increase of ChAT in the cortex and striatum. In adult rats born from mothers injected with MAM at gestational day 13.5 (G13.5) differences in the cholinergic marker were in general less pronounced; GAD was not decreased in the globus pallidus and D-3H aspartate uptake was unchanged in the striatum but significantly decreased in the hippocampus. The results are correlated with morphological brain alterations caused by differentially timed MAM treatment and with available information on the generation time of various neuronal populations. They show that the balance between different neurotransmitter systems can be experimentally altered and suggest that MAM treatment may provide an experimental tool for studying the development of this balance.
