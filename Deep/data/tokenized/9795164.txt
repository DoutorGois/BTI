The present study investigated the regional distribution of putative 'food-intake'-related neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor gene using cRNA in situ hybridization in various regions of the normal control post-mortem human brain. Interestingly, significant levels of Y5 receptor expression were detected in the hypothalamus; the arcuate nucleus being particularly enriched compared to other hypothalamic nuclei. Surprisingly, strong hybridization signals were also noted in the stratum granulosum of the dentate gyrus contrasting with lower levels of Y5 receptor transcripts in other regions of the hippocampal formation. The cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus were not enriched with Y5 receptor mRNA. It thus appears that the expression of the Y5 receptor gene in the human brain is rather restricted with enrichment in areas consistent with the involvement of this receptor type in the modulation of appetite and seizures.
