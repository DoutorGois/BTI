BACKGROUND: It remains unknown which brain regions are involved in the maintenance of gait dynamic stability in older adults, as characterized by a low stride time variability. Expansion of lateral cerebral ventricles is an indirect marker of adjacent brain tissue volume. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between stride time variability and the volume of sub-regions of the lateral cerebral ventricles among older community-dwellers. METHODS: One-hundred-fifteen participants free of hydrocephalus from the GAIT study (mean, 70.4+/-4.4years; 43.5% female) were included in this analysis. Stride time variability was measured at self-selected pace with a 10m electronic portable walkway (GAITRite). Participants were separated into 3 groups based on tertiles of stride time variability (i.e., <2.0%; 2.0-2.8%; >2.8%). Brain ventricle sub-volumes were quantified from three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI using semi-automated software. Age, gender, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics, Mini-Mental State Examination, Go-NoGo, brain vascular burden, 4-item Geriatric Depression Scale, psychoactive drugs, vision, proprioception, body mass index, muscular strength and gait velocity were used as covariates. RESULTS: Participants with the highest (i.e., worst) tertile of stride time variability exhibited larger temporal horns than those with the lowest (P=0.030) and intermediate tertiles (P=0.028). They also had larger middle portions of ventricular bodies than those with the intermediate tertile (P=0.018). Larger temporal horns were associated with increase in stride time variability (adjusted beta=0.86, P=0.005), specifically with the highest tertile of stride time variability (adjusted OR=2.45, P=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Higher stride time variability was associated with larger temporal horns in older community-dwellers. Addressing focal neuronal losses in temporal lobes may represent an important strategy to prevent gait instability.
