The clinico-pathological findings of a nervous disease in two mature Siamese cats are described. In one animal intermittent convulsions and mania over a period of three weeks terminated in death, while in the other irritability and hind leg weakness were the main clinical features. Neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions composed of a complex lipid material were detected microscopically. The ultrastructure and staining reactions of these inclusions in one cat were similar to the curvilinear bodies described in neurovisceral storage disease in humans and in a neuronal lipodystrophy of cattle. The deposit was considered likely to be related to ceroid-lipofuscin. No differences in brain lipid quantity or quality could be detected when compared to two control cats.
