The effect of low-frequency (1-10 Hz) electrical stimulation of nonspecific n. centralis lateralis and n. centrum medianum and specific thalamic (LGB) nuclei on spatial synchronization of biopotentials of neocortical areas and on the process of learning was studied on rabbits. Electrical stimulation of the non-specific nuclei raised the level of correlation of the cortical potentials, while the LGB stimulation, on the contrary, weakened the spatial synchronization between the potentials of the visual and sensorimotor neocortical areas. On the basis of the obtained data a conclusion is made that stimulation of the non-specific thalamus contributes to a more successful formation of defensive conditioned reflex to light unlike LGB stimulation. It is suggested that a certain specificity of the studied subcortical formations in organization of spatial synchronization of the brain biopotentials and in the process of learning is due to morpho-functional peculiarities of these structures.
