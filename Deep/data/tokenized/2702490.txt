Interactions between the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine (NE) have been reported in both developmental neural plasticity and learning and memory. In a test of the generality of this phenomenon, we assessed the amnestic effects of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine in normal and NE-depleted mice. Pretraining administration of scopolamine impaired 24-h retention of inhibitory (passive) avoidance training (at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) and the acquisition of place-training in a water maze (at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg). NE depletion resulting from systemic administration of DSP-4 did not affect performance on these tasks and did not significantly alter the effects of scopolamine. NE depletion did, however, impair the retention of place learning when mice were retested 16 days after initial training; and this impairment in the retest was additive with one observed in mice originally trained under scopolamine. Normal acquisition but rapid forgetting has also been reported in aged rodents, who display deterioration of the noradrenergic system. Thus, observation of a similar pattern of performance consequent to experimental NE depletion suggests a role for noradrenergic dysfunction in age-related memory decline.
