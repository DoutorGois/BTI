Cognitive aging is a leading public health concern with the increasing aging population, but there is still lack of specific interventions directed against it. Recent studies have shown that cognitive function is intimately affected by systemic milieu in aging brain, and improvement of systemic environment in aging brain may be a promising approach for rejuvenating cognitive aging. Here, we sought to study the intervention effects of clinical-grade human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) on cognitive aging in a murine model of aging. The conventional aging model in mice induced by d-galactose (d-gal) was employed here. Mice received once every two weeks intraperitoneal administration of hUC-MSCs. After 3 months of systematical regulation of hUC-MSCs, the hippocampal-dependent learning and memory ability was effectively improved in aged mice, and the synaptic plasticity was remarkably enhanced in CA1 area of the aged hippocampus; moreover, the neurobiological substrates that could impact on the function of hippocampal circuits were recovered in the aged hippocampus reflecting in: dendritic spine density enhanced, neural sheath and cytoskeleton restored, and postsynaptic density area increased. In addition, the activation of the endogenic neurogenesis which is beneficial to stabilize the neural network in hippocampus was observed after hUC-MSCs transplantation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that beneficial effects of systematical regulation of hUC-MSCs could be mediated by activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK-CREB signaling pathway in the aged hippocampus. Our study provides the first evidence that hUC-MSCs, which have the capacity of systematically regulating the aging brain, may be a potential intervention for cognitive aging.
