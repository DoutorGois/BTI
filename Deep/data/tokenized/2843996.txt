Neurotensin (NT) receptor binding sites were characterized and localized by using membrane binding assay and in vitro receptor autoradiography in monkey and human brain. Additionally, the effects of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment on NT binding sites were investigated in monkey. [125I]Tyr3-NT ([125I]NT) apparently binds to a single class of high-affinity sites (Kd in nanomolar range) in both species. Ligand selectivity patterns strongly suggest that the structural requirements of both monkey and human brain NT receptors are very similar to those previously reported in other tissues, such as those of the rat brain and rat stomach. In monkey brain, [125I]NT binding sites are discretely distributed with high densities of sites found in the cingulate cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, and periaqueductal gray matter. A similar pattern is observed in the human brain. However, the laminar distribution of [125]NT binding sites in cortex varies between monkey and human brain. In monkey brain, [125I]NT binding sites are mostly concentrated in deep cortical layers while the laminar distribution of NT sites changes with cortical areas in human brain. The densities of [125I]NT binding sites are markedly decreased in the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra in MPTP-treated monkeys. These results suggest strong interactions between NT and dopaminergic systems in both monkey and human brain tissues.
