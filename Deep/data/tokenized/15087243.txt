The effects of S-allylcysteine on oxidative damage and spatial learning and memory deficits produced by an intrahippocampal injection of amyloid-beta peptide 25-35 (Abeta(25-35)) in rats were investigated. The formation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were all measured in hippocampus 120 min after Abeta(25-35) injection (1 microl of 100 microM solution), while learning and memory skills were evaluated 2 and 35 days after the infusion of Abeta(25-35) to rats, respectively. Abeta(25-35) increased both reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, whereas pretreatment with S-allylcysteine (300 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before peptide injection decreased both of these markers. In addition, Abeta(25-35)-induced incorrect learning responses were prevented in most of trials by S-allylcysteine. In contrast, enzyme activities were found unchanged in all groups tested. Findings of this work: (i) support the participation of reactive oxygen species in Abeta(25-35)-induced hippocampal toxicity and learning deficits; and (ii) suggest that the protective effects of S-allylcysteine were related to its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species.
