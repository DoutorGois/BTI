The excitatory action of quinolinic acid has been examined on neurons in different parts of the rat CNS. When applied by microiontophoresis quinolinic acid excited cells in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and neostriatum, but even when applied from electrodes which produced responses in these areas, quinolinic acid was ineffective in the cerebellum and spinal cord. Like most excitants tested in other studies, L-glutamate was excitatory to all cells examined. As an endogenous compound, therefore, quinolinic acid may merit special attention as a potential neurotransmitter in brain.
