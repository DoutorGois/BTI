We analysed the effects of semaphorin D on axons from the developing rat entorhinal-hippocampal formation. Explants from superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex and of the hippocampus anlage were obtained from various developmental stages and co-cultured with cell aggregates expressing semaphorin D. Neurites extending from entorhinal explants that had been isolated from early embryonic stages (E16 and E17) were not affected by semaphorin D, but were repelled at later stages (E20 and E21). Axons from hippocampal neurons explanted at E21 were also repelled by semaphorin D. In situ hybridization studies revealed expression of the semaphorin D receptor neuropilin-1 in the entorhinal cortex from stage E17 to stage P7, and in the dentate gyrus and CA1-3 regions between E17 and adulthood. These data suggest that semaphorin D is involved in the formation of the perforant pathway and acts, via the neuropilin-1 receptor, as a repulsive signal that prevents entorhinal fibres from growing into the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. These data also suggest a role for semaphorin D in the development of intrahippocampal connections.
