In vivo release of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) in mouse medial prefrontal cortex, medial striatum and hippocampus was characterized using in vivo microdialysis. Basal release of NA was similar in these areas, but DA in striatum was 13-30 times higher than in other areas. Unconditioned stimuli (handling, novelty) induced strong increases, except for striatal DA. Striatal NA was more sensitive to handling than NA in other areas.
