The structures of limbic system have great integration in vegetative reactions. In the oxygen deficiency conditions we studied influence of irritation of limbical cortex, orbitofrontal cortes, hipotalamys, septum and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 areas) on the impulse activity of respiratory neurons. Phases of hypoxia were the model of experiment. Irritation some of this structures on normoxia and 4-5 thousand meters higher, we discover inhibiting influense on respiratory neurons; some structures irritation had activating influence. In difficult conditions of hypoxia (7.5-8 thousand meters) on the reduction of the impulse activity of neurons, stimulation induced uncharacteristic reactions. Those different reactions of irritation limbic structures have regulation sense on respitatory neurons.
