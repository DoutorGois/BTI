The temporospatial profile of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and neuronal degeneration following trimethyltin (TMT) administration was investigated in the rat hippocampus region. In the CA1 region, significant COX-2 expression was detected on day 3 after TMT administration but pyramidal cell degeneration was detected only on day 5 and thereafter. In the CA3 region, on the other hand, the constitutive COX-2 expression remained unchanged, and more severe pyramidal cell degeneration started on day 3. Concomitant with these observations, we observed that the coadministration of a COX-2 inhibitor prevented such neuronal degeneration only in the CA1 region and not in the CA3 region. In addition, COX-2 inhibition did not affect the increase in the plasma corticosterone concentration after TMT administration. Furthermore, the COX-2 inhibitor did not alleviate TMT-induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats, for which inhibitors of corticosterone synthesis are known to be effective. These data suggest that the COX-2-dependent pathway appears to assist TMT-induced degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells but not CA3 pyramidal cells in a corticosterone-independent manner.
