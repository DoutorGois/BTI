Among the developmental changes identified in rats exposed to lead are impairments in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus and changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells and some soft tissues. alpha-Lipoic acid (LA) has been reported to be highly effective in improving the thiol capacity of the cells and in reducing lead-induced oxidative stress. To explore the effects of LA on LTP in chronically lead-exposed rats and the relationship between ROS and LTP in both control and lead-exposed rats, we have compared LTP and oxidative stress parameters in groups of lead-exposed and control rats with or without LA treatment (10, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg through intraperitoneal injection). The capacity of LA to decrease hippocampal lead levels in lead-exposed rats was examined. We found that LA had no effects in decreasing the level of lead in the hippocampus, but it did appear to have both antioxidant properties and a reparatory effect on LTP amplitude in rats developmentally exposed to lead for 2 weeks following birth. Interestingly, bell-shaped dose-response curves emerged. In the lower LA dosage groups (10, 25 mg/kg LA), there was an increasing LTP amplitude. The strongest protective effect in terms of the induction and amplitude of LTP in the lead-exposed group with at 25 mg/kg LA; when higher dosages were applied (50, 100 mg/kg LA), the LTP amplitude decreased as compared to the 25 mg/kg LA treatment group. The administration of LA to control animals resulted in a significant impairment of LTP amplitude, with the 100 mg/kg LA treatment having harmful effects on the oxidative parameters. These differential effects of LA on LTP in control and lead-exposed rats may be due to the different redox status of the control and lead-exposed rats.
