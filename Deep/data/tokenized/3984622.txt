Eleven patients with arterial and arteriovenous aneurysms of the cerebral vessels were subjected to 30 repeated examinations of truncal evoked potentials (TEP) to acoustic stimulation. The examination was conducted in the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhages, before and after surgical intervention. It is shown that changes in TEP may be recorded along with improvement, deterioration, stable disorders. From the degree and character of TEP disorders, not only the trend of changes in the functional state of the brain trunk can be judged but also the processes underlying these disorders (ischemia, hemorrhage into the trunk, tentorial wedging).
