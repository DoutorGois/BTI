Frequency changes of hippocampal theta-rhythm in the process of elaboration of coinciding or delayed instrumental alimentary reflex was studied in two dogs. Determination of dominating frequency of rhythmical activity was carried out by means of mathematical methods of analysis on a computer. It was found out, that during the action of conditioned alimentary stimulus the frequency of dominating oscillations became enhanced. Animals with a more frequent initial theta-rhythm formed the delayed alimentary reflex more rapidly.
