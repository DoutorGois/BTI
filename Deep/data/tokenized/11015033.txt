To better understand antidepressant drug effects on the GABA(A) receptor complex (the GABA(A) receptor, chloride ionophore and benzodiazepine receptor), we investigated how antidepressants influenced power spectrum changes induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a chloride ionophore antagonist, in the rat hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG). In control recording, PTZ (27.5 mg/kg i. p.) increased EEG power at frequencies under 12 Hz up to five times. After rats were pretreated with imipramine, fluoxetine or trazodone for 7 days (10 mg/kg i.p., twice a day), PTZ could not increase EEG power to more than three times the power before injection; this effect was not observed after pretreatment for 3 days. These three antidepressants inhibit serotonin uptake, while two other antidepressants, desipramine and nortriptyline, that inhibit norepinephrine uptake failed to counter the PTZ effect. We concluded that antidepressants with serotonergic effects enhanced the function of the GABA(A) receptor complex.
