Gamma-frequency oscillations (approximately 30-100 Hz) in cortical network activity have been proposed to provide a temporal structure for various forms of cognitive processing. This review provides an update on recent experiments addressing the mechanisms underlying gamma-frequency network oscillations in the rodent hippocampus. Particular emphasis is placed on the correlation between in vivo observations and in vitro models.
