NMDA receptors interact via the extended intracellular C-terminal domain of the NR2 subunits with constituents of the postsynaptic density for purposes of retention, clustering, and functional regulation at central excitatory synapses. To examine the role of the C-terminal domain of NR2A in the synaptic localization and function of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors in hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses, we analyzed mice which express NR2A only in its C-terminally truncated form. In CA1 cell somata, the levels, activation, and deactivation kinetics of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor channels were comparable in wild-type and mutant NR2A(Delta)(C/)(Delta)(C) mice. At CA1 cell synapses, however, the truncated receptors were less concentrated than their full-length counterparts, as indicated by immunodetection in cultured neurons, synaptosomes, and postsynaptic densities. In the mutant, the NMDA component of evoked EPSCs was reduced in a developmentally progressing manner and was even more reduced in miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) elicited by spontaneous glutamate release. Moreover, pharmacologically isolated NMDA currents evoked by synaptic stimulation had longer latencies and displayed slower rise and decay times, even in the presence of an NR2B-specific antagonist. These data strongly suggest that the C-terminal domain of NR2A subunits is important for the precise synaptic arrangement of NMDA receptors.
