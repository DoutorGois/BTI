OBJECTIVES: In the adult human brain, neurogenesis occurs in the SVZ and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but it is still unclear whether persistent neural progenitor/stem cells are also present in other brain areas. The present work studies the possibility of obtaining neural progenitor/stem cells from the temporal lobe and investigates their potential to differentiate into neuronal cells. METHODS: Human biopsies from the temporal lobe of epileptic patients were used to isolate potential neural progenitors. Differentiation was induced in the presence of different agents (NGF, NT3, RA) and immunocytochemistry was then performed for quantitative analysis. RESULTS: It was shown that a significant number of cells in the temporal lobe are also capable of expansion and multi-potency. These cells can be amplified as neurospheres and have the potential to differentiate naturally in vitro into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Quantitative analyses show that the progenitor cells of the temporal lobe exhibit a better rate of neuronal differentiation in vitro than the cells from the SVZ, particularly in the presence of NGF. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that neural progenitors are also present in the human temporal lobe. Studying them could be of great interest for cell therapy in neurological disorders.
