Nischarin is a protein known to inhibit breast cancer cell motility by regulating the signaling of the Rho GTPase family. However, little is known about its location and function in the nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regional and cellular expression and functions of Nischarin in the adult rodent brain. As assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and immunostaining, we found that Nischarin was widely distributed throughout the brain, with a higher expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Double-labeling showed that Nischarin was expressed in neurons and was mainly located in the perinuclear region and F-actin-rich protrusions. The expression pattern of Nischarin in the brain was thought to be closely associated with its function. This was verified by our findings from cell migration assays that Nischarin regulated neuronal migration. These results provide a preliminary survey of the distribution of Nischarin in different regions and cell types in the rat brain. This might help to elucidate its physiological roles, and to evaluate its potential clinical implications.
