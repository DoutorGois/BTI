In the clinic delayed post-conditioning would represent an attractive strategy for the survival of vulnerable neurons after an ischemic event. In this paper we studied the impact of ischemia and delayed post-conditioning on blood and brain tissue concentrations of glutamate and protein synthesis. We designed two groups of animals for analysis of brain tissues and blood after global ischemia and post-conditioning, and one for analysis of blood glutamate after transient focal ischemia. Our results showed elevated blood glutamate in two models of transient brain ischemia and decreases in blood glutamate to control in the first 20min of post-conditioning recirculation followed by a consecutive drop of about 20.5% on the first day. Similarly, we recorded reduced protein synthesis in hippocampus and cortex 2 and 3days after ischemia. However, increased glutamate was registered only in the hippocampus. Post-conditioning improves protein synthesis in CA1 and dentate gyrus and, surprisingly, leads to 50% reduction in glutamate in whole hippocampus and cortex. In conclusion, ischemia leads to meaningful elevation of blood and tissue glutamate. Post-conditioning activates mechanisms resulting in rapid elimination of glutamate from brain tissue and/or in the circulatory system that could otherwise impede brain-to-blood glutamate efflux mechanisms. Moreover, post-conditioning induces protein synthesis renewing in ischemia affected tissues that could also contribute to elimination of excitotoxicity. In addition, the potential of glutamate for monitoring the progress of ischemia and efficacy of therapy was shown.
