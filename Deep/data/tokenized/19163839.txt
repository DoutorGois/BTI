Hippocampus and other parts of the cortex are not stationary, but change as a function of time and experience. The goal of this study is to apply adaptive modeling techniques to the tracking of multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamics underlying spike train transformations across brain subregions, e.g. CA3 and CA1 of the hippocampus. A stochastic state point process adaptive filter will be used to track the temporal evolutions of both feedforward and feedback kernels in the natural flow of multiple behavioral events.
