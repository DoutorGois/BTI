Previous studies of the navigational abilities of nonhuman primates have largely been limited to what could be described by a human observer with a pen and paper. Consequently, we have developed a system that uses a pair of cameras to automatically obtain the three-dimensional trajectory of rhesus monkeys performing an outdoor spatial navigation and memory task. The system provides trajectories, path length, speed, and other variables that would be impossible for an unaided observer to note. From trajectory data, we computed and validated a path-length measurement. We use this measurement to compare the navigation abilities of several animals. In addition, we provide quantitative data on the accuracy of a method for automatic behavior detection. Currently, the system is being used to examine the sex differences in spatial navigation of rhesus monkeys. We expect that measures derived from the trajectory data will reveal strategies used by animals to solve spatial problems.
