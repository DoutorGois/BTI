Nitric oxide (NO) is a gaseous neuromessenger. Although increasing evidence reveals significant physiological effects of NO in the hippocampal synaptic plasticity, the spatial distribution of NO production has remained largely uncharacterized due to the poor development of techniques for real-time NO imaging. In this work, using a NO-reactive fluorescent dye, diaminorhodamine-4M (DAR-4M), time-dependent heterogeneous NO production is demonstrated in hippocampal slices upon N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) stimulation or tetanic stimulation. NMDA-induced DAR fluorescence increase in the CA1 was found to be twice that in the CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG). Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration was also investigated. NMDA induced similar Ca(2+) responses both in the CA1 and DG, which were approx. 13% greater than that in the CA3. Subsequently, spatial distribution of NO production in the CA1 upon a tetanic stimulation of Schaffer collateral was investigated, because there are contradictory reports on the effect of NO on long-term potentiation (LTP), and that NO is known to exert various physiological effects depending on its concentration. In the stratum radiatum (sr), DAR fluorescence increase upon tetanus was largest at the vicinity of a stimulating electrode and decreased as a function of increasing distance from the stimulating electrode, suggesting the possibility that the effect of NO in LTP is dependent on the distance between stimulating and recording electrodes. The tetanus-induced Ca(2+) response observed in the sr showed the same but weak distant dependence from the stimulating electrode. Taken together, the observed heterogeneity in the distribution of NO production is suggestive of region-specific effects of NO in the hippocampus.
