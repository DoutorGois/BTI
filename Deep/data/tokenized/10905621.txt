In most nonneural systems, platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptor effects are mediated by G-proteins that are often pertussis toxin-sensitive. The activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins linked to PAF receptors results in the mobilization of intracellular calcium, at least in part, through the second messenger inositol triphosphate. We have sought to determine if a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein is involved in the PAF receptor-mediated phenomena of growth cone collapse and of synaptic enhancement in primary neuronal culture. Using infrared differential interference contrast microscopy and patch-clamp recording techniques, pertussis toxin, but not the inactive B oligomer of the toxin, was found to block both the growth cone collapse and the enhanced synaptic release of excitatory transmitter induced by a nonhydrolyzable PAF receptor agonist, making it likely that Go, Gq, or Gi is the G-protein transducer of PAF receptors in primary neurons. We believe that PAF acts directly on neuronal receptors, which are linked to pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins, on the tips of developing neurites, and on presynaptic nerve terminals, leading to growth cone collapse and enhanced synaptic release of transmitter.
