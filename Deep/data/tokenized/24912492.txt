Central nervous glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, fragile X syndrome or anxiety disorder. Many drugs employed to treat these conditions inhibit GSK3beta either directly or indirectly. We studied how conditional knockout of GSK3beta affected structural synaptic plasticity. Deletion of the GSK3beta gene in a subset of cortical and hippocampal neurons in adult mice led to reduced spine density. In vivo imaging revealed that this was caused by a loss of persistent spines, whereas stabilization of newly formed spines was reduced. In electrophysiological recordings, these structural alterations correlated with a considerable drop in the frequency and amplitude of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-dependent miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents. Expression of constitutively active beta-catenin caused reduction in spine density and electrophysiological alterations similar to GSK3beta knockout, suggesting that the effects of GSK3beta knockout were mediated by the accumulation of beta-catenin. In summary, changes of dendritic spines, both in quantity and in morphology, are correlates of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity; thus, these results may help explain the mechanism of action of psychotropic drugs inhibiting GSK3beta.
