Rats with unilateral lesions of either the supracallosal regions (including the dorsal cingulate cortex) and the fimbria-fornix either on the same (S) or the opposite (O) sides of the brain were studied in a 16-hole open field without pharmacologic intervention and, subsequently, after 0.1 and after 1.0 mg/kg scopolamine HBr. Their performances were compared with those of unoperated control animals subjected to the same testing regime. Certain of their behaviors were compared with those of a larger number of animals with bilateral hippocampal destruction (and their control groups) from prior studies. Unilateral lesions of fimbria-fornix and supracallosal afferents to the hippocampal formation produced a decrease in hole poking activity relative to control animals. A further decrease in hole-poking behavior, coupled with increased locomotion, was observed in rats with fimbria-fornix and cingulate cortex lesions on opposite sides of the brain (group O). The smaller dose of scopolamine accentuated these effects. Indeed, the behavior of group O after scopolamine treatment was similar to animals with large bilateral hippocampal lesions. The large dose of scopolamine induced stereotyped rearing or hole poking in the brain-damaged animals but not in the control group. These findings suggest that both the fimbria-fornix and the supracallosal pathway is necessary for normal hippocampal function and that the behavioral deficit is greater when these structures are damaged on the opposite sides of the brain.
