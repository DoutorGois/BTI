Using autoradiographic binding methodology with monoiodinated peptide YY together with the agonists neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NPY (13-36), as well as in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes complementary to the NPY Y2 receptor (Y2-R) mRNA, we have studied whether or not intracerebral prion inoculation affects Y2-Rs in male CD-1 mice. Monoiodinated peptide YY binding, mainly representing Y2-Rs, was down-regulated by 85% in the CA1 strata oriens and radiatum and by 50-65% in the CA3 stratum oriens 110-140 days postinoculation. In the CA3 stratum radiatum, where the mossy fibers from the dentate granule cells project, there was a significant decrease in PYY binding at 110-120 days. Y2-R mRNA, moderately expressed both in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers and the granule cell layer in the dentate gyrus, showed a slight, but not significant, decrease in CA3 neurons 130 days postinoculation. The results indicate that the accumulation of the scrapie prion protein in the CA1-3 region strongly inhibits NPY binding at the Y2-Rs, which, however, is only marginally due to reduced Y2-R mRNA expression. The loss of the ability of NPY to bind to inhibitory Y2-Rs may cause dysfunction of hippocampal circuits and may contribute to the clinical symptoms in mouse scrapie.
