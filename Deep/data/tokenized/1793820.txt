Duchenne muscular dystrophy is due to mutations in the dystrophin gene which is predominantly expressed in muscle and brain. Since the disease is associated with cognitive impairment, we sought to localize dystrophin mRNA in brain using in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. We find the gene strongly expressed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, areas with an established cognitive function, and also in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, an area associated with motor coordination.
