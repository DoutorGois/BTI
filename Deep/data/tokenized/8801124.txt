Synapsin Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb are neuronal phosphoproteins, which are supposed to play a role in the short-term regulation of neurotransmitter release. Besides a high degree of homology among the four synapsin subtypes, there are structural differences in the 3'end of their coding region. Here we present the first extensive study of the expression of their gene transcripts by using in situ hybridization and northern blot analysis. Our results show regionally and temporally distinct expression patterns of synapsin Ia, Ib, IIa, and IIb, which suggests different functional properties of the four synapsin subtypes. There was no specific messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of synapsin IIb in most brain regions apart from the cerebellum, suggesting a minor functional role of this synapsin subtype. Synapsin Ia, Ib, and IIa mRNA were expressed earlier in ontogenetically older brain regions such as the piriform cortex, the thalamus, and the hippocampus and later in ontogenetically younger areas such as the neocortex and the cerebellum. Owing to the distinct expression pattern of the synapsin subtypes, we suppose that the synapsins might be essential for the underlying molecular mechanism of pattern formation and plasticity in distinct brain regions during different states of rat brain development.
