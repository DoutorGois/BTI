In experiments with unanaesthetized rabbits the influences of electric stimulation of the dentate fascia (DF) on the extracellularly recorded spontaneous and evoked activity of the CA3 neurones were investigated. Stimulation of a fixed locus in the DF during recording in the CA3 by a microelectrode, shifted along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, supported the notion of the topical, "segmental" organization of connections between the DF and CA3. A relatively narrow "active zone" (approximately 700 nm) appeared in the CA3 during the threshold DF stimulation: it was bordered by zones with predominantly inhibitory responses to stimulation. The CA3 neurones in the "active zone" rapidly lost their reactivity to sensory stimuli. In the "inhibitory" and "zero" zones the normal level of reactivity to sensory stimuli was preserved.
