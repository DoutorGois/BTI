INTRODUCTION: All clinically effective antipsychotics are known to act on the dopaminergic system, and previous studies have demonstrated that repeated treatment with antipsychotics produced region-specific changes in dopamine receptor levels. Cariprazine is a dopamine D(3) and D(2) receptor partial agonist with preferential binding to D(3) receptors. We examined the effects of chronic cariprazine administration on dopamine receptor levels. METHODS: Rats were administered either vehicle or cariprazine (0.06, 0.2, or 0.6 mg/kg) for 28 days. Dopamine receptor levels were quantitated using autoradiographic assays on brain tissue sections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu), hippocampus (HIPP), olfactory tubercle (OT), and islands of Calleja (ICj). RESULTS: Chronic treatment with cariprazine did not alter D(1) receptor levels in any brain region tested. Cariprazine increased D(2) receptor levels in mPFC (27%-43%), NAc (40%-45%), medial (41%-53%) and lateral (52%-63%) CPu, and HIPP (38%). Cariprazine dose-dependently upregulated D(3) receptor levels in ICj (32%-57%), OT (27%-67%), and NAc shell (31%-48%). Repeated cariprazine treatment increased D(4) receptor in NAc (53%-82%), medial (54%-98%) and lateral (58%-74%) CPu, and HIPP (38%-98%). CONCLUSION: Similar to other antipsychotics, cariprazine upregulated D(2) and D(4) receptor levels in various brain regions. Cariprazine was unique among antipsychotics in increasing D(3) receptor levels, which may support its unique psychopharmacologic properties.
