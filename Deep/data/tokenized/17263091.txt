Dietary protein variation has been found to alter brain regional neurochemistry with aging. In the present investigation, we studied the effect of short-term treatment of protein-carbohydrate variable diet to rat on hypothalamic and hippocampal gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-glutamate metabolism with increase of age. Exposure of male albino rats with diet containing normal protein (20%)-normal carbohydrate (68%) increased GABA metabolism and decreased glutamate metabolism in both hypothalamus and hippocampus with the increase of age. GABA-glutamate metabolism of rats having low protein (8%)-high carbohydrate (80%) diet for short-term period (STP), was activated in young age (3 months) and decreased in old age (18 months) in both the brain regions. On the contrary, intake of high protein (50%)-low carbohydrate (38%) diet under similar condition decreased GABA-glutamate metabolism in both hypothalamus and hippocampus of young brain and increased only in hypothalamus of aged brain. In hippocampus of aged brain the same diet decreased glutamate metabolism without changing its GABA metabolism. These results suggest that an age-associated change in GABA-glutamate metabolism depends on the amount of dietary protein and carbohydrate and also on the brain region.
