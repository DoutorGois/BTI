A striking and specific loss of the messenger RNA that encodes a non-N-methyl D-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate receptor was found in hippocampal tissue obtained at necropsy from 6 patients with schizophrenia, when compared to specimens from 8 controls without neurological or psychiatric signs or symptoms. These findings support suggestions of aberrant glutamatergic function in schizophrenia. Evidence that gene expression may be abnormal in schizophrenia, with decreased production of an excitatory neurotransmitter receptor, may have therapeutic as well as pathogenetic implications.
