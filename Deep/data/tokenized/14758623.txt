The study aimed at revealing psycho-emotional manifestations of Wistar rats in a problem situation when they had to solve a food-getting task in a multi-alternative maze. Bilateral lesion of dorsal hippocampus did not affect the learning process while the pattern of psycho-emotional manifestations changed in all the animals irrespective of their individual properties. The pverall effect was manifested in flatness of psycho-emotional responses as a result of reduction of extreme forms of both passive and active stress responses. Individual effects depended on the behavioural phenotype. Hippocampus lesion in initially excitable rats (10%) resulted in reduction of active stress responses (act/pass = 0.35/0.5 instead of 1.0/0.4 in control). Hippocampus lesion in initially inhibited rats (30%) did not affect the basic pattern of psycho-emotional responses, while in the rats with initially depressed cognitive activity (60%) it resulted in decreasing of passive and increasing of active stress responses (act/pass = 0.45/1/4 instead of 0.3/1.9). The findings suggest that hippocampus takes part in the psycho-emotional responses while the individual psycho-emotional pattern is determined by the morpho-functional features responsible for organisation of a psycho-emotional condition.
