OBJECTIVE: Bipolar disorder (BD) commonly begins during adolescence and may continue into adulthood. Studies in adults with BD suggest that disruptions in amygdalar neural circuitry explain the pathophysiology underlying the disorder. Importantly, however, amygdala subregion networks have not yet been examined in youth close to mania onset. The goal of this study was to compare resting state functional connectivity patterns in amygdala subregions in youth with bipolar I disorder with patterns in healthy controls. METHOD: Centromedial, laterobasal, and superficial amygdala subdivisions were assessed during rest and examined in relation to clinical measures of mania in youth (14-20 years old) with bipolar I disorder who experienced only a single episode of mania (BD; n = 20) and age-matched healthy comparison youth without any personal or family history of DSM-IV Axis I disorders (HC; n = 23). RESULTS: Relative to HC youth, youth with BD exhibited decreased connectivity between the laterobasal subdivision of the amygdala and the hippocampus and precentral gyrus, and increased connectivity between the laterobasal subdivision and the precuneus. Connectivity between the right laterobasal amygdala and right hippocampus was positively correlated with levels of anxiety in BD but not in HC youth, and connectivity between the right laterobasal amygdala and right precuneus was negatively correlated with insight about bipolar illness. CONCLUSION: Youth with BD have abnormal amygdala resting state network connections to regions that are critical for emotional processing and self-awareness. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these aberrant patterns in youth with BD can be altered with intervention and can influence the course of disorder.
