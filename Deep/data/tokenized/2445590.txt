Neither the chronic administration (40 daily subcutaneous injections) of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg) nor its withdrawal (3 days) influenced avoidance of the more aversive open runways of an elevated X-maze in rats which had been habituated to the apparatus. Lesions of the serotonergic fibres innervating the hippocampus increased total activity (P less than 0.05). However, analysis of covariance indicated that reduced 5-hydroxytryptamine secretion in the hippocampus was probably not the mechanism by which nicotine stimulated total activity in these rats.
