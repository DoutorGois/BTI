An outbred rat model of novelty-seeking phenotype has predictive value for the expression of locomotor sensitization to nicotine. When experimentally naive rats are exposed to a novel environment, some display high rates of locomotor reactivity (HRs, scores ranking at top 1/3rd of the population), whereas some display low rates (LRs, scores ranking at bottom 1/3rd of the population). Basally, HRs display lower anxiety-like behavior compared to LRs along with higher neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in the amygdala and the hippocampus. Following an intermittent behavioral sensitization to nicotine regimen and 1 wk of abstinence, HRs show increased social anxiety-like behavior in the social interaction test and robust expression of locomotor sensitization to a low dose nicotine challenge. These effects are accompanied by a deficit in NPY mRNA levels in the medial nucleus of the amygdala and the CA3 field of the hippocampus, and increases in Y2R mRNA levels in the CA3 field and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Systemic and daily injections of a Y2R antagonist, JNJ-31020028, during abstinence fully reverse nicotine-induced social anxiety-like behavior, the expression of locomotor sensitization to nicotine challenge, the deficit in the NPY mRNA levels in the amygdala and the hippocampus, as well as result an increase in Y2R mRNA levels in the hippocampus and the CRF mRNA levels in the amygdala in HRs. These findings implicate central Y2R in neuropeptidergic regulation of social anxiety in a behavioral sensitization to nicotine regimen in the LRHR rats.
