It has been shown that single or multiple hydrocortisone and ACTH administrations to intact rats increased GABA content and its synthesis from glutamate and putrescine in synaptosomes of hypothalamus. The letter content was increased by single hormonal administration while multiple hormonal administration and adrenalectomy decreased it. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was increased by single hydrocortisone administration to intact animals, following adrenalectomy, and it was decreased by single hormonal administration to adrenalectomized rats. GABA synthesis in synaptosomes of hippocampus from putrescine was increased by single hydrocortisone and multiple hormonal administrations. GABA content was increased by multiple administration of both hormones and was decreased by adrenalectomy. Putrescine level was decreased by multiple hydrocortisone administration to intact and single administration to adrenalectomized rats; ornithine decarboxylase activity was decreased by multiple administration of both hormones.
