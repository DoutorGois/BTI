Using [3H]MK-801, [3H]muscimol, [3H]cyclic AMP, and [3H]rolipram, we performed quantitative in vitro autoradiography to determine sequential alterations in the binding of N-methyl-D-aspartate and GABAA receptors, particulate cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and cyclic AMP-selective phosphodiesterase, respectively, in the gerbil hippocampus following repeated brief ischemic insults. Changes from 1 h to 28 days after three 2-min ischemic insults at 1-h intervals were compared with those after 2 and 6 min of ischemia. We observed no alterations in the binding of all the four ligands throughout the observation period following 2 min of ischemia which produced no histological neuronal damage except for transient reductions in [3H]cyclic AMP binding during the early reperfusion period. [3H]Cyclic AMP binding in the CA1 subfield decreased one day after 6 min of ischemia and four days after three 2-min ischemic insults, and 62-65% of the binding was lost after 28 days. [3H]Rolipram binding in the CA1 subfield decreased one day after 6 min of ischemia and the binding was reduced by 45-50% after four and 28 days. Following three 2-min ischemic insults, [3H]rolipram binding decreased in the CA1 at one day, and decreased by 25-33% after 28 days. Both [3H]MK-801 and [3H]muscimol binding was preserved during the early reperfusion period after 6 min of ischemia and three 2-min ischemic insults. Reductions in [3H]MK-801 binding in CA1 were observed four days after ischemic insults when CA1 neuronal destruction was seen. After one month, approximately 50% of [3H]MK-801 binding was lost in CA1 in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
