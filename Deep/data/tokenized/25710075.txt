The results of the present study show the augmentation of hippocampal-cortical coherence and phase synchronization in theta-frequency and wider (1-15 Hz) low frequency range, during the time-period of LTP of monosynaptic prefrontal cortex focal potentials. The augmentation was detectable only in that activity segments with low to near-zero hippocampal theta frequency power. No definite changes in amplitude correlation of theta-rhytm envelops has been established.
