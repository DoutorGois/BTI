The mechanism underlying the change in clathrin immunohistochemistry preceding delayed neuronal death (DND) was studied in gerbils. The ischaemic change observed with chc5.9 anti-clathrin antibody in hippocampal CA1 was initially ameliorated by pentobarbital, which blocks DND, but 1 day after ischaemia, no change in the immunoreactivity of the SDS-denatured clathrin molecule was detected by Western blotting and no change in the clathrin content in CA1 was detected by SDS-PAGE. No ischaemia-induced change in immunohistochemistry was observed with another monoclonal anti-clathrin antibody, X-22. The above results imply that some modifications that affect the structure of clathrin molecules around the chc5.9 specific epitope may be a crucial step in the course of DND.
