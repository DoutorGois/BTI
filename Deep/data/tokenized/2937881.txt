Regional distributions of thiobarbituric acid-reactive products, activities of enzymes regulating metabolism of oxygen free radicals, and some of the related enzymes were studied in 10 areas of adult and aged rat brains. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive products were lower in cerebral cortex, septal area, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, and substantia nigra compared with other areas studied in adult rats; however, they increased significantly in the former areas with aging. A slight but significant reduction in superoxide dismutase activity was noted in frontal cortex, septal area, caudate-putamen, and substantia nigra with aging. Glutathione peroxidase and reductase activities were highest in caudate-putamen and in substantia nigra. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activities were lowest in cortical areas. Phosphofructokinase activity was lowest in septal area and hippocampus in aged rats. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity showed only small regional and evolutional changes. Lactate dehydrogenase activity declined with age in most of the areas studied. sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity showed small changes with aging except in hippocampus, where 40% reduction was noted. Generally, cerebral cortical areas, hippocampus, and septal areas were not particularly enriched in enzymes regulating the metabolism of oxygen free radicals. The results were discussed in relation to the role of free radicals in aging.
