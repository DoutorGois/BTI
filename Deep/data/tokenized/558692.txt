The paper describes bioelectrical correlates of negative emotional states on three models: 1) states caused by local, chronic electric stimulation of negative emotiogenic zones (in cats, rabbits); 2) by a neurogenic stress in rats resulting from a conflict of afferent excitations; 3) by an experimental syndrome--"expectation stress". The data attest that hypersynchronization of bioelectrical activity in limbic and cortical structures is a sufficiently significant correlate of an emotional stress. It is assumed that hypersynchronization reflects one of the general mechanisms of involvement of brain structures in a state of neurogenic stress and its manifestation.
