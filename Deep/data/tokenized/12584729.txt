Using a cDNA microarray method, we analyzed gene expression profiles in mouse hippocampus after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Of 6,400 randomly selected arrayed genes and expressed sequence tags from a mouse cDNA library, 253 were found to be differentially expressed (106 increased and 147 decreased). Genes involved in cell homeostasis and calcium signaling were primarily up-regulated while those encoding mitochondrial enzymes, metabolic molecules, and structural proteins were predominantly down-regulated. Equal numbers of genes related to inflammatory reactions showed increased or decreased expression. Importantly, a large proportion of the dysregulated genes we identified have not been reported as differentially expressed in TBI models. Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses of representative genes confirmed the validity of the corresponding microarray findings. Thus, our microarray-based evaluation of gene expression in traumatically injured hippocampus identified both known and novel genes that respond to TBI. Further investigation of these candidate molecules may suggest new ways to attenuate the traumatic effects of brain injury.
