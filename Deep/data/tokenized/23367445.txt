One of the fundamental characteristics of the brain is its hierarchical and temporal organization: scales in both space and time must be considered to fully grasp the system's underlying mechanisms and their impact on brain function. Complex interactions taking place at the molecular level regulate neuronal activity that further modifies the function of millions of neurons connected by trillions of synapses, ultimately giving rise to complex function and behavior at the system level. Likewise, the spatial complexity is accompanied by a complex temporal integration of events taking place at the microsecond scale leading to slower changes occurring at the second, minute and hour scales. These integrations across hierarchies of the nervous system are sufficiently complex to have impeded the development of routine multi-level modeling methodologies. The present study describes an example of our multiscale efforts to rise from the biomolecular level to the neuron level. We more specifically describe how we integrate biomolecular mechanisms taking place at glutamatergic and gabaergic synapses and integrate them to study the impact of these modifications on spiking activity of a CA1 pyramidal cell in the hippocampus.
