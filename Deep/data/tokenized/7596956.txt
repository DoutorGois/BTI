Effects of morphine and aluminum fluoride on field potentials evoked in hippocampal pyramidal cells were investigated revealing the physiological significance of adenylate cyclase in morphine action. Dibutyryl-cyclic AMP (db-cAMP) reduces the amplitude of potentials, while morphine enhances it. Morphine was without effects on db-cAMP induced reduction of potentials. Aluminum fluoride, known to activate GTP binding proteins, also reduced potentials and this was antagonized by morphine. Furthermore, N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulphonamide dihydrochloride (H-8), a protein kinase A inhibitor, enhanced potentials. When GABA synthesis was inhibited by 3-mercaptopropinoic acid, both morphine and db-cAMP was without effect. These results suggested the inhibition of adenylate cyclase by morphine which might be related with the reduction of GABA release in hippocampal slices.
