Inbred DBA/2 (D2) mice have an inherited susceptibility to audiogenic seizures (AGS), whereas inbred C57BL/6 (B6) mice are resistant to these seizures. AGS susceptibility is genetically associated with a reduction of a brain Ca2+-ATPase activity. A novel apparatus was used for monitoring simultaneously the electrical activity and ATP release from brain slices. The amount of extracellular ATP detected in hippocampal slices following the electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals is significantly greater in D2 mice than in B6 mice. We suggest that the increased level of extracellular ATP in D2 mice is associated with reduced brain Ca2+-ATPase activity.
