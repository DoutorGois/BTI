Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) may preserve cognitive function in postmenopausal women, but the mechanism is unknown. Thus, the authors studied aging of parietal lobe and hippocampus using proton MR spectroscopy. ERT naive postmenopausal women had a significant increase in choline-containing compounds (Cho) compared to long-term ERT users and young women. Cho reflects increased neuronal/glial membrane turnover. Thus, ERT's "neuroprotective" effect may include modulating the effects of age on neural integrity in brain regions involved in cognitive function.
