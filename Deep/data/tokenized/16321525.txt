A suitable solid-phase approach, based on Fmoc/(t)Bu methodology and on the use of 2-chlorotrityl resin, allowed a rapid and efficient preparation of new GPE analogues. Most of the synthesized tripeptides displayed glutamate receptor binding affinity comparable to that of GPE, but only a few derivatives showed significant neuroprotective activity.
