Low affinity alpha1/alpha2 containing GABAA receptors are significantly less able to bind [(11) C]/[(3) H]Ro15-4513 following translocation to the endosomal environment. The alterations in [(11) C]Ro15-4513 binding observed in vivo following perturbations in endogenous GABA are likely driven by both alterations in receptor binding parameters following agonist induced internalisation and the GABA Shift.
