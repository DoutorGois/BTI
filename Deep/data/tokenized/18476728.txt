A chimeric protein consisting of a cell-adhesive peptide derived from a neural cell adhesion molecule and a collagen-binding domain was synthesized using recombinant DNA technology. Here, we demonstrate that the chimeric protein binds to type I collagen and promotes the adhesion and neurite extension of hippocampus neurons. These results suggest that the chimeric protein has potential to provide microenvironments for neurons to adhere and survive in collagen-based matrices for use in cell-based therapies for central nervous disorders.
