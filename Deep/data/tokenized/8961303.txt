Transgenic mice carrying the three common human apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles have been developed. In this study, brains of the transgenic mice have been analyzed by in situ histohybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblots to determine sites of gene expression, to identify specific brain cells associated with human apoE protein, and to determine the relative concentrations of the human apoE. Results indicate that (1) human APOE mRNA and apoE protein occur in the gray and white matter of transgenic mouse brains; (2) in the hippocampus of transgenic brains, human apoE protein reacts immunologically within the same cells as the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a specific marker for astrocytes; and (3) concentrations of the apoE isoforms determined in three heterozygous transgenic brains range from 22 to 250 pmol/g wet weight of brain.
