Presynaptically localized adrenoceptors occur on a variety of neurones. In particular, alpha2-adrenoceptors, occurring on neurones of the peripheral and central nervous system, inhibit the release of the respective transmitters whereas beta2-adrenoceptors on some types of postganglionic sympathetic neurones facilitate noradrenaline release. Since only little information is available whether there are also presynaptic beta3-adrenoceptors, we examined the effect of beta3-adrenoceptor agonists on noradrenaline release from the resistance vessels and the hippocampus of the rat and on serotonin and acetylcholine release from the rat hippocampus. In rat hippocampal slices preincubated with (H-noradrenaline, 3H-serotonin and 3H-choline and superfused in the presence of an inhibitor of the neuronal transporter of the respective neurone, the beta3-adrenoceptor agonist CL 316243 did not affect the electrically evoked tritium overflow. The latter was, however, inhibited by at least 50% by agonists of the respective autoreceptors. CL 316243 and another three beta3-adrenoceptor agonists (BRL 37344, ZD 2079 and CGP 12177) failed to affect the electrically evoked tritium overflow also in slices preincubated with 3H-noradrenaline and superfused in the presence of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine whereas prostaglandin E2 caused a marked inhibition. In pithed and vagotomized rats, the increase in diastolic blood pressure induced by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow was also not affected by CL 316243 but markedly inhibited by the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55212-2. CL 316243 and WIN 55212-2 were devoid of an effect on the rise in diastolic blood pressure induced by exogenous noradrenaline. In conclusion, our data suggest that the noradrenergic neurones innervating the resistance vessels of the rat and the noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic neurones of the rat hippocampus are not endowed with presynaptic beta3-adrenoceptors.
