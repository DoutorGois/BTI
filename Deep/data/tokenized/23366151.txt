In order to understand how memory works in the brain, the hippocampus is highly studied because of its role in the encoding of long-term memories. We have identified four characteristics that would contribute to the encoding process: the morphology of the neurons, their biophysics, synaptic plasticity, and the topography connecting the input to and the neurons within the hippocampus. To investigate how long-term memory is encoded, we are constructing a large-scale biologically realistic model of the rat hippocampus. This work focuses on how topography contributes to the output of the hippocampus. Generally, the brain is structured with topography such that the synaptic connections formed by an input neuron population are organized spatially across the receiving population. The first step in our model was to construct how entorhinal cortex inputs connect to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We have derived realistic constraints from topographical data to connect the two cell populations. The details on how these constraints were applied are presented. We demonstrate that the spatial connectivity has a major impact on the output of the simulation, and the results emphasize the importance of carefully defining spatial connectivity in neural network models of the brain in order to generate relevant spatiotemporal patterns.
