Evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that interactions of histamine with H3 receptors decrease the cholinergic tone in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. These interactions may be important in learning and memory. Both H3 and 5-HT3 receptors represent targets for pharmacological intervention by exogenous compounds acting as antagonists. Thus, the use of compounds with such properties as either thioperamide (H3 receptor antagonist) or ondansetron (5-HT3 antagonist) may represent a potential therapy to correct the deficits resulting from cholinergic hypofunction.
