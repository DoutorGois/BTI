Topical application of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) onto hippocampal slices produced spontaneous repetitive large hyperpolarizing potentials in CA1 neurons. This effect of 4-AP was blocked by a new GABAB receptor antagonist, 2-hydroxy-saclofen. 2-Hydroxy-saclofen also blocked slow IPSPs evoked by stimulation of stratum radiatum. It is suggested that 4-AP-evoked slow hyperpolarizing potentials are in fact slow IPSPs evoked by activation of a selective subset of interneurons which do not produce fast IPSPs.
