Krupic, Bauza, Burton, Barry, & O'Keefe (Grid cell symmetry is shaped by environmental geometry. Nature, 518, 232-235, 2015) found that the grids of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex of rats become sparser at the sharp end of a trapezoidal space. This makes grids, and grid cells, unsuitable for measuring distance traveled (odometry) and suggests that grid cells may have more to do with sorting out directions.
