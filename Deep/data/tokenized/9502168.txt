1. The in vitro antiepileptiform effects of some old and new anticonvulsants in the experimental model of the "epileptiform" hippocampal slice have been reviewed. 2. On the basis of their influence on in vitro epileptogenesis and basal neuronal excitability, anticonvulsants can be classified into three main categories: (1) anticonvulsants (prototypical drug phenytoin) affecting basal neuronal excitability but not epileptogenesis; (2) anticonvulsants (prototypical drugs barbiturates) affecting basal neuronal excitability and epileptogenesis; (3) anticonvulsants (prototypical drug felbamate) affecting epileptogenesis but not basal neuronal excitability. 3. It is concluded that the model of the "epileptiform" hippocampal slices can be considered a previsional test for the study and the screening of new anticonvulsant drugs.
