The effects of single or repeated treatments with manual acupuncture (ACU), electro-acupuncture (ELACU) or physical exercise on neuropeptide Y (NPY), neurokinin A (NKA), substance P (SP), galanin (GAL) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-like immunoreactivity (-LI) in different regions of the rat brain were studied. Initially the effect of microwave irradiation (MWI) was compared to decapitation on the recovery of neuropeptides, and significantly higher concentrations of SP-LI, NKA-LI and NPY-LI were found in the hippocampus, occipital cortex, pituitary and striatum following MWI. Repeated ELACU treatments significantly increased SP-LI, NKA-LI and NPY-LI in the hippocampus and NPY-LI in the occipital cortex. No changes were found in animals receiving ACU or performing physical exercise.
