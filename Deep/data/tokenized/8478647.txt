Kainic acid treatment, a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, induces Ammon's horn sclerosis characterized by degeneration of CA3 pyramidal neurons and reactive gliosis. We now report that in kainic acid treated rats, reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus are A2B5 immunopositive and express GAP-43 immunoreactivity. A2B5 is a cell surface ganglioside selectively expressed in the glial O-2A lineage (oligodendrocytes and type-2 astrocytes in vitro). Since A2B5-positive cells were also GFAP immunoreactive, our observation suggest that hippocampal-reactive astrocytes in the epileptic process are type-2 astrocytes. GAP-43 is a membrane-associated phosphoprotein involved in neurite outgrowth. In vitro analysis showed that the glial O-2A lineage may express this phosphoprotein. In this study, we found that GAP-43 was coexpressed in astrocytes with A2B5 suggesting that in vivo as in vitro type-2 astrocytes express GAP-43.
