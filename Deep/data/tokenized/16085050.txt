Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are widely expressed in mammalian sensory neurons and supposedly play a role in nociception and acid sensing. In the course of functioning the redox status of the tissue is subjected to changes. Using whole-cell patch-clamp/concentration clamp techniques we have investigated the effect of redox reagents on the ASIC-like currents in the sensory ganglia and hippocampal neurons of rat. The reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), when applied in the concentrations 1-2 mM, reversibly potentiates proton-activated currents, while the oxidizing reagent 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) causes their inhibition. The EC50 and Hill coefficient for the activation of ASIC-like currents by protons are not affected by DTT. Redox modulation of proton-activated currents is independent on the membrane potential and on the level of pH used for the current activation. The endogenous antioxidant tripeptide glutathione (its reduced form, g-l-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH) also potentiates proton-activated currents. Our results indicate that ASIC-like currents are susceptible to regulation by redox agents.
