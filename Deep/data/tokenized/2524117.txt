Binding sites of vasopressin (VP) have been characterized in the hippocampal synaptic plasma membranes of developing normal and hypothyroid rats using a highly specific tritiated VP antagonist, d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)VP (V1 type). This antagonist bound to an apparently homogeneous population of specific sites with an affinity ten times higher than that of VP itself. The total amount of synaptosomal protein in 15-day-old normal rats represented about 50% of the adult value, but the density of binding sites was already maximal and remained constant thereafter, supporting the concept of an early development of an extrahypophyseal vasopressinergic hippocampal system. Thyroid deficiency specifically reduced the amount of synaptosomal protein. However, the binding site density in the synaptsomal fraction appeared to be relatively well preserved from hypothyroidism, although there was a transient decrease in the apparent affinity of the ligand. These data suggest that thyroid hormones are slightly involved in the early development of high-affinity VP receptors.
