The nature of encoded information in neural circuits is determined by neuronal firing patterns and frequencies. This paper discusses the molecular identity and cellular mechanisms of spike-frequency adaptation in the central nervous system (CNS). Spike-frequency adaptation in thalamocortical (TC) and CA1 hippocampal neurons is mediated by the Ca2()-activated Cl(-) channel (CACC) anoctamin-2 (ANO2). Knockdown of ANO2 in these neurons results in increased number of spikes, in conjunction with significantly reduced spike-frequency adaptation. No study has so far demonstrated that CACCs mediate afterhyperpolarization currents, which result in the modulation of neuronal spike patterns in the CNS. Our study therefore proposes a novel role for ANO2 in spike-frequency adaptation and transmission of information in the brain. [BMB Reports 2017; 50(3): 109-110].
