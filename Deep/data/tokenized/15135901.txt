In the rat, activation of the intracerebral cholinergic system originating in the basal forebrain and projecting to the cortex and hippocampus releases acetylcholine in the cortex and hippocampus, which results in vasodilation and an increase in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the cortex and hippocampus. The augmentation of rCBF is independent of both systemic blood pressure and regional metabolism. The intracerebral cholinergic fibers are able to act as autonomic nerve fibers for the regulation of cortical and hippocampal blood flow.
