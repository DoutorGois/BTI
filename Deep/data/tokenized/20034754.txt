Acute hypoxia at postnatal day (P) 10 is an accepted model of human neonatal hypoxia which results, among other consequences, in increased hippocampal excitability. Hypoxic-ischemic injury, which mimics stroke, has been shown to result in changes in connexins (Cxs), however, changes in Cxs have not been studied in the P10 hypoxia model. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the hippocampal expression of three different connexins at consecutive developmental stages after acute hypoxia at P10 (10min and 30min after reoxygenation, P11, P14, P17, P29, and P45) as compared to sham manipulated pups. After acute hypoxia at P10, Cx30 protein levels were increased at 30min after reoxygenation, at P11 and at P14, and then returned to control levels. Cx36 protein levels transiently decreased at P11 after acute hypoxia then returned to control levels. Cx43 protein levels did not change at any of the time points. Although changes in mRNA expression were observed during development for Cx30 only, acute hypoxia did not result in changes in mRNA expression of all these Cxs when compared to age matched controls suggesting that acute hypoxia induced posttranslational changes in protein expression.
