Four-week-old ICR mice were systemically exposed to 18Gy X-rays. Afterwards, the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the cerebrum was observed with time using Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. As a result, PCNA-positive cells were observed in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles in unirradiated mice. The number of PCNA-positive cells decreased with time in all zones after irradiation, but the decrease was more marked in the hippocampal SGZ. We think that PCNA-positive cells are stem cells. The selective vulnerability to radiation in the hippocampus is considered to be attributed to the fact that stem cells in the SGZ selectively undergo radiation-induced apoptosis.
