Using the tritiated, muscarinic antagonist quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) as a ligand, muscarinic receptors have been identified and characterized in intact, cultured explants of the hippocampus of the rat. Competition studies with scopolamine and oxotremorine indicated a certain heterogeneity in the population of muscarinic receptors, whereas atropine and pirenzepine competed with [3H]QNB in a manner consistent with only one binding site for these substances. Thus, the observed heterogenity does not fit in with the M1/M2 receptor concept. Extended studies, with the aim of determining to what extent these putative subtypes of receptors are functional, would be of interest.
