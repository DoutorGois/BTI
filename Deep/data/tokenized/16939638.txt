Voltage-dependent N-type Ca(2+) channels, along with the P/Q-type, have a crucial role in controlling the release of neurotransmitters or neuromodulators at presynaptic terminals. However, their role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory has never been examined. Here, we investigated hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses in mice deficient for the alpha(1B) subunit of N-type Ca(2+) channels. The mutant mice exhibited impaired learning and memory in the Morris water maze and the social transmission of food preference tasks. In particular, long-term memory was impaired in the mutant mice. Interestingly, among activity-dependent long-lasting synaptic changes, theta burst- or 200-Hz-stimulation-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was decreased in the mutant, compared with the wild-type mice. This type of LTP is known to require brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It was found that both BDNF-induced potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials and facilitation of the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were reduced in the mutant. Taken together, these results demonstrate that N-type Ca(2+) channels are required for hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, and certain forms of LTP.
