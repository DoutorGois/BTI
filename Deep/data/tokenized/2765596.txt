The protein content has been determined by means of cytointerferometry in neurons of fields CA-1 and CA-3 of the dorsal hippocampus in rats, which were trained in a conditioned reflex of two-way avoidance (CRTA) with the action of subcutaneously injected enkephalin cyclic analogue (ECA) in a dose 10 mkg. It has been found that after ECA injection the protein content in the neuronal nuclei of the hippocampal CA-3 field reduces. The acceleration of the CRTA elaboration occurring during the action of ECA is accompanied by a drastic increase of the protein content in the neuronal nuclei of the CA-3 field. The ECA administration to the rats of the active control groups to which were presented the same number of unpaired conditioned and unconditioned stimuli as during the CRTA elaboration also enhances the protein content in the neurons of the CA-3 field. The rats of all investigated groups in the neurons of the CA-1 field display no such significant shifts. The conclusion has been drawn that ECA produces a regulating influence on protein metabolism in hippocampal neurons depending on their functional state.
