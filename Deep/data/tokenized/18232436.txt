Autobiographical memories of one case (Y.K.) were assessed before and after onset of hippocampal amnesia. He was a 56-yr.-old male patient who used to work in an office. The findings can be described as follows. First, Y.K.'s recognition performance regarding his premorbid and postmorbid personal semantics along with premorbid autobiographical incidents was significantly greater than chance, and recognition of premorbid autobiographical incidents was within chance. Given information before onset, a relationship was suspected between frontal lobe dysfunction and Y.K.'s autobiographical problem. The possibility that an amnesic patient could acquire semantic information after onset is discussed.
