This chapter has highlighted how correlates of neuronal plasticity such as electrophysiological responsiveness and changes in gene expression may be examined in defined CNS regions as well as in single cells. The ability to simultaneously measure the mRNA levels for hundreds of different genes, to clone novel genes, and to characterize the physiology and morphology of the cell promises to provide insight into molecular mechanisms of plasticity. The importance of understanding how one gene product changes relative to another (coordinated changes) as well as subcellular distribution of mRNAs cannot be overstated. It is only through an analysis of both the molecular and cellular processes associated with plasticity that a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of neuronal plasticity can be gained.
