The conversion of normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) into its pathogenic isoform (PrPSc) is an essential event in prion pathogenesis. In culture models, membrane rafts are suggested to play a critical role in PrPSc formation. To identify the candidate molecules capable of interacting with PrPC and facilitating PrPSc formation in membrane rafts, we applied a novel biochemical labelling method termed 'enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources (EMARS)'. EMARS was applied to the Lubrol WX insoluble detergent-resistant membrane fractions from mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells in which the surface PrPC was labeled with HRP-conjugated anti-PrP antibody. Two-dimensional Western blots of these preparations revealed biotinylated spots of approximately 20 kDa with an isoelectric point of 8.0-9.0. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis resulted in the identification of peptides containing SCG10, the neuron-specific microtubule regulator. Proximity of SCG10 and PrPC was confirmed using proximity ligation assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Transfection of persistently 22L prion infected N2a cells with SCG10 small interfering RNA reduced SCG10 expression but did not prevent PrPSc accumulation, indicating that SCG10 appears to be unrelated to PrPSc formation of 22L prion. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses showed reduced levels of SCG10 in the hippocampus of prion-infected mice, suggesting a possible association between SCG10 levels and the prion neuropathogenesis.
