Isolated memory disorders occur after bilateral involvement of thalamus. Anterograde amnesia is not complete; retrograde amnesia is always severe. Four groups of thalamic nuclei may be affected: anterior nuclei; midline nuclei, medialis dorsalis nuclei; intralaminar nuclei. A pathophysiologic interpretation is proposed. Three kinds of memory processes may be involved: consolidating process that leads to the formation of memory traces (anterior nuclei, midline nuclei); retrieving process that leads to the activation of memory traces (intralaminar nuclei); temporal organizing process that regards ancient et recent memory traces (medialis dorsalis nuclei).
