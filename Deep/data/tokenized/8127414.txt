The in vivo effect of exogenous vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on the accumulation of cAMP in 21 microdissected brain nuclei was investigated 3 and 7 min after intraventricular injections in rats. VIP elicited significant (up to 20-fold) increases in cAMP levels. This effect is region specific varying considerably among the brain regions investigated. VIP dramatically increased the cAMP content of the lateral septal nucleus, several hypothalamic nuclei, the habenula, the midbrain central gray and the locus coeruleus. Smaller increases were observed elsewhere including some VIP-rich brain areas such as the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus.
