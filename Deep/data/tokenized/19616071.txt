The relationship between free radical and scavenger enzymes has been found in the epileptic phenomena and reactive oxygen species have been implicated in seizure-induced neurodegeneration. Using the epilepsy model obtained by systemic administration of pilocarpine in rats, we investigated the lipid peroxidation, nitrite content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities in the hippocampus of rats during chronic period. The enzyme activities as well as the lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentrations were measured using spectrophotometric methods and the results compared to values obtained from saline-treated animals. The superoxide dismutase and catalase activities increased during the chronic phase. In addition, lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels increased in same period in the hippocampus of animals observed during spontaneous recurrent seizures. Previous studies showed that animals presenting seizures and submitted to 24h of status epilepticus showed normal levels of superoxide dismutase and increased in catalase activities as well as an increase in hippocampal lipid peroxidation and nitrite concentrations. These results show a direct evidence of lipid peroxidation and nitrite during seizure activity that could be responsible for neuronal damage in the hippocampus of rats, during the establishment of pilocarpine model of epilepsy.
