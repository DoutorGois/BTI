Angiotensin II (ANG II) was estimated by radioimmunoassay in extracts of rat brain. In extracts of whole brain the mean content was 108 +/- 16 fmol/g and estimates of ANG II in kidney and plasma were similar to previous reports. A regional distribution of ANG II was determined. Hippocampus had the highest concentration and cortex the lowest. The concentrations relative to cortex were: hippocampus, 8; striatum, 5; cerebellum, 4; hypothalamus:thalamus:septum:midbrain (HTSM), 3; and medulla, 3.
