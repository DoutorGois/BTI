Regulation of neural (N-) cadherin expression in the hippocampus was examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry methods in the rat model of kainic acid (KA) induced seizures. After 12 and 24 h of KA administration, mRNA expression level of N-cadherin decreased in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 area in parallel with decrease of the number of neural cells. In contrast, after 48 h and 7 days, mRNA expression level recovered partially, although the number of neural cells remained small. In addition, immunohistochemical staining indicated that N-cadherin protein expression of survived neurons increased significantly after 48 h of KA administration. These results indicated that N-cadherin might be involved in neuronal reconstruction at the hippocampus.
