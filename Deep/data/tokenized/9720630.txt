The in-vitro pharmacological properties of (2,3-dioxo-7-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-quinoxal inyl)-acetic acid monohydrate, YM872, a novel and highly water-soluble alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)-receptor antagonist were investigated. YM872 is highly water soluble (83 mg mL(-1) in Britton-Robinson buffer) compared with 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX), 6-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)-7-nitro-2,3(1H,4H)-quinoxalinedione hydrochloride (YM90K) or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). YM872 potently inhibits [3H]AMPA binding with a Ki (apparent equilibrium dissociation constant) value of 0.096 +/- 0.0024 microM. However, YM872 had very low affinity for other ionotropic glutamate receptors, as measured by competition with [3H]kainate (high-affinity kainate binding site, concentration resulting in half the maximum inhibition (IC50) = 4.6 +/- 0.14 microM), [3H]glutamate (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glutamate binding site, IC50 > 100 microM) and [3H]glycine (NMDA receptor glycine-binding site, IC50 > 100 microM). YM872 competitively antagonized kainate-induced currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes which express rat AMPA receptors, with a pA2 value of 6.97 +/- 0.01. In rat hippocampal primary cultures, YM872 blocked a 20-microM AMPA-induced increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration with an IC50 value of 0.82 +/- 0.031 microM, and blocked 300-microM kainate-induced neurotoxicity with an IC50 value of 1.02 microM. These results show that YM872 is a potent and highly water-soluble AMPA antagonist with great potential for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as stroke.
