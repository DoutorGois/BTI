Electron microscopy was used to study intracellular changes in the dorsal hippocampus, lateral hypothalamic nucleus and pontine reticular formation of rats after 96-hour paradoxical sleep deprivation. It was found that compensative-accommodative processes predominate in the majority of neurons. At the same time destructive changes are detected in some cells. In changed neurons the ultrastructural signs of damage to protein-synthesizing apparatus were observed. These changes can be as a result of disturbances of protein biosynthesis.
