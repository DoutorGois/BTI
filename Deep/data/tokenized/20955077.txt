Cell therapy using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seems to be a new alternative for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Despite several promising results with their use, possible side effects are still unknown. In a previous work, we have shown that MSC-conditioned medium is toxic to hippocampal slice cultures and aggravates cell death induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation. In this work, we investigated whether the inflammatory response and/or reactive species formation could be involved in that toxicity. Rat organotypic hippocampal cultures were exposed for 24 h to conditioned medium from MSCs isolated from rat bone marrow. A marked glial activation was observed after exposure of cultures to MSC-conditioned medium, as evidenced by glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and isolectin B(4) increase. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 levels were increased in the culture medium, and 2,7-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate oxidation (indicating reactive species generation) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunocontent were also higher after exposure of cultures to MSC-conditioned medium. Antioxidants (ascorbic acid and TROLOX((R))), N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, and anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin and dexamethasone) reduced cell death in hippocampal organotypic cultures after their exposure to MSC-conditioned medium. The results obtained here suggest that MSC-secreted factors trigger reactive species generation and neuroinflammation in organotypic cultures of hippocampus, introducing a note of caution in the use of these cells for neurological application.
