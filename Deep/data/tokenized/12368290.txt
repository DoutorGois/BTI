Trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors to and from the postsynaptic membrane plays an important role in regulating transmission at excitatory synapses. AMPA receptor subunits contain a large extracellular N-terminal domain that is important for receptor assembly (). To further investigate the determinants of receptor assembly and surface expression, we have epitope-tagged the N-terminal domain of the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR1, and expressed it in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and hippocampal neurons. Full-length GluR1 was readily detected on the cell surface in both cell types. However, surface expression was profoundly decreased by deletion or replacement of nine amino acids in the extreme N terminus. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that the mutant GluR1 in which this sequence was deleted still interacts with GluR2, suggesting that mutant GluR1 is capable of at least partial assembly into heteromeric structures. The mutant forms of GluR1 co-localize with an endoplasmic reticulum marker suggesting that they are retained in this structure. These results suggest a specific function of a short sequence present in the N-terminal domain in controlling anterograde trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors.
