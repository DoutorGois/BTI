Modulation of CA1 evoked electrophysiological properties (amplitude, latency, paired-pulse facilitation) by different concentrations of aldosterone (ALDO), spironolactone (SPI), and corticosterone (CT) was studied in hippocampal slice preparation from BALB/c mice. ALDO (5 nM) induced a prolonged increase of the population spike (PS) amplitude with a decrease of its latency and of the paired pulse facilitation. The same effect was observed with a solution of CT (0.5 nM) alone or combined with ALDO (0.5 nM), but no effect was observed with a solution of combined CT (0.5 nM) and SPI (500 nM). Implication of corticosteroid receptors in this response was discussed.
