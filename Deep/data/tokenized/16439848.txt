Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) are expressed in specific regions of the central nervous system during early human development. They may consequently influence aspects of cognition, or emotional and behavioural adjustment from childhood to adulthood, in conditions associated with abnormalities of the somatotropic axis. GH receptors are relatively common within hippocampal and perihippocampal regions that are primarily involved in declarative memory for facts and events. They are also located in structures (e.g. the putamen) that are involved in the processing of social perceptions. IGF-I receptors have been discovered in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, which contribute to the neural circuits known as the 'social brain'. The evaluation of emotional, social and behavioural adjustment among children who have deficiencies in GH or IGF-I functional integrity requires the objective assessment of their social-cognitive competence. We describe a computerized test battery, the Schedules for the Assessment of Social Intelligence (SASI), which has been shown to possess excellent psychometric properties in terms of reliability and validity. The SASI, which can be used by both children and adults, may provide new evidence for deficits and treatment effects of GH/IGF-I on emotional, behavioural and cognitive functions.
