Serotonin increased the isoproterenol-induced cyclic AMP accumulation in rat brain cortical slices but did not itself stimulate the production of cyclic AMP in this area. This effect appeared to be inhibited by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ritanserin. This potentiation was not observed in the hippocampus. These data reinforce the hypothesis of a coupling between the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, which may be involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs.
