Autoradiography was used to measure regional brainstem blood flow in Wistar rats following permanent left anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) occlusion. With the AICA occluded, blood flow to the left vestibular nucleus decreased 31% while flow to the left cochlear nucleus decreased 47% when compared to the right (unobstructed) side. In the rat, the median pontine branch of the basilar artery was found to provide the principal blood supply to the vestibular nucleus. Electrocochleography was also used to measure the action potential (AP), summating potential (SP) and cochlear microphonics (CM) during left AICA occlusion. The AP disappeared completely after at least 7 min, while the SP polarity changed from negative to positive. Findings also showed that CM2 did not disappear completely in pre-mortem animals.
