OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of oxysophoridine (OSR) on glutamate (Glu) and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) immuno-reaction positive neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of rats. METHOD: Immunohistochemistry method (SABC) and the micrographic analysis technique were employed to monitor the effect of OSR in the variations of Glu and GABA immunoreaction positive neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of rats. RESULT: OSR administrated icv (10 mg) significantly increased the number of GABA immuno-reaction positive neurons while decreasing the number of glu immunoreaction positive neurons in cortex and hippocampus in rats (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Results showed that the change of Glu and GABA caused by OSR may responsible for its inhibitory effects on the central nervous system.
