Hypothermia after resuscitation from cardiac arrest reduces functional and histological brain injury. Stimulation of neurotrophic factors may contribute to the beneficial effects of hypothermia. This study examined the effects of cardiac arrest and induced hypothermia on regional levels of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) over the first 24 h after rat cardiac arrest. Hypothermia increased GDNF in hippocampus at 6 h, but did not prevent a subsequent decline in hippocampal GDNF. In contrast, hypothermia prevented early increases in cortical levels of GDNF at 3 and 6 h. Cerebellar GDNF increased slightly over 24 h in hypothermia-treated rats, but brainstem levels of GDNF did not change in response to cardiac arrest or hypothermia. These results suggest that temperature after resuscitation produces regionally specific changes of GNDF levels in brain.
