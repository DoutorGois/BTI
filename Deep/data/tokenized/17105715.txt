Anxiety and its disorders have long been known to be familial. Anxiety levels are associated with low social connectedness and high environmental threats. Studies provide evidence that anxiety disorders may be link to malfunctioning of serotonin neurotransmission. The present study is designed to monitor serotonin-1A (5-HT-1A) receptor responsiveness following subchronic administration of a serotonergic anxiolytic buspirone. Administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg produced comparable syndrome in repeated saline and repeated buspirone injected rats. Cage crossings were significantly lower in repeatedly buspirone injected rats. Decreases in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were higher in saline than buspirone injected rats. Result suggests that following long term administration of buspirone somatodendritic and postsynaptic 5-HT-1A receptors are desensitized. Role of serotonin 1A receptors in the treatment of anxiety is discussed.
