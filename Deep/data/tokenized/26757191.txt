BACKGROUND: Simvastatin (SV) has been reported to improve dementia and slow progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), however there are conflicting reports. OBJECTIVE & METHODS: Intracerebroventricular injection of aggregated Abeta1-42 in mice (Abeta1-42-mice) caused spatial cognitive deficits, long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment, and death of hippocampal pyramidal cells. The present study focused on exploring the dose-dependent effects of SV (10-80 mg/kg) on Abeta1-42-impaired spatial memory and the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The treatment of Abeta1-42-mice with SV for continuous 15 days could attenuate the spatial cognitive deficits and recover the LTP induction in a "U" type dose-dependent manner. The death of pyramidal cells in Abeta1-42-mice was significantly reduced by the SV-treatment at 20 mg/kg, but not at a dose of 10 or 40 mg/kg, even was aggravated at a dose of 80 mg/kg. Hippocampal NMDA receptor (NMDAr) NR2B phosphorylation (phospho-NR2B) was elevated in Abeta1-42-mice, which was further dose-dependently increased by SV-treatment. Replenishment of isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by applying farnesol (FOH) could abolish the SV-increased phospho-NR2B in Abeta1-42-mice, but had no effect on the Abeta1-42-enhanced phospho-NR2B. NMDAr antagonist blocked the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-42 and SV (80 mg/kg) in Abeta1-42-mice, whereas FOH only inhibited SV (80 mg/kg)-neurotoxicity. The SV-treatment in Abeta1-42-mice corrected the decrease in hippocampal Akt phosphorylation. The PI3K inhibitor abolished the SV (20 mg/kg)-neuroprotection in Abeta1-42-mice. CONCLUSION: SV-treatment in Abeta1-42-mice exerts dose-dependent neuroprotection and neurotoxicity by reducing FPP to enhance the phosphorylation of NR2B and Akt.
