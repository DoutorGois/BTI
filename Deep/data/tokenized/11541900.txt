The effects of a 2G force environment on synaptic plasticity were examined in the rat hippocampus. Field potentials from neurons in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer were evoked by stimulation of the afferent Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers in an in vitro slice preparation. Input-output (I-O) relationships of the circuit were determined before and after tetanizing stimuli given to induce long term potentiation (LTP), a form of neural plasticity. I-O curves from animals exposed to 2G via centrifugation for either 2 or 14 days were not different from those obtained in control (1G) animals. Similarly, induction of LTP was equivalent in all groups, showing increases in maximum amplitude, slope and midpoint response of the fitted Boltzmann functions compared to un-tetanized controls. Comparison of slices from dorsal and ventral hippocampus showed the location of the slice had no effect of LTP expression. We conclude that, in contrast to other reports of functional changes in the central nervous system under altered force environments, cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, which may underlie learning and memory, are preserved in the hippocampus.
