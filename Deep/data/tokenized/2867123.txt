A radioiodinated analogue of somatostatin 28, 125I [Leu8,D-Trp22,Tyr25] SS-28, was used to localize and characterize somatostatin binding sites in both human and monkey brain. High-affinity binding sites (approximately 1 nM) were found in cerebral cortex. The highest binding was in cerebral cortex with intermediate binding found in hippocampus, striatum, and amygdala and low binding in hypothalamus and brainstem. There was a rough correlation between somatostatin receptor binding and concentrations of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in human brain. Somatostatin receptors were stable for up to 24 h in an animal model simulating human autopsy conditions and there was no correlation between postmortem interval and receptor binding in human brain. Pharmacologic characterization in human cortex showed that there was a correlation between the inhibition of receptor binding by somatostatin analogues and their known abilities to inhibit growth hormone secretion. These findings demonstrate that a highly specific membrane-associated receptor for somatostatin is present in both monkey and human brain. Examination of somatostatin receptor binding in Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease may improve understanding of the role of somatostatin in both these illnesses.
