The expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) varies across brain regions and changes with age and according to the previous history of estradiol exposure. ERalpha is regulated by a number of mechanisms including the level of mRNA (Esr1) expression. For this study, we took advantage of regional differences in hippocampal ERalpha expression to investigate DNA ERalpha promoter methylation at CpG dinucleotide sites as a potential epigenetic mechanism for regulating gene expression. Young and aged female Fischer 344 rats were ovariectomized, and Esr1 expression and ERalpha promoter methylation were examined in hippocampal regions CA1 and CA3, either 3 or 14 weeks following surgery. The results indicate that reduced Esr1 expression in region CA1 relative to CA3 was associated with an increase in DNA methylation in region CA1, particularly for the first CpG site. Additionally, differential methylation of distal CpG sites, 11-17, was associated with altered Esr1 expression during aging or following long-term hormone deprivation. The results support the idea that methylation of site 1 may be the primary regulatory region for cross-regional patterns in ERalpha expression, while distal sites are modifiable across the life span and may act as a feedback mechanism for ERalpha activity.
