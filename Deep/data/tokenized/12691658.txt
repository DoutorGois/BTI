The question of whether the hippocampus plays a selective role in episodic memory or a more general role in both episodic and semantic memory (together termed declarative memory) is an unresolved and much-debated topic in the current literature. In two back-to-back articles in this issue of Neuron, Squire and his colleagues describe findings from a group of six patients with damage thought to be limited to the hippocampus. The reported findings provide new evidence toward resolving this much-debated controversy.
