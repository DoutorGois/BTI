When you suspect that you just gave an erroneous answer to a question you stop and rethink. Suspected errors lead to a shift in the control and content of cognitive processes. In the present experiment we investigated the influence of errors upon heart rates and response latencies. Sixty-four subjects participated in an experiment in which each subject solved a sequence of 60 verbal analogies. The results demonstrated increased latencies after errors and decelerated heart rates during the post-error period. The results were explained by a psychophysiological model in which the septo-hippocampal system functions as a control system which coordinates the priority and selection of cognitive processes. Error detection suppresses strategies which otherwise prevent looping and iterative reanalyses of old material. The inhibition is also responsible for the cardiac slowing during the post-error period.
