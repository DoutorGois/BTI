Phasic changes in the bioelectrical activity of the dorsal hippocampus (field CA3), the mesencephalic reticular formation, and several regions of the neocortex and the reticulo-cortical evoked potentials were measured under conditions of the action of prolonged vibration (3 months) in electrophysiological experiments with rabbits. Daily three-hour vibration during the first month of the experiment evoked an activation reaction in the EEG, characterized by a desynchronization effect in the neocortex and hippocampus and by the stabilization of the v rhythm in the mesencephalic reticular formation. Noted against this background was a certain facilitation in the reticulo-cortical evoked potentials, more pronounced in the neocortex, and a decline in the ascending activational influence of the mesencephalic reticular formation. The three-month action of vibration exerted an inhibitory influence on reticulo-cortical interrelationships, expressed in a decline in the compound bioelectrical activity of the cortex and subcortical formations, the excitability of the mesencephalic reticular formation, and the suppression of reticulo-cortical evoked potentials. At the same time an elongation of the latent periods of the positive phases of the evoked potentials, a decline in their amplitude, and a reduction of the negative phase in limbic structures was noted. The question of the physiological mechanism of development of vibrational pathology is discussed.
