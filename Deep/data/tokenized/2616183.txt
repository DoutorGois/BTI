Limbic structures including the hippocampus are thought to be involved in pain though not much is known of their neuronal responses to noxious stimuli. In this report we show that a prolonged and substantial depression of the dorsal hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell population spike is produced by a brief but intense noxious stimulus applied to the tail of lightly anaesthetized rats. This depression is temperature-dependent and habituates to subsequent noxious stimuli applied more than 1 h later. Further, the depression is absent when noxious heat is applied in the presence of hippocampal theta rhythm.
