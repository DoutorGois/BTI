PURPOSE: We demonstrate the establishment and characterization of a novel virus infection-induced seizure model in C57BL/6 mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) or mock infected. Mice were followed for seizures, weight change, body temperature, motor function (righting reflex, rotorod) and neurological manifestations (inflammation [perivascular cuffing], pyknotic neurons, transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta expression). RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice are susceptible to seizures induced by TMEV infection. Approximately 50% of C57BL/6 mice develop transient afebrile seizures. Motor function and coordination are impaired in seized mice. Pyramidal neuron pyknosis and TGF-beta expression correlate with seizure activity in the hippocampus. DISCUSSION: The characterization of this model will enable the investigation of viral and immune contributions in the central nervous system to the development of seizure disorders in humans.
