The objectives of the present study were to illustrate three-dimensional hippocampal surface anatomy using deformation-based composite segmentations, superimposed on two-dimensional MRI (magnetic resonance images) in standard and oblique planes. The hippocampi from five normal volumetric MRI studies were segmented using a semiautomated, deformation-based technique. Segmentations were then processed to combine hippocampal surfaces, generating a composite (or average) deformation for each of the five left and five right hippocampi. Composite hippocampal surfaces were then projected on two-dimensional MRIs, with verification of projections using three-dimensional coordinate data. Composite hippocampal surfaces show anatomical details of hippocampal substructures, including the pes hippocampi, intralimbic gyrus, and uncinate gyrus. Projection on two-dimensional MRI helps to define hippocampal anatomy in relationship to surrounding structures. Composite images highlight specific features of normal hippocampal surface anatomy, and demonstrate the structural relationship of the hippocampus to surrounding structures on MRI.
