The redistribution of glutamate and GABA in postischemic brains was examined immunocytochemically using the gerbil model of unilateral 1 h cerebral ischemia. In the cerebral neocortex, the majority of neurons underwent recovery processes after 5 h of recirculation, while neurons in the hippocampus were irreversibly damaged. Glutamate-like immunoreactivity (LI) was highly increased in the degenerating hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells after recirculation, while in the neocortex and the hippocampal CA1 sector, the pyramidal cells showed only slightly increased glutamate-LI. GABA-LI-positive punctae in the neuropil, corresponding to neuronal processes of GABAergic neurons, were accentuated after recirculation both in the cerebral neocortex and the hippocampus. Although the astrocytes on the nonischemic side showed neither glutamate-LI nor GABA-LI, the swollen astrocytes and their foot processes, which were observed after recirculation, often showed strong glutamate-LI and GABA-LI. These data suggest (1) the accumulation of glutamate or glutamate-like substances, especially in the CA3 pyramidal cells, (2) the excitation of the GABAergic neurons and their subsequent uptake of GABA, and (3) the sequestration of the extracellular neurotransmitters by astrocytes in the postischemic period.
