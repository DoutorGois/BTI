Early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by synaptic dysfunction, a phenomenon in which soluble oligomers of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) are implicated. Here, we demonstrated that astrocytes express NMDARs and therefore have the potential to modulate the synaptotoxic actions of Abeta. We found that specific pharmacological antagonism of two of the major NMDAR subunits, GluN2A and GluN2B, exacerbates Abeta-induced synaptotoxicity suggesting, for the first time, that astrocytic GluN2A and GluN2B mediate synaptoprotection. From the perspective of the pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, in which Abeta and NMDAR play significant roles, these observations are striking since neuronal GluN2A and GluN2B are well known modulators of neurodegeneration. We did initial studies to understand the basis for the differential effects of astrocytic and neuronal GluN2A and GluN2B in the promotion of synapse survival, and identified a neurotrophin produced by astrocytes, nerve growth factor beta (beta-NGF), as a likely mediator of the synaptoprotective effects of astrocytic GluN2A and GluN2B activation. The results presented suggest that astrocytes may be suitable druggable targets for the prevention and/or delay of the synaptic loss that occurs during early stages of AD.
