OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of health Qigong Wuqinxi exercise on mild depression in college students and analyze the changes in hydrogen proton magnetic resonance spectra ((1)H-MRS) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus after the exercise. METHODS: Fifty-eight volunteer college students, including 30 with mild depression and 28 healthy students, were randomized into the intervention group and non-intervention group. The students in the intervention group were asked to practice health Qigong Wuqinxi training for 12 weeks and those in the non-intervention group did not engage in such training. For each subject, BECK Depression Self-reported questionnaire (BDI), Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAMD) score, and the metabolic parameters of (1)H-MRS in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were evaluated before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Before the intervention, the scores of BDI and HAMD in the depression group were significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.01), and were lowered obviously after the 12-week intervention (P<0.01). Compared with the control group, (1)H-MRS in the depression group before intervention showed significantly increased NAA/Cr value in the left prefrontal cortex, Cho/Cr value in the bilateral hippocampus and the left frontal lobe, and Cho/Cr value of the left hippocampus and right frontal lobe (P<0.05) with significantly lowered NAA/Cho value in the bilateral prefrontal and Cho/NAA value in the right hippocampus (P<0.05). After 12 weeks of intervention, NAA/Cr value in the bilateral hippocampus and the NAA/Cho value in the right hippocampus were significantly lowered (P<0.05), and NAA/Cho value in the right prefrontal and Cho/NAA value in the right hippocampus were significantly increased (P<0.05) in the depression group. Before the intervention, Pearson correlation analysis showed that the scores of HAMD and BDI were positively correlated with Cho/Cr value in the hippocampus and NAA/Cr value in prefrontal lobe (P<0.01) and inversely with NAA/Cho in prefrontal lobe and Cho/NAA value in the hippocampus (P<0.05); after the intervention, the scores of HAMD and BDI were positively correlated with NAA/Cr value in the hippocampus and Cho/Cr value in the left hippocampus (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Exercise of health Qigong Wuqinxi can reduce depression scale scores in patients with mild depression and improve the metabolic indexes (NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr values) in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.
