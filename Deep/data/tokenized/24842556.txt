3,3'-Iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), one of the nitrile derivatives, can induce neurotoxicity, and therefore cause motor dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Gastrodin is a main bioactive constituent of a Chinese herbal medicine (Gastrodia elata Blume) widely used for treating various neurological disorders and showed greatly improved mental function. This study was designed to determine whether administration of gastrodin attenuates IDPN-induced working memory deficits in Y-maze task, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that exposure to IDPN (150 mg/kg/day, v.o.) significantly impaired working memory and that long-term gastrodin (200 mg/kg/day, v.o.) could effectively rescue these IDPN-induced memory impairments as indicated by increased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze test. Additionally, gastrodin treatment prevented IDPN-induced reductions of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, as well as elevation of dopamine turnover ratio (DOPAC + HVA)/DA. Gastrodin treatment also prevented alterations in dopamine D2 receptor and dopamine transporter protein levels in the rat hippocampus. Our results suggest that long-term gastrodin treatment may have potential therapeutic values for IDPN-induced cognitive impairments, which was mediated, in part, by normalizing the dopaminergic system.
