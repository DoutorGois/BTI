Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) has been shown to play an important role in spatial memory formation, but the molecular mechanism underlying this effect of SGK1 was not known. zif268 is an immediate early gene that is induced by water maze learning. To investigate the role of SGK1 in the regulation of zif268 expression, the dominant negative mutant of SGK1, SGK1 S422A, was infused to the hippocampal CA1 area of rats, and was found to decrease significantly the mRNA level of zif268 in both naive animals and trained animals. SGK1 was also found to phosphorylate serum response factor (SRF) at Ser73, Ser75, and Ser99, and phosphorylate CREB1 at Ser133. Inhibition of SGK1 phosphorylation sites on SRF and CREB1 with alanine substitution significantly diminished SGK1-enhanced zif268 expression in the promoter-luciferase assay. SGK1 also phosphorylates Elk-1 and SGK1 phosphorylation of Elk-1 decreased the transcriptional activity of Elk-1. But SGK1 phosphorylation of Elk-1 did not affect SGK1-enhanced zif268 expression. Moreover, the phosphorylation of SGK1 was increased in rat CA1 area after water maze learning, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of SRF at Ser99 and increased phosphorylation of CREB1 at Ser133. All these effects were antagonized by SGK1 S422A transfection. These results together suggest that SGK1 enhances zif268 expression through the mediation of SRF and CREB1, and these signaling pathways are associated with spatial memory formation in rats.
