Purpose/aim of the study: Neonatal seizures are the most frequent type of neurological disorder, and those newborn babies that experience seizures carry an increased risk of epileptogenesis and other long-term morbidities. The aims of this review were to summarize the different effects on hippocampal neurogenesis between neonatal seizures and adult seizures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pubmed, Medline and Cochrane Library were searched for articles that examined the aberrant plasticity in the hippocampus after neonatal seizures. RESULTS: Different from the adult animals, the proliferation of newly formed dentate granule cells is reduced in the acute phase and enhanced in the chronic phase after neonatal seizures. Neonatal seizures cause less ectopic migration of newborn neurons. Recurrent neonatal seizures also switch the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor activation from inhibition to excitation, which may contribute to increased seizure susceptibility. Similar to adult seizures, mossy fiber sprouting and sprouting of basal dendrites had been seen after neonatal seizures. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of seizures on neurogenesis in the hippocampus are age-dependent.
