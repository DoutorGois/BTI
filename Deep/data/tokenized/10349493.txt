To investigate the relationship between the hippocampal [symbol: see text] activity (or Rhythmical Slow Activity, RSA) and the hippocampal serotonergic activity during spontaneous behavior, simultaneous recordings of i) hippocampal EEG, ii) sleep-wake activity, and iii) hippocampal levels of the serotonin (5-HT) metabolite 5-hydroxyndolacetic acid (5-HIAA--measured by in vivo voltammetry and infrared telemetry) were performed. The results show that hippocampal type 1 RSA recorded during wakefulness and voluntary movements (such as walking), is positively correlated to hippocampal 5-HIAA levels. Since in the experimental conditions used in the study, 5-HIAA levels are a reliable index of 5-HT release, the results support the hypothesis that hippocampal type 1 RSA is generated by a serotonergic mechanism. In contrast, hippocampal type 2 RSA recorded during desynchronized sleep is negatively correlated with 5-HT release, suggesting a different neurochemical mechanism for its production. These results also show that, in the experimental condition of this study, hippocampal RSA power spectrum has a main peak frequency of 3.5 during wakefulness, and of 6.5 Hz during desynchronized sleep.
