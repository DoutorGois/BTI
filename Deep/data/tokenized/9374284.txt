To investigate the correlation between neural activity and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) mobilization in immature and adult brain during ischemia (hypoxia and glucose deprivation) and deprivation of glucose, hippocampal slices were prepared from 7-, 10-day-old and adult rats. Population spikes (PS) and antidromic responses (AR) were recorded in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 area as an index of neural function. [Ca2+]i mobilization of the stratum radiatum in the CA1 area was measured using the fluorescent dye fura-2 AM. The rise in [Ca2+]i occurred earlier in the adult animal and the decay times for the orthodromic PS and antidromic responses were shorter in the adult during ischemia. The field potentials and antidromic responses decreased substantially prior to the elevation of [Ca2+]i in both developing and adult brains. Furthermore, ATP levels decreased substantially before the elevation of [Ca2+]i during ischemia. These results suggest that neural activity and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in the immature rats brain are more resistant to energy failure than adult rats and that neuronal activity in the developing and adult brain is impaired initially by energy depletion during ischemia. In the immature animal, during glucose deprivation, the antidromic responses were slowly decayed or even failed to extinguish and [Ca2+]i levels were maintained for a longer period or even failed to rise in spite of the rapid loss of PS. Furthermore, ATP levels were well preserved at the time of PS loss. These results agree well with our previous reports showing that glucose plays an important role in the preservation of synaptic transmission in addition to its major function as an energy substrate.
