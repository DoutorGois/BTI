We have shown that bifemelane augments long-term potentiation in the mossy fiber-CA3 system, but not in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 system. To elucidate the mechanism of action of bifemelane in relation to pathway-specific augmentation of long-term potentiation, we prepared a mossy fiber terminal-rich synaptosomal fraction (P3) from guinea-pig hippocampus and investigated the effect of bifemelane on the release of glutamate from these synaptosomes, using an in vitro superfusion technique. Bifemelane (0.01-1 microM) dose dependently increased the 30 mM K(+)-evoked release of glutamate from the P3 fraction, without affecting glutamate release from a conventional synaptosomal P2 fraction. This stimulatory effect of 1 microM bifemelane was abolished by 100 microM H-7, which also suppressed the increase in K(+)-evoked glutamate release by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (1 microM). Bifemelane (1 microM) induced the translocation of protein kinase C activity from cytosol to membrane in the P3 fraction (which contains large and irregular-shaped synaptosomes probably derived from mossy fiber terminals), but not in the P2 fraction. These findings suggest that bifemelane directly acts on mossy fiber terminals to potentiate depolarization-induced glutamate release, which may be at least partly mediated by the translocation (activation) of protein kinase C.
