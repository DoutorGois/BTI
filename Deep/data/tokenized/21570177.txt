Previous studies demonstrate that the exposure to titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2) NPs) damages the central nervous system of mice; however, very little is known about the effects of TiO(2) NPs on hippocampal apoptosis or its molecular mechanism. The present study investigated the molecular mechanism associated with hippocampal apoptosis in mice induced by intragastric administration of TiO(2) NPs for consecutive 60 days. Our findings indicate that TiO(2) NPs accumulate in the mouse hippocampus, and this accumulation, in turn, led to hippocampal apoptosis and impairment in spatial recognition memory in mice. In addition, TiO(2) NPs significantly activated caspase-3 and -9, inhibited Bcl-2, and promoted the levels of Bax and cytochrome c. Furthermore, TiO(2) NPs induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the mouse hippocampus. These findings suggest that TiO(2) NP-induced apoptosis in the mouse hippocampus may result from an intrinsic pathway, and workers and consumers should take great caution when handling nanomaterials.
