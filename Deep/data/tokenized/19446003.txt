2-Deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) administration causes transient depletion of glucose derivates and ATP. Hence, it can be used in a model system to study the effects of a mild glycoprivic brain insult mimicking transient hypoglycemia, which often occurs when insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents are administered for diabetes control. In the present study, the effect of a single 2-DG application (500mg/kg, a clinically applicable dose) on glial reactivity and neurogenesis in adult rat hippocampus was examined, as well as a possible temporal correlation between these two phenomena. Post-insult (PI) glial reactivity time course was assessed by immunoreaction against glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) during the following 5 consecutive days. A clear increase of GFAP immunoreactivity in hilus was observed from 48 to 96h PI. Moreover, enhanced labeling of long radial processes in the granule cell layer adjacent to hilus was evidenced. On the other hand, a transient increase of progenitor cell proliferation was detected in the subgranular zone, prominently at 48h PI, coinciding with the temporal peak of glial activation. This increase resulted in an augment of neuroblasts double labeled with 5-bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and with double cortin (DCX) at day 7 PI. Around half of these cells survived 28 days showing matured neuronal phenotype double labeled by BrdU and a neuronal specific nuclear protein marker (NeuN). These findings suggest that a transient neuroglycoprivic state exerts a short-term effect on glial activation that possibly triggers a long-term effect on neurogenesis in hippocampus.
