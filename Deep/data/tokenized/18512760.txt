Asphyxia during delivery produces long-term deficits in brain development, including hippocampus. We investigated hippocampal plasticity after perinatal asphyxia, measuring postnatal apoptosis and neurogenesis. Asphyxia was performed by immersing rat fetuses with uterine horns removed from ready-to-deliver rats into a water bath for 20 min. Caesarean-delivered pups were used as controls. The animals were euthanized 1 week or 1 month after birth. Apoptotic nuclear morphology and DNA breaks were assessed by Hoechst and TUNEL assays. Neurogenesis was estimated by bromodeoxyuridine/MAP-2 immunocytochemistry, and the levels and expression of proteins related to apoptosis and cell proliferation were measured by Western blots and in situ hybridization, respectively. There was an increase of apoptosis in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) and cell proliferation and neurogenesis in CA1, DG, and hilus regions of hippocampus 1 week after asphyxia. The increase of apoptosis in CA3 and cell proliferation in the suprapyramidal band of DG was still observed 1 month following asphyxia. There was an increase of BAD, BCL-2, ERK2, and bFGF levels in whole hippocampus and bFGF expression in CA1 and CA2 and hilus at P7 and P30. There was a concomitant decrease of phosphorylated-BAD (Ser112) levels. The increase of BAD levels supports the idea of delayed cell death after perinatal asphyxia, whereas the increases of BCL-2, ERK2, and bFGF levels suggest the activation of neuroprotective and repair pathways. In conclusion, perinatal asphyxia induces short- and long-term regionally specific plastic changes, including delayed cell death and neurogenesis, involving pro- and antiapoptotic as well as mitogenic proteins, favoring hippocampal functional recovery.
