Ultrastructure of the CA1 zone in the rat dorsal hippocampus has been investigated after injection of actinomycin D into the cerebral lateral ventricles. Actinomycin D possesses a wider spectrum of action as it was previously thought. The data obtained make it possible to suppose that certain cerebral disturbances (in particular, memory), produced with actinomycin D, can be dependent on or stipulated by: decreased DNA synthesis in the neuronal nuclei, disorder of RNA synthesis in neurons and astrocytes, damage of the protein synthesis apparatus only in neurons with a dense granular endoplasmic reticulum, decreasing contents of functionally active neurons, possessing a loose granular endoplasmic reticulum, decreasing production of energy by mitochondria of synapses, neurons and astrocytes.
