The binding properties of ligands specific for two subclasses of glutamate receptors were studied by quantitative autoradiography after one hour of acute immobilization/shock stress. [3H]N-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)-3,4-piperidine (TCP) and [3H]alpha-amino-3-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) were used to visualize the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the AMPA/quisqualate receptor types, respectively. While no change was observed in the binding properties of the [3H]TCP, [3H]AMPA binding was significantly increased in several areas of the hippocampus of acutely stressed rats relative to naive controls.
