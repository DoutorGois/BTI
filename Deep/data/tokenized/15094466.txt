Although ATP is reported to modulate synaptic plasticity, the mechanism of action of ATP on synaptic transmission is not fully understood. Here we show that ATP enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), and P2X receptor antagonists inhibit this ATP effect, but do not affect paired pulse facilitation (PPF) in rat hippocampal slices. ATP rapidly increases intracellular calcium, and P2X receptor antagonists inhibit this increase in cultured dissociated neurons. These results indicate that ATP enhances LTP via activation of postsynaptic P2X receptors. A pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein inhibitor significantly attenuates PPF, although it does not affect LTP, indicating that presynaptic P2Y receptors also play an important role in neuronal plasticity. We conclude that ATP modulates synaptic plasticity via dual effects on pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms.
