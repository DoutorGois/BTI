Proteomic analyses have revealed a novel synaptic proline-rich membrane protein: PRR7 (proline rich 7), in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction of rat forebrain. PRR7 is 269 amino acid residues long, and displays a unique architecture, composed of a very short N-terminal extracellular region, a single membrane spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic domain possessing a proline-rich sequence and a C-terminal type-1 PDZ binding motif. A fraction of PRR7 accumulates in spines along with synapse maturation, and colocalizes with PSD-95 in a punctate pattern in rat hippocampal neural cultures. Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays demonstrated that PRR7 binds to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95. In addition, the NMDA receptor subunits, NR1 and NR2B, specifically co-immunoprecipitated with PRR7. These results suggest that PRR7 is involved in modulating neural activities via interactions with the NMDA receptor and PSD-95, and PSD core formation.
