Exposure to chronic constant light (CCL) influences circadian rhythms and evokes stress. Since hippocampus is sensitive to stress, which facilitates long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampal CA1 area, we examined whether CCL exposure influenced hippocampus-dependent spatial memory and synaptic plasticity in Wistar rats. Here we report that CCL exposure (3 weeks) disrupted 24-h cycle of locomotion activity in open field test. These rats showed shorter escape latency during initial phase of spatial learning but impaired hippocampus-dependent spatial memory without affecting the visual platform learning task in Morris water maze (MWM) compared with control rats. This effect may be due to stress adaptation as reflected by reduced thigmotaxis and anxiety-like behaviors in CCL rats. Moreover, in CA1 area of the hippocampal slices, CCL rats failed to show LTD by low frequency stimulation (LFS, 900 pulses, 1 Hz), while showed decreased short-term depression compared with control rats indicating the induction of LTD was influenced by CCL exposure. Furthermore, additional acute stress enabled LFS to induce LTD in control rats but not in CCL rats. Thus, these results suggested that CCL exposure impaired spatial memory and influenced hippocampal LTD, which may be due to stress adaptation.
