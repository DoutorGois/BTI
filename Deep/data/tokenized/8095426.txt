Brief perfusion of salines containing elevated (10.5-50 mM) [K+] plus glutamate (2.5 or 5 mM) could erase long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat hippocampal slices. Prolonged perfusion with high-[K+]/glutamate could cause persistent neuronal depression lasting > 1 h. LTP erasure occurred in the absence of generalized depression of axonal responsiveness, while persistent neuronal depression was associated with a failure of antidromic invasion of cells. The protocols used may contribute to the development of a model for the cellular study of memory loss following neurological dysfunction.
