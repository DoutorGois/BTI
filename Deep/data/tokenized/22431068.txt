The MAPK/ERK/p38 are signal transduction pathways that couple intracellular responses to the external stimuli. Contrary to ERK protein which is part of the survival route, presence of p38 could have an impact on cell injury. Tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a phenomenon of tissue adaptation, which results in increased tolerance to lethal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Paper describes changes in MAPK protein pathways after brain IPC. Ischemia was induced by 4-vessels occlusion and rats were preconditioned by sub-lethal ischemia. Western blot and immunohistochemistry identified ERK/p38 proteins in injured areas. The highest level of the pERK was detected at 24 h in IPC groups. A contrary pattern of MAPK/p38 activation was observed in this group, where the lowest level of p38 was displayed at 24 h after ischemia. This suggests that the MAPK signal transduction might have a potential role in tissues response subjected to IRI and in the phenomenon of tolerance.
