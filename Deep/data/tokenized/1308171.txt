Research has demonstrated environmentally induced plasticity of hippocampal dentate gyrus-evoked potentials. Other research has shown a role of the NMDA receptor in dentate gyrus long-term potentiation (LTP). The authors tested the role of the NMDA receptor in one form of environmentally induced plasticity, in which transferring animals from their home cages to another environment results in significant excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) enhancement and concomitant depression of the population spike. Rats were chronically implanted with stimulating electrodes in the perforant path and recording electrodes in the dentate gyrus bilaterally. Evoked potentials were recorded from freely behaving rats for four 20-minute sessions (1/wk), which took place immediately following an environmental transfer. Rats received 0.00, 0.05, 0.08, or 0.10 mg/kg MK-801 s.c. 30 minutes prior to recording sessions in either an ascending- or descending-dose series. Results showed that MK-801 produced a reduction of the EPSP enhancement, which takes place over the 20-minute session. The effects of MK-801 on spike depression varied as a function of dose series and time within a session, suggesting a long-term effect of MK-801 on spike depression. There was no detected effect of MK-801 on behavior. Results suggest a role of the NMDA receptor in this form of environmentally induced plasticity with different effects of NMDA receptor antagonism on EPSP enhancement and spike depression.
