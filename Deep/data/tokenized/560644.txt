Cerebral commissurotomy or the "split-brain" procedure may be a valuable adjunct to anticonvulsants for the control of seizures in people whose epilepsy cannot be relieved by anticonvulsants alone, and who are not candidate for the standard methods of surgery. Corpus callosotomy, a revised form of the usual division of many commissures, is a safer operation and appears to be equally effective. The complex clinical aspects of cure and treatment are emphasized.
