A procedure to measure noradrenaline synthesis in rat hippocampal synaptosomes using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection is described. In order to characterize the technique, the linearity of synthesis as well as the effects of K+-depolarization and tyrosine omission were investigated. The technique was compared with the radiochemical tritium release method and the DOPA-accumulation method.
