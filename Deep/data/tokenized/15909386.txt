OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of the effects of microwave on learning and memory. METHOD: Long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampus induced potential and lipofuscin content in rat brain were studied. After irradiated by a 2450 MHz microwave, rats hippocampus induced potential in vivo was recorded and lipofuscin content in the brain was measured by fluorospectrophotometry. RESULT: Continuous microwave with 10-25 mW/cm2 intensity could inhibit the amplitude of the population spike (PS) of weak and strong stimuli induced LTP with an intensity-effect relationship. At 25 mW/cm2, lipofuscin content was significantly higher than control and 10 mW/cm2 group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Continuous microwave with 10-25 mW/cm2 intensity impairs learning and memory by restraining hippocampus LTP and brain lipofuscin content.
