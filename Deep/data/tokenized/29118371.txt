Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a strong association signal of microRNA137 host gene (MIR137) with schizophrenia. MIR137 dysfunction results in downregulation of presynaptic target gene complexin 1 (CPLX1) and impairs synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the variants of MIR137 and CPLX1 confer susceptibility to schizophrenia in Han Chinese. This study employed 736 patients with schizophrenia patients and 751 well-matched healthy subjects for genetic analysis, and genotyped 12 SNPs within MIR137 and CPLX1. SZDB database was used to performed brain eQTL analysis. There were no significant differences of CPLX1 expression in hippocampus, prefrontal cortex or stratum between the schizophrenia patients and control subjects. No significant differences were observed in allele and genotype frequencies in studied SNPs between the case and control groups. Gene interaction analysis showed that MIR137 SNP rs1625579 did not affect schizophrenia susceptibility in interaction with the CPLX1 polymorphic variants. Our findings do not support MIR137 and CPLX1 conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in Han Chinese.
