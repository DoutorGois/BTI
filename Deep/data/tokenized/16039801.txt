Transient cerebral ischemia leads to irreversible translational inhibition which has been considered as a hallmark of delayed neuronal death after ischemia. This study utilized a rat transient cerebral ischemia model to investigate whether irreversible translational inhibition is due to abnormal aggregation of translational complex, i.e. the ribosomes and their associated nascent polypeptides, initiation factors, translational chaperones and degradation enzymes after ischemia. Translational complex aggregation was studied by electron microscopy, as well as by biochemical analyses. A duration of 15 or 20 min of cerebral ischemia induced severe translational complex aggregation starting from 30 min of reperfusion and lasting until the onset of delayed neuronal death at 48 h of reperfusion. Under electron microscopy, most rosette-shaped polyribosomes were relatively evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of sham-operated control neurons. After ischemia, most ribosomes were clumped into large abnormal aggregates in neurons destined to die. Translational complex components consisting of small ribosomal subunit protein 6, large subunit protein 28, eukaryotic initiation factor-3eta, co-translational chaperone heat shock cognate protein 70 and co-chaperone HSP40-Hdj1, as well as co-translational ubiquitin ligase c-terminus of hsp70-interacting protein were all irreversibly clumped into large abnormal protein aggregates after ischemia. Translational components were also highly ubiquitinated. To our knowledge, irreversible aggregation of translational components has not been reported after brain ischemia. This study clearly indicates that ischemia damages co-translational chaperone and degradation machinery, resulting in irreversible destruction of protein synthesis machinery by protein aggregation after ischemia.
