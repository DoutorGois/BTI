In this study 66 section--cases have been examined in order to verify a possible coherence between the frequency of corpora amylacea (CA) of the brain and the age respectively the duration of mortal agony. The study was confined to the hippocampus, which is a zone of predilection for CA. The exploration with the light microscope showed a coherence between the frequency of CA and the biological age, but not with the duration of mortal agony.
