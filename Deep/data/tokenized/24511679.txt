The effects of repetitive mild hypobaric hypoxic preconditioning upon pro- and antioxidant systems in rat hippocampus were studied. It was found that three-trial preconditioning by mild hypobaric hypoxia (360 mm Hg, 2 h) induced moderate oxidative stress immediately after the last preconditioning trial. In addition, it down-regualted the levels of peptide antioxidants (Trx-1, Trx-2, Cu,Zn-SOD) and several lipid peroxidation products 24 h later.
