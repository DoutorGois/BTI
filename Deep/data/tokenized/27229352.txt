The Clusterin (CLU) gene, also known as apolipoprotein J (ApoJ), is currently the third most associated late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) risk gene. However, little was known about the possible effect of CLU genetic variants on AD pathology in brain. Here, we evaluated the interaction between 7 CLU SNPs (covering 95% of genetic variations) and the role of CLU in beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition, AD-related structure atrophy, abnormal glucose metabolism on neuroimaging and CSF markers to clarify the possible approach by that CLU impacts AD. Finally, four loci (rs11136000, rs1532278, rs2279590, rs7982) showed significant associations with the Abeta deposition at the baseline level while genotypes of rs9331888 (P = 0.042) increased Abeta deposition. Besides, rs9331888 was significantly associated with baseline volume of left hippocampus (P = 0.014). We then further validated the association with Abeta deposition in the AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), normal control (NC) sub-groups. The results in sub-groups confirmed the association between CLU genotypes and Abeta deposition further. Our findings revealed that CLU genotypes could probably modulate the cerebral the Abeta loads on imaging and volume of hippocampus. These findings raise the possibility that the biological effects of CLU may be relatively confined to neuroimaging trait and hence may offer clues to AD.
