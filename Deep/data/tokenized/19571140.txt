The cAMP cascade and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are critical modulators of depression. Here we have tested whether the antidepressive effect of the cAMP cascade is mediated by VEGF in the adult hippocampus. We used a conditional genetic system in which the Aplysia octopamine receptor (Ap oa(1)), a G(s)-coupled receptor, is transgenically expressed in the forebrain neurons of mice. Chronic activation of the heterologous Ap oa(1) by its natural ligand evoked antidepressant-like behaviors, accompanied by enhanced phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein and transcription of VEGF in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neurons. Selective knockdown of VEGF in these cells during the period of cAMP elevation inhibited the antidepressant-like behaviors. These findings reveal a molecular interaction between the cAMP cascade and VEGF expression, and the pronounced behavioral consequences of this interaction shed light on the mechanism underlying neuronal VEGF functions in antidepression.
