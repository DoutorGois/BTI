The default-mode network (DMN) has been reported to comprise a set of inter-connected transmodal cortical areas, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex, posterior inferior parietal lobule, lateral temporal region and others. However, the subcortical constituents of the DMN are still not clear. This study aimed to examine whether the correlation maps derived from subcortical structures may also account for neural pattern of the DMN. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and resting-state functional MRI scans of 36 subjects were selected from the Rockland sample (Nathan Kline Institute). The hippocampus and thalamus were chosen as subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Each ROI was partitioned into composite modules which in turn provided simplified and representative dynamics of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. PCC-seeded and ROI-based correlation maps were compared by conjunction analyses and paired t-tests (corrected P < 0.05). Our results unveiled that the hippocampus-, thalamus- and PCC-centred correlation patterns actually overlapped to a substantial degree. Integrating the signals in the thalamus and hippocampus altogether fully explained the PCC-seeded DMN. Supplementary analyses based on the BOLD dynamics in several subcortical nuclei (caudate, putamen and globus pallidus) were dissimilar to the DMN. The DMN derived from the ROI/seed-based approach may represent combined limbic and region-specific informatics (and their closely interacting neural substrates). The possible causes for previous methods of task-induced deactivation and seed-based correlation that failed to depict the holistic limbic picture are discussed. The neocortical manifestation of DMN may reflect the limbic information in the transmodal brain regions.
