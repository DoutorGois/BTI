A number of recent studies have used pharmacological inhibitors to establish a role for protein kinase Mzeta (PKMzeta) in synaptic plasticity and memory. These studies use zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) and chelerythrine as inhibitors of PKMzeta to block long term potentiation and memory; staurosporine is used as a negative control to show that a nonspecific kinase inhibitor does not block long term potentiation and memory. Here, we show that neither ZIP nor chelerythrine inhibits PKMzeta in cultured cells or brain slices. In contrast, staurosporine does block PKMzeta activity in cells and brain slices by inhibiting its upstream phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1. These studies demonstrate that the effectiveness of drugs against purified PKMzeta may not be indicative of their specificity in the more complex environment of the cell and suggest that PKMzeta is unlikely to be the mediator of synaptic plasticity or memory.
