Activation of alpha2-adrenoceptors inhibits long-term potentiation and long-term depression in many brain regions. However, effectiveness and mechanism of alpha2-adrenoceptors for synaptic plasticity at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in rat in vivo is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of alpha2-adrenoceptors agonist clonidine on high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse of rat hippocampus in vivo. Clonidine (0.05, 0.1 mg/kg, ip) inhibited synaptic plasticity in a dose-dependent manner, accompanying with the decreasing of aortic pressure and heart rate (HR) in anesthetized rats. Clonidine (1.25, 2.5 mug/kg, icv, 10 min before HFS) also dose-dependently inhibited synaptic plasticity, which had no remarkable effect on HR and aortic pressure. But, 20 min after HFS, administration of clonidine (2.5 mug/kg) had no effect on LTP. The inhibitory effect of clonidine (2.5 mug/kg) on LTP was completely reversed by yohimbine (18 mug/kg, icv) and ZD7288 (5 mug/kg, icv). Moreover, the inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase of the normalized PPF ratio. Furthermore, clonidine at 1 and 10 muM significantly decreased glutamate (Glu) content in the culture supernatants of hippocampal neurons, and yohimbine at 1 and 10 muM had no effect on Glu release, while it could reverse the inhibition of clonidine (1 and 10 muM) on Glu release. In conclusion, clonidine can suppress the induction of LTP at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse, and the possible mechanism is that activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors reduces the Glu release by inhibiting HCN channels.
