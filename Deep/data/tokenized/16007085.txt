The C-terminal PDZ ligand of the AMPA receptor GluR1 subunit may be important for expression of CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation. To test this directly in vivo, we generated a knock-in mouse lacking the last seven residues of GluR1, comprising the PDZ ligand. This deletion did not affect basal GluR1 synaptic localization, basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation or long-term depression, indicating that the ligand is not required for CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
