Opioids are thought to increase the excitability of hippocampal pyramidal cells by decreasing release of neurotransmitter from inhibitory interneurons. This study compared the actions of the opioid agonist normorphine, and the GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline, on the responses of CA1 pyramidal cells to afferent stimulation. Both normorphine and bicuculline increased the sensitivity of pyramidal cells to presynaptic stimulation, increased the number of population spikes and action potentials elicited, increased the duration of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and reduced the change in input conductance during the early inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP). Unlike bicuculline, normorphine also decreased the change in conductance during the late inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The decreased change in the conductance of pyramidal cells caused by normorphine during both early and late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials supports the hypothesis that opioids decrease the release of GABA from inhibitory interneurons. In addition to reducing GABA-mediated changes in conductance, both normorphine and bicuculline unmasked a D-APV-sensitive conductance, measured during the early inhibitory postsynaptic potential. These results demonstrate that activation of opioid receptors enhances the excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells by decreasing GABA-mediated early and late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and by unmasking NMDA receptors.
