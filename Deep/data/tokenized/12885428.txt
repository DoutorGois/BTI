[3H]Spermidine (SPD) was accumulated in subcellular fractions enriched of the nucleus in a temperature-dependent manner with a saturable profile in murine brain. The accumulation reached a plateau within 30 min at 2 degrees C and 30 degrees C, while excess unlabeled SPD significantly inhibited the accumulation at 2 degrees C without markedly affecting that at 30 degrees C when added after equilibrium. The temperature-dependent accumulation of [3H]SPD was significantly inhibited by the triamine SPD and the tetraamine spermine, but not by the diamine putrescine. Phospholipases were invariably effective in significantly inhibiting the accumulation at 30 degrees C in a concentration-dependent manner. Amongst different discrete murine central structures examined, the temperature-dependent [3H]SPD accumulation was highest in neocortex with progressively lower activities in striatum, hypothalamus, spinal cord, medulla-pons, hippocampus, midbrain and cerebellum. These results suggest the possible presence of a hitherto unidentified nuclear transport system for particular polyamines in murine brain.
