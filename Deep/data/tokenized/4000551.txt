The alterations in the water, sodium (Na) and potassium (K) contents of the frontoparietal cortex, hippocampus and thalamus as well as the protein permeability of the blood-brain barrier were investigated in rats 4 h after systemic kainic acid administration. Increases in the water and Na contents and a decrease in the K content were observed together with Evans blue extravasation in the thalamus area indicating the development of vasogenic brain edema. Changes observed in the ion contents of the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus may be due to a general cell membrane permeability damage but are not caused by a primary disturbance of the blood-brain barrier.
