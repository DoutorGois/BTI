BACKGROUND: Spatial navigation performance in the Hidden Goal Task (HGT), a real-space human analogue of the Morris Water Maze, can identify amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients with memory impairment of the hippocampal type, a known indicator of incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: Contrast results from computer versus real-space versions of the HGT. METHODS: A total of 42 aMCI patients were clinically and neuropsychologically classified into: (1) memory impairment of the hippocampal type--the hippocampal aMCI (HaMCI; n = 10) and (2) isolated retrieval impairment--the nonhippocampal aMCI (NHaMCI; n = 32). Results were compared to the control (n = 28) and AD (n = 21) groups. RESULTS: The HaMCI group, although similar to the NHaMCI group with respect to overall cognitive impairment, performed poorer on the computer version of the HGT and yielded parallel results to the real-space version. The two versions were strongly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Both versions of the HGT can reliably identify aMCI with pronounced memory impairment of the hippocampal type. The computer version of the HGT may be a useful, relatively inexpensive screening tool for early detection of individuals at a high risk of AD.
