Somatic and dendritic responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were recorded intracellularly from CA1 pyramidal cells in slices of the hippocampus ipsilateral and contralateral to a unilateral kainic acid lesion of the CA3 region. Ipsilateral CA1 cells show a loss of GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition. However, somatic GABA responses and the sensitivity of cells to GABA were very similar in ipsilateral and contralateral cells. This was also true for dendritic applications of GABA.
