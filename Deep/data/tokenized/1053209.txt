Activity levels of COMT were measured in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala of two strains of male mice, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, at various ages between 2 and 30 months. Determinations were made in mice housed under normal conditions and in mice exposed to a form of mild stress, an open-field apparatus, for 5 minutes. There were no major significant differences between the two strains as a function of age. However, after the open-field experience, C57BL/6J mice appeared significantly more responsive to the environment, as interpreted by increases in COMT, than DBA/2J mice. Interpretation is offered that C57BL/6J mice possess a more labile norepinephrine system, in spite of aging, than DBA/2J mice.
