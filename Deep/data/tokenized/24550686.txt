OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects and pharmacological mechanisms of icariin, which is the main component in the traditional Chinese herb Epimedium, on beta-amyloid (Abeta) production in an amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg) mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: APPV717I Tg mice were randomly divided into a model group and icariin-treated (30 and 100 mumol/kg per day) groups. Learning-memory abilities were determined by Morris water maze and object recognition tests. Abeta contents were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunohistochemistry. Amyloid plaques were detected by Congo red staining and Bielschowsky silver staining. The levels of expression of APP and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Ten-month-old Tg mice showed obvious learning-memory impairments, and significant increases in Abeta contents, amyloid plaques, and APP and BACE-1 levels in the hippocampus. The intragastric administration of icariin to Tg mice for 6 months (from 4 to 10 months of age) improved the learning-memory abilities and significantly decreased the Abeta contents, amyloid plaques, and APP and BACE-1 levels in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Icariin reduced the Abeta burden and amyloid plaque deposition in the hippocampus of APP transgenic mice by decreasing the APP and BACE-1 levels. These novel findings suggest that icariin may be a promising treatment in patients with AD.
