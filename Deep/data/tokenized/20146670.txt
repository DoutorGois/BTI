Attachment to the substrate is essential for both survival and differentiation of various kinds of cells, such as neurons and epithelial cells. We recently found a small synthetic molecule, adhesamine, which boosts adhesion and growth of mammalian cells. In the present study, we applied adhesamine to primary cultured hippocampal neuronal cells and compared its effects with those of PLL (poly-L-lysine), which is widely used as a substrate for cell cultures. Neurons grown on adhesamine-coated coverslips survived for up to 1 month without a feeder layer of glial cells, and had greater viability than cells grown on PLL-coated coverslips. Morphological analysis revealed that neurons cultured with adhesamine exhibited earlier differentiation, i.e. earlier axonal outgrowth and dendritic maturation with enhanced neurite branching, than neurons cultured with PLL. Synaptic formation and postsynaptic responses were evident as early as 4 days in cells cultured with adhesamine. Acceleration of differentiation is mediated by earlier activation of the signalling pathways from heparan sulfate in the extracellular matrix to both FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). Improved survival rates and accelerated maturation of neurons exposed to adhesamine suggest that this completely synthetic molecule may be a useful reagent for culturing neuronal cells.
