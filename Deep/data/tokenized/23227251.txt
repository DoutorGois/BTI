Recently, multiple neurotrophic/growth factors have been proposed to play an important role in the therapeutic action of antidepressants. In this study, we prepared astrocyte- and neuron-enriched cultures from the neonatal rat cortex, and examined the changes in neurotrophic/growth factor expression by antidepressant treatment using real-time PCR. Treatment with amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) significantly increased the expression of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA with a different time course in astrocyte cultures, but not in neuron-enriched cultures. Only the expression of FGF-2 was higher in astrocyte cultures than in neuron-enriched cultures. We focused on the FGF-2 production in astrocytes. Several different classes of antidepressants, but not non-antidepressants, also induced FGF-2 mRNA expression. Noradrenaline (NA) is known to induce FGF-2 expression in astrocyte cultures, as with antidepressants. Therefore, we also assessed the mechanism of NA-induced FGF-2 expression, in comparison to amitriptyline. NA increased the FGF-2 mRNA expression via alpha1 and beta-adrenergic receptors; however, the amitriptyline-induced FGF-2 mRNA expression was not mediated via these adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, the amitriptyline-induced FGF-2 mRNA expression was completely blocked by cycloheximide (an inhibitor of protein synthesis), while the NA-induced FGF-2 mRNA was not. These data suggest that the regulation of FGF-2 mRNA expression by amitriptyline was distinct from that by NA. Taken together, antidepressant-stimulated astrocytes may therefore be important mediators that produce several neurotrophic/growth factors, especially FGF-2, through a monoamine-independent and a de novo protein synthesis-dependent mechanism.
