Type 1 diabetes is a common metabolic disorder accompanied by increased blood glucose levels along with glucocorticoid and cognitive deficits. The disease is also thought to be associated with environmental changes in brain and constantly induces oxidative stress in patients. Therefore, glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback mechanisms involving the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding site are very important to understand the development of this disease. Many researchers have used streptozotocin (STZ)-treated diabetic animals to study changes in GR expression in the brain. However, few scientists have evaluated the hyperglycemic period following STZ exposure. In the present study, we found GR expression in the hippocampus varied based on the period after STZ administration for up to 4 weeks. We performed immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to validate the sequential alterations of GR expression in the hippocampus of STZ-treated type 1 diabetic rats. GR protein expression increased significantly until week 3 but decreased at week 4 following STZ administration. GR expression after 70 mg/kg STZ administration was highest at 3 weeks post-treatment and decreased thereafter. Although STZ-induced increase in GR expression in diabetic animals has been described, our data indicate that researchers should consider the sequential GR expression changes during the hyperglycemic period following STZ exposure.
