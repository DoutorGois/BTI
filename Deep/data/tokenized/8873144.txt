Granule cells of the dentate gyrus can express neuropeptide-Y (NPY) in several models of epilepsy involving limbic seizures, however, the nature of this ectopic expression is not well understood at present. We have studied the expression of NPY-immunoreactivity in mossy fibres contralateral to a unilateral intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and report that ectopic mossy fibre NPY-immunoreactivity is observed throughout the contralateral hippocampus.
