Rats born to dams fed either a 6% (malnourished) or a 25% (control) casein diet during gestation and lactation and maintained on the diet of the dam after weaning were tested for electrographic and behavioral responses to electrically induced kindling of the CA1 field of the hippocampus beginning at 44 days of age. Animals in the 6% diet group had a significantly lower threshold to afterdischarge (AD), a significantly faster spread of AD activity to distal recording sites, significantly longer average duration of AD activity at all recording sites and a markedly altered behavioral progression toward seizure activity compared to control animals. These findings indicate that prenatal protein malnutrition results in hippocampal dysfunction as evidenced by both the electrographic and behavioral correlates of the kindling process. The data presented suggest that prenatal proteins malnutrition alters the response of hippocampal CA1 pyramids to electrical stimulation and that this alteration results in marked changes to both the electrographic and behavioral correlates of kindling.
