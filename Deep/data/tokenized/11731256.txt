Wnts are a family of secreted proteins involved in multiple developmental mechanisms during nervous system development, including cell proliferation, cell migration, axon guidance and specification of cell positional information. We report here the expression of sFRP-1 mRNA, encoding a putative inhibitor of Wnt, in the developing mouse neocortex during the entire period when neurons for the neocortex are born. We show that sFRP-1 mRNA expression is spatially restricted to the proliferative zones during the period, when neurons are known to be generated in large numbers for the enlarging cortical plate.
