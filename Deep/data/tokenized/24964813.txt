Aging is associated with declines in memory and cognitive function. Here, we evaluate the effects of HT-0712 on memory formation and on cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated genes in aged mice. HT-0712 enhanced long-term memory formation in normal young mice at brain concentrations similar to those found to increase CRE-mediated gene expression in hippocampal neurons. Aged mice showed significantly poorer contextual and trace conditioning compared with young-adult mice. In aged mice, a single injection of HT-0712 significantly boosted contextual and trace long-term memory. Additional effects of HT-0712 were seen in a spatial memory task. Our parallel biochemical experiments revealed that inductions of the CREB-regulated genes, cFos, Zif268, and Bdnf, after fear conditioning were diminished in aged mice. HT-0712 facilitated expression of these CREB-regulated genes in aged hippocampus, indicating that the drug engages a CREB-regulated mechanism in vivo. These findings corroborate and extend our previous results on the mechanism of action of HT-0712 and its efficacy to enhance memory formation. Our data also indicate that HT-0712 may be effective to treat age-associated memory impairment in humans.
