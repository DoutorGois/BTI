Values of cyclic AMP, DNA and protein content were determined in six regions of the rat brain: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, thalamus with hypothalamus, cerebellum, and medulla. The obtained results indicated significant differences in the levels of protein in several areas of rat brain. There is some relationship between the changes in the content of DNA and cyclic AMP in these regions of the brain. These observations support the view that adenosine 3': 5'-monophosphate can play a positive role in regulating DNA synthesis in rat brain tissue.
