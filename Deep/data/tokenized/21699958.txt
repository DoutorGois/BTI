Amyloid beta peptide 1-40 (Abeta(1-40)) is closely associated with the progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study aimed to establish a proteomic strategy for the profiling of AD tissues for disease-specific changes in protein abundance. Intrahippocampal injection of Abeta(1-40) induced spatial memory and learning decline in rats. Proteomic analysis revealed the changes in protein expression in the rat hippocampus treated with Abeta(1-40). Four proteins of interest which was in abundance was significantly altered in Abeta(1-40)-treated rats were identified by peptide mass fingerprint (PMF). These proteins corresponded to synapsin Ib, protein disulfide-isomerase A3 precursor, tubulin beta chain and ATP synthase beta subunit. Our results provide new insights into the relationship between Abeta and the pathogenesis of AD, and suggest potential targets for the therapy of AD.
