Microwell cultures of dissociated tissue from prenatal rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex as well as from early postnatal cerebellum were used for quantification of neuronal aggregation, process extension, and fasciculation. It was shown that the cells in culture from these different brain regions developed differently with regard to both architecture and rate of differentiation. The effect of a polyclonal antibody against the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), the excitatory amino acid receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and the neurotoxin acrylamide on aggregation and fiber formation was investigated. Exposure to the NCAM antibody led to formation of fewer but larger aggregates and stimulated the morphological development of the cultures. Acrylamide affected aggregate formation, leading to smaller but more numerous aggregates, and it inhibited process extension and fasciculation. Treatment with NMDA affected process formation and led to formation of more numerous but smaller aggregates. Some of these effects were strongly tissue-dependent. Thus, large differences were seen regarding the effect of the NCAM antibody on aggregation and process extension in cultures from the different brain areas. The culture systems appear to represent convenient and reliable screening tools to study the influence of putative morphoregulatory substances on cell-cell interactions during early neuronal development.
