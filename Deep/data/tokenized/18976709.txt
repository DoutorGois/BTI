Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is an extracellularly operating enzyme involved in the synaptic plasticity, hippocampal-dependent long term memory and neurodegeneration. Previous studies have shown its upregulation following seizure-evoking stimuli. Herein, we show that in the rat brain, MMP-9 mRNA expression in response to pentylenetetrazole-evoked neuronal depolarization is transient. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the rat hippocampus neuronal activation strongly induces JunB expression, simultaneously leading to an accumulation of JunB/FosB complexes onto the -88/-80 bp site of the rat MMP-9 gene promoter in vivo. Surprisingly, manipulations with JunB expression levels in activated neurons revealed its moderate repressive action onto MMP-9 gene expression. Therefore, our study documents the active repressive influence of AP-1 onto MMP-9 transcriptional regulation by the engagement of JunB.
