Hippocampal precursor of nerve growth factor (proNGF)/NGF signaling occurs in conjunction with beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulations in Alzheimer disease (AD). To assess the involvement of this pathway in AD progression, we quantified these proteins and their downstream pathway activators in postmortem tissues from the brains of subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD using immunoblotting and ELISA. Hippocampal proNGF was significantly greater in AD cases compared with those in NCI and MCI cases. TrkA was significantly reduced in MCI compared with those in NCI and AD, whereas p75 neurotrophin receptor, sortilin, and neurotrophin receptor homolog 2 remained stable. Akt decreased from NCI to MCI to AD, whereas phospho-Akt and phospho-Akt-to-Akt ratio were elevated in AD compared with those in MCI and NCI. No differences were found in phospho-Erk, Erk, or their ratio across groups. Although c-jun kinase (JNK) remained stable across groups, phospho-JNK and the phospho-JNK-to-JNK ratio increased significantly in AD compared with those in NCI and MCI. Expression levels of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), and Abeta(40/42) ratio were stable. Statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between proNGF and phospho-JNK, although only proNGF was negatively correlated with cognitive function and only TrkA was negatively associated with pathologic criteria. These findings suggest that alterations in the hippocampal NGF signaling pathway in MCI and AD favor proNGF-mediated proapoptotic pathways, and that this is independent of Abeta accumulation during AD progression.
