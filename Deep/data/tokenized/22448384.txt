The effect of intravenous injection of human umbilical cord blood cells on the levels of N-acetylaspartate, creatine and phosphocreatine, choline-containing compounds, glutamine and glutamate, and myoinositol in morphologically intact areas of the cortex, white matter, and hippocampus of children with consequences of traumatic brain injury was studied by single voxel 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It was shown that cell therapy increases the content of N-acetylaspartate, a marker of functional integrity of neurons, in the white matter and in the cortex at the boundary between the frontotemporal and parietal lobes and reduces neurological deficit.
