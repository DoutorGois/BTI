This study shows that [3H]AF-DX 116 binds specifically, saturably, and with high affinity to putative muscarinic-M2 receptor sites in the rat brain. In homogenates of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, and cerebellum, [3H]AF-DX 116 appears to bind two subpopulations of muscarinic sites: one class of higher affinity sites (Kd less than 4.0 nM) and one class of lower affinity sites (Kd greater than 50 nM, except in the cerebellum). The apparent maximal capacities (Bmax) of [3H]AF-DX 116 sites in forebrain tissues ranged between 34 and 69 fmol/mg protein for the higher affinity site, and between 197 and 451 fmol/mg protein for the lower affinity site. In cerebellar homogenates, the maximal capacity of [3H]AF-DX 116 binding sites was 10.4 +/- 0.4 (Kd = 1.9 +/- 0.2 nM) and 39.1 +/- 2.6 (Kd = 26 +/- 7 nM) fmol/mg protein for the higher and the lower affinity site, respectively. Determination of the Kd for the higher and lower affinity [3H]AF-DX 116 sites from association and dissociation constants yielded similar values to those obtained from the saturation data. The ligand selectivity pattern reveals that AF-DX 116 is more potent than (-)QNB greater than atropine greater than methoctramine greater than 4-DAMP greater than gallamine greater than NMS greater than carbamylcholine greater than oxotremorine greater than pirenzepine much greater than nicotine in competing for the higher affinity [3H]AF-DX 116 sites. With few exceptions, the pattern was similar for the lower affinity sites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
