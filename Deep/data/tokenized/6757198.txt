The localization and regional distribution of insulin-like immunoreactivity (IRI) was studied in human brain autopsy material using the indirect immunofluorescence technique. A positive reaction for IRI could be observed in many neurons of the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, corpus amygdaloideum, medulla oblongata (especially within the nuclei of cranial nerves IX, X and XII), and the cerebral cortex, whereas the cerebellar cortex was lacking in immunohistochemically detectable insulin-like material. No nerve fibres containing polypeptides could be revealed. Additionally, the insulin content of various brain regions was estimated by radioimmunoassay. Insulin concentrations in human nervous tissue were found to be elevated in comparison to blood plasma levels.
