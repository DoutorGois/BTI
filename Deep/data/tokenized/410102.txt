The subiculum of the primate hippocampal formation stands at the end of a polarized sequence of intrinsic hippocampal efferents and is the source of efferents to the medial frontal cortex, the caudal cingulate gyrus, and the parahippocampal area and amygdala in the temporal lobe. In addition, the subiculum sends subcortical efferents to the septum and diencephalon.
