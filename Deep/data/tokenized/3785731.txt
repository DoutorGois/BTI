Alteration of metabolic activity during deep halothane anesthesia (3%) was analyzed qualitatively in the rat using a modified 2-deoxyglucose technique using the tritiated compound. The grey matter exhibited a homogeneous low level of metabolic activity in most places but some nuclei or subnuclear structures showed a much higher activity. These included in particular the locus coeruleus, the dorsal raphe, the substantia nigra pars compacta, the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the nucleus reticularis thalami. In the nucleus reticularis thalami, the use of 2-deoxy-[3H]glucose allowed us to demonstrate a high cellular metabolic activity, which is in agreement with several electrophysiological studies which showed a high rate of spontaneous activity under the same anesthetics.
