Records of evoked responses to clicks in the cortex, reticular formation and hippocampus as well as determination of thresholds of hypothalamus stimulation eliciting fear and rage reactions, have shown that after emotional excitation the hypothalamus excitability is enhanced and the thresholds of perception of foreign signals are higher causing a slackening of attention to them. Trifluoperasine and galoperidol in a dose of 0,5 mg/kg, diazepam (0.5 and 1,0 mg/kg), benactizine (0,5 and 1,0 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxid (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), amitriptiline (2,5 and 5,0 mg/kg), imipramine (2,5 and 5,0 mg/kg) normalize the attention after emotional excitation by reducing the excitability of the hypothalamus. Pentobarbital (1,0 and 2,0 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (0,5 and 1,0 mg/kg) as well as trifluorasine and galoperidol in a dose of 1,0 mg/kg, deepen the attention disturbances after emotional excitation due to a blockade of inhibitory effects of the basolateral amygdala and dorsal hippocampus on the hypothalamus.
