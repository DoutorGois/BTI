Thyroid hormones are critical for the maturation and function of the central nervous system. Insufficiency of thyroid hormones in the adulthood causes a wide range of cognitive dysfunctions, including deficits in learning and memory. The present study investigated whether adult-onset hypothyroidism would alter synaptic functions in the dorsal hippocampo-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway, a neural pathway important for learning and memory. Adult hypothyroidism was induced by oral administration of 1% (g/l) antithyroid acting drug 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 4 weeks. Postsynaptic potentials (PSP) were recorded in the mPFC by stimulating the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region in vivo. Basal synaptic transmission was evaluated by comparing input-output relationships. Paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation were recorded to examine short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Adult-onset hypothyroidism did not change the basal synaptic transmission, but significantly reduced paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation of PSP. These inhibitions can be restored by thyroid hormone replacement. The results suggest that such alterations in synaptic plasticity of the dorsal hippocampo-mPFC pathway might contribute to understanding basic mechanisms underlying learning and memory deficits associated with adult-onset hypothyroidism.
