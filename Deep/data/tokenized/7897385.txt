During aging, the brain parenchyma of animals and humans share many similarities, both in the gray and the white matter. Unfortunately, until now, neither aged animals nor animal models reproduce the two hallmarks of aging of the human brain: senile plaques and tangles. Therefore, observations performed on animals are limited to some aspects of the involutive process which affects brain parenchyma during aging and their appropriateness to the human situation. One striking aspect concerns the occurrence of vacuolated necrotic cells whose number increases with advancing age. These cells can constitute markers of the brain involutive process and they characterize, both in animal and human, the more vulnerable areas of the brain affected by the neuronal rarefaction. Experimental animal models can be used to study the various conditions which sustain the cell survival and to determine, at the cellular level, the factors leading the brain parenchyma to an irreversible state of degradation.
