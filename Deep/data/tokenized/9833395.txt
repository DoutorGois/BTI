The aim of the work was to evaluate the effect of CoQ10 (10 mg/kg body weight) on the morphological changes in the rat brain after the Et-1 induced cerebral ischemia. Selective necrotic foci and dark neurons were observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal CA1, CA2 sectors and dentate gyrus after the administration of Et-1. Around the necrotic foci, glycogen was deposited 24 hours after the ischemic hypoxia. It seems that histopathological changes evoked by Et-1 indicate the complicated mechanism connected with ischemia. After treatment with CoQ10 only sparse neuronal changes were observed. CoQ10, known oxygen-derived free radicals scavenger diminished neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus.
