The effect of aging on hippocampus is often confounded by diseases that commonly occur in the elderly. In this research, functional proteomics was used to characterize age-related changes in energy metabolism of different neuronal pathways within the hippocampus of Wistar rats aged 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. The "large" synaptosomes, derived from glutamatergic mossy fiber endings connecting granule cells of dentate gyrus with apical dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells, and the "small" synaptosomes, derived from the cholinergic small nerve endings of septo-hippocampal fibers, whose projections reach CA1 pyramidal cells, were isolated. Because most brain disorders are associated with bioenergetic changes, the maximum rate (V(max)) of selected enzymes of glycolysis, Krebs cycle, glutamate and amino acids metabolism, and acetylcholine catabolism were evaluated. The results show that "large" and "small" synaptosomes possess specific and independent metabolic features coherently with the selective vulnerability of the respective hippocampal subfields to Alzheimer's disease and cerebral ischemia. This study represents a reliable model to study in vivo (i) the physiopathological molecular mechanisms of some brain diseases dependent on energy metabolism, (ii) the responsiveness to noxious stimuli, and (iii) the effects of drugs, discriminating their action sites at subcellular level.
