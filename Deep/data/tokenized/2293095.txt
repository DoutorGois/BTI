Tetanus toxin (about 20 mouse LD50) injected into the ventral hippocampus of rats leads to brief seizures occurring intermittently over a period of weeks. Toxin injection leads to the appearance of activated microglia (detected with OX42 immunohistochemistry) in the hippocampus. After 7-14 days, many activated microglia are visible in CA1 area of dorsal hippocampus aligned with the pyramidal cell dendrites and having the morphology characteristic of 'rod cells'. Extensive cell loss is found in dorsal CA1, but not at the injection site, in about one third of injected rats.
