Cultured hippocampal pyramidal cells responded to field stimulation with a short latency excitation followed by a long-lasting inhibition. This sequence was transformed into a bursting response by bath application of 10(-8) M FK 33-824, 10(-6) M (D-Ala)2(D-Leu)5-enkephalin and 10(-5) M bremazocine. Bremazocine and ethylketocyclazocine stereospecifically blocked the effects of FK 33-824. The results indicate that the excitatory responses were predominantly mediated by mu-receptors.
