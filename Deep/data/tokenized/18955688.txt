BACKGROUND: Semantic dementia is a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive erosion of semantic processing and is one of the canonical subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This study aimed to characterize the pattern of global and regional longitudinal brain atrophy in semantic dementia and to identify imaging biomarkers that could underpin therapeutic trials. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with semantic dementia (including eight pathologically confirmed cases) underwent whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses on volumetric brain MRI scans at two time points. Sample size estimates for trials were subsequently calculated using these data. RESULTS: Mean (SD) whole-brain atrophy rate was 39.6 (31.9) mL/y [3.2 (12.0) mL/y in controls], with ventricular enlargement of 8.9 (4.4) mL/y [1.0 (1.0) mL/y in controls]. All patients had a smaller left temporal lobe at baseline [left mean 31.9 (6.9) mL, right mean 49.2 (9.5) mL; p < 0.0001]; however, the mean rate of atrophy was significantly greater in the right temporal lobe [right 3.9 (1.7) mL/y, left 2.8 (1.2) mL/y; p = 0.02]. Similarly, whereas the left hippocampus was smaller at baseline, the mean atrophy rate was significantly greater in the right hippocampus. Using the atrophy rates generated, sample size requirements for clinical trials were found to be smallest for temporal lobe measurement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the rate of tissue loss in the right temporal lobe overtakes the left temporal lobe as semantic dementia evolves, consistent with the later development of symptoms attributable to right temporal lobe dysfunction. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that MRI measures of temporal lobe volume loss could provide a feasible and sensitive index of disease progression in semantic dementia.
