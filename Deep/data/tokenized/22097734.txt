OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of penehyclidine hydrochloride on glutamate (Glu)release and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)1 expression in hippocampus CA1 with global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats. METHODS: Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into three groups; group A received sham operation; group B received ischemia/reperfusion; group C received penehyclidine hydrochloride treatment (2 mg/kg) before ischemia/reperfusion (n=20). Global cerebral ischemia was induced according to Pulsinelli-Brierley method. All animals were divided into two experiments: (I) Microdialysis plus HPLC/FD were used to detect Glu level after reperfusion 1 h, 3 h, 6 h. (II) After reperfusion 3 h, the animals were decapitated on ice and the brains were immediately removed to detect NMDAR1 expression in CA1 area by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After penehyclidine hydrochloride treatment, extracellular Glu level in CA1 were significantly decreased compared with those of control group (P < 0.05 or 0.01); Total integrated OD, average gray value and positive-cell area of NMDAR1 in CA1 were also significantly decreased compared with those of control group (P < 0.05 or 0.01). CONCLUSION: Penehyclidine hydrochloride might has protective effect in hippocampus CA1 on global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion animals. The protective mechanism might be involved in inhibiting Glu release and NMDAR1 expression.
