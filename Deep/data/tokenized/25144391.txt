The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of right versus left temporal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on navigation efficiency and spatial memory in individuals with low versus high spatial skills. A mixed design administered low (0.5 mA) versus high (2.0 mA) anodal tDCS (within-participants) over the right or the left temporal lobe (between-participants), centered at electrode site T8 (right) or T7 (left). During stimulation, participants navigated virtual environments in search of specified landmarks, and data were logged in terms of current position and heading over time. Following stimulation, participants completed pointing and map-drawing spatial memory tests. Individual differences in sense of direction reliably and inversely predicted navigation advantages in the 2.0 versus 0.5 mA right hemisphere stimulation condition (R=0.45, P<0.01); in other words, individuals with lower sense of direction showed increased navigation efficiency in the 2.0 versus 0.5 mA condition. Spatial memory tests also showed the development of relatively comprehensive spatial memories: bidimensional regression indicated lower distortion in sketch maps drawn following 2.0 versus 0.5 mA right temporal lobe stimulation (F=8.7, P<0.05). Data provide the first demonstration that right temporal anodal tDCS may hold potential for enhancing navigation efficiency in otherwise poor navigators. Data support neuroimaging studies showing the engagement of right temporal brain regions in developing and applying spatial memories during complex navigation tasks, and uniquely suggest that continuing research may find value in optimizing stimulation parameters (intensity, focality) as a function of individual differences.
