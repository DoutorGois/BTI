Interneurons in the area dentata of the rat were immunostained with an antibody to gamma-aminobutyric acid. After septal lesions, degenerating terminals were found in asymmetric synaptic contact with granule cell somata and dendritic elements of immunoreactive and nonreactive cells in the supragranular part of the molecular layer.
