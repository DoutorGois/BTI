Previous studies have demonstrated a spatial working memory deficit in glutamate receptor (GluR)-A (GluR1) AMPA receptor subunit knockout mice. The present study evaluated male and female wild-type and GluR-A-/- mice on a test battery that assessed sensorimotor, affective, and cognitive behaviors. Results revealed a behavioral phenotype more extensive than previously described. GluR-A-/- mice were hyperactive, displayed a subtle lack of motor coordination, and were generally more anxious than wild-type controls. In addition, they showed a deficit in spontaneous alternation, consistent with previous reports of a role for GluR-A-dependent plasticity in hippocampus-dependent, spatial working memory. Although changes in motor coordination or anxiety cannot explain the dissociations already reported within the spatial memory domain, it is clear that they could significantly affect interpretation of results obtained in other kinds of behavioral tasks.
