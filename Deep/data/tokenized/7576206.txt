Rats that had received bilateral lesions of the perirhinal cortex, fimbria-fornix, combined lesions of both these structures, or sham operations were tested on an object-guided delayed non-match-to-sample task. Perirhinal lesioned and fimbria-fornix lesioned rats were moderately impaired when delay intervals of 30 s or more were introduced between the sample and test phases of the experiment. Animals with combined lesions displayed a considerably greater impairment than animals with lesions of either structure alone. The combined lesioned animals were severely impaired in the initial acquisition of the task and displayed a profound memory deficit at delay intervals of greater than 4 s. These results emphasize the importance of the perirhinal cortex to memory function and suggest that the perirhinal cortex and the hippocampal formation may function interactively in the execution of memory processes.
