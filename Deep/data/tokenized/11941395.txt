Hippocampal neurons cultured from 7 to 9 d in vitro were used to observe the effect of glutamate. Treatment of glutamate for 24 h greatly decreased neuronal survival and pretreatment with pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) significantly attenuated hippocampal neuron death induced by glutamate. Moreover, glutamate dose-dependently increased the intracellular calcium concentration in cultured hippocampal neurons, while PACAP inhibited the increase of intracellular calcium concentration induced by glutamate. PACAP 6-38, a specific PACAP type I receptor antagonist, completely inhibited the amelioration of glutamate induced death and the decrease of intracellular calcium concentration induced by PACAP in cultured hippocampal neurons. The data suggest that PACAP has a neuroprotective effect on the hippocampal neuronal damage induced by glutamate, which is related to an inhibition of glutamate-induced increase of intracellular calcium concentration and mediated by PACAP type I receptor.
