In this study we investigated the time course, cell-type and stress-specific expression of hsp70 mRNA and Hsp70 protein in glial cells and neurons in the rat brain following heat shock treatment and kainic acid-induced status epilepticus. Transcripts for hsp70 were detected in hippocampal homogenates from 1.5 to 6 h following hyperthermia and from 3 to 24 h following kainic acid-induced seizures. In situ hybridization revealed hsp70 mRNA to be region specific and time-dependent following hyperthermia and kainic acid-induced seizures. Western analysis indicated that Hsp70 reached maximal levels at 3 h after hyperthermia and 12 h after kainic acid-induced seizures. Immunohistochemistry revealed low level expression of Hsp70 protein in dentate granule cells at 1.5 and 3 h after hyperthermia. No Hsp70 protein was detected in neurons of the pyramidal cell layer or dentate hilus at any time following hyperthermia. Small Hsp70-immunoreactive cells were detected throughout the hippocampus following hyperthermia that, based on cell size, distribution, and double-labeling with vimentin, were considered to be glia. In contrast, high levels of Hsp70 protein were detected in neurons of the pyramidal cell layer and dentate hilus at 24 h after seizure-inducing kainic acid injection. These results suggest that expression of Hsp70 protein is cell-specific depending on the stressor. In addition, finding high levels of Hsp70 mRNA in the dentate granule cells after hyperthermia, but little or no Hsp70 protein, suggests that the synthesis of the protein is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level following hyperthermia.
