We have transplanted fetal neurons to prolong hippocampal pyramidal cell survival in a mouse scrapie model in which 50% of CA1 pyramidal cells have died by day 180 of the 250-day incubation period. Cells prepared from embryonic PrP deficient mice were intracerebrally injected into infected mice on day 150 and groups killed on day 171 and with terminal disease. Neuron counts and CA1 depth measurements were made on semi-serial sections using an image analysis system. Both grafted groups retained more CA1 neurons than controls injected with medium alone, and showed greater depth of CA1 than controls. This new approach may have potential as a late-stage therapy for TSEs for which there are currently no available treatments.
