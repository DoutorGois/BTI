Utilizing a questionnaire, we inquired about the self-perceived sexual behavior of 50 married males with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS) before and after anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) and compared the results with those of 50 age-matched healthy married males. The sexual desire and satisfaction of the patients were poor when compared to the controls. Although a majority of the sexual domains improved following ATL, even after a median duration of five years, the sexual status of the patients did not match with that of the controls. Those who, after ATL, were seizure free, had one or no antiepileptic drug (AED) and had an EEG without epileptiform abnormalities achieved a better sexual outcome. We conclude that sexual dysfunction is frequent in male patients with MTLE-HS. They require preoperative assessment to identify their sexual inadequacies as well as counseling about the expected post-ATL sexual outcome. Discontinuation of enzyme-inducing AEDs facilitates post-ATL improvement in sexual function.
