Behavioral effects of septal lesion and fornix-fimbria transection were compared in absence and presence of a septal transplant in the hippocampus. The transplant grew in the hippocampus and projected acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing fibers throughout the extent of the denervated hippocampus. There were no differences in graft size or AChE reinnervation pattern after septal lesion or fornix transection. An increase in the density of M1 binding sites seen in hippocampal CA3 region after a cholinergic lesion, was restored back to normal after reinnervation of the hippocampus by the graft. Fornix-transected rats were more impaired in water maze acquisition than septal-lesioned rats which were impaired compared to controls. Septal-grafted rats were not different from lesioned rats in the behavioral tasks. However, an injection of physostigmine improved their performance relative to lesioned non-grafted rats. These experiments indicate that grafts can ameliorate behavioral deficits when the efficacy of acetylcholine of graft origin is enhanced.
