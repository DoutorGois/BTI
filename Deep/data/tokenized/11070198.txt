Lithium has been used clinically for the treatment of bipolar disorders. However, the brain mechanisms, by which lithium acts, are still unclear. An impaired hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic lithium on the corticosteroid receptors in the brain. Male Wistar rats were injected with LiCl (1.5 mEq/kg) or saline intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, the expressions of mRNA for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the brain were determined by non-radioactive in situ hybridization. Chronic administration of LiCl increased the expression of GR mRNA in the hippocampus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). However, no significant changes were observed in the expression of either MR mRNA in the hippocampus or GR mRNA in the locus ceruleus. Since the hippocampus and PVN mediate negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis, an increased expression of GR mRNA in these regions may normalize HPA axis activity in mood disorders. Thus, the effect of chronic lithium on GR function may be involved in its antimanic and/or prophylactic activity in bipolar disorders.
