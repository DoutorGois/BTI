Humans share adaptative capacities to stress with other species, as demonstrated on amphibians: the physiological response to experimental water volume and food deprivation results in the activation of the endocrine axes that drive metamorphosis, in particular the neuroendocrine stress system. Unfavorable effects may, however, occur, probably due to inappropriate timing and/or duration of stress: recent experiments are converging to show a profound impairment of hippocampal functioning in the offspring of mothers exposed to prenatal stress. Moreover, fetal changes are likely one of the risk factors for a number of diseases in adulthood.
