MRI-based evaluation of the hippocampus is important in the assessment and treatment of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Using MRI-based large-deformation high-dimensional mapping (HDM-LD), which allows structural evaluation of regions of the hippocampus, we document the HDM-LD-defined pattern of hippocampal deformation in MTLE patients compared with matched controls. In 30 subjects with MTLE and confirmed medial temporal lobe sclerosis (MTS), we performed measurements of intracranial area, brain parenchymal volume and deformation-based hippocampal segmentations, and then grouped patients into right and left MTS groups (resulting in 15 subjects in each group). Using HDM-LD techniques, we compared the right and left MTS groups with a group of 15 matched controls. Analysis included both the MTS and contralateral hippocampi, and covariance for changes in brain parenchymal volume. Final results were interpreted using a segmentation showing normal hippocampal surface subfield anatomy. Comparing the MTS groups with controls, after covarying with brain parenchymal volume, the MTS hippocampi showed significant volume loss (P < 0.0001), contralateral hippocampi showed no significant volume loss. HDM-LD techniques showed significant shape changes, with marked inward deviation in the Sommer sector of the MTS hippocampi. In the contralateral hippocampi, the inferior surface of the hippocampal body showed inward deformation in the medial aspect of the subiculum, with minimal involvement of the Sommer sector. HDM-LD shows involvement of subregions of the hippocampus which are consistent with MTS histopathology. Contralateral hippocampi show different HDM-LD changes, suggesting that the underlying disease process in the contralateral hippocampi is different from MTS.
