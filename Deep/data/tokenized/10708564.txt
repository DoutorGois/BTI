Changes in glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) levels and/or redox status have been suggested to mediate the induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that follows exposure to oxidizing agents such as ethanol. Here we report the effects of ethanol administration to rats at intracellular levels of GSH, GSSG, HSP70, and protein carbonyls in brain and liver. Following 7 days of ethanol administration, there was a significant decrease in GSH, a significant induction of HSP70, and a significant increase in protein carbonyls in all brain regions studied and in liver. In cortex, striatum, and hippocampus there was a significant correlation between (a) the decrease in GSH, (b) the increase in GSSG, and (c) the decrease in GSH/GSSG ratio and HSP70 levels induced in response to ethanol. These data support the hypothesis that a redox mechanism may be involved in the heat-shock signal pathway responsible for HSP70 induction in the brain.
