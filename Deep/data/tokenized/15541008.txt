GADD34 is a growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene up-regulated in response to DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. It is thought that GADD34 may play a crucial role in cell survival in ischaemia. GADD34 expression was assessed immunohistochemically in post-mortem human hippocampal tissue obtained from patients surviving for defined periods (0-24 h; 24 h-7 days) after a cardiac arrest and in age-matched control subjects. In control brain, cytoplasm staining in GADD34 immunopositive cells was faint but present throughout the hippocampus and cortex. There was minimal change in GADD34 expression in the group surviving 0-24 h after cardiac arrest. However GADD34 immunostaining was markedly increased in selectively vulnerable regions in the 24 h-7 day survival group. Increased GADD34 staining was present in ischaemic neurones and in some morphologically normal neurones after cardiac arrest. Extensive ischaemic damage was found to correlate with elevated GADD34 immunostaining in the CA1 layer of the hippocampus (**P < 0.0016). In addition, GADD34 was found to colocalize with proliferating cell nuclear antigen in some neurones. The up-regulation of GADD34 in response to global ischaemia in the human brain plus its influence on protein synthesis and DNA repair suggests that this protein may have the potential to influence cell survival.
