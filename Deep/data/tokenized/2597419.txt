In this report we have examined the distribution in the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VTA-A10) of the neurons projecting to the hippocampal formation (HF) by injecting, in different combinations, retrograde fluorescent tracers (Fast Blue, 2% and Nuclear Yellow, 1%) in several hippocampal areas. The distribution of the VTA labeled neurons suggest a topographic organization of the VTA efferent pathway towards the HF. These results are in agreement with the concept that precise topography of the projections is a distinctive feature of the dopaminergic systems in general.
