Investigations using double labeling by axonal transport of tracers have shown that in the rat, four nuclei of the anterior thalamus (anterior dorsal, anterior ventral, lateral anterior, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) that project to the CA1 region of the hippocampus also receive a discrete input from the contralateral eye. The significance of this telencephalic visual pathway is discussed in a phylogenetic context.
