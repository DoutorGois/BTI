The effects of 60- and 90-day administration of a pill containing 0.05 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.5 mg norgestrel on the regional lipid levels of female albino rabbit brains have been investigated. Decreased levels of total lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, free fatty acids and esterified fatty acids were observed in hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygadaloid nucleus, midline nuclei of thalamus and gyrus cinguli. However, the levels of esterified fatty acids only in the amygdaloid nucleus and that of cholesterol in hypothalamus were significantly increased.
