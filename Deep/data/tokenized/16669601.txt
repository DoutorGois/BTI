In addition to commonly advertised hazards of obesity contributed by excess dietary fat, evidence of alterations in brain chemistry and structure are well documented. This brief review examines the role of nutrients, minerals and certain lipids, primarily the essential fatty acids (FA), that are beneficial to the maintenance of good health and that may offer therapeutic options by dietary supplementation. The review also considers the damaging effects of stress, especially in pre-existing conditions of obesity and diabetes, as studied in both animals and humans. The main focus of this brief review is to examine the effects of a high fat diet on stress and the immune system with particular emphasis on brain and cognitive function.
