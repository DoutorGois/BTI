We identified a novel gene, kf-1, highly expressed in the normal cerebellum but not in the cerebral cortex, the expression of which could have been augmented in the cerebral cortex of a sporadic Alzheimer's disease patient. We cloned human and mouse entire kf-1 cDNAs encoding conserved 79 kDa proteins containing a zinc-binding RING-H2 finger motif at the carboxy-terminus as found in acetylcholine receptor-associated protein (RAPsyn). The 3'-untranslated regions are highly conserved between human and mouse as to constitute a common mRNA secondary structure. In situ hybridization analysis of mouse brain sections revealed strong kf-1 expression in the cerebellum and hippocampus. We propose that KF-1 is involved in membranous protein-sorting apparatus similarly to RAPsyn. We mapped the human kf-1 gene to 2p11.2.
