Recreational use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA;"ecstasy") poses worldwide potential health problems. Clinical studies show that repeated exposure to low oral doses of MDMA has toxic effects on the brain, altering cognitive and psychosocial behavior. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in conscious marmoset monkeys was used to evaluate the sensitivity of the brain to an oral dose of MDMA (1 mg/kg). Following MDMA administration, the midbrain raphe nuclei and substantia nigra, major sources of serotonin and dopamine, were activated as were the hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala. The corticostriatal circuit of dorsal thalamus, sensorimotor cortex and basal ganglia showed a robust, coherent activation pattern. Two key reward areas, the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, and most other cortical regions showed little activation. The visual cortex, however, showed intense activation without applied visual stimuli. These data identify brain areas and functional circuits sensitive to a recreational dose of MDMA, some of which may be vulnerable to long-term intermittent exposure to this drug.
