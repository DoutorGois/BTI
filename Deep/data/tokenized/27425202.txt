Over the past years, extensive research in experimental cognitive neuroscience has provided a comprehensive understanding about the role of ionotropic glutamate receptor (IGluR)-dependent signaling underpinning postsynaptic plasticity induced by long-term potentiation (LTP), the leading cellular basis of long-term memory (LTM). However, despite the fact that iGluR-mediated postsynaptic plasticity regulates the formation and persistence of LTP and LTM, here we discuss the state-of-the-art regarding the mechanisms underpinning both LTP and LTM decay. First, we review the crucial roles that iGluRs play on memory encoding and stabilization. Second, we discuss the latest findings in forgetting considering hippocampal GluA2-AMPAR trafficking at postsynaptic sites as well as dendritic spine remodeling possibly involved in LTP decay. Third, on the role of retrieving consolidated LTMs, we discuss the mechanisms involved in memory destabilization that occurs followed reactivation that share striking similarities with the neurobiological basis of forgetting. Fourth, since different AMPAR subunits as well as postsynaptic scaffolding proteins undergo ubiquitination, the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is discussed in light of memory decay. In conclusion, we provide an integrated overview revealing some of the mechanisms determining memory forgetting that are mediated by iGluRs.
