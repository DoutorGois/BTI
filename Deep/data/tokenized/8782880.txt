The distribution and subcellular localization of AH9 antigen, recognized by a monoclonal antibody AH9, were examined in rat brain. Highest expression was observed in the lamina lucidum of the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampus. Synaptic subfields of other limbic areas also expressed AH9 antigen at a substantial level. The molecular size of the AH9 antigen is 15 kDa and it was found in the microsomal fraction of brain but not of heart or kidney. These results indicate that AH9 antigen is a novel synaptosomal protein that is relatively specific to the limbic system, at least in the rat brain. We designated AH9 antigen as a limbic system associated protein-1, lap-1.
