The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effects of 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG), an active component extracted from Polygonum multiflorum, on learning/memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We randomly divided 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats among 4 groups: (i) the sham-operated group (control); (ii) sham-operated group also treated with TSG (sham+TSG); (iii) beta amyloid treated group (Abeta); and (iv) Abeta treatment group also treated with TSG (Abeta+TSG). Rats in the Abeta and Abeta+TSG groups were treated with Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) intracerebroventricularly, whereas the control and sham+TSG groups were given phosphate-buffered saline. Rats in the sham+TSG and Abeta+TSG groups were then treated intragastrically with TSG (50 mg.(kg body mass)(-)(1).day(-)(1)) for 4 weeks, and rats in the Abeta and control groups were treated with saline. The results from Morris water maze tests, electron microscopy, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting demonstrated that Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) induced impairment in learning and memory, degeneration in synaptic structures, and downregulation of Src and NR2B at the gene and protein level, respectively. These alterations were reversed by the administration of TSG, suggesting that TSG exerts anti-AD properties by protecting synaptic structure and function. TSG-induced upregulation of Src and NR2B may be responsible for this process.
