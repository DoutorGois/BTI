Stem cells capable of proliferating along neuronal and glial lines persist in the adult central nervous system (CNS). These cells are found pedominantly in the subventricular zones and in the hippocampus. The therapeutic potential of both endogenous and exogenous stem cells in achieving repair of the injured CNS is being explored. Stem cells from embyonal lines, mescnchymal stromal cells and neural stem cells are being investigated for their potential role in the management of neural loss due to traumatic hypoxic or inflammatory insult.
