The rhythmic activity of CA1 hippocampal neurons was studied after the rhythmic (1-2 Hz) electrocutaneous forelimb stimulation (10-20 min) of 6-84-months-old rabbits. The spectral analysis of neuronal activity revealed the age-dependent decrease in ability to reproduce the rhythm of stimulation. The cytochemical data showed that the protein synthesis in the neurons under study also declined with age.
