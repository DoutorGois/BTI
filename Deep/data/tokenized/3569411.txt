A single injection of cysteamine, 200 mg/kg i.p., administered 4 h before a kindling session induces long-term suppression of kindled seizures. Injection of cysteamine 2, 4 or 6 h after or 24 h before the kindling session is either less effective or ineffective. The present series of experiments shows that the injection-to-kindled seizure interval is critically important for the long-term inhibition. We propose that the anticonvulsant effect is caused by an interaction of the cysteamine and the kindled seizure.
