Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype modulates the risk of Alzheimer's disease. ApoE has been shown essential for amyloid beta-peptide fibrillogenesis and deposition, a defining pathological feature of this disease. Because astrocytes and microglia represent the major source of extracellular apoE in brain, we investigated apoE secretion by glia. We determined that protein prenylation is required for apoE release from a continuous microglial cell line, primary mixed glia, and from organotypic hippocampal cultures. Using selective protein prenylation inhibitors, apoE secretion was found to require protein geranylgeranylation. This prenylation involved a protein critical to apoE secretion, not apoE proper. ApoE secretion could also be suppressed by inhibiting synthesis of mevalonate, the precursor to both types of protein prenylation, using hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Recent reports have described the beneficial effects of statins on the risk of dementia. Our finding that protein geranylgeranylation is required for apoE secretion in the brain parenchyma provides another contributing mechanism to explain the effective properties of statins against the development of dementia. In this model, statin-mediated inhibition of mevalonate synthesis, an essential reaction in forming geranylgeranyl lipid, would lower extracellular levels of parenchymal apoE. Because apoE has been found necessary for plaque development in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease, suppressing apoE secretion by statins could reduce plaques and, in turn, improve cognitive function.
