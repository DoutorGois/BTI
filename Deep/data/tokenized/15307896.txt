Despite a preponderance of studies demonstrating gene expression and/or enzymatic activation of calpain and caspase proteases after traumatic brain injury (TBI), no studies have examined the effects of injury magnitude on expression levels of these cell death effectors after TBI. Determination of the degree to which injury severity affects specific expression profiles is critical to understanding the relevant pathways contributing to post-trauma pathology and for developing targeted therapeutics. This investigation tested the hypothesis that different injury magnitudes (1.0, 1.2, and 1.6 mm) cause alterations in the regional and temporal patterns of mRNA expression of calpain-related (calpain-1 and -2, calpastatin) and caspase-related (caspases -3, -8, -9, BID) gene products after cortical impact in rats. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to compare effects of injury severity on mRNA levels in ipsilateral (injured) cortex and hippocampus, 6 h to 5 days post-injury. TBI caused increases in mRNA expression of all proteins examined, with the highest expression detected in the cortex. Generally, injury magnitude and levels of gene expression were positively correlated. High levels of gene induction were observed with BID, caspase-3, and -8, while caspase-9 mRNA had the lowest level of induction. Interestingly, although calpains are activated within minutes of TBI, calpain mRNA expression was highest 72 h to 5 days post-TBI. This study is the first analysis of the regional and temporal expression of calpains and caspases after TBI. These data provide insight into the inter-relationship of these two protease families and on the distinct but overlapping cascades of cell death after TBI.
