Effect of stereotaxic injuries to the medial temporal brain structures on memorization of material presented successively or simultaneously was studied. The study aimed at testing whether stereotaxic damage to the hippocampus and amygdala results in a memory deficit and whether functions subserved by those structures depend on type and organization of the memorized material. The results indicate that even small damage to the medial temporal lobe structures may result in a deficit in memorization ability. The greatest impairment was observed for successive presentation of nonverbal stimuli.
