Brief forebrain ischemia in rodents causes delayed neuronal death selectively in the CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus. Treatment with a reversible protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, significantly reduced the occurrence of delayed neuronal death in the Mongolian gerbil. This result indicates that de novo synthesis of certain protein(s), collectively termed 'killer protein' is required, possibly due to deprivation of nerve growth factor or other trophic factors.
