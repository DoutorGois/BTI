Immune activation can exert multiple effects on synaptic transmission. Our study demonstrates the influence of neonatal vaccination on hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats under normal physiological conditions. The results revealed that neonatal BCG vaccination enhanced synaptic plasticity. In contrast, HBV hampered it. Furthermore, we found that the cytokine balance shifted in favour of the T helper type 1/T helper type 2 immune response in BCG/HBV-vaccinated rats in the periphery. The peripheral IFN-gamma:IL-4 ratio was positively correlated with BDNF and IGF-1 in the hippocampus. BCG raised IFN-gamma, IL-4, BDNF and IGF-1 and reduced IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in the hippocampus, whereas, HBV triggered the opposite effects.
