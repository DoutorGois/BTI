BACKGROUND: Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are at risk for Alzheimer's dementia but the presence of amyloid (Abeta) strongly increases this risk. In clinical settings, when Abeta status is not available, different neurodegenerative markers are used to characterize MCI. The accuracy of these markers to discriminate between Abeta-and Abeta+ MCI is not yet determined. OBJECTIVE: To compare different markers of neurodegeneration in Abeta-and Abeta+ MCI, with an Abeta-elderly control (EC) group. METHODS: Patients with MCI (n = 39) and EC (n = 28) underwent MRI, 18F-FDG PET, and Abeta PET (18F-flutemetamol). We compared FDG and MRI biomarker values in cortical and hippocampal regions of interest, and using voxel-wise surface maps. We computed ROC curves discriminating between the three groups for each biomarker. RESULTS: All biomarker values were reduced in Abeta+ MCI compared to EC (p < 0.001). Abeta-MCI had low cortical metabolism (p = 0.002), but hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, and hippocampal metabolism were not significantly different between Abeta-MCI and EC (p > 0.40). Cortical metabolism best discriminated between MCI and EC (AUC = 0.92/0.86, Abeta+/Abeta-) while hippocampal volume best discriminated between Abeta-MCI and Abeta+ MCI (AUC = 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Cortical hypometabolism was observed in both Abeta-MCI and Abeta+ MCI whereas hippocampal atrophy was mostly found in Abeta+ MCI. For MCI patients without available Abeta information, hippocampal atrophy is thus more informative about Abeta status than cortical hypometabolism.
