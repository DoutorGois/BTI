[Arg8]vasopressin improved long-term retrieval processes and relearning in a go-no go visual discrimination task when bilaterally microinjected at a dose of 25 pg/animal into the ventral hippocampus of mice, 10 min prior to the retention session. We had shown that this enhancing effect is antagonized by pretreatment with equal or lower doses (25 pg or 1 ng) of the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, (d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)-vasopressin). The present study was an attempt to determine whether the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist or oxytocin receptor antagonist is as effective as the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist to block the behavioral effect of vasopressin in the ventral hippocampus. We tested the effect of 25 pg of [d(CH2)5-D-Ile2,Ile4,Arg8]vasopressin, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, and [d(CH2)5,Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr-NH9(2)]ornithine vasotocin, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, under the same experimental conditions as those used to test the effect of the vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist. The results showed that the vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist microinjected into the ventral hippocampus did not alter the enhancing effect of vasopressin on retrieval and relearning. In contrast, the oxytocin receptor antagonist blocked the vasopressin-enhancing effect on retention processes. We can conclude from the data that both vasopressin V1 receptors and oxytocin receptors seem to be involved in the enhancing effect of vasopressin on memory retention. In contrast, the vasopressin V2 receptors do not seem to be involved in the effect of the peptide.
