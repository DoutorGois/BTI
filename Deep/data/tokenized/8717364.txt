Cholecystokinin (CCK) can be a potent anticonvulsant neuropeptide in certain seizure models. Therefore, we examined whether seizures produced by electrical kindling of the amygdala or electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) would affect the expression of CCK mRNA in rat brain. Following a single kindled seizure, CCK mRNA expression was decreased about 20-58% in the amygdala. In contrast, after multiple consecutive kindled seizures, CCK mRNA expression was increased in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, CA1 pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and dentate hilus. A single ECS produced no effect on CCK mRNA expression, but multiple ECS increased expression in the interneurons of the hippocampus 24 h after the last seizure. Since seizures produced by ECS can be anticonvulsant to further ECS or kindled seizures, the CCK increases in the hippocampus may represent a compensatory anticonvulsant adaptation observed in both models. Overall, the kindling-induced alterations in CCK expression appear to be more complex involving multiple brain regions and distinct temporal properties.
