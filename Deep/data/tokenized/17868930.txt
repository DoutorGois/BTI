Attention to addiction of women alone for fetus and infant's health has caused the possible role of father's status was less considered, while some developmental impairments including decrease of liter size, weight loss, congenital deficiencies, behavioral disorders, and learning and memory impairments in offspring with addicted father have been reported. In this study the effects of addiction of one or both parents to morphine on male and female offspring hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), were assessed. One hundred twenty female and 48 male rats (4-5 months, 250-270 g) were used. Forty females and 16 males were addicted by oral administration of morphine (32 mg/kg twice daily) for 5 days before mating. Then each two males with five females were housed (coupled) per cage as five groups for coupling: (A) addicted females+5% dextrose males (add.F); (B) addicted males+5% dextrose females (add.M); (C) addicted females+addicted males (add.MF); (D) 5% dextrose females+intact males (dex.F); (E) 5% dextrose males+intact females (dex.M). In puberty offspring LTP was induced in hippocampal dentate gyrus by stimulation of perforant path (pp). Changes of population spikes (PS) amplitude and LTP slope at 0, 5, 30, 60 and 120 min were evaluated. Slope of LTP at 30, 60 and 120 min, and amplitude of PS at 60 and 120 min in add.F and add.M offspring were significantly lower than dextrose groups (P<0.01). LTP slope and PS amplitude of male and female offspring did not different between add.F and add.M groups. Our results suggest that both parental and paternal addiction to morphine may cause memory deficiency through reduction of LTP in hippocampus.
