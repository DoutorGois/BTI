SUMMARY: Although ATP and P2X receptor activity have been lately associated with epilepsy, little is known regarding their exact roles in epileptogenesis. Temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) in rat was induced by pilocarpine in order to study changes of hippocampal P2X(2), P2X(4) and P2X(7) receptor expression during acute, latent or chronic phases of epilepsy. During acute and chronic phases increased P2X(7) receptor expression was principally observed in glial cells and glutamatergic nerve terminals, suggesting participation of this receptor in the activation of inflammatory and excitotoxic processes during epileptogenesis. No significant alterations of hippocampal P2X(2) and P2X(4) receptor expression was noted during the acute or latent phase when compared to the control group, indicating that these receptors are not directly involved with the initiation of epilepsy. However, the reduction of hippocampal P2X(4) receptor immunostaining in the chronic phase could reflect neuronal loss or decreased GABAergic signaling.
