Depletion of dopamine (DA) in neonatal rats by cerebroventricular infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine with desmethylimipramine resulted in a significant decrease in mesolimbic immunoreactive cholecystokinin-8-sulfate (CCK-8SI) and a marked increase in striatal serotonin in 10-week-old rats. In contrast, neonatal norepinephrine (NE) depletion did not affect either CCK-8SI or serotonin in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex or hippocampus. Neonatal DA and NE depletion did not induce an increase in striatal serotonin.
