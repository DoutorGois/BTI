Treatment of bovine brain cell membranes with dithiothreitol decreases the affinity without changing binding capacity for [3H]flunitrazepam in the cerebellum, hippocampus and frontal cortex. Specific binding of beta-[3H]carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester in the cerebellum and frontal cortex was influenced by dithiothreitol in a similar manner. However, in the hippocampus the binding of this inverse agonist was modified by dithiothreitol in another way: a significant (25%) decrease of binding capacity, or (and) appearance of heterogeneity of binding sites was detected. Sensitivity of benzodiazepine receptors to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) stimulation was not changed by dithiothreitol.
