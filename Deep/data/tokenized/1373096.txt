1. The effects of chronic treatment with the dihydropyridine, Bay K 8644, were studied on the ethanol withdrawal syndrome, in vivo and in vitro. 2. Addition of racemic Bay K 8644 to the drinking mixture, throughout the chronic ethanol treatment, decreased the behavioural excitability seen during ethanol withdrawal in vivo. 3. All the signs of hyperexcitability in field potentials in the isolated hippocampal slice, caused by ethanol withdrawal, were decreased by the chronic administration of Bay K 8644. 4. These effects resembled those previously reported for chronic administration of calcium channel antagonists; racemic Bay K 8644 has both calcium channel activating and antagonist properties. 5. Measurement of brain levels of Bay K 8644 at the end of the chronic treatment showed that the compound reached micromolar concentrations during the treatment, but none could be detected in the tissues at the time of the above measurements. 6. It is possible that the results might be explained by predominance of the calcium channel antagonist properties of this compound, owing to the high central concentrations achieved during the treatment. Tolerance to the calcium channel activating properties of Bay K 8644 may also have occurred during the chronic treatment.
