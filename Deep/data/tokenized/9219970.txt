Neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease are composed of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Based on biochemical criteria, several enzymes have emerged as potential tau protein kinases, including the extracellularly regulated kinases 1, 2 and 3. In situ hybridization was used to map the messenger RNA distribution of extracellularly regulated kinase 1, 2 and 3 in the adult rat brain and their response to excitotoxic hippocampal lesions was examined. Extracellularly regulated kinase 1 messenger RNA was uniformly expressed by glia, but was also present in the dentate gyrus and some other neuronal populations. Extracellularly regulated kinase 2 was exclusively neuronal and concentrated within the cortical laminae and the CA subfields of the hippocampal formation. Extracellularly regulated kinase 3 messenger RNA expression was similar to extracellularly regulated kinase 2 and was also present in neurons but the level of expression was lower. Extracellularly regulated kinases 2 and 3 messenger RNA expression was lost following excitotoxic injury, further supporting a neuronal localization. Extracellularly regulated kinase 1 messenger RNA expression appeared unaltered, suggesting a non-neuronal localization and lack of responsiveness to lesion at the level of transcription. By contrast, messenger RNA of sgk, a recently described serine/threonine kinase, was up-regulated by glial cells following excitotoxic injury. Based on their messenger RNA distribution, cellular localization and response to lesion, it is clear that each kinase may function differently in various signaling pathways. Extracellularly regulated kinase 2, however, is the only kinase with the proper messenger RNA distribution to contribute to neurofibrillary tangle formation in Alzheimer's disease.
