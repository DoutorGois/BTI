Transverse slices of the rat hippocampus were used to examine the ability of phosphonate analogues of acidic amino acids to inhibit perforant path synaptic transmission. Micromolar concentrations of L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (APB), an analogue of L-glutamic acid, inhibited transmission from the lateral entorhinal cortex. Two other less-sensitive components were detected in projections from the medial entorhinal cortex. The component from the lateral entorhinal cortex showed high stereospecificity for the L-isomer of APB and was relatively insensitive to phosphonate homologues of shorter and longer chain length.
