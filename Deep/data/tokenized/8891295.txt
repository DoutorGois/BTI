The relative contribution of adenosine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for the hypoxia-induced depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices, was investigated. It is concluded that both adenosine and GABA, by activating A1 and GABAA receptors, could be responsible for the inhibition of synaptic transmission during hypoxia, but the action of endogenous GABA becomes evident only when the adenosine A1 receptor action is precluded.
