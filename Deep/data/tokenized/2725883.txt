We performed neuropsychological testing in 2 patients during subclinical hippocampal seizures recorded with depth electrodes. Neither subject showed impairment of consciousness, orientation, motor skills, or verbal fluency. The rapidity of recall of a well-learned word list was impaired in 1 subject during ictal fast spiking in the left hippocampus. Subclinical seizure activity may be responsible for a portion of the memory deficits found in patients with epilepsy.
