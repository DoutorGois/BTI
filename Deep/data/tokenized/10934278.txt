Previous studies have shown that the expression of the neuropeptide galanin in the hippocampus is altered by seizures and that exogenous administration of galanin into the hippocampus attenuates seizure severity. To address the role of endogenous galanin in modulation of hippocampal excitability and its possible role in seizure mechanisms, we studied two types of transgenic mice: mice with a targeted disruption of the galanin gene (GalKO) and mice that overexpress the galanin gene under a dopamine-beta-hydroxylase promoter (GalOE). GalKO mice showed increased propensity to develop status epilepticus after perforant path stimulation or systemic kainic acid, as well as greater severity of pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions. By contrast, GalOE mice had increased resistance to seizure induction in all three models. Physiological tests of hippocampal excitability revealed enhanced perforant path-dentate gyrus long-term potentiation (LTP) in GalKO and reduced LTP in GalOE. GalKO showed increased duration of afterdischarge (AD) evoked from the dentate gyrus by perforant path simulation, whereas GalOE had increased threshold for AD induction. Depolarization-induced glutamate release from hippocampal slices was greater in GalKO and lower in GalOE, suggesting that alterations of physiological and seizure responses in galanin transgenic animals may be mediated through modulation of glutamate release. Our data provide further evidence that hippocampal galanin acts as an endogenous anticonvulsant and suggest that genetically induced changes in galanin expression modulate both hippocampal excitability and predisposition to epileptic seizures.
