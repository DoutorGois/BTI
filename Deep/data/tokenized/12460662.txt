Endosulfan (ES) and methyl parathion (MP) are widely used in Latin America, and simultaneous exposure to both products is documented. This exposure may have effects on the nervous system because their targets include the GABAergic and cholinergic systems, which are main modulators of neuronal excitability in the cortex and hippocampus. We tested whether low-level, repeated exposure of adult rats to commercial formulations containing ES and MP disrupts spatial learning in the water maze. Five groups of eight animals received subcutaneously appropriate dilutions of the commercial formulations to yield the following treatments during 10 days: saline, 25 mg/kg ES, 2 mg/kg MP (MP(2)), 25 mg/kg ES plus 1 mg/kg MP (ES+MP(1)) and 25 mg/kg ES plus 2 mg/kg MP (ES+MP(2)). In addition, markers of neurological function, renal and hepatic damage were explored as potential consequences of exposure. In the absence of overt toxicity, the groups exposed to the ES plus MP showed significantly longer escape latencies, higher number of failures to reach the platform and more time in the periphery of the tank than the control and single-exposed groups. This finding shows that commercial formulations of ES and MP have marginal effects when administered individually but can produce behavioral alterations when given in combination.
