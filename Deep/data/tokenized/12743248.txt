The authors describe three patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) following an episode of hypertensive encephalopathy as their only identified antecedent event. All patients had typical MR features of hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and the two operated cases had typical HS histology and became seizure-free postoperatively. These cases suggest that hypertensive encephalopathy may be a rare form of initial precipitating injury, leading to TLE and HS.
