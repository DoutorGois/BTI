Neurotensin immunoreactive neurons comprise the majority of large perikarya in the human subiculum and project axons to the alveus, fimbria, fornix and neuropil of the mammillary bodies. These regions are prominently involved in conditions such as Wernicke's and Alzheimer's disease in which memory is impaired. Neurotensin has potential significance as a peptide in a human brain circuit which may serve a role in memory processing.
