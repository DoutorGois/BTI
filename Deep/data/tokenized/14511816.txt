A new, easy to construct electrode, microdrive and headstage for electrophysiological recording system which is specifically adapted for freely behaving mice is described. The system uses printed circuit boards and light, flexible cables to enable the animal's free movement for behavioral testing. A clip attachment system permits rapid and secure connection of the headstage and cables to the microdrive assembly on the animal's head. The current system provides eight recording channels, but the design can be modified to accommodate additional channels.
