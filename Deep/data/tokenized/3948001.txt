Cysteamine has a biphasic effect in kindled rats. At a dose of 200 mg/kg (i.p.), hippocampal kindled rats all have myoclonic seizures during the first hour after injection, while naive rats seldom do. Four hours after cysteamine, the animals exhibited stage 5 seizures when stimulated. However, kindled seizures could not subsequently be elicited for up to 10 days in these animals.
