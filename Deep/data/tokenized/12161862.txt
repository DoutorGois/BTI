Energy metabolism state was studied in experiment and in epileptic patients with reference to the disease clinical course and antiepileptic drugs. Adjuvant pathogenetic treatment was validated. The use of drugs activating energy metabolism facilitate a long-term clinical and electroencephalographic compensation of epilepsy that is confirmed by positive histological dynamics in experiment. The compensation is accompanied by significant intensification of energy metabolism. According to experimental findings, such treatment prevents destructive and degenerative changes in neurons and epileptic encephalopathy development.
