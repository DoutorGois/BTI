This study was performed to determine whether the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) is increased in hippocampal CA3 neurons of spontaneously epileptic rats (SER) which show both absence-like and convulsive seizures using hippocampal slices loaded with Calcium Green-1 when a weak single stimulation is given to the mossy fiber. [Ca(2+)](i) in the CA3 area was significantly increased after a single stimulus to mossy fibers in SER, while no changes were detected in normal Wistar rats. These findings suggest the existence of an abnormality in the Ca(2+) channel in the SER CA3 region and that this is probably responsible for epileptic seizures.
