AIMS: To investigate the effects of sevoflurane inhalation on beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced cognitive disorders and hippocampal oxidative stress in rat models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cognitive dysfunction is induced by hippocampal injection of Abeta1-40 (10mug in 2mul) for 22days. To explore the effect of sevoflurane inhalation on Abeta1-40 induced cognitive disorder, two doses of sevoflurane inhalation are used: 1.3% (Abeta+S1) and 2.6% (Abeta+S2). Sham operation (Sham, for operation control), saline injection (Control, for injection control) and 30% oxygen inhalation after Abeta1-40 injection (Abeta+O2, for inhalation control) were used as controls. All rats were further tested in electrical Y-maze and Morris water maze. Serum S100beta levels, hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, S100beta expression and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were further quantified. KEY FINDINGS: Rats in Abeta+O2, Abeta+S1 and Abeta+S2 groups had lower number of correct actions in the electrical Y maze task, longer escape latencies, less time exploring the original platform, elevated serum S100beta levels, depressed hippocampal SOD activity, S100beta expression and higher MDA concentrations compared to control group (p<0.05). Such difference was not significant between Abeta+S1 and Abeta+O2 rats. Rats in Abeta+S2 group, however, showed significantly impaired performances compared to those in Abeta+S1 group (p<0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Sevoflurane (2.6%) can aggravate the Abeta-induced cognitive dysfunction, possibly via the intracerebral oxidative stress response.
