The medial amygdaloid nucleus (AME) sends a projection of fibers containing a peptide similar to arginine vasopressin (AVP) to the rat hippocampus. Electrical stimulation of the AME has an impact on evoked hippocampal field potentials that is identical to the effect obtained by applied AVP in vitro or in vivo. Here we show that the AVP-like peptide released by AME stimulation has action that is blocked by a structural AVP analog. The antagonist specificity suggests that the native transmitter is a peptide similar, but not identical, to AVP. We conclude that the AME projection to the hippocampus satisfies all the criteria for recognition as a central peptidergic system important in the generation of behavior.
