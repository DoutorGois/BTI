The association between hippocampal volume (as a presumed index of Alzheimer's disease pathology) with serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was studied in 86 elderly subjects with a range of cognitive functions. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total cholesterol, was associated with hippocampal volume and dementia. This is compatible with protective effects of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol on hippocampal atrophy and Alzheimer's disease.
