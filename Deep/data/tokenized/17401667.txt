Myb genes are a family of transcription factors and have been implicated in the control of the proliferation and differentiation of normal and transformed cells. c-Myb is the best characterized member of the myb family. In the present study, we investigated age-dependent changes of c-myb immunoreactivity, its protein and mRNA level in the hippocampus proper (CA1-3 regions) at various age stages in gerbils. In the postnatal month 1 (PM 1) group, c-myb immunoreactivity was detected in non-pyramidal neurons of the strata oriens and radiatum as well as in pyramidal neurons of the stratum pyramidale. At PM 3, c-myb immunoreactivity and its protein level were similar to those at PM 1. Thereafter, c-myb immunoreactivity and its protein level were increased with time. In the PM 24 group, c-myb immunoreactivity, its protein and mRNA levels were highest. These results suggest that the significant increase of c-myb immunoreactivity, protein and mRNA levels in the aged hippocampus may be associated with neuronal aging.
