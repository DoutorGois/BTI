As alterations in intracellular pH (pH(i)) tend to exert a profound effect on the properties of cells, this study was undertaken to examine NMDA-induced changes in pH(i) in rat hippocampal slices using the BCECF fluorescent technique. The 'resting' pH(i) in the CA1 pyramidal cell layers was 6.93 +/- 0.07 (mean +/- S.D., n = 72 slices) in 25 mM HCO3-/5% CO2-buffered solution at 37 degrees C. Exposure of hippocampal slices to NMDA in the range of 10-1000 microM produced a biphasic change in pH(i): an initial transient alkaline shift was followed by a long-lasting acid shift. Dizocilpine (10 microM) but not CNQX (40 microM) blocked the NMDA-induced changes in pH(i). In 0 Ca medium (0 mM Ca2+ supplemented 1 mM EGTA, referred to as 0 Ca), pH(i) acid shift caused by NMDA (20 microM) declined by about 11%, whereas the initial alkaline shift almost completely disappeared. In an independent experiment, the NMDA-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) was reduced by more than 80% in 0 Ca medium. Glucose substitution using equimolar pyruvate (as an energy-yielding substrate) suppressed this NMDA-induced pH(i) acid shift by two-thirds, while the NMDA-induced pH(i) alkaline shift was enhanced. Fluoride (10 mM), a glycolytic inhibitor, abolished NMDA-induced pH(i) acid shift. Furthermore, the lactate content of hippocampal slices was markedly increased following exposure to NMDA. In conclusion, activation of NMDA receptors in rat hippocampal slices evokes a biphasic change in pH(i). The initial alkaline shift is suggested to be associated with calcium influx, and the following acid shift may be caused by an increase in lactate production through the acceleration of glycolysis, as well as the increased [Ca2+]i. The pH(i) acid shift produced by the increased lactate may contribute to proton modulation of the NMDA receptor and NMDA-induced cell injury or death.
