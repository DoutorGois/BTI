To test the putative serotonin (5-HT)-like effect of zonisamide (ZNS) we employed xanthine-induced epileptiform activity in the hippocampus slice preparation from guinea pigs. In this model Na(+)- and T-type Ca(2+) channel blockers are hardly effective while 5-HT should be inhibitory. Bath application of 5-HT hyperpolarized neurons and abolished theophylline-induced epileptiform activity. In contrast, ZNS failed to alter epileptiform bursting. We conclude that 5-HT augmenting effects of ZNS are missing or are not sufficient to inhibit epileptiform activity in hippocampal slice preparations.
