Norepinephrine (NE) has widespread projections throughout the brain, and thus, is ideally positioned to orchestrate neural functions based on arousal state. For example, NE can increase "signal/noise" ratio in the processing of sensory stimuli, and can enhance long-term memory consolidation in the amygdala and hippocampus through actions at alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptors. Over the last 20 years, NE has also been shown to play a powerful role in regulating the working memory and attention functions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Moderate levels of NE released under control conditions strengthen prefrontal cortical functions via actions at post-synaptic alpha-2A adrenoceptors with high affinity for NE, while high levels of NE release during stress impair PFC cortical functions via alpha-1 and possibly beta-1 receptors with lower affinity for NE. Thus, levels of NE determine whether prefrontal cortical or posterior cortical systems control our behavior and thought. Understanding these receptor mechanisms has led to new intelligent treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders associated with PFC dysfunction.
