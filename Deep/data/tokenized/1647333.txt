Adrenalectomy as well as single or multiple hydrocortisone and ACTH administration have been studied for their effect on putrescine, spermidine and spermine contents, ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosyl-+methionine decarboxylase activities in the rat hypothalamic and hippocampal tissues and fraction of nervous endings. The data obtained prove complicated character of changes in polyamine metabolism in the studied structures when glucocorticoid level is disturbed. Hormone action is characterized by regional and intracellular specificity and depends upon the ratio of administration and the initial hormonal background of the organism. The significance of these changes for feedback regulation of ACTH secretion and metabolism of GABA is discussed.
