Hibernation is a state of extremely reduced physiological functions and a deep depression of CNS activity, which is thought to be under hippocampal control. Our previous findings indicate increased histamine turnover during hibernation in several brain regions, including the hippocampus. In this study we showed that histamine infused into the hippocampus significantly delayed arousal from hibernation. These findings indicate that histamine may contribute to maintaining the hibernating state, suggesting a novel role for histamine in controlling arousal state.
