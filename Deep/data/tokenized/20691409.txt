OBJECTIVE: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a dietary fatty acid with neuroprotective properties. We hypothesized that DHA treatment after hypoxia-ischemia would improve function and reduce brain volume loss in a perinatal rat model. STUDY DESIGN: Seven-day-old Wistar rat pups from 7 litters (n = 84) underwent right carotid ligation, followed by 8% O(2) for 90 minutes. Fifteen minutes after hypoxia-ischemia, pups were divided into 3 treatment groups (intraperitoneal injections of DHA 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg) and 2 control groups (25% albumin or saline). At 14 days, rats underwent vibrissae-stimulated forepaw placing testing, and bilateral regional volumes were calculated for cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and hemisphere. RESULTS: Posthypoxia-ischemia treatment with DHA acid significantly improved vibrissae forepaw placing (complete responses: 8.5 +/- 2 treatment vs 7.4 +/- 2 controls; normal = 10; P = .032, t test). Postinjury DHA treatment did not attenuate brain volume loss in any region. CONCLUSION: Posthypoxia-ischemia DHA treatment significantly improves functional outcome.
