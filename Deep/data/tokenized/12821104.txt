This study tested the effects of different hypertension models on active avoidance learning in rats. Three-month-old male Wistar rats were divided randomly into six groups as follows: control (C), sham operated (sham), two kidney-one clip (2K-1C), one kidney-one clip (1K-1C), deoxycorticosterone-salt (DOCA), and N-omega-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) groups. Mean arterial blood pressures were significantly higher in four hypertensive groups compared with control and sham groups. The active avoidance training results indicated that hypertension state is associated with learning impairment. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were determined as an indicator of lipid peroxidation in brain and hippocampus. Additionally, brain and hippocampus nitrite levels were studied.
