The effect of a selective kappa-opioid agonist, U-50, 488H, on wet-dog shaking (WDS) induced by hippocampal stimulation was investigated and compared with that produced by morphine. U-50, 488H, as well as morphine, inhibited the appearance of WDS in a dose-dependent manner. U-50, 488H was approximately three times more potent than morphine in this effect. Neither drug showed any effect on hippocampal afterdischarge. The inhibition of WDS produced by U-50, 488H was blocked significantly by a kappa-opioid antagonist, MR-2266, but not by naloxone. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of morphine was completely antagonized by both MR-2266 and naloxone. The present results strongly suggest that not only mu-but also kappa-opioid receptors are involved in the appearance of WDS induced by hippocampal stimulation.
