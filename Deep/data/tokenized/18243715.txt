Aluminum and silicon have been observed to be present in the human degenerated brain and normal elderly brains by using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray spectrometry (EDS-SEM). Al and Si of electric organs were also reported--in electrocytes and cholinergic nerves--from living electric fish (family Rajidae). A biogenically produced crystalline mineral phase (i.e., chalcedony) has also been observed in electric organs by using a mineralogical microscope. Based on this evidence we decided to explore the presence of chalcedony (SiO2) in the human central nervous system (CNS). Sections from aged patients (mean, 81 years) were collected after autopsy and observed using a Leica DMLP mineralogical microscope. Chalcedony was detected in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In plane-polarized light, chalcedony is rounded in shape, 12-20 microm in size, translucent, with a low refraction index. The crossed-polarizer image shows first order birefringence color (grey-white) and radial extinction. Chalcedony was also detected in the hippocampus in large amounts and sizes (50-60 microm). Chalcedony is a microcrystalline fibrous form of silica. It consists of nanoscale intergrowths of quartz and the optically length-slow fibrous silica polymorph moganite. Chalcedony precipitation occurs at a specific pH (7-8) and oxidation potential (Eh; 0.0 to -0.2) in geological environments. This observation supports the important role played by pH and Eh conditions in silica precipitation in elderly brains, as has also been reported in peripheral cholinergic nerves in electric organ from living electric fish. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) (silicase) are involved in physiological pH regulation and may also be participating in the polymerization-depolymerization of chalcedony in the human brain. This is the first time a biogenically produced crystalline mineral phase (i.e., chalcedony) has been observed in the human CNS from aged patients.
