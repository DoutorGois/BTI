Following 1-4 days of food-deprivation (FD) male rats were sacrificed. The pituitary and different regions of brain were analyzed for beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-EI), dynorphin (dyn) and methionine-enkephalin (ME) content by RIA. Pituitary beta-EI increased by 16, 28 and 43% on days 2, 3 and 4 of FD. In striatum also, beta-EI increased by 140 and 176% on days 2 and 3 of FD. Dyn level in pituitary was not affected but decreased in hypothalamus by 20% and in striatum by 73% on the 4th day of FD. There was a significant decrease (33-55%) in ME levels in striatum, hippocampus and cortex on 4th day of FD. When food-deprived rats were fed for 24 hr, concentration of most of the opioid peptides returned to basal level. These results suggest that FD in rats affects the opioid peptide levels in a differential manner.
