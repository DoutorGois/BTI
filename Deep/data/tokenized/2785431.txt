Deoxycoformycin, a potent and specific adenosine deaminase antagonist, reduced ischemic hippocampal damage and the associated hypermotility in Mongolian gerbils. Cerebral ischemia was induced by a bilateral 5 min occlusion of the carotid arteries. Deoxycoformycin (500 micrograms/kg IP), administered 15 min prior to ischemia, prevented the increase in locomotor activity normally observed with this model and significantly reduced the ischemia-induced damage to CA1 hippocampal neurons. The results suggest that deoxycoformycin may be useful in the prevention of brain damage due to cerebral ischemia.
