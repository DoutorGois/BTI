The rapid suppression of CNS function produced by cyanide (CN) was studied by field, intracellular, and whole-cell recording in hippocampal slices (at 33-34 degrees C). Population spikes and field EPSPs were depressed by 4-5 min bath applications of 50-100 microM CN (IC50 was 18 miroM for spikes and 72 microM for EPSPs). The actions of CN were reversibly suppressed by the adenosine antagonists 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (8-SPT; 10 microM) and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX; 0.2 microM), potentiated by the adenosine transport inhibitor dipyridamole (0.5 microM), but unaffected by the KATP channel blocker glyburide (10 microM). Therefore the CN-induced reductions of synaptic efficacy and postsynaptic excitability-demonstrated by synaptic input:output plots-are mediated mainly by adenosine. In whole-cell or intracellular recordings, CN depressed EPSCs and elicited an increase in input conductance and an outward current, the reversal potential of which was approximately -90 mV (indicating that K+ was the major carrier). These effects also were attenuated by 8-SPT. In the presence of 1 mM Ba, CN had no significant postsynaptic action; Cs (2 mM) also prevented CN-induced outward currents but only partly blocked the increase in conductance. Another 8-SPT-sensitive action of CN was to depress hyperpolarization-activated slow inward relaxations (Q current). At room temperature (22-24 degrees C), although it did not change holding current and slow inward relaxations, CN raised the input conductance; this effect also was prevented by 8-SPT (10 microM), but not by glyburide (10 microM). Adenosine release thus appears to be the major link between acute CN poisoning and early depression of CNS synaptic function.
