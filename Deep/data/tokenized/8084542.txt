Nitric oxide (NO) may mediate some of the toxic effects of the excitatory amino acid (EAA) glutamate when there is overactivation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. In the developing rodent nervous system, NMDA neurotoxicity peaks at postnatal day 7. To assess whether NO toxicity exhibits a similar developmental profile, we injected the NO generator sodium nitroprusside into the immature and adult rodent hippocampal formation and striatum, using a dose known to damage the adult nervous system. Contrary to our expectations, we found the immature brain highly resistant to the toxic effects of sodium nitroprusside.
