The effects of aging on the efficiency of RNA processing of AMPA glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits GluR1, GluR2, and GluR 3 was examined for RNA editing at the Q/R site of GluR2 and for alternative splicing of the flip or flop exons for GluR1-3. RNA isolated from six young (3 months old) and old (22-23 months old) animals was reverse-transcribed for PCR and restriction endonuclease analyses to distinguish between edited forms of GluR2 and flip/flop isoforms of GluR1-3. Unedited transcripts of GluR2 at the Q/R site (which controls calcium permeability) were not detected (at the limit of detection of >/= 2.5%) from the corticies and hippocampi of young and old animals. Distribution of flop/flip isoforms in the cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striatum varied between GluR subunits and brain region, with GluR2 showing the greatest differences. However, no differences in alternative splicing of GluRs 1-3 were observed between young and old animals, suggesting that the fidelity of GluR transcript processing remains intact in the brains of aged animals.
