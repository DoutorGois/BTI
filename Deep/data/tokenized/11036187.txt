The cholecystokinin receptor, subtype 2 (CCK(2)R), is considered, based on receptor autoradiography, to be the predominant receptor for this peptide transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. To directly visualize the CCK(2)R we utilized a convenient and sensitive immunohistochemical procedure using antipeptide receptor antibodies raised in rabbits against unique portions of the carboxyl tail and third intracellular loop of the CCK(2)R. Antibodies were characterized by ELISA and Western blotting, and used for immunohistochemistry in rat brain sections. Studies with both antibodies revealed a widespread topographic distribution of CCK(2)R-like immunoreactivity (CCK(2)R-LI) in regions such as cortex, olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, septum, striatum, hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, habenula, hypothalamus, thalamus, ventral mesencephalon, inferior colliculus, parabrachial nucleus, pontine nucleus, supercolliculus, red nucleus, subcommisural and occulomotor nucleus, area postrema, solitary, olivary, cochlear, cuneate and trigeminal nuclei and spinal cord dorsal horn in agreement with the results of previous receptor autoradiography.
