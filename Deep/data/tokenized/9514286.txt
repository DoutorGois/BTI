Optical methods can usefully augment classical techniques such as electrical recording for investigating cellular and network physiology. Here, recent developments in optical methods--including confocal and nonlinear fluorescence imaging, semiconductor array imaging, and improved fluorescent indicators of ion concentration and transmembrane electrical potential--are briefly reviewed, and examples are offered that may suggest potential applications to experimental studies in alcoholism research.
