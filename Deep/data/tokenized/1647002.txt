The mechanism of arginine vasopressin (AVP) action in the rat hippocampus has been determined. The peptide activates inhibitory interneurons and constricts cerebral microvessels. In the whole animal, each of these direct actions has secondary consequences for the excitability of pyramidal cells. Recent studies have shown that a peptide similar to AVP mediates endogenous neurotransmission in the hippocampus. Here we report experiments showing that the endogenous peptide activates the same mechanisms as exogenously applied AVP. The endogenous AVP-like peptide has no effect on the presynaptic fiber volley, or on pure somatic and dendritic postsynaptic potentials. These results are taken to exclude presynaptic mechanisms as explanations for the peptide's action. The endogenously released peptide inhibits individual pyramidal cells in single unit recording and excites presumed interneurons, just as AVP itself is known to act. The endogenous peptide is released only by stimuli applied to a nucleus that contains immunoreactive AVP and projects to the hippocampus.
