The APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits remarkable elevation of beta-amyloid production associated with certain behavioral abnormalities, while the senescence accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) is characterized by early and age-related deterioration of learning and memory. In order to obtain an AD model that develops earlier pathological changes and cognitive impairment, we generated SAMP8-APP/PS1, a novel senescence accelerated APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model of AD. Standard histological staining and immunohistochemistry using an amyloid beta (Abeta) antibody showed an age, genotype and strain-dependent progression of amyloid deposition and neuron loss in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of SAMP8-APP/PS1 mice. Results from the cognitive behavioral tests revealed early deficits in learning and memory in SAMP8-APP/PS1 mice in the two way active avoidance and Morris water maze tests compared with C57-APP/PS1, SAMP8 wild-type and control mice. These results suggest that accelerated senescence exacerbates amyloid deposition and cognitive dysfunction in APP/PS1 mice and the senescence accelerated-APP/PS1 (SAMP8-APP/PS1) mouse model might be a valuable tool to study AD progression and to evaluate the effect of drugs on AD.
