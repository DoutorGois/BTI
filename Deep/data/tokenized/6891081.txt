A simple behavioral paradigm is described in which hippocampal electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythmical slow activity (RSA) frequency shifts can be correlated with other central or behavioral events. Rabbits placed in various postures right spontaneously in a relatively stereotyped way. The movements are associated with RSA frequency shifts and the highest RSA frequencies occur when rabbits right from an inverted posture. The peak RSA frequency is correlated with rapid heat rotation. Not only does this paradigm provide a simple way of studying RSA frequency correlates, the results obtained in its description suggest that there is a close relation between the speed with which a movement is initiated rather than with the distance that an animal is carried by the movement.
