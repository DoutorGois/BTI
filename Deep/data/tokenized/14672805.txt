Scrapie is a fatal, but slow, infectious disease. C57BL/6J, SAMP8 (a strain that develops early senescence), SAMR1 (a strain that is resistant to senescence) and AKR/J (a progenitor of the SAM strains) mice were infected with 22A, 139A, 22L and ME7 scrapie strains. Histopathological stains included haematoxylin and eosin (HE), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Vacuolation was found in the brains of all scrapie-infected mice. The 22A strain caused more extensive vacuolation in the brains of SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice than in C57BL mice. PAS-positive plaques (PP) were found in 22A-infected mice in cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, subependymal zone area and thalamus. PP were significantly increased in 22A-infected SAMR1 mice compared to mice from other scrapie-infected strains. Clusters of small, round, homogeneous PAS-positive granular structures (PGS) were found in all mouse strains, especially in aging control and 22A-infected C57BL mice, predominantly in the stratum radiatum of the CA1, CA2 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus. Some of these structures were also observed in stratum oriens and piriform cortex, and in cerebellar Purkinje cell areas. Some of the PGS were associated with astrocytes and blood vessels. Each granule was 1-5 microm in diameter and there were clusters consisting of several to 40 PGS; the sizes of the clusters ranged from 10 to 80 microm in diameter. There were more PGS clusters in uninfected C57BL and AKR mice than in uninfected SAMP8 and SAMR1 mice. PGS were not increased in scrapie-infected mice. These findings suggest that PGS accumulation was more dependent on the genetic information of the mouse strain, whereas PP and vacuolation patterns depended on the scrapie strain-mouse strain combination.
