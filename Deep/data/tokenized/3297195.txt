Computer analysis of the maps of distribution of intensively labelled neurons (ILN) in the frontal sections of area 6 of the frontal neocortex and area CA 1 of the dorsal hippocamp was performed in 1-day-old mice who received a single injection of 3H-thymidine on the 13th-17th day of embryogenesis (E 13-E 17). It has been revealed that ILN are distributed in rather close, vertically oriented groups. In mice exposed to isotope in E 14-E 16, the average number of ILN in a group was 4.44 +/- 0.25 for area 6 and 4.35 +/- 0.16 for area CA 1. The data available have confirmed an earlier postulated hypothesis on the discrete arrangement of neurogenesis loci in the ventricular zone of the embryonic brain. Additional calculations have allowed to conclude that in E 14-E 16 period the locus of the ventricular neocortex during one mitotic cycle produces 7-9 cells starting the neuronal differentiation, while during the whole period of neurogenesis in the neocortex the column consisting of 84-108 neurons is formed, which is close to the number of neurons in a minicolumn of the neocortex (110 cells).
