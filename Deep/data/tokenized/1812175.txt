Implantation of an embryonal hippocampal tissue suspension into the area of the kainic acid lesion brought about an increase of the number of neurons. These neurons formed dendritic trees of an irregular pattern. Only neurons located within the pyramidal layer had the typical arrangement of pyramidal cells, but their dendrites were shorter and less branched.
