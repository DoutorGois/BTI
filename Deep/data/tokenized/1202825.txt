In experiments on alert rabbits high frequency stimulation of the CA1 field of the dorsal hippocampus reduced the peak latency of the main negative component of the evoked potential (EP) to a light flash in the sensorimotor and occipital tests areas of the cerebral cortex. A single stimulation of the same part of the hippocampus resulted in a gradually developing facilitation of secondary negativity of the EP 5th component, predominantly in the sensorimotor cortex. Investigation of neuronal responses in the same cortical areas to a stimulation of the CA1 field with different parameters has shown that the effects of EP modulation are due to dynamic reorganizations of cortical neuronal activity.
