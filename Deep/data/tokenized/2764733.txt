Ultrastructural changes in the central nucleus of the amygdalar body, field CA I of the hippocampus, piriform cortex, field 17 and field 7 have been studied in dogs, bred under conditions of social isolation. The changes are more numerous in emotiogenic structures. Similar ultrastructural rearrangements are revealed in the amygdalar body, hippocampus and in both fields of the neocortex. They are: neurons with different degree of chromatolysis, reactive changes in some organelles, terminals with agglutinated vesicles, or with their reduced number, increasing amount of synapses with a short active zone. At the same time, in the piriform gyrus vacuoles, membrane-like and osmiophilic inclusions, terminals with granular vesicles of various size are found more often.
