The ability of an organism to develop, maintain, and act upon an abstracted internal representation of spatially extensive environments can provide an increased chance in ensuring that organism's survival. Here, we propose a neurocognitive model of spatial representation describing how several different processes interact and segregate the differing types of information used to produce a unified cognitive map. This model proposes that view-based egocentric and vestibulomotor translational information are functionally and anatomically separate, and that these parallel systems result in independent, but interacting, models within a neurocognitive map of space. In this context, we selectively review relevant portions of the large literature, addressing the establishment and operation of such spatial constructs in humans and the brain systems that underpin them, with particular reference to the hippocampal formation (HF). We present a reinterpretation of the types of knowledge used in the formation of this spatial construct, the processes that act upon this information, the nature of the final spatial representation, and describe how these universal concepts relate to the proposed model of spatial processing. The relevant experimental paradigms used to examine the neural basis of spatial representation and the main findings from previous research are also briefly presented. Finally, we detail a series of testable theoretical, behavioral, and anatomical predictions made by the model.
