Mutual modulatory and functional interactions exist between the histaminergic and cholinergic systems in the brain. The activity of histaminergic neurons is permanently modulated by neighboring cholinergic neurons via muscarinic M(1) receptors, cholinergic transmission by histaminergic neurons through H(1), H(2), H(3A) and H(3B) receptors. In the nucleus accumbens, glutamatergic neurons originating from the hippocampus modulate cholinergic transmission in a direct way via stimulation of NMDA receptors located on cholinergic neurons. Additionally, glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus modulate the activity of cholinergic neurons in an indirect way by stimulating histaminergic neurons within the nucleus accumbens. Reciprocal regulatory influences and neurotransmission are subjected to the global modulatory influence of nitric oxide. Both histaminergic and cholinergic systems in the nucleus accumbens are implicated in the response to aversive stimuli. Memory acquisition is associated with activation of cholinergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens, while stimulation of histaminergic neurons facilitates memory in a way that is independent of the cholinergic system. Hence, both histaminergic and cholinergic transmission within the nucleus accumbens and interactions between the two systems seem to play a predominant role in cognition.
