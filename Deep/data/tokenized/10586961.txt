Episodes of heart arrhythmia are present during paradoxical sleep, a known non-homeostatic--'open loop'--physiological state, while wakefulness and slow wave sleep exhibit 'closed-loop' control. A brain-stem autonomic oscillator, a hypothalamic and a corticofrontal center, entrained by baroreceptor input, has been proposed as the main heart rhythm control system. We are postulating another neural timer, i.e. the hippocampal theta rhythm. Cross-correlation between the R-wave of the electrocardiogram and the hippocampal theta revealed phase-locking during behavioral periods under 'open-loop' operations as paradoxical sleep indicative of a participation of such a rhythm in autonomic heart rate timing, in coordination with hypothalamic neuronal activities.
