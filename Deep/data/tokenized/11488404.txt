We examined the effects of a non-opioid antitussive, carbetapentane (CB) on kainic acid (KA)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. KA administration (10 mg/kg, i.p.) produced robust behavioral convulsions lasting 4 to 5 h. CB (12.5 and 25 mg/kg. i.p.) pretreatment consistently and in a dose-dependent manner reduced the KA-induced seizures, mortality, and marked loss of cells in regions CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus. Consistently, CB pretreatment also significantly attenuated the KA-induced increase in Fos-related antigen immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. In contrast, pretreatment with the sigma-1 receptor antagonist BD1047 (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked, in a dose-related manner, the neuroprotection afforded by CB. These results suggest that CB provides neuroprotection against KA insult via sigma-1 receptor modulation.
