1. The authors have recently reported a new protocol for inducing long-term depression through activation of GABAA receptors in the hippocampal slices. This long-term depression is reversed by bicuculline and potentiated by neurosteroids such as alphaxalone. It was also shown that glutamate receptor activity is not involved in the induction of this novel type of long-term depression. Brain derived neurotrophic factor is a member of the neurotrophins family widely expressed in the central nervous system. There is increasing evidence that indicate an important role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor in synaptic plasticity. It has been reported that brain-derived neurotrophic factor level is downregulated by GABA system. The present study investigated a possible relation between muscimol-induced long-term depression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor level. 2. Extracellular recordings were made in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of rat hippocampal slices following orthodromic stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers in stratum radiatum. 3. It was observed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor at concentration that did not have any effect itself on the population spike, prevents the induction of long-term depression by muscimol. In addition to this, K-252a an inhibitor of Trk type kinase blocked the prevention of muscimol-induced LTD by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. 4. The results suggest that there is an interaction between muscimol-induced long-term depression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor and may explain the post receptor mechanism of muscimol-induced long-term depression through a bilateral relation between GABAA activity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
