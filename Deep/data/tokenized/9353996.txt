A three-dimensional platinum (Pt) microelectrode array embedded on a micromachined silicon (Si) substrate (porosity of 13%, via hole diameter of 40 microns) has been developed. Electrodes are 35-micron wide and 20-microns high, spaced 200 microns apart and arranged in an elliptic geometry. Integrated within a microperfusion chamber, the devices were used for stimulation and recording experiments of hippocampal slice cultures over a period of several days.
