We have combined electrophysiology and imaging to measure the release of neurotransmitter and fluorescent dye at synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons. These experiments have revealed a "kiss and run" mode of exocytosis in which synaptic vesicles release glutamate normally but do not permit dye to enter or escape from the vesicle. During "kiss and run," the vesicle interior may be exposed very transiently (<6 ms), or a special configuration of the fusion pore may prevent dye exchange. We estimate that about 20% of the vesicles normally use this "kiss and run" pathway, and that the fraction of "kiss and run" events can be increased to over 80% by superfusing the synapses with hypertonic solution.
