Universality connects various natural phenomena through physical principles governing their dynamics, and has provided broadly accepted answers to many complex questions, including information processing in neuronal systems. However, its significance in behavioral systems is still elusive. Lateral head scanning (LHS) behavior in rodents might contribute to spatial navigation by actively managing (optimizing) the available sensory information. Our findings of scale invariant distributions in LHS lifetimes, interevent intervals and event magnitudes, provide evidence for the first time that the optimization takes place at a critical point in LHS dynamics. We propose that the LHS behavior is responsible for preprocessing of the spatial information content, critical for subsequent foolproof encoding by the respective downstream neural networks.
