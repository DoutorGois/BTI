Hippocampal atrophy is a marker of disease state and progression in Alzheimer's disease. The gold standard to measure hippocampal volume is through manual segmentation. A number of protocols to measure hippocampal volume through manual segmentation have been developed, but the marked heterogeneity of anatomical landmarks has given rise to wide variability of volume estimates. With the aim of fostering the use of hippocampal volume in routine clinical settings, an international task force is currently working on developing a harmonized protocol that will resolve and reduce the present heterogeneity. The task force will then validate the harmonized protocol, develop harmonized probabilistic hippocampal maps, and develop illustrative and educational material on the use of the harmonized protocol and maps.
