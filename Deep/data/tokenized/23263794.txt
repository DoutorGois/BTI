The earliest records of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prevention and treatment of epilepsy dated back to famous "Huang Di Nei Jing." TCM "spasmolytic powder" (equal-ratio compatibility of scorpion and centipede) is a famous prescription which was recognized as a useful add-on drug for refractory epilepsy in clinical observations. Multidrug resistance gene (mdr1) product Pgp overexpression in blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier is well recognized as the drug resistance mechanism of refractory epilepsy. Here, we established the drug-resistant epilepsy Sprague-Dawley rat model induced by Coriaria Lactone and treated these rats with topiramate and verapamil and low dose, middle dose, and high dose of spasmolytic powder by intragastric administration for 1 week. Electroencephalogram, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry were respectively used to detect epileptic discharge frequencies and amplitudes and expression of mdrl mRNA and Pgp on hippocampus and temporal lobe of rats. The results showed that the seizure decreases significantly in the high- and middle-dose groups of spasmolytic powder and topiramate group; in addition, mdr1 mRNA and Pgp expressions on hippocampus and temporal lobe of these drug intervention groups were significantly less than the model group (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that inhibition of intracephalic Pgp expression is possibly one of mechanisms of spasmolytic powder treating refractory epilepsy.
