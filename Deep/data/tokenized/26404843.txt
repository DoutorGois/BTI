Ketamine, a pan-NMDA receptor channel blocker, and CP-101,606, an NR2B-selective negative allosteric modulator, have antidepressant effects in humans that develop rapidly after the drugs are cleared from the body. It has been proposed that the antidepressant effect of ketamine results from delayed synaptic potentiation. To further investigate this hypothesis and potential mechanistic underpinnings we compared the effects of ketamine and CP-101,606 on neurophysiological biomarkers in rats immediately after drug administration and after the drugs had been eliminated. Local field and auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded from primary auditory cortex and hippocampus in freely moving rats. Effects of different doses of ketamine or CP-101,606 were evaluated on amplitude of AEPs, auditory gating, and absolute power of delta and gamma oscillations 5-30 min (drug-on) and 5-6 h (drug-off) after systemic administration. Both ketamine and CP-101,606 significantly enhanced AEPs in cortex and hippocampus in the drug-off phase. In contrast, ketamine but not CP-101,606 disrupted auditory gating and increased gamma-band power during the drug-on period. Although both drugs affected delta power, these changes did not correlate with increase in AEPs in the drug-off phase. Our findings show that both ketamine and CP-101,606 augment AEPs after drug elimination, consistent with synaptic potentiation as a mechanism for antidepressant efficacy. However, these drugs had different acute effects on neurophysiological parameters. These results have implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms for the rapid-onset antidepressant effects of NMDA receptor inhibition and for the use of electrophysiological measures as translatable biomarkers.
