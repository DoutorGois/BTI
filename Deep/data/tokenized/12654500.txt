To investigate the changes in the principal subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 1 (NR1) following the transient ischemia and postischemic hypothermia, in situ hybridization was used in the gerbil hippocampus. One of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, Glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) was also investigated to compare with NR1. Even at 1 day, NR1 and GluR2 mRNAs in the CA1 region were reduced following ischemia. Although postischemic hypothermia prevented almost all the neuronal cell death by ischemia and inhibited the reduction of NR1 and GluR2 mRNAs in the CA1 region after 7 days, the downregulation of NR1 mRNA in the CA2 region was observed even at 1 day. This change was specific for NR1 and not for GluR2. These results suggest that the changes in NR1 and GluR2 receptors at the mRNA level would occur in spite of postischemic hypothermia. The phenomenon in the CA2 region may play an important role to rescue neuronal cell death by ischemia.
