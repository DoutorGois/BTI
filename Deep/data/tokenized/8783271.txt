We have used a novel antibody to map the distribution of the protein kinase C substrate protein RC3/neurogranin during the development of the rat telencephalon. Neurogranin appearance in the rat brain is biphasic: it shows an early stage of anatomically restricted, low-intensity expression, and a juvenile stage of anatomically widespread, high-intensity expression. Most of the structures that express neurogranin during development conserve it in the adult stage. Neurogranin expression starts on embryonic day 18 in two different sites-the amygdalar primordium and in the piriform cortex-and is confined to these structures until the first postnatal day (P1). On P1, neurogranin expression increases dramatically in intensity, and appears in the olfactory cortex, isocortex, subiculum and hippocampus. In the striatum, expression starts on P1 and extends to the caudoputamen and parts of the globus pallidus and septum. Particularly complex patterns of labelling can be seen in the amygdala and cerebral cortex. Cortical layers showing early expression are the presumptive layers 4 and 5 in the somatosensory cortex, and layers 2 and 5 in the anterior cingulate and agranular insular cortices. Immunoreactivity is found mostly in cell bodies during the early and juvenile stages, but by the end of the first postnatal week it starts being more apparent in the neuropil. This phenomenon probably reflects the intracellular translocation of neurogranin to distal parts of the dendrites and dendritic spines. This process culminates by the end of the second postnatal week, when the adult pattern is reached. According to the timing and anatomy of its distribution, expression of neurogranin seems to be independently regulated in each telencephalic region by specific signalling mechanisms. It is proposed, on this basis, that neurogranin could be implicated in neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis during telencephalic development.
