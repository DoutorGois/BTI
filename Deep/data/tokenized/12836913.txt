The role of the hippocampal formation (HF) in memory processing was assessed in food-storing black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) by reversibly inactivating the HF during different memory tests. The memory tests required birds to remember a location based on spatial cues only, or based on a combination of both spatial and distinct visual cues. Inactivation of the HF impaired short-term spatial memory, but not visual-spatial memory. Inactivation of the HF impaired the retrieval of short-term (15 min) spatial memories, but not long-term (3-h) spatial memories. The pattern of deficits produced by inactivation of the HF in chickadees suggests a possible function of the hippocampal specialization of food-storing birds, as well as extends the notion of functional homology between the avian and mammalian HF.
