The DNA content of individual cell nuclei of cat hippocampus has been measured by means of a scanning cytophotometric technique. The pyramidal cells are tetraploid, whereas the remaining cell types, which include glial cells, interneurons, and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, are diploid. Nuclei of tetraploid pyramidal cells are significantly larger than those of diploid granule cells.
