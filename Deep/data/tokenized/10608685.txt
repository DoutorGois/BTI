Reversible magnetic resonance (MR) imaging lesions have been described in humans following seizures. This condition has not yet been reported in animals. This paper describes reversible abnormalities identified in 3 dogs using MR imaging that was performed initially within 14 days of the last seizure and follow-up imaging that was performed after 10 to 16 weeks of anticonvulsant therapy. All three dogs had lesions in the piriform/temporal lobes, characterized by varying degrees of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and hypointensity on T1-weighted images. In one dog, contrast enhancement was evident. On reevaluation, partial resolution occurred in all 3 dogs. In a fourth animal with an olfactory meningioma, similar appearing lesions in the temporal cortex and right and left piriform lobes were identified after seizure activity. A surgical biopsy of the temporal cortex and hippocampus was performed and edema, neovascularization, reactive astrocytosis, and acute neuronal necrosis were evident. These histologic findings are similar to those reported in humans with seizures. Recognizing the potential occurrence of reversible abnormalities in MR images is important in developing a diagnostic and therapeutic plan in canine patients with seizures. Repeat imaging after seizure control may help differentiate between seizure-induced changes and primary multifocal parenchymal abnormalities.
