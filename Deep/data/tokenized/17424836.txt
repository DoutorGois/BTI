OBJECTIVE: To observe changes of dopamine and its metabolite (3,4-hydroxyphenylaceticacid, DOPAC) levels of the brain regions in rats exposed by dimethoate (DM). METHODS: Groups of rats were treated with saline and 38.9, 83.7 and 180.0 mg/kg DM respectively, and were decapitated at different time course from 0.5 to 24 hours after the administration. The dopamine neurotransmitters and its metabolite were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. RESULTS: The concentrations of DA (28% - 122% of control) and DOPAC (89% - 538% of control) varied according with the DM dose and the exposure time. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that DM-induced toxic effects could alter the dopamine levels after the different dose and time exposure in the brain regions of rats.
