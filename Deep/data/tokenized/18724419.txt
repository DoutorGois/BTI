Electrical stimulations (ES, 100 Hz) of the paleocerebellar cortex (Iuvula and flocculus) were performed in male Wistar rats. Similar stimulations of the frontal cortical zones were used as control. Lipid peroxidation intensity was estimated spectrophotometrically by the level of products reacting with thiobarbituric acid. It is shown that ES of the cerebellar cortex caused a decrease of the above products in the brain hemispheres. Increased absorption of 14C methionine by ventral hippocampal structures and 3H triptophane by ventral hippocampus, brain stem and the "rest" tissue of the brain was registered in response to electrostimulations. The findings are discussed in terms of activation of antioxidant mechanisms in brain structures.
