In human neuropsychiatric disorders, there are functional and anatomical abnormalities of GABAergic interneurons in each temporal cortex subregion. Furthermore, accumulation of amyloid-beta is observed in the temporal cortex in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Each subregion of the temporal cortex has an important role in coordinating the input and output of the hippocampus. When subregions of the temporal cortex are impaired, memory and learning ability decrease. GABAergic interneurons control excitatory neurons, forming the cortico-cortical and cortico-hippocampal networks. However, in temporal cortex subregions, details of the distribution and developmental processes of GABAergic interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) have not been elucidated. Here we examined the development of GABAergic interneurons and PNNs in mouse temporal cortex subregions. Results indicate that temporal cortex GABAergic interneurons have developmental stages different to those of the primary sensory cortex. In addition, the density of PNNs in the temporal cortex is lower than that in the sensory cortex. Furthermore, we found that the Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-reactive extracellular matrix molecule is present in the upper level of layer 1 of the temporal cortex. These results support the idea that mouse temporal cortex subregions develop differently from other cortical regions and have region-specific characteristics after maturation. The present study results suggested that the structure of the temporal cortex is significantly different from the sensory cortex and that temporal cortex may be highly vulnerable to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
