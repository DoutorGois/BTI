In vitro opioid receptor binding in the dorsal hippocampal formation and parietal cortex was surveyed in ground squirrels (Citellus lateralis) in the contrasting physiological states of hibernation and euthermia (i.e. not hibernating). Computer-assisted autoradiographic analysis of coronal sections incubated with [3H]dihydromorphine (DMH; 4 nM) revealed statistically significant reductions in specific opioid binding associated with hibernation. In the dorsal hippocampal formation of hibernating animals, binding in the stratum radiatum of CA3, hilus of the dentate gyrus and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus exhibited decreases up to 34% compared to euthermic animals. The stratum radiatum of CA3 exhibited the smallest decrease overall. DHM binding in parietal cortex displayed significant hibernation-related reductions, although they were not uniformly observed across all laminae at the 3 different brain levels examined. These experiments present evidence of changes in brain opioid binding related to the mammalian state of hibernation. The results suggest that changes in opioid receptor binding during hibernation may contribute to the earlier reported apparent failure of morphine physical dependence to develop during hibernation.
