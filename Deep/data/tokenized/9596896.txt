OBJECTIVES: To study the secondary pathological changes in the central nervous system after injury and the role of dynorphin A1-13 in hypoxi-ischemic brain injury in neonatal rats. METHODS: Changes of concentrations of dynorphin A1-13 immunoreactives in some brain areas at different times after brain injury and the effect of injecting 8 microliters dynorphin A1-13 anti-serum into the medulla pool on pathological process of brain injury were observed in perinatal cerebral hypoxia ischemic rat models prepared by permanent ligation of right common carotid artery combined with a temporary systematic hypoxia at 37 degrees C in 7 day old Wistar rats. RESULTS: Concentrations of dynorphin A1-13 in cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus increased significantly after the injury. Microinjection of anti-dynorphin A1-13 serum into the medulla pool 1 h preinjury might markedly reduce brain edema and improve the physiological condition. CONCLUSIONS: Dynorphin A1-13 plays a role in the pathophysiological process of brain hypoxia-ischemia and excessive amount of dynorphin A1-13 had some detrimental effect on the process.
