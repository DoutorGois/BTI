Repeated exposures to addictive drugs result in persistent or even permanent expression changes of proteins in addiction-related brain regions, such as nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex while the changes of protein content in amygdala were seldom studied. Here we aimed to find the proteins involved in the process of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). The model of morphine-induced CPP was established in rats and the rat amygdala tissues were obtained in different stages of morphine-induced CPP: establishment group, extinction group, reinstatement group and saline group as a control. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed to analyze and compare the changes of protein expression profiles in the amygdala of rats during the process of morphine-induced CPP. There were eighty proteins with 1.3-fold changes in amygdala relative to saline group, most of which were down-regulated. These differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in metabolism, structure, cell signaling pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. And we further used methods of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting to confirm the results of proteomics. Mitosis activated protein kinase1 (MAPK1) was increased in the stages of extinction and reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP, while glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was decreased in the stage of extinction. Our results provide some proteins and cellular signaling pathways involved in the molecular mechanisms of opioid addiction in amygdala.
