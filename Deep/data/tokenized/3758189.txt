Kynurenine and kynurenic acid are known to produce convulsions in rats and mice and it has been reported that kynurenine can displace GABA from its neuronal binding sites. The present study shows that neither kynurenine nor kynurenic acid are antagonist of GABA when tested on the rat hippocampal slice preparation. It is therefore unlikely that kynurenine seizures result from the blockade of inhibitory neurotransmission.
