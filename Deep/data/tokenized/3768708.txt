Rat hippocampal minces were loaded with N-methyl-[3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh) in the presence of the 'poorly penetrating' acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7, AChE) inhibitor echothiophate and the effect of the depolarizing agent veratridine determined on the subcellular storage and release of [3H]ACh and [3H]choline. Results indicated that veratridine stimulated the release of [3H]ACh from a crude vesicular fraction (P3) by a Ca2+-dependent process, while simultaneously accelerating the breakdown of cytosolic (S3) [3H]ACh. A portion of the [3H]choline derived from the hydrolyzed S3 [3H]ACh was donated to the P3 fraction for [3H]ACh formation and release. When the identical experiment was done using hippocampal minces from septal lesioned rats, veratridine did not stimulate either the Ca2+-dependent release of [3H]ACh or the hydrolysis of cytosolic [3H]ACh. Incubation of control hippocampal minces with paraoxon, an AChE inhibitor which can penetrate cholinergic nerve terminals more rapidly than echothiophate, prevented veratridine from stimulating the Ca2+-dependent release of [3H]ACh from the P3 fraction. Instead, it then stimulated the Ca2+-independent release of [3H]ACh from the S3 fraction. When minces were incubated with the choline O-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6, ChAT) inhibitor 4-(1-naphthyl)vinyl pyridine (NVP), veratridine was no longer able to stimulate the Ca2+-dependent release of labelled ACh either. Instead, veratridine stimulated the Ca2+-independent release of labelled ACh from the S3 fraction. NVP also abolished the veratridine-induced, Ca2+-dependent release of total ACh. Both paraoxon and NVP inhibited the reversible reaction of ionically bound ChAT prepared from rat brain when tested in vitro, yet paraoxon was much less potent than NVP, and was unable to inhibit this reaction at the low concentration which prevented the veratridine induced breakdown of S3 [3H]ACh during mince incubation. Veratridine depolarization of hippocampal minces stimulated the activity of a membrane-bound fraction of ChAT associated with the P3 fraction, but this fraction of ChAT did not become more sensitive to inhibition by paraoxon during tissue incubation. Veratridine depolarization of minces also increased the activity of membrane-bound AChE, but this enzyme was not inhibited by the low NVP concentration which prevented the veratridine-induced breakdown of S3 [3H]ACh. The veratridine-induced increase in membrane-bound ChAT activity was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+ in the incubation medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
