Effects of adrenergic agonist on population spike (PS) amplitude were studied extracellularly at CA1 region of hippocampal slices from partial and full kindled rats with coriaria lactone (1-1.25 mg/kg, two days a time, i.m.) and compared with those from control rats. 5 mumol/L norepinephrine (NE) increased PS; 50 mumol/L NE decreased it slightly. 5 mumol/L isoproterenol (ISO) increased PS. 100 mumol/L phenylephrine (PE) decreased it. The effects of increasing and decreasing PS could be antagonised by beta and alpha adrenergic antagonists, respectively. The effects of NE and PE on PS amplitude showed no significant difference between the control and kindled rats. The effect of beta-adrenergic agonist ISO on PS amplitude in hippocampal slices from partial kindled rats was less than that of control (P < 0.01). The effect of ISO on PS of full kindled rats was partially recovered.
