The beta1 subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels, Nav beta1, plays multiple roles in neurons spanning electrophysiological modulation of sodium channel alpha subunits to cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth. This study used immunohistochemistry to investigate Nav beta1 subneuronal and regional expression. Nav beta1 was enriched at axon initial segments (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier. Nav beta1 expression at the AIS was detected throughout the brain, predominantly in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. Despite expression of Nav beta1 in both excitatory and inhibitory AIS, it displayed a marked and fine-grained heterogeneity of expression. Such heterogeneity could have important implications for the tuning of single neuronal and regional excitability, especially in view of the fact that Nav beta1 coexpressed with Nav 1.1, Nav 1.2, and Nav 1.6 subunits. The disruption of Nav beta1 AIS expression by a human epilepsy-causing C121W genetic mutation in Nav beta1 was also investigated using a mouse model. AIS expression of Nav beta1 was reduced by approximately 50% in mice heterozygous for the C121W mutation and was abolished in homozygotes, suggesting that loss of Nav alpha subunit modulation by Nav beta1 contributes to the mechanism of epileptogenesis in these animals as well as in patients.
