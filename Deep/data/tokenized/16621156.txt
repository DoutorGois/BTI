The aim of this work was to investigate if MCH modifies the feeding and freezing responses in rats exposed to stressful stimuli. We used a basic version of contextual fear, where one group of rats were placed in a novel environment and two different groups were exposed to footshock paradigms, one of them escapable and the other one inescapable. At the end of each treatment, freezing and feeding were measured. Only the animals exposed to inescapable footshock paradigm showed significant increase in the food intake and freezing behavior in comparison to the control animals. The MCH administration (intra-hippocampal or intra-amygdaline) reverted these effects elicited by inescapable footshock. Results presented in this paper lead us to the assumption that the anxiolytic effect of the peptide is responsible for the reversion of the IS effects.
