Total copper and manganese contents were measured in five rat brain regions 7 days after a unilateral striatal injection of quinolinic acid (QUIN, 240 nmol/ 1 microliter), an endogenous N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist. Concentrations of both transition metals were evaluated in tissue of brain cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum, midbrain and cerebellum of saline- and QUIN-treated rats using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Increases in copper content were observed after QUIN striatal injection in cerebellum, hippocampus, midbrain and corpus striatum (37, 55, 71 and 152% as compared against control values, respectively) but not in brain cortex. Manganese levels were found enhanced only in corpus striatum of QUIN-treated rats by 35% vs. control values, but not in all other brain regions analyzed. QUIN-induced increases in regional copper content were partially prevented in hippocampus, midbrain and striatum (17, 57, and 23% vs. control, respectively) by pretreatment of rats with an NMDA receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (MK-801, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 60 min before QUIN microinjection. The same protective effect of dizocilpine was observed against QUIN-induced enhancement of striatal manganese content (-0.45% vs. control). These findings resemble those changes observed in postmortem Huntington's disease brains and suggest that alterations in regional content of copper, but not in manganese, may be a consequence of the spreading of QUIN-induced neurotoxic events into the striatal tissue to the neighboring regions of the brain, by action of QUIN on NMDA receptors.
