The present study quantified ribosomes, as an ultrastructural marker of neuronal protein synthesis, following long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region in vitro. Sixty min after LTP-inducing, high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path, the total number of ribosomes, the number of polysomes, and the number of membrane-bound ribosomes increased significantly. These increases are a postsynaptic morphological correlate consistent with enhanced protein synthesis following the induction of LTP in the perforant path-CA1 system.
