The maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) depends on altered gene expression. Previously, we found the expression of neuronal growth associated protein SCG10, which is involved in neurite outgrowth and neural regeneration, was up-regulated by LTP induction in the rat hippocampal Schaffer-collateral CA1 pathway. Here we studied the temporal expression pattern of SCG10 mRNA after LTP induction using permanently implanted electrodes in the same CA1 pathway. The real-time RT-PCR showed that both SCG10 mRNA 1 and 2 kb forms were increased at the 3 h, but not at 1 or 24 h. In situ hybridization revealed an increase of SCG10 2 kb mRNA level in ipsilateral CA3 and CA1 areas, but not their contralateral counterparts or either side of dentate gyrus. These results suggest that SCG10 may play a role in the maintenance of synaptic plasticity through a transient regulation of microtubule dynamics, which facilitates the structural remodeling of the presynaptic element during the consolidation period.
