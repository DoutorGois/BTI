The effect of a synthetic estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), on kainate-induced currents was investigated in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons acutely dissociated from the mice using the nystatin-perforated patch-clamp recording configuration under voltage-clamp conditions. DES inhibited the current evoked by 100 microM kainate in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 8.8 microM. The action of DES was voltage-independent. Since DES produced a suppression of the maximum response of the kainate concentration-response curve, the inhibition by DES of the kainate-induced current appears to be non-competitive.
