Although some central effects of triadimefon, a triazole fungicide, have been reported, its effects on spatial memory have not been examined. In this study, we used the Morris water maze to study the effect of triadimefon on spatial learning and memory in rats. To elucidate the mechanism of this effect, we also measured the retinoic acid concentration in the hippocampus by high-performance liquid chromatography. Our data showed that triadimefon inhibited spatial learning and impaired spatial reference memory, and decreased hippocampal retinoic acid concentration. There is evidence that triadimefon can regulate the metabolism of retinoic acid, which serves a critical function in the development and maintenance of spatial memory. Therefore, we speculate that the reduction in hippocampal retinoic acid concentration induced by triadimefon might be responsible for its suppressive effect on spatial learning and reference memory.
