An in vivo microdialysis method was used to study the cholinergic alteration of the hippocampus in entorhinal cortex-lesioned rats performing a positive reinforcement operant learning task. Rats with bilateral entorhinal cortex lesions were implanted with a dialysis probe into the hippocampal CA3 after ten learning sessions. After 7 days, the bilateral entorhinal cortex-lesioned rats showed impaired acquisition of positive reinforcement operant learning. The basal level of the acetylcholine efflux decreased within 30 min before the beginning of a learning session. The hippocampal acetylcholine efflux showed a significantly diminished increase and rapidly returned to the basal level during the 60 min after the beginning of a learning session. These results suggested that enorhinal cortex lesion may cause damage to the hippocampal cholinergic system with disruption of the entorhinal cortex-hippocampus relay passage.
