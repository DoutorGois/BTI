OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of lead on the transcription factor Brn-3a expression level in the neurons of central nervous system. METHODS: The pregnant rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, which were provided with distilled water, 0.5 g/L, 1.0 g/L, 2.0 g/L lead acetate solution via drinking water respectively, the lead-exposed period for exposure groups was limited from the 15th day after pregnancy to the 21st day when the offspring began to weaned and various brain regions were obtained. Brn-3a mRNA transcription level were observed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Brn-3a proteins expression level were observed by immunohistochemistry method. RESULTS: The RT-PCR results showed that Brn-3a mRNA transcription level decreased significantly in neural cells from cerebral hippocampus in every lead treatment group compared with the control group (P < 0.05). The immunohistochemistry results showed that Brn-3a decreased significantly in lead poisoning groups compared with that of control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Brn-3a mRNA transcription level and protein expression level were decreased in brain regions in this study. The results showed that lead-exposure might interfere the normal model of Brn-3a protein expression, so it interfered the differentiation of neuronal cells.
