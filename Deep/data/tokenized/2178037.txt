Whole cell currents were recorded in cultured rat hippocampal neurons using the patch-clamp method. When the cells were held near the resting membrane potential (-60 mV) the application of adenosine (1 microM) or the adenosine analogues 2CA (100 nM) and R-PIA (40 nM) induced a steady-state inward current. This response was unchanged when extra- and intracellular media were used, in which Na+ and K+ were substituted by impermeable ions in equimolar concentrations. In contrast the current was affected by lowering the extracellular Cl- concentration and thus Cl- was considered to be the ionic carrier. Additionally an almost complete block of the current was observed after applications of DIDS (50 microM), a putative Cl- channel blocker. The modulated current was voltage-dependent and was slowly activated by hyperpolarizing voltage steps. The adenosine action was theophylline- and pertussis toxin-sensitive indicating that the modulatory effect is mediated via an A1 receptor coupled to a G protein of the Gi or Go class.
