The binding of [3H] corticosterone to hippocampal cytosol receptors of Brattleboro rats homozygous for diabetes insipidus (Ho-Di) and of normal Brattleboro rats (Ho-No) was investigated at 24 h after removal of the adrenals. The apparent maximal binding capacity of the Ho-Di hippocampal corticosterone receptor system was about 30% less than that of the Ho-No rats. Substitution of the vasopressin deficient rats with 1E pitressin tannate in oil partially restores the hippocampal corticosterone receptor level towards that of the control animals.
