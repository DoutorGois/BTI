Allylnitrile induces in rats persistent behavioral abnormalities, including head twitching, following a single administration. We studied the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) systems in the brain of rats in inducing and maintaining the head twitching. Allynitrile (1.49 mmol/kg) induced 5-HT system activation in all areas of the brain studied 1-4 days after oral administration, and a reduction in the content of NA in the hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus 1 day after dosing, in the hippocampus, cortex, hypothalamus and midbrain 2 days after dosing, and in the hypothalamus 4 days after dosing. Allylnitrile induced no change in the content of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) or NA 7-28 days after dosing. Pretreatment with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) suppressed the allylnitrile-induced head twitching, and decreased the contents of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in almost all areas of the brain throughout the observation period, as well as the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT in the medulla oblongata plus pons from 1 to 30 days after dosing with allylnitrile. No change in NA was observed in any areas of the brain. Pretreatment with N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4) increased the head twitching induced by allylnitrile, and decreased the content of NA in all areas of the brain throughout the observation period, without any change in the contents of 5-HT or 5-HIAA or in the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT. The present results suggest the involvement of 5-HT and NA systems in allylnitrile-induced head twitching.
