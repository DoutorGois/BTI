Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in the loss of neurons in AD. The phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) plays an important role in regulating neuronal survival processes. However, the direct effects of the PTEN on ER stress and apoptosis in AD have not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that the expression of PTEN and ER stress related proteins, GRP78 and CHOP, increased in APP/PS1 transgenic AD mice compared with WT mice. A PTEN inhibitor, dipotassium bisperoxo-(5-hydroxypyridine-2-carboxyl)-oxovanadate (bpv) could decrease apoptosis, induce AKT phosphorylation and inhibit the ER stress response proteins in hippocampus in APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice. Furthermore, treatment with the specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, significantly blocked the anti-apoptotic effects of bpv in AD mice. The expression in GRP78, CHOP and apoptosis levels by bpv was reversed after PI3K inhibitor treatment. Taken together, our results indicate that the neuroprotective role of bpv involves the suppression of ER stress via the activation of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathways in APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice.
