Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP, causes the fragile X syndrome. Highly expressed in the brain and testis, FMRP has been implicated in the transport and translation of specific mRNAs. Here we show that FMRP and the mRNA nuclear export factor NXF2 co-express in the mouse male germ cells and hippocampal neurons and that FMRP associates with NXF2 but not with its close relative NXF1. We thus hypothesize that FMRP and NXF2 may act in concert to promote the nucleocytoplasmic transport of specific mRNAs in male germ cells and neurons.
