Phosphorylation of the serine residues in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha is important in transcriptional activation. Hence, methods to detect such posttranslational modification events are valuable. We describe, in detail, the analysis of the phosphorylated ERalpha by electrophoretic separation of proteins and subsequent immuno-blotting techniques. In particular, phosphorylation of the ERalpha is one possible outcome of activation of the putative membrane estrogen receptor (mER), GPR30. Hence, phosphorylation represents a cross talk event between GPR30 and ERalpha and may be important in estrogen-regulated physiology.
