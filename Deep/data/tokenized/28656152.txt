The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of antioxidants lycopene and insulin on histological changes and expression of Bcl-2 family genes in the hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats. Forty-eight Wistar rats were divided into six groups of control (C), control treated with lycopene (CL), diabetic (D), diabetic treated with insulin (DI), diabetic treated with lycopene (DL), and diabetic treated with insulin and lycopene (DIL). Diabetes was induced by an injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, IP), lycopene (4 mg/kg/day) was given to the lycopene treated groups as gavages, and insulin (Sc, 1-2 U/kg/day) was injected to the groups treated with insulin. The number of hippocampus neurons undergoing cell death in group D had significant differences with groups C and DIL (p < 0.001). Furthermore, insulin and lycopene alone or together reduced the expression of Bax, but increased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels in DI, DL, and DIL rats, especially when compared to group D (p < 0.001). The ratios of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-xL in DI, DL, and DIL rats were also reduced (p < 0.001). Our results indicate that treatment with insulin and/or lycopene contribute to the prevention of cell death by reducing the expression of proapoptotic genes and increasing the expression of antiapoptotic genes in the hippocampus.
