SEMA3F is a secreted semaphorin that affects axon and cell guidance in the developing nervous system, and is also thought to have anti-tumor activity. Two spliced forms of SEMA3F have been identified that differ by the insertion of 31 amino acids in the sema domain. Here, we investigated the bioactivity of these isoforms and show, using coculture and binding assays, that they share common axonal chemorepulsive properties and binding to neuropilin receptors. SEMA3F isoforms were also found to regulate endothelial cell morphology by remodeling lamellipodial protrusions. Although Sema3F expression globally decreased during mouse development, we noted an enrichment of the longest isoform at postnatal stages in some territories such as the brainstem and spinal cord. These results indicate that although functionally redundant in cell culture assays, Sema3F spliced forms are characterized in vivo by a temporal and regional specific regulation during maturation of the nervous system.
