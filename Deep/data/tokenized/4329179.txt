Amounts of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in discrete regions of the brain were estimated after exposure of rats to microwave irradiation. Amounts were highest in the cerebellum and brainstem, intermediate in the hypothalamus and midbrain, and lowest in the hippocampus and cortex. Decapitation increased the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in all brain areas, although the increase in the cerebellum was three to four times greater than that in other areas. Microwave irradiation may provide a means of rapidly fixing brain tissue in situ while permitting easy dissection of the brain. In this way artifacts produced by decapitation can be eliminated, and concentrations of heat-stable compounds in the brain can be estimated under conditions which more closely approximate those in vivo.
