The concentrations of Cu2+ and Zn2+ in 3 strains of mice were determined spectrophotometrically. The brain of the inborn audiogenic mouse (DBA/2J) contains higher levels of Zn2+ and Cu2+ than those found in the normal mouse (CBA/Ca or Parkes). Small differences in the metallic content in the whole brains of audiogenic and normal mice are accentuated in the hippocampus and the colliculus.
