Adenosine added to the perfusion fluid of rat hippocampal slices at 10 mumol X l-1 enhanced long lasting afterhyperpolarizations after single action potentials, bursts of action potentials or calcium spikes. Accommodation of firing during a depolarizing pulse was potentiated. An increase in calcium dependent potassium conductance is likely to mediate these effects. Adenosine at 50 mumol X l-1 induced a hyperpolarization accompanied by a reduction in input resistance. The hyperpolarization could be reversed at -85 mV. In TTX and TTX-barium treated slices the amplitude of the slow spike was decreased. This may result from a shunting of inward current in the dendrites due to an adenosine induced increase in potassium conductance. It is suggested that adenosine reduces pre- and postsynaptic excitatory signals principally by enhancing one or more potassium conductances. This effect is a powerful means for modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic efficacy and can explain the antiepileptic activity of adenosine.
