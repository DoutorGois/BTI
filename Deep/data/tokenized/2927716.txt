Using antisera directed against somatostatin-28 or somatostatin-28(1-12), the development of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SS-LI) was examined in the hippocampal formation of normal and reeler mice. As early as postnatal day 5, SS-labeled neurons exhibit the adult pattern of distribution in the normal hippocampal formation, these neurons being situated predominantly in the stratum oriens of the hippocampus and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. In contrast, SS-labeled neurons in the reeler hippocampal formation are dispersed throughout the various layers, reflecting the disrupted laminar organization of the hippocampus in this mutant. In both the normal and reeler hippocampal formation, SS-labeled fibers are most abundant in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. However, in the reeler, there appears to be increase in the density of SS-LI fibers, not only in the stratum lacunosum moleculare but also in the stratum oriens, stratum radiatum and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus.
