Previous investigations in seizure-prone mice have suggested that an abnormally elevated production of the astrocyte-derived neuroexcitant, quinolinic acid (QUIN), plays a role in seizure susceptibility. In order to evaluate further the role of QUIN metabolism in genetic murine seizure models, the activities of its biosynthetic enzyme 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (3HAO), and of two other astrocytic enzymes, kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) and glutamine synthetase (GS), were measured in the brains of seizure-prone EL and DBA/2 mice and two non-epileptic strains (BALB/c and Swiss-Webster). 3HAO activity was found to be markedly higher in both EL and DBA/2 mice than in the non-epileptic strains in all brain regions examined. The activity of 3HAO was not modified by the tossing procedure employed to promote seizures in EL mice. While some strain differences were noted in the activities of KAT and GS, these enzymes did not distinguish seizure-prone from the non-epileptic mice. In order to delineate better the relationship between glial activation and 3HAO, KAT and GS, further studies were performed in the ibotenate-lesioned hippocampus. In mice (but not in rats), the activity of 3HAO was selectively increased in gliotic tissue. These data demonstrate substantial species and strain differences in astroglial enzymes and in their response to brain injury. The observation of widespread abnormally high 3HAO activity in two distinct seizure-prone mouse strains strengthens the hypothesis that enhanced production of QUIN contributes to seizure susceptibility in mice.
