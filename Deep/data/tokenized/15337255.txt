Social behaviour is the basis of one of the most generally accepted independent dimensions of personality. The purpose of the present study was to find out whether the social activity of individual rats, expressed in the social interaction test of anxiety, is consistent, and associated with monoamine levels. Four social interaction tests with 10 days intervals were carried out in 20 rats, and the animals were decapitated 4 days after the last test. There was no consistent correlation between performances in single tests, but the social interaction time in each test correlated strongly with the mean values of social activity in all or the other three tests. Social interaction time of rats correlated moderately but significantly with their partner's social activity in the test. The average social interaction time correlated strongly with 5-HIAA levels in the frontal cortex (r = -0.67, P < 0.01). Neither exposure of rats singly to the social interaction test box nor the test procedure had any effect on monoamine levels. When animals were decapitated immediately after a single social interaction test, there was a negative correlation between the social interaction time and 5-HIAA and 5-HT levels in the septum, but not in the frontal cortex or hippocampus. Thus, social behaviour is a stable trait, expression of which depends in part upon the partner's social behaviour. This trait is negatively associated with 5-HT metabolism in the frontal cortex. Social activity of rats in a particular test situation may rather be related to 5-HT metabolism in the septum.
