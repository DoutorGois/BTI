A technique for multi-element analysis of brain tissue by proton induced X-ray emission spectroscopy (PIXE) is described and data from analysis of fixed and unfixed samples from rat hippocampus, neocortex, amygdala, and spinal cord is presented and commented on. The atoms present in the tissue are bombarded with protons which causes the ejection of electrons from the inner shells. When the "holes" are refilled with electrons from outer shells, X-ray quanta characteristic for each element are emitted. Using a high resolution energy dispersive detector a complete X-ray spectrum of the specimen can be recorded in a single measurement. Detection limits less than or approximately 5 p.p.m. of dry matter are obtained for most elements with atomic number greater than 14 (silicon). Around 13 elements were found in concentrations above the detection limits. The grand means for non-fixed hippocampi were e.g. for Zn - 120 p.p.m.; Rb - 20 p.p.m.; Fe - 150 p.p.m.; Pb - 3 p.p.m; Ni - 5 p.p.m.
