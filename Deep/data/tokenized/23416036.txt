Emerging evidence suggests that elevated hippocampal activation may be important for disrupting cognitive functions in aged subjects as well as patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, reducing deleterious overactivity of the hippocampus may have therapeutic benefits. This study was designed to compare the effects of levetiracetam, an antiepileptic drug, on memory deficits associated with normal aging and AD in mouse models. Pretraining administration of levetiracetam ameliorated memory impairments of aged C57BL/6 mice (17-20months of age) in the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. Acute levetiracetam immediately after training was also efficacious in rescuing contextual memory decline in aged mice, whereas administration at a later posttraining interval (3h) had no effect. These results suggest that suppressing overexcitation with acute levetiracetam around the time of acquisition or early consolidation may be sufficient to reverse memory decline associated with aging. In contrast, pretraining administration of levetiracetam was not able to rescue memory deficits in 5XFAD transgenic mice harboring amyloid plaque pathologies at moderate (6-8months old) or massive (12-15months old) levels, differentiating between normal aging- and AD-related memory impairments in the responsiveness to acute levetiracetam treatment.
