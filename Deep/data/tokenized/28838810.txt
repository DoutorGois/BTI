N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are present in both pyramidal neurons and interneurons of the hippocampus. These receptors play a key role in the structural plasticity of excitatory neurons, but to date little is known about their influence on the remodeling of interneurons. Among hippocampal interneurons, the somatostatin expressing cells in the CA1 stratum oriens are of special interest because of their functional importance and structural characteristics: they display dendritic spines, which change their density in response to different stimuli. In order to understand the role of NMDAR activation on the structural dynamics of the spines of somatostatin expressing interneurons in the CA1 stratum oriens, we have studied entorhino-hippocampal organotypic cultures obtained from mice in which this interneuronal subpopulation expresses constitutively EGFP, and have imaged them in real-time. We have acutely infused the cultures with NMDA, a strong NMDAR agonist, and have analyzed the structural dynamics of somatostatin expressing interneurons, prior and after its administration. The appearance and disappearance rates of their dendritic spines increased 24h after the NMDA infusion and returned to baseline levels 48h afterwards. By contrast, their stability rate decreased 24h after the infusion and also returned to control levels 48h later. The relative density of the dendritic spines remained unaltered throughout the assay. Altogether, our results show that the activation of NMDARs can influence the structural dynamics of interneurons. This is especially important because of the involvement of these receptors in neuronal potentiation/depression and their putative role in the etiopathology of certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia.
