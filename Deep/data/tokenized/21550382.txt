Although nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is essential for neuron survival and its activation may protect neuron against oxidative-stresses or ischemia-induced neurodegeneration, NF-kappaB activation can contribute to inflammatory reaction and apoptotic cell death after brain injury and stroke. However, there are little data concerning the specific pattern of NF-kappaB phosphorylations in neuronal damage/survival induced by status epilepticus (SE). In the present study, NF-kappaB phosphorylation showed the cellular specific pattern in responses to SE. p52-S865, p52-Ser869, p65-Ser276, p65-Ser311, p65-Ser468, and p65-Ser529 NF-kappaB phosphorylation was significantly decreased in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells vulnerable to SE, although neuronal specific nuclear antigen immunoreactivity was strongly detected. In contrast, p65-Ser536 NF-kappaB phosphorylation was enhanced in these neurons accompanied by TUNEL- and Fluoro-Jade B 244signals. These findings serve as the first comprehensive description of the cellular specific distribution of NF-kappaB phosphorylation in response to pilocarpine-induced SE in the rat hippocampus, and suggest that enhancement in p65-Ser536 NF-kappaB phosphorylation may be closely relevant to neuronal vulnerability to SE, while others may be involved in neuronal survival.
