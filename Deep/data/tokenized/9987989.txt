We have used the Golgi method and Golgi electron microscopic techniques to analyze the axonal arborization and efferent connections of spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons in the CA3 region and hilus of the rat hippocampal formation. In the hilus, the axons of spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons sent out numerous collaterals that arborized in the hilar region and the molecular layer. In the CA3 region, these axons extended mainly to the stratum radiatum and pyramidal layer but also to the stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Axonal varicosities were distributed widely throughout the axonal collaterals. Electron microscopic studies revealed that the axon terminals of spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons established synaptic contacts mainly with dendritic shafts. We next analyzed the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67) mRNAs in spiny nonpyramidal neurons that were identified by calretinin immunoreactivity. We found that spiny calretinin-positive neurons in the CA3 region and hilus of the rat hippocampal formation expressed the two isoforms of GAD: GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs. These findings show that the spiny calretinin-immunoreactive neurons of hippocampus give rise to local axonal arborizations, suggesting that they are inhibitory.
