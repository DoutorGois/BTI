Transections of the entorhinal afferent fibers to hippocampus, perforant path (PP), result in the denervation in specific hippocampal subregions, which is followed by a series of plastic events including axon sprouting and reactive synaptogenesis. Many growth-associated molecules are thought to participate in these events. In the present study, we proved the upregulation of ephrin-A2 in the denervated areas of the ipsilateral hippocampus following PP transections. Interestingly, when the elevation of ephrin-A2 reached the maximum axon sprouting in the denervated areas almost finished, implying the possible inhibitory effect of ephrin-A2 on sprouting. In addition, ephrin-A2 expression was observed in synapses during reactive synaptogenesis, suggesting that this molecule might also be implicated in the formation and maturation of synapses in the denervated areas.
