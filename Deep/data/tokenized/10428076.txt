Altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function has been shown to be associated with changes in mood and behavior. The enzyme phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an important component of the PI signal transduction system, plays a major role in mediating various physiological functions. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a single dose and of repeated administration (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg for 10 days) of dexamethasone (DEX), a synthetic glucocorticoid, on PI-PLC activity and on expression of PLC isozymes (beta1, delta1, and gamma1) in rat brain. Repeated administration of DEX (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in PI-PLC activity and in protein expression of the PLC beta1 isozyme in both membrane and cytosol fractions of cortex and hippocampus; however, the repeated administration of a smaller dose of DEX (0.5 mg/kg) caused these changes only in hippocampus but not in cortex. The increase in PLC beta1 protein was associated with an increase in its mRNA level, as measured by competitive RT-PCR. A single administration of DEX (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) to rats had no significant effects on PI-PLC activity or on the protein expression of PLC isozymes. These results suggest that DEX up-regulates PI-PLC in rat brain, which presumably is due to a selective increase in expression of the PLC beta1 isozyme, and that these changes in PI-PLC may be related to HPA axis-mediated changes in mood and behavior.
