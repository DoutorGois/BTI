Previous research has implicated hippocampal rhythmical slow activity in the mechanisms of action of the anxiolytic drugs. In this study ethanol and a putative ethanol antagonist, Ro 15-4513, were investigated with reticular elicitation of rhythmical slow activity. Doses of ethanol between 0.6 and 3.1 g/kg were used. Ethanol reduced the frequency of reticular-elicited rhythmical slow activity in the same way as has been reported for anxiolytic barbiturates and benzodiazepines. This effect was linearly related to log dose of ethanol in the range of 1.7-3.1 g/kg. Ro 15-4513 at a dose of 2 mg/kg reduced the effect of ethanol (2.0 g/kg) but had no action itself. Ethanol also decreased the slope of the stimulation voltage-rhythmical slow activity frequency function but this effect was not reduced by Ro 15-4513. These results show that ethanol acts in a similar manner to conventional anxiolytic drugs but that only one component of this action can be reduced by Ro 15-4513.
