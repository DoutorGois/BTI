The tricarboxylate carrier protein catalyzes an electroneutral exchange across the mitochondrial inner membrane of tricarboxylate, dicarboxylate or phosphoenolpyruvate. We examined expression and localization of mitochondrial tricarboxylate carrier TCC mRNA and protein in the rat brain. TCC mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all rat tissues examined and was abundant in brain, liver and kidney. TCC protein as well as mRNA was widely expressed in brain, and the protein expression was strong in neuronal cells in the hippocampus, the olfactory bulb, the corpus mamillare and the cerebellum. Our results suggest that this tricarboxylate carrier protein may contribute to biosynthesis and bioenergetics in neuronal cells in brain.
