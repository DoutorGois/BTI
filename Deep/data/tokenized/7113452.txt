Rabbits with penicillin epileptogenic foci in the hippocampus were subjected to the action of a non-uniform magnetic field (MF) of magnetophores. The maximal induction of the field on the surface of the magnetophore was 30 mT, the gradient -- 30 mT/cm, and average induction in the region of the focus --0.5 mT. It has been shown that activity between seizures does not change under the action of MF, while the number of electrographic correlates of seizures sharply increases. Interhemispheric difference in the epileptiform activity in the left and right hippocampus detected in the control, is substantially intensified in the experimental animals. No weakening of the effect was observed for fifteen days from the moment of the field application. It is assumed that the effect of the magnetic field action on the organism is similar to the influence of hypoxia.
