The effects of dorsal hippocampal and medial frontal lesions of the cortex on a spatial learning problem were studied in two inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) which present both neuroanatomical differences of such structures and various patterns of spontaneous exploration. The results showed that hippocampal lesions produced impairments of the learning performance in each strain of mouse, but the temporal distribution of the errors over the experiment was found to be strain dependent. On the other hand, medial frontal cortex lesions selectively affected the learning performances since the acquisition process of only the C57BL/6 lesioned mice differed significantly from the other groups. The effects of these lesions are discussed in terms of genetically associated differences of brain structures and functions. It is suggested that investigations of such differences can provide an experimental model for the study of functional and structural recovery.
