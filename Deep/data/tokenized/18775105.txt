OBJECTIVE: Glycine transporter-1 (GLYT1) is an early marker of neural development and involved in the excitatory transmission in cortex. The study was designed to investigate the expression of GLYT1 in different parts of the brain by immunohistochemistry in the rat cortical dysplasia model. METHODS: On postnatal day 0, one freeze lesion was carried out on ten rats between bregma and lambda on the skull in the right hemisphere for 5 seconds. Six weeks later, rats were transcardially perfused with fixative and then their brains were removed for both hamotoxylin-eosine (H&E) staining for histopathology and immunohistochemistry staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytic activity and GLYT1 in the cortical dysplastic region and other rostral brain regions involving epileptogenesis such as hippocampus, pyriform cortex, amygdala, thalamus and substantia nigra. RESULTS: GFAP immunoreactivity showed clusters of glial cells in the area of the microgyrus. Dense GLYT1 expression was localized to superficial layer of microgyric cortex and around the microgyrus. GLYT1 immunoreactivity was not detected in the other rostral regions. DISCUSSION: GLYT1 stained superficial structures might correspond to immature neuron and higher concentrations of GLYT1 around microgyrus might be correlated with increased excitatory mechanisms in these regions.
