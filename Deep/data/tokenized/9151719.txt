One of the key questions concerning glutamate toxicity is how a transient NMDA exposure can lead to a delayed death of neurons. To address this issue, we performed whole-cell recording on acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons to monitor the membrane response after NMDA exposure. Transient NMDA exposure (100 microM, 10 min) induced an inward current (postexposure current; Ipe) which was associated with a Ca2+- and Na+-permeable cation conductance. Ipe continuously increased (in the absence of NMDA) until death of the neuron occurred. Application of NMDA in the absence of extracellular calcium failed to trigger Ipe and neuronal death. Postexposure suppression of Ipe protected against NMDA toxicity. These results indicate that a cation current, which is induced by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and is itself partly carried by Ca2+, links the initial NMDA exposure to neuronal death.
