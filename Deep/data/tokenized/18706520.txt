We describe two female patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and chronic drug-resistant psychosis. In both patients, MRI scans revealed left mesial temporal sclerosis. After clinical assessment, ictal video/EEG monitoring, and a neuropsychological evaluation including Wada testing, the patients underwent selective left amygdalohippocampectomy. Since the operation, the two patients have remained free of seizures for 17 and 15 months. During the same period, both patients have sustained a full remission of the psychosis.
