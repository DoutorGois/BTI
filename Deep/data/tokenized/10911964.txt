Data from an ongoing study of differences in the total number of neurons in the five major subdivisions of the hippocampal regions of the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal age-matched controls confirm an earlier finding from our laboratories of a pronounced loss of CA1 neurons associated with AD. In view of an earlier finding that the CA1 region does not suffer normal age-related neuronal loss, these data support the earlier conclusion that the neuropathologic mechanisms involved in the AD-related losses in CA1 are not related to normal aging and that the study of the cellular and molecular events involved in the AD-related loss of CA1 cells can aid in the identification of the unique pathologic processes associated with AD.
