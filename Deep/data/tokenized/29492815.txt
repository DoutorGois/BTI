The present study evaluated the protective effects of Centella asiatica (CA) leaf extract on behavioral deficits and neurotoxicity in adult rat exposed to lead during perinatal period. Adult Wistar rats were exposed to 0.15% lead acetate (Pb) from gestation day 6 through drinking water and the pups were exposed lactationally to Pb till weaning. Significant perturbations in locomotor activity and exploratory behavior were observed in rats exposed to Pb during perinatal period. The levels of lipid peroxidation increased significantly with a reduction in levels of glutathione and activity levels of acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes in hippocampus, cerebrum, cerebellum, and medulla of brains excised from Pb-exposed rats. Oral supplementation of CA during postweaning period provided significant protection against Pb-induced behavioral impairments and neurotoxicity, without chelating tissue Pb levels. The possible neuroprotective efficacy of CA may be due to its antioxidant potential but not by lowering effects of brain Pb content.
