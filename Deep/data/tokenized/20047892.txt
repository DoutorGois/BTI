Stroke results in damages to many biochemical, molecular and behavioral deficits. Present study provides evidence of the protective efficacy of a Unani herbal medicine, Majun Khadar (MK), against cerebral ischemia-induced behavioral dysfunctions and neurochemical alterations in the hippocampus (HIP). Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 22 h in a rat model. Rats were divided into four groups: sham, middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAO), drug sham (MK; 0.816 g kg(-1) orally for 15 days) and MK pre-treated ischemic group (MK + MCAO). Levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants were estimated in HIP along with behavioral testing. MK pre-treatment significantly (P < .05-.001) restored the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and decreased the level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and H2O2 content in HIP in the MK + MCAO group which were severely altered in the MCAO group. The content of glutathione (GSH), total thiols (TT) and ascorbic acid (AsA) was significantly depleted in the MCAO group; pretreatment with MK was able to restore its levels. Also in the MK + MCAO group, significant (P < .5-.001) recovery in behavioral testing by rota rod and open-field activities was seen as compared with the MCAO group. MK alone did not show any change neither in the status of various antioxidants nor behavioral functions over sham values. Although detailed studies are required for the evaluation of exact neuroprotective mechanism of MK against cerebral ischemia these preliminary experimental findings conclude that MK exhibits neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia by potentiating the antioxidant defense system of the brain.
