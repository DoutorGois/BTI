Voltage-gated CaV1.2 channels (L-type calcium channel alpha1C subunits) are critical mediators of transcription-dependent neural plasticity. Whether these channels signal via the influx of calcium ion (Ca(2+)), voltage-dependent conformational change (VDeltaC), or a combination of the two has thus far been equivocal. We fused CaV1.2 to a ligand-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channel, enabling independent control of localized Ca(2+) and VDeltaC signals. This revealed an unexpected dual requirement: Ca(2+) must first mobilize actin-bound Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, freeing it for subsequent VDeltaC-mediated accumulation. Neither signal alone sufficed to activate transcription. Signal order was crucial: Efficiency peaked when Ca(2+) preceded VDeltaC by 10 to 20 seconds. CaV1.2 VDeltaC synergistically augmented signaling by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Furthermore, VDeltaC mistuning correlated with autistic symptoms in Timothy syndrome. Thus, nonionic VDeltaC signaling is vital to the function of CaV1.2 in synaptic and neuropsychiatric processes.
