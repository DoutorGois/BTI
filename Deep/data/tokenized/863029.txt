2nd somatosensory area (C2) was shown to have modulating influence on evoked activity of the 1st somatosensory and visual areas. Electrical stimulation of C2 evoked short latency potentials in the structures of paleocortex (hippocampus) and striatum (putamen, caudate nucleus). Analysis of the data obtained here and elsewhere (19) suggests the important role of C2 in mechanisms of selection, comparison and integration of adequate sensory information under conditions of uncertainty, for the programming of behaviour.
