Traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits a sequence of complex biochemical changes including oxidative stress, oedema, inflammation and excitotoxicity. These factors contribute to the high morbidity and mortality following TBI, although their underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a non-selective cation channel, highly expressed in the brain and immune cells. Recent studies have implicated TRPM2 channels in processes involving oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death. However, no studies have investigated the role of TRPM2 in TBI pathophysiology. In the present study, we have characterised TRPM2 mRNA and protein expression following experimental TBI. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were injured using the impact-acceleration model of diffuse TBI with survival times between 5 and 5 days. Real-time RT-PCR (including reference gene validation studies) and semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry were used to quantify TRPM2 mRNA and protein levels, respectively, following TBI. Significant increases in TRPM2 mRNA and protein expression were observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of injured animals, suggesting that TRPM2 may contribute to TBI injury processes such as oxidative stress, inflammation and neuronal death. Further characterisation of how TRPM2 may contribute to TBI pathophysiology is warranted.
