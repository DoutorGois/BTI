This study investigated the molecular mechanism of brain impairment induced by drinking fluoridated water and selenium intervention. Results showed that the learning and memory of rats in NaF group significantly decreased. Moreover, the number of apoptotic cells, the expression levels of Cytc mRNA and protein, and the expression levels of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 mRNA significantly increased; by contrast, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 protein levels significantly decreased. Compared with the NaF group, the mRNA levels of Cytc and Caspase-9, as well as the protein levels of Cytc in NaF+Se group, significantly decreased. Conversely, the protein levels of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9, as well as the mRNA levels of Caspase-3, significantly increased. Thus, the mitochondrial CytC-Caspase-9-Caspase-3 apoptosis pathway in the hippocampus was one of the mechanisms leading to fluorosis-induced brain damage. Furthermore, the Cytc signaling molecules were possibly the key target molecules in fluorosis-induced apoptosis, and selenium could alleviate fluorosis-induced brain injury.
