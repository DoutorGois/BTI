Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common and challenging neurodegenerative diseases in humans and is characterized by: progressive impairment in cognitive function, degeneration of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (CBF), neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) depositions. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a transmembrane protein of which abnormal processing produces Abeta that is associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Neurotrophic factors have attracted much attention for their potential as a remedy for neurological disorders. In this regard, nerve growth factor (NGF) has generated a great interest as a potential target for the treatment of AD. This interest is based on the observation that CBF neurons, which provide the major source of cholinergic innervation to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, undergo selective and severe degeneration in advanced AD and that the survival of CBF neurons depends upon NGF and its receptors, namely, trkA and p75NTR. This review focuses on recent findings about APP, NGF and their potential signaling-connections to the protein encoded by the 'Sunday-driver' (SYD) gene.
