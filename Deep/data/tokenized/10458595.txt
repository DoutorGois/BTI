Transient ischemia increases tyrosine phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B in the rat hippocampus. The authors investigated the effects of this increase on the ability of the receptor subunits to bind to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of Src and Fyn expressed as glutathione-S-transferase-SH2 fusion proteins. The NR2A and NR2B bound to each of the SH2 domains and binding was increased approximately twofold after ischemia and reperfusion. Binding was prevented by prior incubation of hippocampal homogenates with a protein tyrosine phosphatase or by a competing peptide for the Src SH2 domain. Ischemia induced a marked increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in the postsynaptic density (PSD), including NR2A and NR2B, but had no effect on the amounts of individual NMDA receptor subunits in the PSD. The level of Src and Fyn in PSDs, but not in other subcellular fractions, was increased after ischemia. The ischemia-induced increase in the interaction of NR2A and NR2B with the SH2 domains of Src and Fyn suggests a possible mechanism for the recruitment of signaling proteins to the PSD and may contribute to altered signal transduction in the postischemic hippocampus.
