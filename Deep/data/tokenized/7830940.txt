The effect of electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus on accumbens dopamine release was examined. Stimulation of the kindled hippocampus that produced stage 3 seizures evoked a brief increase in extracellular DA and DOPAC levels in the contralateral nucleus accumbens. In contrast, similar stimulation early in the development of kindling producing a stage 1 seizure did not evoke this increase.
