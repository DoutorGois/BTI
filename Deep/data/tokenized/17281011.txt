The aim of this study is to investigate how firing patterns of neuron in hippocampus change with coupling effect between soma and dendrite via simulation of single neuron firings by a two-compartment (soma-dendrite) model. The results will help to understand how firing patterns relative to synaptic plasticity in further study. The neuron model used in this study consisted two compartments: the soma compartment and the dendrite compartment, which can describe synaptic input functions. Simulations of neural firings were performed with fourth order Runge-Kutta algorithm with different range of coupling conductance. Firing patterns of neuron were simulated under different current applied to soma (Is). The range for different firing patterns is: Is=0..A/cm2, range for spiking is [0.0, 1.8] and [4.5, ..], for bursting is [1.9,4.4]; Is=0.5..A/cm2, range for spiking is [0.0, 2.2] and [4.0, ..], for bursting is [2.3,3.9]; Is=1.0..A/cm2, range for spiking is [0.0, 2.5] and [3.6, ..], for bursting is [2.6,3.5]; Is=1.5..A/cm2, range for spiking is [0.0, 2.5] and [3.8, ..], for bursting is [2.6,3.7]; Is=2.0..A/cm2, range for spiking is [0.0, 2.6] and [3.6, ..], for bursting is [2.7,3.5]; Is=2.5..A/cm2, range for spiking is [0.0, 2.6] and [3.3, ..], for bursting is [2.7,3.2].
