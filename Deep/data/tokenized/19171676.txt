Cytosolic sulfotransferases (SULTs) are a family of Phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a sulfonate group from 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate to endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. Several SULT isoform messages have been detected in the human brain; however, protein expression patterns have not been characterized. Immunoblot analysis of the SULT1A1 and 1A3 isoforms was carried out with cytosolic fractions isolated from superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, cerebellum, occipital pole, frontal pole, and temporal pole regions of normal adult human brains. SULT1A1 expression was highest in cytosolic fractions isolated from cerebellum, occipital, and frontal lobes, whereas, SULT1A3 expression was highest in cytosol from superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, and temporal lobe. SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 immunoreactivities were found in both neurons and glial cells by immunohistochemical analysis in all brain regions studied. SULT1A1 is known to catalyze the metabolism of small phenols, whereas SULT1A3 sulfates catecholamine neurotransmitters. Because SULT1A1 and 1A3 have distinct substrate specificities, the differences in expression pattern and cellular localization of the SULT1A isoforms are probably associated with the distribution and function of their selective substrates in the different brain regions.
