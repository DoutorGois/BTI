Parvalbumin mRNA was localized in rat brain by in situ hybridization using a 35S labelled rat parvalbumin cDNA and a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (corresponding to base sequences 140 to 183 of rat parvalbumin cDNA). Strongest hybridization signals were detected in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and in neurones of the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Signal was also detected in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and brain stem in agreement with the distribution of parvalbumin immunoreactivity.
