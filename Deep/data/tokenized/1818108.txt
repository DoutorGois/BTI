The availability of relatively large amounts of nerve growth factor (NGF) has allowed extensive in vitro and in vivo characterization of the neuronal specificity of this neurotrophic factor. The restricted neuronal specificity of NGF (sympathetic neurons, neural crest-derived sensory neurons, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons) has long predicted the existence of other neurotrophic factors possessing different neuronal specificities. Whereas there have been many reports of "activities" distinct from NGF, full characterization of such molecules has been hampered by their extremely low abundance. The recent molecular cloning of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) revealed that this protein is closely related to NGF and suggested that these two factors might be members of an even larger gene family. A PCR cloning strategy based on homologies between NGF and BDNF has allowed us to identify and clone a third member of the NGF family which we have termed neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). The establishment of suitable expression systems has now made available sufficient quantities of these proteins to allow us to begin to establish the neuronal specificity of each member of the neurotrophin family, and the role of each in development, maintenance and repair of the PNS and CNS. Using primary cultures of various PNS and CNS regions of the developing chick and rat, and Northern blot analysis, we describe novel neuronal specificities of BDNF, NT-3 and an unrelated neurotrophic factor-ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).
