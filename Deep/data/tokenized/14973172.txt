Clinical and experimental evidence indicate that infection in pregnancy is associated with fetal brain damage. However, the inflammatory processes that compromise the fetal brain are not fully understood. In this study, we used a single, low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1 microg/kg i.v.) to provoke an acute-phase response in unanesthetized fetal sheep in utero. COX-2 mRNA was increased in the cortex and cerebellum at 24 and 48 h after LPS, and immunoreactive COX-2 protein was increased in perivascular cells throughout gray and white matter at 24 h after LPS administration. Plasma albumin was observed in the parenchyma of the brain in cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, corpus callosum, fornix, hippocampus, midbrain, subcallosal bundle, and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Large, rounded, lectin-positive cells with the appearance of macrophages were observed around blood vessels in subventricular white matter. These results indicate that blood-brain barrier permeability is increased in the fetal brain after exposure to endotoxin and suggests that cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory substances could pass from the circulation into the brain after peripheral inflammatory stimulation.
