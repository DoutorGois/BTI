This study examined the comparative effects of body height and body weight on the neuronal cell size in humans and investigated their possible mechanisms. A total of 21 cases between the ages of 20 and 40 years were studied. Data on body height, body weight, and neuropathology were obtained from autopsy records. Mean cross sectional areas of cell bodies for 30 normal neurons were determined for the motor cortex projecting to lumbar spinal cord segments (L) 1-4 (Betz cells) as well as various regions of the hippocampus. Approximate axonal length of the motor neuron studied was measured from motor cortex to L2. We found that only motor cortex neuronal cell body size was significantly proportional to body height and the respective axonal length (p < .05). The findings indicate that: 1) body height has a greater effect than body weight on the motor neuron cell size, probably because of its association with axonal length; 2) the effect is regional (motor cortex) rather than general.
