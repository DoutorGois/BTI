The present study aims to investigate the effects of mood stabilizers, lithium (Li) and valproate (VPA), on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brains of rats subjected to an animal model of mania induced by D-amphetamine (D-AMPH). In the reversal treatment, Wistar rats were first given D-AMPH or saline (Sal) for 14 days. Between days 8 and 14, the rats were treated with Li, VPA, or Sal. In the prevention treatment, rats were pretreated with Li, VPA, or Sal. AChE activity was measured in the brain structures (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum). Li, alone in reversion and prevention treatments, increased AChE activity in the brains of rats. VPA, alone in prevention treatment, increased AChE activity in all brain regions evaluated; in the reversion, only in the prefrontal. However, D-AMPH decreased activity of AChE in the striatum of rats in both the reversion and prevention treatments. VPA was able to revert and prevent this AChE activity alteration in the rat striatum. Our findings further support the notion that the mechanisms of mood stabilizers also involve changes in AChE activity, thus reinforcing the need for more studies to better characterize the role of acetylcholine in bipolar disorder.
