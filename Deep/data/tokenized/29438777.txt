Up to this day, the roles of PEA15 expression and its phosphorylation in seizure-related events have not been still unclear. In the present study, we found that PEA15 was distinctly phosphorylated in reactive astrocytes and apoptotic astrocytes in the rat hippocampus following LiCl-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity). PEA15-serine (S) 104 phosphorylation was up-regulated in reactive astrocytes following SE, although PEA15 expression and its S116 phosphorylation were unaltered. Bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, attenuated SE-induced reactive astrogliosis, but phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, a PKC activator) aggravated it. Unlike reactive astrocytes, PEA15-S116 phosphorylation was reduced in apoptotic astrocytes. However, PEA15 expression and its S104 phosphorylation were unchanged in apoptotic astrocyte. Neither BIM nor PMA affected SE-induced astroglial apoptosis. PEA15 expression and its phosphorylations were not relevant to SE-induced CA1 neuronal death. These findings indicate that PEA15-S104 and S116 phosphorylations may play a role in reactive astrogliosis and prevention of astroglial apoptosis, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that the selective manipulation of PEA15 phosphorylations may regulate apoptotic and/or proliferative signals in astrocytes.
