Analysis of binding data from saturation experiments using a radiolabeled oxytocin antagonist ([125I]OTA) demonstrated an increase in binding affinity after treatment with 5 micrograms estradiol benzoate (EB) for 3 days in membrane fractions from the medial preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus (MPOA-AH) of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Analysis of data from competition experiments revealed high- and low-affinity [125I]OTA binding sites in the MPOA-AH, the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), and hippocampus of OVX controls. Three days of EB treatment reduced low-affinity binding sites in the MPOA-AH and MBH, but not in the hippocampus. Treatment of membrane fractions from the MPOA-AH of oil-treated OVX rats in vitro with 100 nM OT or with estrogen or progesterone conjugated to bovine serum albumin (E-BSA and P-BSA) also reduced low-affinity [125I]OTA binding sites but BSA alone did not.
