Tetanus toxin is a potent neurotoxin, the mode of action of which is unknown, although it is widely considered to be mediated by loss of inhibitory neurotransmission. In the present study we have investigated the effect of a single unilateral injection of tetanus toxin in the hippocampus on extracellular concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine and their metabolites in freely moving rats. Tetanus toxin treatment caused a progressive decline in hippocampal dialysate 5-hydroxytryptamine over the 3-day period following the injection. After 3 days the level of 5-HT on the injected side was only 20% of the control side. On the second day of observation the level of dopamine was found to be elevated by more than 2-fold but this was not the case for either of the other 2 days studied. The 5-hydroxytryptamine metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid declined in a manner similar to that of the parent transmitter, but to a lesser extent. Of the dopamine metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was decreased on the second and third days of observation, whilst homovanillic acid was not significantly altered during the period of observation.
