It is well established that the microtubules of the mitotic spindle are organized by a variety of motor proteins, and it appears that the same motors or closely related variants organize microtubules in the postmitotic neuron. Specifically, cytoplasmic dynein and the kinesin-related motor known as CHO1/MKLP1 are used within the mitotic spindle, and recent studies suggest that they are also essential for the establishment of the axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays of the neuron. Other motors are required to tightly regulate microtubule behaviors in the mitotic spindle, and it is attractive to speculate that these motors might also help to regulate microtubule behaviors in the neuron. Here we show that a homolog of the mitotic kinesin-related motor known as Eg5 continues to be expressed in rodent neurons well after their terminal mitotic division. In neurons, Eg5 is directly associated with the microtubule array and is enriched within the distal regions of developing processes. This distal enrichment is transient, and typically lost after a process has been clearly defined as an axon or a dendrite. Strong expression can resume later in development, and if so, the protein concentrates within newly forming sprouts at the distal tips of dendrites. We suggest that Eg5 generates forces that help to regulate microtubule behaviors within the distal tips of developing axons and dendrites.
