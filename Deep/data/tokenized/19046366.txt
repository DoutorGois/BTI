The cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie acquired changes in Ca(2+) dynamics of different neuronal compartments are important in the induction and maintenance of epileptiform activity. Simultaneous electrophysiology and Ca(2+) imaging techniques were used to understand the basic properties of dendritic Ca(2+) signaling in rat subicular pyramidal neurons during epileptiform activity. Distance-dependent changes in the Ca(2+) decay kinetics locked to spontaneous epileptiform discharges and back-propagating action potentials were observed in the apical dendrites. A decrement in the mean tau value of Ca(2+) decay was observed in distal parts (95-110 mum) of the apical dendrites compared with proximal segments (30-45 mum) in in-vitro epileptic conditions but not in control. Pharmacological agents that block Ca(2+) transporters, i.e. Na(+)/ Ca(2+) exchangers (Benzamil), plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps (Calmidazolium) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps (Thapsigargin), were applied locally to the proximal and distal part of the apical dendrites in both experimental conditions to understand the molecular aspects of the Ca(2+) extrusion mechanisms. The relative contribution of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchangers in Ca(2+) extrusion was higher in the distal apical dendrites in the in-vitro epileptic condition and this property modulated the excitability of the neuron in simulation. The Ca(2+) homeostatic mechanisms that restore normal Ca(2+) levels could play a major neuroprotective role in the distal dendrites that receive synaptic inputs.
