This study is to investigate the effects of huperzine A on memory deficits, neuronal damage and neurotrophic factors production after transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in mice, as well as the potential downstream signaling pathway. Bilateral common carotid occlusion (BCCAo) combined with systemic hypotension induced severe memory deficits in a water maze task and neuronal degeneration in cerebral cortex and hippocampus in mice. Oral administration of huperzine A (0.2 mg/kg, once per day, started 2 days before surgery and lasted for 7 days after surgery) markedly attenuated the memory deficits and neuronal damage. Meanwhile, huperzine A significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of NGF, BDNF and TGF-beta(1), and potentiated phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK 1/2 in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus compared with transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion group. This study provides evidence for the protective effects of huperzine A against transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in mice, and suggests potentially important roles that neurotrophic factors might play in these effects. It also indicates that the MAPK/ERK pathway might be involved in the in vivo neurotrophic effects of huperzine A against transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
