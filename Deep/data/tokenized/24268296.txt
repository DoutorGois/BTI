Neurofibrillary tangles, one of the characteristic pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are composed of paired helical filaments mainly with hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Inhibition of the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is an effective therapy for AD. The current study was designed to investigate the protective effects of alkaloids enriched extract from Dendrobium Nobile Lindl. (EDNLA), a Chinese medicinal herb, on hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in AD brain. Rats were administrated intragastrically with different doses of DNLA (20, 40 mg/kg) every 8h for one day, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 mug) injecting into the bilateral ventricle. Two hours later, the hippocampi of each group were collected to examine the hyperphosphorylated tau protein by western blotting. Additional rats were treated by EDNLA thrice daily for one week, to examine the effects on LPS-induced apoptosis in the brain. LPS injection significantly increased the expression of hyperphosphorylated tau protein at Ser396, Ser199-202, Ser404, Thr231, Thr205 sites and GSK-3beta increased, LPS also induced apoptosis in the brain. EDNLA dramatically ameliorated these abnormal changes (P<0.05). The present study demonstrated that EDNLA attenuates LPS-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in rat's hippocampus and protects against LPS-induced apoptosis in rat brain.
