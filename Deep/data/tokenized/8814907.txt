Angiotensin IV (Val Tyr Ile His Pro Phe), administered centrally, increases memory retrieval and induces c-fos expression in the hippocampus and piriform cortex. Angiotensin IV binds to a high affinity site that is quite distinct in pharmacology and distribution from the angiotensin II AT1 and AT2 receptors and is known as the AT4 receptor. These observations suggest that the AT4 receptor may have multiple central effects. The present study uses in vitro receptor autoradiography, and employs [125I]angiotensin IV to map AT4 receptors in the macaca fascicularis brain. The distribution of the AT4 receptor is remarkable in that its distribution extends throughout several neural systems. Most striking is its localization in motor nuclei and motor associated regions. These include the ventral horn spinal motor neurons, all cranial motor nuclei including the oculomotor, abducens, facial and hypoglossal nuclei, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Receptors are also present in the vestibular, reticular and inferior olivary nuclei, the granular layer of the cerebellum, and the Betz cells of the motor cortex. Moderate AT4 receptor density is seen in all cerebellar nuclei, ventral thalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra pars compacta, with lower receptor density observed in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Abundant AT4 receptors are also found in areas associated with cholinergic nuclei and their projections, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, ventral limb of the diagonal band and the hippocampus, somatic motor nuclei and autonomic preganglionic motor nuclei. AT4 receptors are also observed in sensory regions, with moderate levels in spinal trigeminal, gracile, cuneate and thalamic ventral posterior nuclei, and the somatosensory cortex. The abundance of the AT4 receptor in motor and cholinergic neurons, and to a lesser extent, in sensory neurons, suggests multiple roles for the AT4 receptor in the primate brain.
