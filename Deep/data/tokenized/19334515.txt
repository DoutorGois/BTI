Hemantane (N-adamant-2-yl-hexamethyleneimine hydrochlortide) is a new antiparkinsonian drug showing a broad activity spectrum, being superior to the reference drug amantadine in some tests. The effects of hemantane on the levels of biogenic amines and their metabolites in the striatum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus have been studied in C57BL/6 mice. It was found that a single administration of hemantane (20 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the concentration of DOPA, serotonin, and its metabolite in mice striatum, gently inhibited the synthesis of dopamine in mice striatum, and influenced the HVA/DA balance in frontal cortex homogenates.
