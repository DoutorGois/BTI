Sensitivity of CA3 field neurones to hydrocortisone hemisuccinate, sodium dexamethasone-21-phosphate and angiotensin II was studied in experiments on surviving sections of the mouse hippocampus. High sensitivity of the neurones of surviving sections of the hippocampus to the steroid hormones (hydrocortisone and dexamethasone) and virtually complete absence of responses to angiotensin II were demonstrated.
