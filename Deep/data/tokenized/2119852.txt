The effects of hypoxia on the epileptic seizures and neuronal damages induced by kainic acid were studied in rats using hypoxic chamber equipment. Rats treated with kainic acid and placed in atmospheric pressure showed typical limbic seizures and regressive neuronal changes in CA3 and CA4 of the hippocampus, while those kept in a hypoxic chamber with 8.5% O2 and 91.5% N2 showed moderate hypoxia and a slight decline of mean arterial blood pressure. In these hypoxic rats, seizures were completely prevented and there was remarkably less regressive neuronal injury of the hippocampus. Thus hypoxia has a rather ameliorative effect on the occurrence of seizures and excitotoxic neuronal injuries induced by kainic acid. The contribution of oxygen radicals and endogenous adenosine to preventing excitotoxic neuronal damages by kainic acid was discussed.
