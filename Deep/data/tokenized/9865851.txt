Effects of acute exposure (2 h) to either 1.5% halothane or 0.5% methoxyflurane on chemical mediators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats immediately after exposure, after the righting reflex (4 h), or 24 h postexposure. Effects of these anesthetics on hippocampal corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) were also evaluated. Methoxyflurane caused significant elevations in pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-like immunoreactivities in all three of the experiment's time groups, yet halothane failed to cause the same response immediately after exposure. Serum ACTH-like immunoreactivities were significantly elevated immediately after exposure to both anesthetics, but were not elevated at 4 and 24 h postexposure. Corticosterone (CORT)-like immunoreactivities were significantly elevated by halothane in all experimental groups, and in the 2- and 24-h groups following methoxyflurane exposure. Hippocampal CRF-like immunoreactivities remained unaffected by either anesthetic. Results indicate that a 2-h exposure to either halothane or methoxyflurane results in significant activation of the rat hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and that the activation appears to be sustained over a 24-h period.
