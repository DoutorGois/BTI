A stress-resistant rat model was introduced. SPORTS (Spontaneously-Running-Tokushima-Shikoku) rats showed significantly shorter time of immobility in the forced swim test compared to control Wister rats. Increase norepinephrine concentration secondary to decreased activity of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) in hippocampus was observed in this model rats. This model rats are considered to be useful for studying the mechanism of psychological stress.
