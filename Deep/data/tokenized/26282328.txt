The hippocampus is crucial for long-term episodic memory and learning. It undergoes structural change in aging and is sensitive to neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. MRS studies have seldom been performed in the hippocampus due to technical challenges. The reproducibility of MRS in the hippocampus has not been evaluated at 3 T. The purpose of the present study was to quantify the concentration of metabolites in a small voxel placed in the hippocampus and evaluate the reproducibility of the quantification. Spectra were measured in a 2.4 mL voxel placed in the left hippocampus covering the body and most of the tail of the structure in 10 healthy subjects across three different sessions and quantified using LCModel. High-quality spectra were obtained, which allowed a reliable quantification of 10 metabolites including glutamate and glutamine. Reproducibility of MRS was evaluated with coefficient of variation, standard errors of measurement, and intraclass correlation coefficients. All of these measures showed improvement with increased number of averages. Changes of less than 5% in concentration of N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds, and total creatine and of less than 10% in concentration of myo-inositol and the sum of glutamate and glutamine can be confidently detected between two measurements in a group of 20 subjects. A reliable and reproducible neurochemical profile of the human hippocampus was obtained using MRS at 3 T in a small hippocampal volume.
