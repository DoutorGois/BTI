In the hippocampus of freely-moving rats, basal extracellular levels of cGMP are inhibited by L-NARG or ODQ whereas they are increased by NO donors or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Activation of NMDA receptors also augments cGMP dialysate levels in a MK-801 and L-NARG sensitive manner, an effect dramatically diminished during ageing. Experiments with AMPA, AMPA receptor antagonists and cyclothiazide revealed complex relationships with GABAergic circuits that potently control the NO/cGMP pathway. Furthermore, the activity of this neurochemical cascade is also modulated by hippocampal nicotinic receptors via enhancement of endogenous glutamate release and stimulation of NMDA receptors. From a behavioural point of view, increased hippocampal excitation leads to the appearance of epileptic-like manifestations that, however, seem unrelated to the increase of NO/cGMP formation.
