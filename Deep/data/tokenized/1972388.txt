We have been interested in the possibility that arachidonic acid or one of its 12-lipoxygenase metabolites may function as a retrograde messenger in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. One criterion required of a retrograde messenger is that it stimulates presynaptic changes. Here, two possible presynaptic actions of arachidonic acid and its 12-lipoxygenase metabolites, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE), are examined. We report that arachidonic acid, HETE, and HPETE significantly increase both K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]glutamate and [3H]inositol labelling of inositol phosphates in synaptosomes, whereas other biologically important fatty acids (oleic, palmitic, and stearic) failed to induce a similar response. The findings of these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that arachidonic acid, HETE, or HPETE may play the role of a retrograde messenger in LTP.
