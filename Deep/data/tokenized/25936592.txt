Increasing body of evidence suggests that inflammatory and neurotrophic factors might be important for epileptogenesis. Most animal studies demonstrated altered levels of these mediators in drug-induced models of seizures and epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated the production of cytokines and a neurotrophin in the brain of Wistar Audiogenic Rats (WAR), a genetic model of epilepsy, stimulated with high-intensity sound. Four hours after stimulation, animals were decapitated and the hippocampus, inferior colliculus, striatum and cortex were removed for evaluation of the levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). All the cytokines and BDNF levels were increased in the cortex. Increased levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were also observed in the striatum. Finally, TNF-alpha also increased in the inferior colliculus after the seizures induced by high-intensity sound. Although different studies have demonstrated that the levels of cytokines and BDNF increase in animal models of epilepsy induced by chemical stimuli, we provided here evidence that these mediators are also increased in WAR, a genetic model of epilepsy. Thus, the observed increase in these mediators might be involved in the pathophysiology of epilepsy.
