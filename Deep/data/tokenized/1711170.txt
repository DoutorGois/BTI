The rat brain and spinal cord have been mapped for Type II glucocorticoid receptor-like immunoreactivity in neurons and glia, using a monoclonal antibody, BUGR2, which recognizes an epitope close to the DNA-binding domain of the rat Type II receptor. The study revealed a widespread distribution of Type II-like immunoreactive neurons and glia, and a heterogeneity of densities and intensities of immunoreactive elements. Our results corresponded to a large extent with previous immunocytochemical mapping using Ig2a, a monoclonal antibody against a different epitope in the variable domain, with some notable differences in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. There was also a good correlation between immunocytochemical mapping and binding studies, [3H]steroid autoradiography and mRNA localization of the Type II receptor.
