The influence of behavioral state on the induction of long-term enhancement (LTE) of hippocampal synapses was studied in chronically prepared animals. Perforant path evoked field potentials and EEG were recorded from fascia dentata during slow-wave sleep (SWS) and waking. LTE was strongly suppressed during SWS, suggesting that hippocampal information storage may be inactivated at certain phases of the sleep cycle. Normal LTE was observed in the same animals while awake.
