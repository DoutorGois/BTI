Ketamine in dose 10 mg/kg increased the number of erroneous choices of rats with spatial strategy and didn't effect searching accuracy of rats with non-spatial strategy in 8-arm radial maze. Ketamine in doses 1 and 5 mg/kg disrupted rat short-term memory in delayed response reaction. Physostigmine and aspartic acid, but not haloperidol, diminished ketamine amnesia, therefore ketamine impaired the interaction of cholinergic and glutamate/aspartatergic neurons of hippocampal areas.
