Previous correlative and interventive work from this laboratory has suggested that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is important for the maintenance of the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) response. One such study demonstrated that application of the cis-unsaturated fatty acid, oleate, a newly discovered PKC activator, could prolong the time course of LTP. The present study explored the mechanism of cis-unsaturated fatty acid action on LTP produced by perforant path stimulation. First, neither oleate application nor high-frequency stimulation alone produced a persistent change in synaptic transmission, while the 2 in conjunction did so. This suggests that oleate acts synergistically with the consequences of this stimulation to produce an enhancement of the LTP response. Second, oleate enhancement of LTP was more potent when applied in the perforant path synaptic terminal zone than in the dentate hilus, implying that the site of oleate action is at the synapse (where PKC is reported to be enriched). Third, translocation of PKC activity to the membrane was significantly increased after oleate-enhanced LTP relative to vehicle controls. PKC translocation was found to be unaltered by oleate application alone. Fourth, mepacrine blockade of the Ca2+-dependent enzyme phospholipase A2, which releases endogenous oleate from membrane phospholipids, inhibited the time-course of a persistent LTP response. This inhibition was shown to be reversible with oleate application. We propose that high-frequency stimulation produces an elevation of intracellular Ca2+, which then triggers phospholipase A2-mediated oleate release. This free oleate then could act in synergy with processes that render PKC oleate-sensitive to produce a persistent activation of PKC, which is critical for and leads to the persistence of the LTP response.
