We have performed immunocytochemistry on rat brains using a highly specific antiserum directed against the originally described form of the glutamate transporter GLT-1 (referred to hereafter as GLT-1alpha), and another against a C-terminal splice variant of this protein, GLT-1B. Both forms of GLT-1 were abundant in rat brain, especially in regions such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and macroscopic examination of sections suggested that both forms were generally regionally coexistent. However, disparities were evident; GLT-1alpha was present in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland, whereas GLT-1B was absent. Similar marked disparities were also noted in the external capsule, where GLT1A labeling was abundant but GLT-1B was only occasionally encountered. Conversely, GLT-1B was more extensively distributed, relative to GLT-1alpha, in areas such as the deep cerebellar nuclei. In most regions, such as the olfactory bulbs, both splice variants were present but differences were evident in their distribution. In cerebral cortex, patches were evident where GLT-1B was absent, whereas no such patches were evident for GLT-1alpha. At high resolution, other discrepancies were evident; double-labeling of areas such as hippocampus indicated that the two splice variants may either be differentially expressed by closely apposed glial elements or that the two splice variants may be differentially targeted to distinct membrane domains of individual glial cells.
