KCHO-1 is a novel product comprised of 30% ethanol extracts obtained from nine medical herbs, which are commonly used in traditional Korean and Chinese medicine. The nine herbs include Curcuma longa, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Gastrodia elata, Chaenomeles sinensis, Polygala tenuifolia, Paeonia japonica, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Atractylodes japonica and processed Aconitum carmichaeli. Recent studies have reported the beneficial effects of these herbs. The present study aimed to investigate the direct neuroprotective effects of KCHO1 on HT22 mouse hippocampal cells, and to determine the possible underlying mechanisms. KCHO1 significantly suppressed glutamate and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)induced cell damage, and reactive oxygen species generation. In addition, KCHO1 increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of heme oxygenase (HO)1. Tin protoporphyrin, which is an inhibitor of HO activity, partially suppressed the effects of KCHO1. Furthermore, KCHO1 significantly upregulated nuclear factor erythroidderived 2related factor2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation. Extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) activation also appeared to be associated with KCHO1induced HO1 expression, since the ERK inhibitor PD98059 suppressed HO1 expression and prevented KCHO1induced cytoprotection. The results of the present study suggested that KCHO1 may effectively prevent glutamate or H2O2induced oxidative damage via Nrf2/ERK mitogenactivated protein kinasedependent HO1 expression. These data suggest that KCHO1 may be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
