BACKGROUND: Emerging data have demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) activation confers a potentially neuroprotective role in some neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether PPARdelta is involved in depression is unknown. METHODS: In this study, PPARdelta was firstly investigated in the chronic mild stress (CMS) and learned helplessness (LH) models of depression. The changes in depressive behaviors and hippocampal neurogenesis were investigated after PPARdelta overexpression by microinfusion of the lentiviral vector, containing the coding sequence of mouse PPARdelta (LV-PPARdelta), into the bilateral dentate gyri of the hippocampus or PPARdelta activation by repeated systemic administration of PPARdelta agonist GW0742 (5 or 10mg/kg.d, i.p., for 21 d). RESULTS: We found that both CMS and LH resulted in a significant decrease in the PPARdelta expression in the hippocampi of mice, and this change was reversed by treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine. PPARdelta overexpression and PPARdelta activation each suppressed the CMS- and LH-induced depressive-like behavior and produced an antidepressive effect. In vivo or in vitro studies also showed that both overexpression and activation of PPARdelta enhanced proliferation or differentiation of neural stem cells in the hippocampi of mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that hippocampal PPARdelta upregulation represses stress-induced depressive behaviors, accompanied by enhancement of neurogenesis.
