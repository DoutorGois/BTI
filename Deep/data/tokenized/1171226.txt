Six dogs with implanted cortical and subcortical electrodes were trained to press a lever to avoid electroshock to a hind leg. Intracerebral stimulation at low frequency was delivered as an "indifferent" or a "CD" tracer. Changes of EEG responses to the tracers prior to the voluntary lever-pressing or the conditioned avoidance lever-pressing were prior to the voluntary lever-pressing or the conditioned avoidance lever-pressing were examined by continuous frequency analysis. (1) Evoked potentials to the tracer stimulation were changed just before the conditioned defensive reflex, the voluntary lever-pressing and the conditioned avoidance lever-pressing, regardless of the site of the tracer stimulation. (2) The cortical and subcortical structures (Hippo, RF) seemed to be involved in the neural circuit responsible for the avoidance lever-pressing, whereas the sensorimotor cortex may be essential in the circuit for the alimentary lever-pressing. (3) The avoidance lever-pressing and the EEG response to the "CS" tracer were influenced by the internal inhibition (experimental extinction, inhibitory mechanism was discussed.
