Activity of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and kinetic parameters (Km, Vmax) for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine deamination were examined in the brain of rats with conditioned passive avoidance recall. Changes of the 5-HT and dopamine deamination were found in amygdala, striatum and frontal cortex. MAO activity was not changed in hippocampus. In amygdala the rate of 5-HT deamination was significantly increased and kinetic studies revealed increased affinity of the enzyme for 5-HT. The metabolism of dopamine in amygdala was unchanged. In frontal cortex the deamination of 5-HT was not changed, but the dopamine deamination significantly decreased. This decrease was due to lowering of MAO affinity for dopamine. In striatum the metabolism of both 5-HT and dopamine was reduced, and kinetic studies showed the lowering of Vmax for 5-HT and dopamine deamination.
