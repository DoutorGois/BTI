The expression of food-anticipatory activity (FAA) is induced by restricted feeding (RF), and its entrainment requires food-entrainable oscillators, the neuroanatomical basis of which is currently unclear. Although RF impacts various hormones, sex-related differences in FAA are unclear. 'Here, we report significantly more food-anticipatory wheel-running activity in male than in female mice during RF. In parallel with the sex-related difference in FAA, male and female mice display different food intake and body weight in response to RF. Since gonadal hormones could be involved in the sex-specific difference in FAA, we compared sham and gonadectomized male and female wild-type mice. In gonadectomized mice, the sex difference in FAA was abolished, indicating a role for gonadal hormones in FAA. Further, plasma concentrations of the hormone ghrelin were higher in female than in male mice during ad libitum (AL) feeding, and RF induced a temporal advance in its peak in both sexes. RF also shifted the expression peak of the circadian gene mPer1 in the hippocampus and liver, although no sex difference was found in either the level or the cyclic phase of its expression. Per1(Brdm1) mutant mice were still sexually dimorphic for FAA, but diminished FAA was noted in both male and female Per2(Brdm1) mutant mice. In summary, our results imply that gonadal hormones contribute to the sex difference in FAA, possibly through modulating ghrelin activity.
