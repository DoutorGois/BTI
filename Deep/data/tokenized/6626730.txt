During kindling electric stimulation of the hippocamp, some rabbits demonstrate the appearance of spontaneous interictal spikes (SIS). First they appear in the stimulated hippocamp, then in the contralateral one, and later on in the neocortex. The development of the kindling syndrome depends on the relationship between SIS in the neocortex and hippocamp and the degree of their synchronism. If the amount of SIS in the hippocamp considerably exceeds that in the cortex, the kindling syndrome rapidly progresses. Alternatively, provided that the amount of SIS in the cortex significantly rises and drops at the same time in the hippocamp, the kindling syndrome disappears.
