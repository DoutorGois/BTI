Autophagy has been suggested to participate in the pathology of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD). However, its regulatory role in HIBD remains unclear and was thus examined here using a rat model. To induce HIBD, the left common carotid artery was ligated in neonatal rats, and the rats were subjected to hypoxia for 2 hours. Some of these rats were intraperitoneally pretreated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (10 mM in 10 muL) or the autophagy stimulator rapamycin (1 g/kg) 1 hour before artery ligation. Our findings demonstrated that hypoxia-ischemia-induced hippocampal injury in neonatal rats was accompanied by increased expression levels of the autophagy-related proteins light chain 3 and Beclin-1 as well as of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1, but by reduced expression of GluR2. Pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked hypoxia-ischemia-induced hippocampal injury, whereas pretreatment with the autophagy stimulator rapamycin significantly augmented hippocampal injury. Additionally, 3-methyladenine pretreatment blocked the hypoxia-ischemia-induced upregulation of GluR1 and downregulation of GluR2 in the hippocampus. By contrast, rapamycin further elevated hippocampal GluR1 levels and exacerbated decreased GluR2 expression levels in neonates with HIBD. Our results indicate that autophagy inhibition favors the prevention of HIBD in neonatal rats, at least in part, through normalizing GluR1 and GluR2 expression.
