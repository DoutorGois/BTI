In two dogs with electrodes chronically implanted in the hippocampus, hippocampal electrical activity and the heart rate were recorded in the process of elaboration of a conditioned switch-over of operant alimentary and defensive responses. Averaged computerized spectral characteristics of hippocampal theta-rhythm were essentially different between the alimentary and defensive situations in intersignal period as well as during the action of triggering conditioned stimulus. Individual differences in the dominant frequency of bioelectrical activity were observed. The animal with a higher theta-rhythm frequency elaborated conditioned switch-over of heterogeneous operant responses sooner and more successfully.
