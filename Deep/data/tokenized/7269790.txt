Long-lasting potentiation was examined in the dentate gyrus -- area CA3 pathway by extra- and intracellular recording from slices of the mouse hippocampus. Tetanization of the dentate gyrus led to a shortening of the latency of action potentials (APs) and EPSPs recorded from the area CA3, to an increase in the amplitude of EPSPs and in the steepness of their ascending slope and to an augmented probability of APs. These changes persisted for a period of several seconds to 30 min after tetanization. The results suggest that monosynaptic EPSPs also can undergo long-lasting (up to 30 min) post-potentiation.
