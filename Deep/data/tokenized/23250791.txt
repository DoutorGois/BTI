Hippocalcin, a member of the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) subclass of the calmodulin superfamily, serves as an important calcium sensor for the slow afterhyperpolarizing (sAHP) current in the hippocampus, which underlies some forms of learning and memory. Hippocalcin is also a calcium sensor for hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) and genetically linked to neurodegenerative diseases. We report NMR chemical shift assignments of Ca(2+)-free hippocalcin (BMRB no. 18627).
