As a structure involved in learning and memory, the hippocampus functions as a network. The functional differentiation along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus is poorly demarcated in comparison with the transverse axis. Using patch clamp recordings in conjunction with post hoc anatomy, we have examined the pattern of connectivity and the functional differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus. Here, we provide anatomical and physiological evidence that the prominent rhythmic network activities of the hippocampus, the behavior-specific gamma and theta oscillations, are seen predominantly along the transverse and longitudinal axes respectively. This orthogonal relationship is the result of the axonal field trajectories and the consequential interaction of the principal cells and major interneuron subtypes involved in generating each rhythm. Thus, the axonal arborization patterns of hippocampal inhibitory cells may represent a structural framework for the spatiotemporal distribution of activity observed within the hippocampus.
