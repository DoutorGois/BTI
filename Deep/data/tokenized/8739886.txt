The early ontogenetic pattern of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression was studied in the rat brain through embryonic days (E) 12 to 17. Using a [35S]-labelled GR antisense RNA probe for in situ hybridization, we first detected GR mRNA in E13 embryos. The strongest signal was in Rathke's pouch, but the hypothalamic, and to a lesser degree the pontine and rhinencephalic neuroepithelium were also moderately labelled. Significant levels of GR mRNA were also detected in the choroid plexus and the epithelia lining the ventricles on E13. Receptor gene expression was further extended by E15 to the neuroepithelium and the differentiating field of several neuronal structure primordia, including the basal ganglia, rhinencephalon, hippocampus, pons and cerebellum. On E17, GR gene expression was in addition detected in the amygdala, subiculum and olfactory bulb and cortex. The integrity of the mRNA transcripts revealed by in situ hybridization was assessed by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from embryonic brain and pituitary. A major approximately 7-kb transcript was detected throughout embryonic development. An adult-like GR protein was shown by immunoblotting analysis to be expressed in brain and pituitary extracts already by E13. Based on our results, we postulate a receptor-mediated regulatory role for glucocorticoids in the embryonic development of the rat brain.
