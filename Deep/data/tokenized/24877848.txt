ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: We isolated a single compound, 1-methoxyoctadecan-1-ol (MOD), from dried hooks and stems of Uncaria sinensis, which is used in traditional Korean medicine to provide relief from various nervous related symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neuroprotective effects of MOD against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells were investigated by analyzing cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase, flow cytometry, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Western blot assays. RESULTS: Exposure to glutamate alone resulted in remarkable hippocampal neuronal cell death; however, pretreatment with MOD resulted in suppression of neuronal death and ROS accumulation in connection with cellular Ca2+ level after exposure to glutamate. Stimulation by glutamate also caused significant protein level of phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and dephosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), however, pretreatment with MOD resulted in inhibition of these changes in protein level. Treatment with glutamate alone led to suppressed protein level of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB); however, pretreatment with MOD resulted in significant enhancement of this level of protein. Anti-oxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and both Ca2+ inhibitors, BAPTA and EGTA, showed effects similar to those of MOD in all proteins examined, except mature BDNF. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that MOD mainly exerted neuroprotective effects in suppression of ROS accumulation and up-regulation of mature BDNF in association with p38 MAPK and PI3K signaling in hippocampal neuronal cells.
