OBJECTIVE: Previous experiments in rats suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis over-responsiveness, which leads to increased secretion of immunoregulatory glucocorticoid hormones, increases periodontal disease susceptibility, whereas HPA axis under-responsiveness is associated with increased resistance to the disease. The present study was designed to investigate whether MK-801 (dizocilipine malate), an antagonist of the glutamate receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in the brain, which has been found to play an important role in the regulation of the HPA axis, would influence the outcome of experimental ligature-induced periodontal disease in a rat model. METHODS: Experimental periodontal disease was induced in periodontal disease susceptible and HPA axis high-responding Fischer 344 rats 2 days before chronic treatment with MK-801(1 mg/kg intraperitoneally). The periodontal breakdown was assessed after the ligatures had been in place for 23 days. Following intraperitoneal Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulation (Escherichia coli, 250 microg/kg), concentrations of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus, and levels of the cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), as well as the HPA axis-derived hormone corticosterone, were measured in serum. RESULTS: Compared to vehicle-treated controls, MK-801-treated rats had significantly increased periodontal tissue destruction (p < 0.01). MK-801-treated rats also showed significantly increased expression of GRs in the hippocampus (p < 0.05), elevated levels of corticosterone (p < 0.001) and reduced levels of TNF-alpha (p < 0.01) in serum 2 h after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. CONCLUSION: These findings may implicate glutamate receptor-dependent mechanisms in periodontal disease, and support the concept of a bidirectional immune-brain-immune regulatory network with importance for periodontal health and disease.
