The aim of this research was to examine possible role of dietary n-3 fatty acids in modulation of the age-related changes in phospholipid exchange in the rat hippocampus and cognitive function. In the hippocampus of fish oil-fed 24-month-old phosphatidylserine (PS) level was found to be increased whereas phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) contents decreased as compared with control group. However, fish oil exerted no effect on the PS synthesis de novo and decreased PC and PE synthesis in the hippocampus of old rats. In shuttle box active avoidance test, fish oil-treated rats showed an increase in the number of avoidances in the learning session.
