A novel method for visualization of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in vivo has been developed. Following intravenous administration of a radiolabelled acetylcholine analog, N-methyl-3-piperidyl acetate, there was very good agreement between the distribution of radioactivity and AChE activity in the brain of rat and monkey. The method would be applicable for in vivo studies of human brain AChE activity in disorders of central cholinergic systems such as Alzheimer's disease.
