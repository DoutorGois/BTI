The influence of transient forebrain ischemia on behavioral performance, and the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) on such ischemia-induced deficits were examined in Mongolian gerbils by assessing learning and memory in two tasks: passive avoidance and Morris water maze. A 5-min period of forebrain ischemia led to learning and memory deficits in both tasks, and also to neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region. Continuous i.c.v. infusion of aFGF bilaterally into the lateral ventricules by osmotic minipumps over 2 days before, and 5 days after the ischemia (a total of 3.6 microg/gerbil) largely prevented both the ischemia-induced behavioral deficits and the neuronal death in the hippocampus. These observations suggest that the hippocampus is a critical site for the performance of the two tasks, and that aFGF has a protective effect against such ischemia-induced learning and memory deficits in gerbils.
