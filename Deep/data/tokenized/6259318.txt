C57BL/6 mice were treated with 7% (v/v) ethanol in a Bio-Serve liquid diet for 7 days. Some animals were then allowed to withdraw from ethanol for a period of 24 hr. The severity of the ethanol withdrawal was assessed by monitoring behavioral changes and by quantitating the decrease in body temperature that occurred during the first 16 hr of withdrawal. Animals withdrawn from ethanol for 24 hr showed a decreased hypothermic response to apomorphine suggesting that changes in dopaminergic systems had occurred. This possibility was further examined in homogenates of striatum by measuring dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and the binding of [3H]spiroperidol. However, there were no changes observed in either basal- or dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity or in the density or affinity or receptors for [3H]spiroperidol. The affinity of apomorphine for the dopamine receptor was also unchanged. In other experiments, alpha and beta adrenergic receptor-mediated increases in cyclic AMP accumulation were assessed in slices of cerebral cortex. There was no change in cyclic AMP accumulation due to either alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. There was, however, a significant decrease in the density of beta adrenergic receptors in both the ethanol-treated mice and in the withdrawn mice. This decrease was restricted to the beta-2 receptor subtype with no change being observed in the density of beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Ethanol administration was also associated with a significant increase in the density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The effect was not observed in animals allowed to withdraw for 24 hr.
