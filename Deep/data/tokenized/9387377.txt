Northern Blot and hybrization in situ techniques were used to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on the changes of cholecystokinin (CCK) mRAN levels of the hippocampus in rat penicillin-induced epilepsy model. Epilepsy can significantly increase CCK mRNA levels in dentate gyrus and CA3 areas of hippocampus in diencephalic sections after penicillin-induced seizure, whereas EA not only can attenuate the seizure behaviors and EEG changes, but also can decrease the increase of CCK mRNA contents induced by the seizure. However, in the subiculum, dentate gyrus and CA3 areas of mesencephalic sections of rat hippocampus, EA can further increase the enhancement of CCK mRNA concentration induced by penicillin-induced seizure. The results suggest that EA inhibitory effects on the seizure's behaviors and epileptiform activities may be related to the alteration of CCK gene expression in the different area of hippocampus.
