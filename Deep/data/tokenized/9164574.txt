The objective of this investigation was to examine the immediate and long term effects of acute, chronic and chronic intermittent stress on the central noradrenergic system of rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to one hour of physical immobilization stress either as a single exposure, or as 14 exposures applied either on consecutive days, or randomly over 60 days. Animals were sacrificed immediately, 6 h and 24 h following the last stressor. Levels of norepinephrine (NE) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene-glycol sulfate (MHPG-sulfate) were measured in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and locus coeruleus region and beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR) density was determined in the cortex. Immediately after acute stress, a significant reduction in hypothalamic NE levels and marked increases in MHPG-sulfate levels in all four brain regions were observed. In contrast immediately after the last stressor of a chronic or chronic intermittent stress regimen, no change in NE concentration was observed while levels of MHPG-sulfate in the four brain regions showed a smaller increase than that observed after an acute stressor. Acute stress induced changes normalized within 6 h while chronic and chronic intermittently stressed animals had altered NE or MHPG-sulfate levels in certain brain regions for up to 6-24 h. Cortical BAR binding parameters remained unchanged after all stress paradigms.
