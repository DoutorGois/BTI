In order to test the functional significance of noradrenergic neurotransmission for brain maturation, rat pups were injected daily with clonidine from 8-21 days of postnatal life. In adulthood, single cell responses to microiontophoretically applied neurotransmitters were studied in different layers of the hippocampus. No significant differences were found in neuronal responsiveness to glutamate, GABA, or acetylcholine in the hippocampus of clonidine-treated rats as compared with age-matched controls. However, there was a significantly stronger depression of glutamate-evoked activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons by noradrenaline in the clonidine-treated rats.
