The fine structure of neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampal gyrus, substantia nigra, pontine nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brain was postmortem studied in a case of progressive supranuclear palsy. Straight tubules and twisted tubules were observed in both the cortical and subcortical neurofibrillary tangles. Most tubules appeared separately in each neuron but a few straight tubules were mixed with the twisted tubules in the cortical tangles. The implication and possible significance of this findings are discussed.
