Chronic morphine treatment produced increases in [3H]-flunitrazepam binding in some hippocampal areas of the rat brain. The differences in binding were statistically significant in some cases. Both morphine-dependent and morphine-deprived (abstinence syndrome) animals showed an identical response in binding, which confirms a real, although small, increase in benzodiazepine binding sites in the hippocampus after morphine treatment, that is not affected by a naloxone-induced abstinence syndrome under the conditions studied. These findings support the hypothesis of a morphine-induced up-regulation of benzodiazepine binding sites in the hippocampus. A possible different response in benzodiazepine binding sites 1 and 2 could explain the different findings reported in the literature. Our data suggest that the detected increase in benzodiazepine binding would be mainly due to type 2 binding sites, since the hippocampus has a higher density of this type of benzodiazepine binding sites.
