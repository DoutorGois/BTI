Chronic phenobarbital effects on brain NMDA and kainate receptors were assessed using [3H]MK-801 and [3H]kainate. Mice fed a phenobarbital diet for 7 days had a higher density of MK-801 binding sites (NMDA receptors) but a lower density of kainate receptors in cortex than control mice. No changes in MK-801 or kainate binding were observed in hippocampus. The results suggest brain area specific adaptation of certain glutamate receptors to chronic barbiturate treatment.
