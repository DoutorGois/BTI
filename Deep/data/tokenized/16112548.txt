The hippocampus is a part of the brain strongly linked to spatial exploration. Within it exist 'place cells' which fire preferentially when an animal is in certain regions of physical space. Recent research has shown that these place cells and their corresponding representations of space behave differently in the CA3 and CA1 subfields of the hippocampus. We review this research and show, by simulation, that these differences can be explained by a combination of known physiological features of the hippocampus and proposed variations in the rate of synaptic plasticity and connection strength between different information pathways. We suggest possible reasons for these differences, namely use of the CA1 cell field for current spatial exploration, and CA3 for longer term spatial memory.
