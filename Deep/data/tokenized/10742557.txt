The expression of transcripts for type 1 interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1R1) were investigated utilizing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques in male C57BL/6 mice. First, we measured IL-1R1 mRNA 1, 2, 6, and 12 h after a single injection of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 30 microg/mouse). IL-1R1 mRNA was measured in relevant tissues utilizing semiquantitative RT-PCR. IL-1R1 mRNA levels were significantly increased 2 and 6 h after one LPS injection group in comparison with the saline injection group in the hippocampus and testis. Next, we investigated the effect of repeated injections of LPS on IL-1R1 expression. LPS or saline were injected at 24-h intervals for 4 consecutive days. The mice were divided into four groups: (1) LPS injections for 4 days and LPS injection on day 5 (LPS-LPS); (2) LPS injections for 4 days and saline injection on day 5 (LPS-saline); (3) saline injections for 4 days and LPS injection on day 5 (saline-LPS); (4) saline injections for 4 days and saline injection on day 5 (saline-saline). The mice were sacrificed by decapitation 2 h after the last injection. In the hippocampus and pituitary gland, significant increases of IL-1R1 mRNA levels were observed in the saline-LPS group, however, the increases were attenuated in LPS-LPS group. IL-1R1 mRNA levels in the hypothalamus were unchanged in all four groups. In the adrenal gland and testis, IL-1R1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the LPS-LPS group as well as saline-LPS group. These data demonstrate differential regulation of IL-1R1 mRNA by one and repeated endotoxin treatment and suggest the importance of the cytokines in mediating the effects of infectious challenge on brain, endocrine and immune function during endotoxemia.
