Intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) in rodents leads to cognitive impairments and several pathological changes like Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is hardly any research about the effect of ICV-STZ on regional cerebral glucose metabolism in rodents. Previous studies have demonstrated that intranasal insulin improves cognition in AD patients. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we treated the ICV-STZ rats with daily intranasal delivery of insulin (2 U/day) for 6 consecutive weeks, then monitored (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake using a high-resolution small-animal positron emission tomography (microPET) and studied the expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using immunohistochemical staining. We observed that (18)F-FDG uptake decreased significantly at the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex in ICV-STZ rats as compared with the control rats. Intranasal insulin restores the cerebral glucose metabolism in prefrontal and cingulate cortex and attenuates astroglia activation and neuronal loss in the hippocampus of ICV-STZ rats. These findings provide the mechanistic basis for treating AD patients with intranasal insulin.
