Hybridomas from spleen cell fusions of six BALB/c mice immunized with hypothalamus were analyzed by immunocytochemistry for antibodies reactive with paraffin sections of fixed rat brain. In a total of 135 antibody producers, 60% were brain specific. Among these, 54% reacted with glial elements, pituitary cells, or basal lamina of intracerebral capillaries, with little variation among individual hybridomas in each of these groups. Forty-six percent of brain-specific antibodies reacted with neuronal structures, localizing on nerve fibers, neurofibrils, or perikarya. Neuron-specific hybridomas could be classified into groups that localized in anatomically defineable overall patterns. Within these patterns individual hybridomas exhibited extensive qualitative localization diversity ("neurotypy"). Conceivably, the genetic message for a common "proantigen" within an overall pattern may be slightly modified during differentiation of a neuron, thus leading to minor variability in antigenic expression. During antibody formation, similar minor changes occur in the differentiation of the genetic message for the antibody variable region. Apparently, minor changes in the antibody combining site among groups of hybridomas is reflected in the detectability of minor neurotypic changes among differentiated neuronal proantigens. If neurotypy proves to be the result of single-base substitutions or of variability in alignment of peptide-coding exons, the Scharrer concept of the fundamental significance of neurosecretion could also become applicable to neuronal specialization.
