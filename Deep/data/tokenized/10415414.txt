Recent studies have shown that time windowed extraction of nonlinear parameters like an effective correlation dimension from intracranially recorded EEG of epileptic patients often allows to detect and identify an unequivocal "pre-ictal phase" preceding an epileptic seizure. In another study, however, such an anticipation could not be made. These conflicting findings may indicate that observed changes in nonlinear parameters probably depend on the type of elementary mechanisms underlying epileptic processes and/or the spatial distribution of neurons primarily involved in generation of epileptiform discharges. To test the existence of such dependencies, the transition from normal to epileptiform activity (EA) of CA3-neurons in hippocampal slices was analyzed in four epilepsy models, using a time windowed computation of an effective correlation dimension. Indeed, in xanthine and penicillin models, signal complexity in intracellular recordings was reduced before manifestation of paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDS), whereas a preceding loss of complexity was missing in low-magnesium and veratridine models. These findings indicate that interictal-like EA is predictable only in some epilepsy models.
