Receptors made visible: The described biotin-tagged small-molecule probes with excellent affinities for the CB(1) and CB(2) cannabinoid receptors (CB(1)R and CB(2)R) enable direct visualization of these receptors in native cellular systems, including neurons, microglia, and immune cells. This method could overcome some of the limitations of current methodologies and may help to dissect the complexity of the endogenous cannabinoid system.
