As part of our continuing study of neural plasticity in rat hippocampus, we examined two structural proteins involved in neuronal plasticity, synaptophysin (SYP) and microtubule-associated protein 1 (MAP1) for their response to repeated restraint stress and modulation of such response by the antidepressant drug venlafaxine. This drug has the pharmacological action of inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in nerve terminals. We subjected the rats to restraint stress for 4 h per day for three days, and then injected the animals intraperitoneally (i.p.) with vehicle or 5 mg/kg/day of venlafaxine for various time periods. In all, eight groups of 10 rats each were used. The expression of these two proteins in hippocampal tissue of the rats was examined by means of western blot and immunohistochemical staining techniques. We found that restraint stress decreased the expression of SYP in the rat hippocampus by 50% (p < 0.01), and increased the expression of MAP1 by 60% (p < 0.01). SYP returned to the pre-stress levels in three weeks and MAP1 in two weeks. In animals treated with venlafaxine post-stress, SYP returned to pre-stress levels after 2 weeks and MAP1 after 1 week. These findings enhance our understanding of the compromise of the hippocampus by stressful assaults, and may be relevant to the action of venlafaxine in the treatment of patients with major depression, a mental disease thought to be related to the mal-adaptation of subjects to environmental stressors.
