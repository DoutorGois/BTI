Ischemic insult induces neuronal death in the CA1 subfields of the hippocampus which are designated generally as the most vulnerable brain region. Recent studies have shown that acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors are potent trophic factors that support the survival of neurons in many brain regions including the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that continuous infusion of acidic fibroblast growth factor into the lateral cerebral ventricles beginning 2 days before ischemia prevents the death of the CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of gerbils. Furthermore, delayed continuous administration of acidic fibroblast growth factor starting 5 min after ischemia is equally protective. The results suggest a possible physiological function for acidic fibroblast growth factor in the normal support of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and neurons in some other brain regions in considering the broad spectrum of responsive neurons.
