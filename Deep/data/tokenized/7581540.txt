The value of receptor capacity in respect to cytosol concentration was shown to vary, therefore two criteria are proposed for estimation of condition of the cytosol corticosteroid receptors: the density of the receptors in tissue and the range of intermediate (active) complex. The number of receptors in the hypophysis was shown to reduce after adrenalectomy whereas in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and striatum it increased. The range of intermediate complex was shown to change differently in different structures after stress.
