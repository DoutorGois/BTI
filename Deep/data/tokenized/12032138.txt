The HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope, a sulfated glucuronic acid at the non-reducing terminus of glycans, is expressed characteristically on a series of cell adhesion molecules and is synthesized through a key enzyme, glucuronyltransferase (GlcAT-P). We generated mice with a targeted deletion of the GlcAT-P gene. The GlcAT-P -/- mice exhibited normal development of gross anatomical features, but the adult mutant mice exhibited reduced long term potentiation at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses and a defect in spatial memory formation. This is the first evidence that the loss of a single non-reducing terminal carbohydrate residue attenuates brain higher functions.
