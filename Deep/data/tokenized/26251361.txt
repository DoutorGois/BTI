A putative etiological association exists between noise exposure and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-beta (Abeta) pathology is thought to be one of the primary initiating factors in AD. It has been further suggested that subsequent dysregulation of Abeta may play a mechanistic role in the AD-like pathophysiology associated with noise exposure. Here, we used ELISA, immunoblotting, cytokine arrays, and RT-PCR, to examine both hippocampal Abeta pathology and neuroinflammation in rats at different time points after noise exposure. We found that chronic noise exposure significantly accelerated the progressive overproduction of Abeta, which persisted for 7 to 14 days after the cessation of exposure. This effect was accompanied by up-regulated expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its cleavage enzymes, beta- and gamma-secretases. Cytokine analysis revealed that chronic noise exposure increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and the receptor for advanced glycation end products, while decreasing the expression of activin A and platelet-derived growth factor-AA. Furthermore, we found persistent elevations of glial fibrillary acidic protein and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 expression that closely corresponded to the noise-induced increases in Abeta and neuroinflammation. These studies suggest that lifelong environmental noise exposure may have cumulative effects on the onset and development of AD.
