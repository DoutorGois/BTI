Neurons with zinc in the presynaptic vesicles innervate much of the telencephalon, but the functional significance of the vesicular zinc has never been established. The present work shows that reversible binding of zinc by drug infusion into the hippocampus produces a time-locked and selective disruption of hippocampal-dependent spatial-working memory. A role for vesicular zinc in neurotransmission or neuromodulation is implied.
