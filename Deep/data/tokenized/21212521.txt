Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is reported to change in animal models of depression and antidepressants. We have used the mitotic marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyyridine to address the effects of imipramine and lithium on cell proliferation and survival following chronic treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. ACTH treatment for 14 d decreased adult hippocampal cell proliferation and survival. Coadministration of imipramine and lithium for 14 d blocked the loss of cell proliferation but not cell survival resulting from the chronic treatment with ACTH. The coadministration of imipramine and lithium may have treatment-resistant antidepressive properties, which may be attributed, in part, to a normalization of hippocampal cell proliferation.
