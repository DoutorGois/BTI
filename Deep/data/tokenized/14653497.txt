Motivated by the study of sharp wave-associated ripples, high-frequency (approximately 200 Hz) extracellular field oscillations observed in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus during slow-wave sleep and periods of behavioural immobility, we consider a single inhibitory neuron synapsing onto a network of uncoupled, excitatory neurons. The inhibitory synapse is depressing and has a small synaptic delay. Each excitatory cell provides instantaneous, positive feedback to the inhibitory cell. We show that the interneuron can rapidly synchronize the action potentials of the pyramidal cells if the frequency of inhibitory input is increased in a ramp-like manner as occurs during the ripple. We show that the basin of attraction of the synchronous solution is larger when the inhibition frequency is gradually increased as opposed to remaining constant.
