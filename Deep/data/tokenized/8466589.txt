Localization of the alpha 2 macroglobulin receptor (alpha 2MR) was studied in postmortem human brain tissue of Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-matched control cases with a monoclonal antibody (A2MR alpha 2) to the receptor. In control cases alpha 2MR was detected in neurons, glia, and some capillaries. Neuronal staining was most conspicuous in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. In AD, alpha 2MR immunoreactivity was enhanced. The staining intensity of some neurons was increased, as was the number of positive glial cells. In addition, senile plaques, tangles, and dystrophic neurites were strongly stained. These results suggest that alpha 2MR is involved in AD pathology.
