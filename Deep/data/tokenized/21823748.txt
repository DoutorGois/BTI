Stress relaxation tests using a custom designed microindentation device were performed on ten anatomic regions of fresh porcine brain (postmortem time <3 h). Using linear viscoelastic theory, a Prony series representation was used to describe the shear relaxation modulus for each anatomic region tested. Prony series parameters fit to load data from indentations performed to approximately 10% strain differed significantly by anatomic region. The gray and white matter of the cerebellum along with corpus callosum and brainstem were the softest regions measured. The cortex and hippocampal CA1/CA3 were found to be the stiffest. To examine the large strain behavior of the tissue, multistep indentations were performed in the corona radiata to strains of 10%, 20%, and 30%. Reduced relaxation functions were not significantly different for each step, suggesting that quasi-linear viscoelastic theory may be appropriate for representing the nonlinear behavior of this anatomic region of porcine brain tissue. These data, for the first time, describe the dynamic and short time scale behavior of multiple anatomic regions of the porcine brain which will be useful for understanding porcine brain injury biomechanics at a finer spatial resolution than previously possible.
