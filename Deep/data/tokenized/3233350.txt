In this paper a comparative study is made of stria longitudinalis medialis in the fighting bull and domestic bull. This nervous bundles are more developed in the former, and their connections with the Gyrus dentatus and Hippocampus are demonstrated. The structural differences observed between both animals could be related with the mechanisms that control the aggressive behaviour.
