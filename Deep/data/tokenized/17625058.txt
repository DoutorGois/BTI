An acute application of neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) to hippocampal slices from adult rats induced a long-lasting potentiation (LLP PREGS) at the perforant path-granule cell synapse. As a partial mechanism of the LLP PREGS, we previously revealed that PREGS transiently increases the probability of presynaptic glutamate release via a sensitization of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR). We herein demonstrate that the LLP PREGS could be separated into two independent processes: the above-mentioned early presynaptic-origin short-term potentiation (STP PREGS) and a delayed postsynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr)-dependent long-term potentiation termed LTP(PREGS). This study focused on the analysis of the signaling mechanism underlying the LTP PREGS. PREGS increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B, a subunit of NMDAr, and the NMDAr-mediated Ca2+ influx in the granule cells. The enhanced Ca2+ influx was largely attenuated by the NR2B subunit inhibitor ifenprodil and the Src kinase family inhibitor PP2. PREGS also triggered a persistent phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) followed by an ERK-dependent phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), which was crucial for the LTP PREGS induction and was sensitive to ifenprodil. These results suggest that PREGS induces an acute increase in the NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation which enhances the Ca2+ influx through NMDAr, followed by an activation of the ERK/CREB signaling cascade that leads to LTP PREGS.
