Dopamine increases/decreases synaptic vesicle recycling and in schizophrenia the proteins/mRNA is decreased. We isolated cDNA clone, similar to amphiphysin 1 (vesicle protein) mRNA from the neocortex of rats injected repeatedly with methamphetamine using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) differential display. This clone is highly homologous to the 3' region of the human amphiphysin gene. PCR extension study using a primer specific for the rat amphiphysin 1 gene and a primer located within the clone revealed that it is the 3' UTR region of the rat amphiphysin 1 gene. Furthermore, in situ hybridization revealed that amphiphysin 1 mRNA is expressed in the cerebrum, medial thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. In the cerebellum, amphiphysin mRNA expression was confined to upper granule cell layer. Repeated methamphetamine administration increased amphiphysin I mRNA expression in both anterior part of the cerebrum, and the cerebellum. However, the repeated administration did not alter mRNA expression of the other vesicle proteins, synaptotagmin I, synapsin I, synaptojanin and dynamin I, we conclude that the repeated administration selectively increased amphiphysin 1 mRNA expression. Thus, amphiphysin 1 does not work as synaptic recycling, but it is suggested, as a part of pathogenesis of brain tissue injury (under Ca(2)(+) and Mg(2)(+) devoid environment) in repeated methamphetamine-injected states, the gene regulate actin-asssembly, learning, cell stress signaling and cell polarity.
