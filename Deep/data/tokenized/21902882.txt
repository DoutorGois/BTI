On June 19 2009, everyone who knew Leon Cintra was shocked by the terrible news of the automobile accident that took his life. The feeling within the scientific community was that his passing was not only a great loss for Mexican science but also the loss of a beloved friend. He will be missed and forever remembered for his brilliant mind and noble heart. His scientific career was focused, since the beginning, on the study of protein malnutrition effects on brain morphometry, somato-sensory transmission, sleep, circadian rhythms and behavior. His findings showed that malnutrition has long lasting adverse effects on morphometry of systems involved in sleep regulation such as locus coeruleus, nucleus raphe dorsalis and susprachiasmatic nucleus, and on hippocampal circuit implicated in theta activity generation. His results on spectral analysis of electrical field potential at every 4 sec from 24-h baseline recording and 72-h of recovery sleep after total sleep deprivation or selective REM sleep deprivation demonstrated that protein malnutrition induced alterations on homeostatic as well as on circadian sleep regulation; brain oscillations and theta coherent activity between left and right hemisphere and between hippocampus and cerebral cortex are also affected by malnutrition.
