Long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized normal and prenatally protein malnourished rats in adulthood. LTP was initiated by high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path. Potentiation of both population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope and population spike was studied at various times after conditioning out to 5 h. The results indicate that prenatal protein malnutrition has a differential effect on LTP. Although potentiation of the population spike was relatively unaffected, prenatal protein malnutrition did lead to a significant reduction in potentiation of the population EPSP. Several possibilities are proposed as to the cause of the differential effect.
