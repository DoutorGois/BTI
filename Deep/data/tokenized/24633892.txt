The mechanisms that lead to the onset of organoselenium intoxication are still poorly understood. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the effect of acute administration of 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(phenylseleno)oct-2-en-1-one on some parameters of oxidative stress and on the activity of creatine kinase (CK) in different brain areas and on the behaviour in the open field test of 90-day-old male rats. Animals (n = 10/group) were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of the organoselenium (125, 250 or 500 microg kg(-1) ), and after 1 h of the drug administration, they were exposed to the open field test, and behaviour parameters were recorded. Immediately after they were euthanized, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected for measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), carbonyl, sulfhydryl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and CK activity. Our results showed that the dose of 500 microg kg(-1) of the organoselenium increased the locomotion and rearing behaviours in the open field test. Moreover, the organochalcogen enhanced TBARS in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum and increased the oxidation of proteins (carbonyl) only in the cerebral cortex. Sulfhydryl content was reduced in all brain areas, CAT activity enhanced in the hippocampus and reduced in the cerebellum and SOD activity increased in all brain structures. The organoselenium also inhibited CK activity in the cerebral cortex. Therefore, changes in motor behaviour, redox state and energy homeostasis in rats treated acutely with organoselenium support the hypotheses that the brain is a potential target for the organochalcogen action.
