Large-scale gene expression data sets are revolutionizing the field of functional genomics. However, few data analysis techniques fully exploit this entirely new class of data. We present a linear modeling approach that allows one to infer interactions between all the genes included in the data set. The resulting model can be used to generate interesting hypotheses to direct further experiments.
