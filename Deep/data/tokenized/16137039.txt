OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of long-term estrogen deficiency and replacement therapy of compound nylestriol tablet or low-dose 17 beta-estradiol on the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in rat hippocampal formation. METHODS: Fifty 7 month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: normal control, sham operated (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX), OVX plus 17 beta-estradiol (OVX/ERT), and OVX plus compound nylestriol tablet (OVX/NL) groups. Immunohistochemistry of NGF was used to quantitatively determine the levels of expression of NGF using cell counting and imaging system in ovariectomized rat hippocampal formation. RESULTS: The number and optical density of NGF-positive neurons of all hippocampal subregions and dentate gyrus in OVX rats were obviously lower than those of the normal control, SHAM, OVX/NL, and OVX/ERT rats. CONCLUSION: Long-term estrogen deficiency can lead to a decrease of NGF expression in hippocampal formation, while the replacement of low-dose 17 beta-estradiol or compound nylestriol tablet can equally preserve the expression of NGF to a normal level, showing a neurotrophic effect of estrogen.
