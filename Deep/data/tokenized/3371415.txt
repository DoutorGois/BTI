Corticosterone was injected directly into the hippocampus of rabbits, and changes in hepatic acetate metabolism were studied. The microinjection of corticosterone with seasame oil into hippocampus decreased the rates of 14C transfer from 14C-1-acetate into CO2 and free cholesterol, and increased 14C transfer into glucose, ketone bodies, triglyceride, free fatty acids and phospholipids. But after microinjection of corticosterone into the hippocampus of rabbits with lesions of dorsal fornix, hepatic acetate metabolism did not differ from that of control rabbits, which received injection of seasame oil into the same brain region. From these results it might be suggested that the hippocampus is a part of corticosterone-sensitive brain regulator system in the hepatic acetate metabolism.
