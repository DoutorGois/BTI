Projection neurons of the developing cerebral cortex are generated in the cerebral ventricular zone and subsequently move to the developing cortical plate via radial migration. Conversely, most inhibitory interneurons originate in the ganglionic eminences and enter the developing cortical plate by tangential migration. Using immunohistochemical analysis together with tracer labeling experiments in organotypic brain slices, we show that a portion of cortical projection neurons migrates tangentially over long distances. Lineage analysis revealed that these neurons are derived from Emx1+ cortical progenitors and express the transcription factor Satb2 but do not express GABA or Olig1. In vitro and in vivo analysis of reeler mutant brains demonstrated that although reeler mutation does not influence tangential migration of interneurons, it affects the tangential migration of cortical projection neurons.
