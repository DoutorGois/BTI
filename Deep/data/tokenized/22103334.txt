The presynaptic protein RIM1alpha mediates multiple forms of presynaptic plasticity at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Previous studies of mice lacking RIM1alpha (RIM1alpha(-/-) throughout the brain showed that deletion of RIM1alpha results in multiple behavioral abnormalities. In an effort to begin to delineate the brain regions in which RIM1 deletion mediates these abnormal behaviors, we used conditional (floxed) RIM1 knockout mice (fRIM1). By crossing these fRIM1 mice to previously characterized transgenic cre lines, we aimed to delete RIM1 selectively in the dentate gyrus (DG), using a specific preproopiomelanocortin promoter driving cre recombinase (POMC-cre) line , and in pyramidal neurons of the CA3 region of hippocampus, using the kainate receptor subunit 1 promoter driving cre recombinase (KA-cre). Neither of these cre driver lines was uniquely selective to the targeted regions. In spite of this, we were able to reproduce a subset of the global RIM1alpha(-/-) behavioral abnormalities, thereby narrowing the brain regions in which loss of RIM1 is sufficient to produce these behavioral differences. Most interestingly, hypersensitivity to the pyschotomimetic MK-801 was shown in mice lacking RIM1 selectively in the DG, arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and select cerebellar neurons, implicating novel brain regions and neuronal subtypes in this behavior.
