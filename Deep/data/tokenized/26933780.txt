INTRODUCTION: The maldevelopmental model of schizophrenia postulates pathological alterations in embryonal neurogenesis as the etiopathogenetic basis of schizophrenic psychoses. The neurotrophic factor hypothesis explains these neuropathological abnormalities as the result of alterations of the neurotrophin system caused by different mechanisms such as a genetic, infectious and traumatic factors. The tyrosine-kinase containing receptors trkB and trkC mediate growth-promoting effects of neurotrophins and respond to changes in neurotrophic factors availability. AIM: The aim of the present study was to establish the expression pattern of trkB and trkC in rat brain structures by a developmental model of schizophrenia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On cryostat coronal brain sections of control and lesioned rats (after infusion of ibotenic acid solution bilaterally into the hippocampal formation), immunoreactions for trkB and trkC were performed. RESULTS: We found diminished expression of trkB and trkC in the hippocampal formation of lesioned animals compared to the controls. Quantitative measurements of immunohistochemical reactions intensity and statistical analysis confi rmed the reduced immunoreactivity for antigens under study (trkB and trkC) in the positive hippocampal neurons of 56-day-old lesioned rats compared to the control animals. CONCLUSION: The observed downregulation of neurotrophic factor receptors expression may compromise the function and plasticity of hippocampal formation in schizophrenic brains.
