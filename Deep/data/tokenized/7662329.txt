The efficacy of temporal-distance processing for spatial locations was evaluated in college students, elderly controls, and subjects with mild and moderate dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The elderly controls showed a slightly lower level of performance than college students, but both elderly controls and college students displayed a temporal-distance effect. The mild DAT subjects performed the task accurately only at the greatest temporal distances. The moderate DAT subjects performed at chance levels for all distances. Because similar changes in the temporal-distance function have been described for humans and animals with small hippocampal or prefrontal cortex damage, there might be important hippocampal or prefrontal cortex involvement or both in early stages of Alzheimer disease.
