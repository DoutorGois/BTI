Transient periodic increases in the extracellular K+ concentration (20 mM, 30 sec, 3-6 episodes) led to the appearance of a kindling-like state in local neuronal networks of field CA1 of rat hippocampal slices. A criterion for the appearance of this state was a reduction in the threshold for the generation of multiple population discharges and an increase in the total number of population spikes within discharges (epileptiform activity). This state correlated with potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) (long-term increases in pyramidal neuron excitability), but not with potentiation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in field CA1 of hippocampal slices. The role of the various Ca2+ channels in inducing and maintaining the kindling-like state in rat hippocampal sections, evoked by periodic increases in the extracellular K+ concentration, is discussed.
