NMDA currents from Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant zeta1/epsilon2 NMDA receptors can be potentiated by activation of protein kinase-C (PKC) and also demonstrate time-dependent rundown. In order to determine whether cytoskeletal proteins are involved in either of these phenomena, experiments were performed using the f-actin stabilizer phalloidin, the f-actin de-stabilizer cytochalasin-D, and the microtubule stabilizer taxol. Phalloidin treatment both prevented rundown and inhibited PKC-potentiation of whole-cell currents but did not affect baseline current amplitudes. Treatment with cytochalasin-D also prevented rundown and inhibited PKC-potentiation of whole-cell currents, but baseline currents from cytochalasin treated cells were only 50% as large as those from control cells. Taxol had no effect on either rundown or PKC potentiation of NMDA currents. The results indicate that both spontaneous rundown and PKC potentiation of currents from heterologously expressed zeta1/epsilon2 NMDA receptors depend on dynamic actin polymerization/depolymerization but do not involve changes in microtubules.
