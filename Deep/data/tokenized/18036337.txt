Ascorbic acid (AA) and dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) have been shown to have protective effects as anti-oxidants in experimental neurological disorder models such as stroke, ischemia, and epileptic seizures. The present study was conducted to examine the protective effects of AA and DHA on kainic acid (KA) neurotoxicity using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. After 12h KA treatment, significant delayed neuronal death was detected in the CA3, but not the CA1, region. Pretreatment with intermediate doses of AA and DHA significantly prevented cell death and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the CA3 region. In contrast, pretreatment with low or high doses of AA or DHA was not effective. These data suggest that pretreatment with both AA and DHA has dose-dependent neuroprotective effects on KA-induced neuronal injury through inhibiting ROS generation and mitochondrial dysfunction.
