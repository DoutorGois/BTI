AIM: To explore the relationship between the effects of curcumin on cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury and immediately genic expressions of Fos, Jun and NF-kappaB in hippocampal CA1 area. METHODS: Gerbils were randomly divided into sham group (SH), ischemia/reperfusion group (I/R), curcumin group (CU) and solvent control group (SC). Forebrain ischemia was induced by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries. Observations were carried out in each group 15 min, 1 h, 2 h, 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 5 d and 7 d after ischemia: open field test was used to examine the behavioral change, the apoptosis neurons in hippocampal CA1 region was counted, the expression of Fos, Jun and NF-kappaB in hippocampal CA1 was detected by SABC immunocytochemical technique. RESULTS: The behavioral mark and the number of apoptosis neurons in hippocampal (CA1 region was much less in CU group than in I/R group (P < 0.01) The expression of Fos was more and the expression of Jun and NF-kappaB was less in CA1 area in CU group than in I/R group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Curcumin can significantly protect neurons against cerebral ischemia, increasing the expression Fos and decreasing the expression of Jun and NF-kappaB may be the protective mechanisms.
