Normal waking mentation is the outcome of the combined action of both electrophysiological and neurochemical antagonistic and complementary activating and inhibitory influences occurring mainly in the cerebral cortex. The chemical ones are supported principally by acetylcholine, and noradrenaline and serotonin, respectively. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the monoaminergic silence - except dopaminergic ongoing activity - disrupts this equilibrium and seems to be responsible for disturbances of mental activity characteristic of dreaming. This imbalance could cause disconnectivity of cortical areas, failure of latent inhibition and possibly the concomitant prefrontal dorsolateral deactivation. Moreover, the decrease of prefrontal dopaminergic functioning could explain the loss of reflectiveness in this sleep stage. All these phenomena are also encountered in schizophrenia. The psychotic-like mentation of dreaming (hallucinations, delusions, bizarre thought processes) could result from the disinhibition of dopamine influence in the nucleus accumbens by the noradrenergic and serotonergic local silence and/or the lifting of glutamate influence from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We hypothesize that, during REM sleep, the increase of dopamine and the decrease of glutamate release observed in nucleus accumbens reach the threshold values at which psychotic disturbances arise during wakefulness. Whatever the precise mechanism, it seems that the functional state of the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens is the same during dreaming sleep stage and in schizophrenia. The convergent psychological, electrophysiological, tomographic, pharmacological and neurochemical criteria of REM sleep and schizophrenia suggest that this sleep stage could become a good neurobiological model of this psychiatric disease.
