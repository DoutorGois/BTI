The molecular basis of estrogen-mediated neuroprotection against brain ischemia remains obscure. Here, we studied by immunohistochemistry the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha and beta in the hippocampal CA1 sector of postischemic adult macaque monkeys. ERbeta was present in control CA1 pyramidal neurons, decreasing on day 4 after ischemia. In contrast, ERbeta immunoreactivity increased remarkably in the radiate and molecular layers of CA1, where it was present in astrocytes and microglia. ERalpha was negligible in both control and postischemic monkeys. These results indicate that ERbeta is the major receptor responsible for the direct estrogen actions on the monkey hippocampus, regulating glial response after ischemia.
