Neuroinflammation induced by beta-amyloid (Abeta) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and inhibiting Abeta-induced neuroinflammation serves as a potential strategy for the treatment of AD. Oridonin (Ori), a compound of Rabdosia rubescens, has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we demonstrated that Ori inhibited glial activation and decreased the release of inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus of Abeta1-42-induced AD mice. In addition, Ori inhibited the NF-kappaB pathway and Abeta1-42-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, Ori could attenuate memory deficits in Abeta1-42-induced AD mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that Ori inhibited the neuroinflammation and attenuated memory deficits induced by Abeta1-42, suggesting that Ori might be a promising candidate for AD treatment.
