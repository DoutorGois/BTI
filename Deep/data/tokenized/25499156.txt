Absolute pitch (AP) ability is a rare musical phenomenon. In the literature, it has been suggested that the relative specialization for pitch processing is in the right temporal lobe in the non-AP population. Since the anatomic basis for absolute pitch is not fully understood and cases of temporal lobe epilepsy of AP possessors are extremely rare, applicability of resection as a treatment of epilepsy in this particular area should be evaluated with caution. In the present study, we examined an AP possessor who suffered from medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy and underwent right selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH). The SAH procedure clearly avoided disturbing important structures for AP, inasmuch as postsurgically she preserved her AP ability and was seizure-free. She did well post-operatively in the test of pure sine wave tones with short reaction time, which could be identified as "true" absolute pitch.
