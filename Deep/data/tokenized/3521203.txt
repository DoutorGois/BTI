By means of radioimmunoassay procedures, cholecystokinin-(CCK) and somatostatin-(SRIF) like immunoreactivity have been studied in the dorsal hippocampal formation and in the frontoparietal cortex of the male rat in insulin-induced hypoglycaemia, leading to an isoelectric EEG pattern. It has been demonstrated that severe hypoglycaemia of 40-min-duration produces a disappearance of SRIF but not of CCK-like immunoreactivity in both cortical regions. It was found that an i.v. injection of uridine but not of saline could significantly counteract the disappearance of SRIF-like immunoreactivity induced by severe hypoglycaemia in both cortical areas. Uridine did not by itself change plasma glucose levels. It is suggested that uridine may prevent release and/or increase synthesis of cortical SRIF peptides in severe hypoglycaemia, possibly due to an action on the metabolism (e.g. by enhancing the resynthesis of phosphatidyl inositol) within the tissue of the cerebral cortex and/or on putative pyrimidine binding sites in the brain controlling SRIF synthesis and/or release. It is possible that uridine in this way may improve recovery of neuronal function within SRIF-immunoreactive neurons of the cerebral cortex after severe hypoglycaemia (which also may be true in other states of reduced metabolic support). These findings suggest a possibility to use uridine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and Status epilepticus.
