Melatonin administered at the beginning of cerebral reperfusion protected CA1 neurons against 10, 20 and 30 min of transient forebrain ischemia. Intraperitoneal injections of saline or melatonin (10 mg/kg) were given after 0, 2 and 6 h, or 1, 2 and 6 h of cerebral reperfusion, or 30 min prior to ischemia. One week later, quantitative histological analysis demonstrated that CA1 neuronal density was significantly increased in the melatonin groups that were treated at 0, 2, 6 h compared to the saline-treated controls. Ischemic protection of CA1 was lost in the animals in which the melatonin treatment was delayed by 1 h, or given 30 min prior to the ischemia.
