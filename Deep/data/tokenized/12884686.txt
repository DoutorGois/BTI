Dissociation of the forebrain of a single 8-day chick embryo produces > 10(7) neurons in nearly pure culture. Our methods allow 50-70% of these neurons to develop an axon and typical pyrimidal shape after 3-4 days in culture at low density (10(4) cells/cm2) by a stereotyped developmental sequence similar to that of rat hippocampal neurons. The culture method for chick forebrain neurons is unusually rapid, inexpensive, simple, and could be used in undergraduate laboratory exercises. The dissection and dissociation of the tissue are easy and rapid, requiring less than 30 min from cracking open the chicken egg to plating the cells. Axonal development by these neurons and growth for about a week do not require glial support. The neurons are grown on polylysine-treated culture surfaces in either CO2-dependent (Medium 199) or -independent (Liebovitz L15) media with 10% fetal bovine serum and a supplement based on the classic N2 supplement for neuronal culture.
