The human anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is active during conflict-monitoring tasks, is thought to participate with prefrontal cortices in a distributed network for conscious self-regulation. This hypothesis predicts that conflict-related ACC activation should occur only when the conflicting stimuli are consciously perceived. To dissociate conflict from consciousness, we measured the behavioral and brain imaging correlates of a motor conflict induced by task-irrelevant subliminal or conscious primes. The same task was studied in normal subjects and in patients with schizophrenia in whom the ACC and prefrontal cortex are thought to be dysfunctional. Conscious, but not subliminal, conflict affected anterior cingulate activity in normal subjects. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia, who exhibited a hypoactivation of the ACC and other frontal, temporal, hippocampal, and striatal sites, showed impaired conscious priming but normal subliminal priming. Those findings suggest that subliminal conflicts are resolved without ACC contribution and that the ACC participates in a distributed conscious control network that is altered in schizophrenia.
