Stimulation of the subiculum/CA1 of the hippocampal formation evokes monosynaptic field potentials in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). High-frequency stimulation of the hippocampus (HPC) can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in this hippocampo-prefrontal cortical (hippo-PFC) pathway. Previous studies have shown that dopamine and serotonin modulate hippo-PFC LTP. Here, we investigated whether the locus coeruleus (LC) and noradrenaline (NA) can modulate LTP in the rat hippo-PFC pathway. Stimulation of the LC in combination with stimulation of the HPC increased hippo-PFC LTP. Infusion of lidocaine into the LC reduced hippo-PFC LTP. Administration of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, nisoxetine or the alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan prior to high-frequency stimulation of the HPC enhanced hippo-LTP. In contrast, administration of clonidine, an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, impaired hippo-PFC LTP. Partial noradrenergic (NAergic) lesioning with DSP-4 also impaired hippo-PFC LTP. In conclusion, the LC and NAergic mechanisms modulate hippo-PFC LTP.
