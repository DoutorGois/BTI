This study investigates the role of carbosilane dendrimers in fibrillation of alpha-synuclein and prevention of the mouse hippocampal cell (mHippoE-18) from rotenone-induced damage. Examining the interaction between carbosilane dendrimers and alpha-synuclein, we found that the dendrimers inhibit fibril formation. We also investigated cell viability, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential. mHippoE-18 cells were preincubated with carbosilane dendrimers before rotenone was added. All the dendrimers possess potential protection activity. Preincubation with dendrimers contributed to: increased viability, higher mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ROS level in cells. The probable mechanism of cell protection lies in the ability of dendrimers to capture rotenone by encapsulating or binding to its surface groups. The fact that dendrimers have prevention potential is important in the search for new pharmacological strategies against neurodegenerative disorders.
