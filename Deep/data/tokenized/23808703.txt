A method is described to assess the reproductive status of male Hippocampus abdominalis on the basis of behavioural traits. The non-invasive nature of this technique minimizes handling stress and reduces sampling requirements for experimental work. It represents a useful tool to assist researchers in sample collection for studies of reproduction and development in viviparous syngnathids, which are emerging as important model species.
