We examined the effects of chronic administration of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) on memory and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity in the forebrain of senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP8 strain). Subcutaneous injection of aFGF (aFGF group) or saline vehicle (saline group) once a week into SAMP8 was begun at three weeks after birth and continued for nine months. In the passive avoidance test, the retained latency was significantly longer in the aFGF group than in the saline group. In the Morris test, the mean latency to climb on a platform was significantly shorter in the aFGF group than in the saline group. The number of ChAT-positive neurons in the forebrain septum was greater in the aFGF group than in the saline group, and was at the level of that in the control mouse strain (SAMR1). The intensity of ChAT staining in the aFGF group appeared slightly weaker than in SAMR1 but significantly stronger than in the saline group. The results indicate that the effect of aFGF on memory function in SAMP8 may be related to the preservation of function in septal cholinergic cells.
