The consolidation of memory is thought to occur via a hippocampal-neocortical dialog involving reactivation of memory patterns in the hippocampus during sharp-wave ripples. In this issue of Neuron, Nakashiba et al. demonstrate that CA3 output is required for consolidation of contextual fear memory. They also show that lack of CA3 output results in a decrease in ripple-related reactivation, providing additional evidence for a role of ripple-related reactivation in the consolidation process.
