OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Valeriana amurensis on the expressions of P-APP,A4,1 and Caspase-3 of cortical neurons and hippocampus neurons in in Alzheimer's disease model rats' brain. METHODS: Established the model with multiple factors, observed the expressions of beta-APP, Abeta(1-40) and Caspase-3 of cortical neurons and Hippocampus neurons in in Alzheimer's disease model rats' brain by electron lens using immunohistochemistry method. RESULTS: The extracts of the roots and rhizomes of Valeriana amurensis decreased the expressions of beta-APP, Abeta(1-40) and Caspase-3 of cortical neurons and hippocampus neurons in in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of high dose of 50% ethanol extract of macroporous resin group were more significant than the other groups'. CONCLUSION: The 50% ethanol extracts of macroporous resin group from the roots and rhizomes of Valeriana amurensis can decrease the expressions of beta-APP, Abeta(1-40), and Caspase-3, to inhibit the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease model rats' brain, and decrease cell fate of cortical neurons and hippocampus neurons in in Alzheimer's disease model rats' brain.
