In the present study, we investigated the effects of treadmill exercise in early and chronic diabetic stages on parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and its lean control rats (ZLC). To investigate the effects, ZLC and ZDF rats at 6 or 23 weeks of age were put on a treadmill with or without running for 1 h/day/5 consecutive days at 16-22 m/min for 5 weeks or 12-16 m/min for 7 weeks, respectively. Physical exercise in pre-diabetic rats prevented onset of diabetes, while exercise in rats at chronic diabetic stage significantly reduced blood glucose levels. In addition, physical exercise in the pre-diabetic rats significantly increased PV immunoreactive fibers in the strata oriens and radiatum of the CA1-3 region and in the polymorphic and molecular layers of the dentate gyrus compared to that in sedentary controls. However, in rats at chronic stages, PV immunoreactivity was slightly increased in the CA1-3 region as well as in the dentate gyrus compared to that in the sedentary controls. These results suggest that physical exercise has differential effects on blood glucose levels and PV immunoreactivity according to diabetic stages. Early exercise improves diabetic phenotype and PV immunoreactive fibers in the rat hippocampus.
