Stereotypical behavior or response perseveration dominating early mammalian responding, especially under conditions of aversive motivation, may be radically modified through damage in the prefrontal and hippocampal systems. These observations contribute evidence to the notion that changes in neural circuitry may be supporting behavioral recovery of function after selective brain damage. The extent of behavioral deficits as well as the prognosis for recovery are governed by task-specific variables, usually related to a discriminative element in stimulus control. Conversely, reversion to earlier, stereotypical behavior may be produced in adult rats exposed to damage at points within the same sites. Specific experiments tested weanling and adult rats within tasks that differed in the (1) extent and site of damage, (2) variety of signalling stimuli, (3) complexity of the task requirements, and (4) time since surgery for initiation of training. Experiments on 1-way active avoidance, alternation and reversal learning indicated that performance deficits are attributed to developmental immaturity early in ontogeny, and enhanced neurophysiological growth with age provides a reliable predictor of recovery. However with increasing age, variables related to the subtleties of damage site and task also emerge as salient factors in behavioral deficiencies. Interestingly, the cue properties or information value contained in the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the environmental context provide differential compensation for selected types of injury-induced deficits, and there was some evidence that the utility of environmental signals can be improved over long-term recovery periods. The results support the view that relationships between age at the time of injury and extent of recovery are perhaps best explained within developmentally determined constraints.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
