Spontaneous oscillatory activity is a general feature of developing neural networks. Early in postnatal development, spontaneous network-driven events, termed giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs), occur synchronously over the entire hippocampus. By performing simulation of hippocampal network with using physiology parameters of the neurons and its network from the present experiments and literature dates, we investigated the participation of the different components of network in the generation of GDPs. Comparing the results of the model and in vitro experiments we conclude that are necessary for the GDP generation involvement the activation of GABAergic, glutamatergic inputs and perhaps gap junction.
