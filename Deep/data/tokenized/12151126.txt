Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients are frequently afflicted with deficits in spatial and other forms of declarative memory. This impairment is likely associated with the medial temporal lobe, which suffers widespread damage in the disease. Physiological and lesion studies, as well as examinations of the complex connectivity of the medial temporal lobe in animals and humans, have identified the entorhinal cortex (EC) as a key structure in the function and dysfunction of this brain region. Lesions in EC layer III, which normally provides monosynaptic input to area CA1 of the hippocampus, frequently occur in TLE and may be causally related to the memory impairments seen in the disease. Lesions that are initially largely restricted to EC layer III can be produced in rats by focal intra-entorhinal injections of 'indirect excitotoxins' such as aminooxyacetic acid or gamma-acetylenic GABA. These animals eventually show more extensive neurodegeneration in temporal lobe structures and, after a latent period, exhibit spontaneously recurring seizure activity. These progressive features, which may mimic events that occur in TLE, provide new opportunities to explore the role of the EC in memory deficits associated with TLE. These animals will also be useful for evaluating new treatment strategies that focus on the prevention of pathological events in the EC.
