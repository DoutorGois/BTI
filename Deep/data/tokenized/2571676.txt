Six brain areas of rats and guinea-pigs, killed by microwave irradiation, were used for the concomitant measurement of the levels and regional distribution of cholinergic, biogenic amine, and amino acid neurotransmitters and metabolites. Acetylcholine (ACh) and choline (Ch) were quantified by chemiluminescence; noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and their metabolites by HPLC with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC); and six putative amino acid neurotransmitters by HPLC-EC following derivatisation. The levels and regional distribution of these transmitters and their metabolites in the rat were similar to those reported in previous studies, except that biogenic amine transmitter levels were higher and metabolite concentrations were lower. The guinea-pig showed a similar regional distribution, but the absolute levels of ACh were lower in striatum and higher in hippocampus, midbrain-hypothalamus, and medulla-pons. In all areas, the levels of Ch were higher and those of NA, 5-HT, and taurine were lower than in the rat. The most marked differences between the rat and guinea-pig were in the relative proportion of DA metabolites and 5-HT turnover, as estimated by metabolite/transmitter ratios. This study can be used as a basis for a comprehensive understanding of the central effects of drugs on the major neurotransmitter systems.
