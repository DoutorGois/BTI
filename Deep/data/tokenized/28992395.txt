OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether response to lithium treatment in pediatric bipolar disorder can be predicted by changes in white matter microstructure in key cortico-limbic tracts involved in emotion regulation. METHODS: Eighteen clinically referred lithium-naive patients (mean age 15.5 years) were administered clinical rating scales and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examinations at baseline and following 4 weeks of lithium treatment. Clinical ratings were repeated following 8 weeks of treatment. Patients with Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) ratings of 1 ("very much improved") or 2 ("much improved") were classified as responders. Ten healthy volunteers received baseline and follow-up DTI examinations. Using the ENIGMA pipeline, we investigated the relationship between changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the cingulum hippocampus (CGH) and clinical response to lithium. RESULTS: Patients demonstrated significantly lower FA compared to healthy volunteers in the left and right CGH white matter at baseline. Following 4 weeks of lithium treatment, FA in the left CGH increased in patients, but no significant changes in FA were observed among the untreated healthy volunteers. Lithium responders had a significantly greater increase in FA compared to non-responders. Moreover, baseline (pre-treatment) FA in the left CGH white matter significantly predicted week 8 overall CGI severity score, with post hoc analyses indicating that these effects were evident for both severity of depression and mania. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that response to lithium treatment in pediatric bipolar disorder is associated with normalization of white matter microstructure in regions associated with emotion processing.
