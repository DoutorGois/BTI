AIMS: Nanoelectrodes are an emerging biomedical technology that can be used to record intracellular membrane potentials from neurons while causing minimal damage during membrane penetration. Current nanoelectrode designs, however, have low aspect ratios or large substrates and thus are not suitable for recording from neurons deep within complex natural structures, such as brain slices. MATERIALS & METHODS: We describe a novel nanoelectrode design that uses nanowires grown on the ends of microwire recording electrodes similar to those frequently used in vivo. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: We demonstrate that these nanowires can record intracellular action potentials in a rat brain slice preparation and in isolated leech ganglia. CONCLUSION: Nanoelectrodes have the potential to revolutionize intracellular recording methods in complex neural tissues, to enable new multielectrode array technologies and, ultimately, to be used to record intracellular signals in vivo.
