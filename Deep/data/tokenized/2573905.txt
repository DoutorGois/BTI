The behavioral effect of single administration of +/- 3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on rats performing on the differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-second schedule (DRL 72-sec) was compared before and after a period of repeated administration of MDMA known to deplete 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the brain. Single administration of MDMA decreased reinforcement rate (1, 2, 4, 6 mg/kg) and increased response rate (4,6 mg/kg) of rats performing on the DRL 72-sec schedule. This effect is typical of amphetamines and other psychomotor stimulants. Four weeks after repeated administration of MDMA (6 mg/kg twice daily for 4 days) there was an increase in sensitivity to the effect of single administration of MDMA. Doses of 2, 4 and 6 mg/kg of MDMA resulted in increases in response rate that were significantly greater after repeated MDMA administration than before. Doses of 0.5, 2, and 6 mg/kg of MDMA resulted in decreases of reinforcement rate that were significantly greater after repeated MDMA administration than before. Repeated administration of MDMA resulted in long-term depletion of serotonin levels by 30-50% in the amygdala, neostriatum, hippocampus and the frontal cortex. Norepinephrine and dopamine (DA) levels were not significantly different from control in any of the brain regions analyzed. The behavioral and neurochemical results suggest that serotonergic neurons normally exert an inhibitory action upon the psychomotor stimulant effects of MDMA. Since the psychomotor stimulant effects of amphetamines appear to be mediated primarily by the dopamine system, these results provide evidence that 5-HT and DA may represent opposing systems in the DRL schedule-controlled behavior.
