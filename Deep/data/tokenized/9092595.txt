Several subtypes of Ca2+ channel support the release of glutamate at excitatory synapses. We investigated the pattern of colocalization of these subtypes on presynaptic terminals in hippocampal cultures. N-type (conotoxin GVIA-sensitive) or P/Q-type (agatoxin IVA-sensitive) Ca2+ channels were blocked selectively, and the reduction in transmitter release probability (Pr) was measured with MK-801. The antagonists completely blocked release at some terminals, reduced Pr at others, and failed to affect the remainder. In contrast, nonselective reduction of presynaptic Ca2+ influx by adding Cd2+ or lowering external Ca2+ reduced Pr uniformly at all terminals. We conclude from these results that the mixture of N-type and P/Q-type channels varies markedly between terminals on the same afferent. The distribution of Ca2+ channel subtypes was the same for high and low Pr terminals. Given that Ca2+ channel subtypes are affected differentially by neuromodulators, these findings lead to the possibility of terminal-specific modulation of synaptic function.
