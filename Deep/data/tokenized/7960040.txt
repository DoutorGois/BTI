Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were given a single dose of trimethyltin chloride (TMT). Three days following treatment, a neuronal alteration was observed in the CA3c pyramidal cell layer of hippocampus which was not accompanied by any apparent astrocyte reaction. At 1 as well as 2 weeks after treatment, a gliosis in hippocampus, piriform, and entorhinal cortices was detected by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry. Concomitant with the enhanced astrocytic GFAP, astrocytes were swollen and expressed immunoreactivity to vimentin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The astrocytic GABA immunoreactivity may reflect a trimethyltin-induced alteration in astrocyte phenotype, or alterations in compartmentalization and/or metabolism of GABA.
