RNA coding for a 50 kDa polypeptide decreased by 50% in 5 brain regions after corticosterone (CORT) treatment (40 mg/kg for 3 days). By hybrid selection and in vitro translation, the 50 kDa polypeptide is identified as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Hippocampal GFAP mRNA (2.9 kb) decreases in a dose-dependent manner in response to CORT by RNA blot hybridization using a mouse GFAP cRNA probe; a similar decrease in response to the glucocorticoid agonist, RU 28362, is consistent with a type II glucocorticoid receptor-mediated effect. GFAP mRNA is decreased in both hippocampus and cortex following acute (1-3 days) and chronic (3 days to 3 months) CORT treatment. GFAP gene expression is disinhibited in the rat hippocampus by 7 days post adrenalectomy but not by 3 days. Finally, two clones (CR46 and CR59) that were isolated from a rat hippocampal cDNA library by differential hybridization, show decreased RNA abundance in CORT-treated rats compared to controls. A partial DNA sequence derived from the two clones exhibits 94% nucleotide identity and 96% derived amino acid identity with mouse GFAP mRNA. These results indicate that GFAP mRNA is under negative regulation by glucocorticoids and suggests that glucocorticoids may be used to inhibit GFAP gene expression in vivo in order to assess the role of GFAP in temporal aspects of central nervous system damage.
