Nitric oxide (NO) is an atypical neurotransmitter that has been related to the pathophysiology of major depression disorder. Increased plasma NO levels have been reported in depressed and suicidal patients. Inhibition of neuronial nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), on the other hand, induces antidepressant effects in clinical and pre-clinical trials. The mechanisms responsible for the antidepressant-like effects of nNOS inhibitors, however, are not completely understood. In this study, genomic and proteomic analyses were used to investigate the effects of the preferential nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) on changes in global gene and protein expression in the hippocampus of rats submitted to forced swimming test (FST). Chronic treatment (14 days, i.p.) with imipramine (15 mg/kg daily) or 7-NI (60 mg/kg daily) significantly reduced immobility in the FST. Saturation curves for Serial analysis of gene expression libraries showed that the hippocampus of animals submitted to FST presented a lower number of expressed genes compared to non-FST stressed groups. Imipramine, but not 7-NI, reverted this effect. GeneGo analyses revealed that genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis and survival controlled by HTR1A signaling and cytoskeleton remodeling controlled by Rho GTPases were significantly changed by FST. 7-NI prevented this effect. In addition, 7-NI treatment changed the expression of genes related to transcription in the cAMP response element-binding pathway. Therefore, this study suggests that changes in oxidative stress and neuroplastic processes could be involved in the antidepressant-like effects induced by nNOS inhibition.
