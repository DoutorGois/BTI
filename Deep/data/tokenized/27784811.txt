Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an established effective treatment for medication-resistant depression with the rapid onset of action. However, its cellular mechanism of action has not been revealed. We have previously shown that chronic antidepressant drug treatments enhance dopamine D1-like receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation at the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 excitatory synapse. In this study we show that ECT-like treatments in mice also have marked effects on the dopaminergic synaptic modulation. Repeated electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS), an animal model of ECT, strongly enhanced the dopamine-induced synaptic potentiation at the MF synapse in hippocampal slices. Significant enhancement was detectable after the second ECS, and further repetition of ECS up to 11 times monotonously increased the magnitude of enhancement. After repeated ECS, the dopamine-induced synaptic potentiation remained enhanced for more than 4 wk. These synaptic effects of ECS were accompanied by increased expression of the dopamine D1 receptor gene. Our results demonstrate that robust neuronal activation by ECS induces rapid and long-lasting enhancement of dopamine-induced synaptic potentiation at the MF synapse, likely via increased expression of the D1 receptor, at least in part. This rapid enhancement of dopamine-induced potentiation at the excitatory synapse may be relevant to the fast-acting antidepressant effect of ECT. NEW & NOTEWORTHY: We show that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)-like stimulation greatly enhances synaptic potentiation induced by dopamine at the excitatory synapse formed by the hippocampal mossy fiber in mice. The effect of ECT-like stimulation on the dopaminergic modulation was rapidly induced, maintained for more than 4 wk after repeated treatments, and most likely mediated by increased expression of the dopamine D1 receptor. These effects may be relevant to fast-acting strong antidepressant action of ECT.
