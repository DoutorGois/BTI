Malathion is a pesticide used on a large scale and with high potential risk for human exposure. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that while the malathion is metabolizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be generated and subsequently there is onset of an oxidative stress in central nervous system (CNS) structures: hippocampus, cortex, striatum and cerebellum of intoxicated rats due to mitochondrial respiratory chain disfunctions. The present study was therefore undertaken to evaluate malathion-induced lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide production from sub-mitochondrial particles and the activity of complexes II and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Malathion was administered in doses of 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg malathion/kg. After malathion administration LPO increased in hippocampus and striatum. This was accompanied by an increase in the formation of superoxide in submitochondrial particles in the hippocampus. Complex IV suffered significant inhibition of its activity. We could demonstrate in this study that malathion induces oxidative stress and it could be due to inactivation of mitochondrial respiratory complexes.
