Cell suspensions obtained from the fetal hippocampus were transplanted into the adult rat hippocampus at 1 or 4 weeks after transient forebrain ischemia. Only when the ischemia induced death of most of the CA1 pyramidal cells of the host hippocampus and transplantation was performed at 1 week after the ischemia, did a large number of transplanted cells survive and the most extensive dendritic growth was demonstrated by microtubule-associated protein 2 immunohistochemistry. The dendrites of the cells located in the ventral part were oriented ventrally, lining up similarly to the parallel arrangements of apical dendrites of normal CA1 pyramidal cells. These findings suggest that certain forms of trophic factors, which appear to occur in association with the presence of free terminals of afferent fibers during the earlier period after ischemic insult, are involved in the survival of and dendritic growth from transplanted hippocampal cells.
