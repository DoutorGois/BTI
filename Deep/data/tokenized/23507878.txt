Excessive stimulation of glutamatergic receptors (GluRs) can overexcite neurons. This can be dampened by KATP channels linking metabolic and neuronal activities, but the cross-talk has not yet been examined on the single channel level. In the brainstem and hippocampal neurons, GluR agonists augmented the open state probability (Popen) of KATP channels with relative efficacy: kainate AMPA > NMDA > t-ACPD. Inhibition of calcium influx and chelation of intracellular calcium did not modify the effects. Kainate did not augment production of reactive oxygen species measured with roGFP1. H2O2 slightly increased Popen, but GluR effects were not modified. GluR actions were abolished in Na(+)-free solutions and after blockade of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase. KATP channels in open-cell patch-clamp measurements were inhibited by ATP, stimulated by ADP, and kainate was effective only in the presence of ATP. GluR stimulation enhanced ATP consumption that decreased submembrane ATP levels, whereas metabolic poisoning diminished bulk ATP. Modelling showed strong ATP depletion and ADP accumulation near the membrane, and both effects contributed to Popen increases after GluR stimulation. Kainate and hypoxia activated KATP channels in the functional brainstem slices. Inhibition of aerobic ATP production and GluR stimulation were about equally effective in KATP channel opening during hypoxia. Induction of seizure-like activity in hippocampal slices with Mg(2+)-free solutions was accompanied by ATP decrease and KATP channel opening. We propose that KATP channels and GluRs are functionally coupled that can regulate long-lasting changes of neuronal activity in the CNS neurons.
