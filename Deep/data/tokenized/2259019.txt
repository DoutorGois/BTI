We studied 40 patients with temporal lobe epilepsies who had long-term intracranial EEG recordings and temporal lobectomies. They were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the anatomical site of seizure origin. An electrode implantation technique combined intracerebral depth electrodes with subdural strip electrodes. The seizures were of amygdalo-hippocampal origin in 18 patients, lateral temporal in 13 patients, and temporo-basal in 9 patients. The clinical and EEG features were reviewed retrospectively with regard to 3 factors in each patient: localization of interictal spikes in the scalp-recorded EEG, signal symptoms (auras), and presumed etiologies. Epilepsy with amygdalo-hippocampal and lateral temporal seizures was found to be distinguishable by the electroclinical features. It seems practical to classify these 2 subtypes of temporal lobe epilepsies as in the 1989 Classification of Epilepsies and Epileptic Syndromes. Temporal lobe epilepsies thus defined can be regarded as epileptic syndromes rather than a cluster of seizure manifestations.
