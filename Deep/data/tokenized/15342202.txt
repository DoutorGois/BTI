The present study examined the modulating effects of an intrahippocampal injection of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h following contextual fear conditioning, a task known to increase BDNF mRNA, in rats. Contextual fear conditioning produced a time-dependent increase in BDNF mRNA that varied by region of hippocampus. IL-1beta blocked or reduced these increases in BDNF mRNA in the CA1, CA2, and dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus, but had no effect in cortical regions. These data support the idea that IL-1beta-produced memory deficits may be mediated via BDNF mRNA reductions in hippocampus.
