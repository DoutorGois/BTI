Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a widely studied toxic peptide secreted by certain water blooms of cyanobacteria that exhibit hepatotoxicity and neural toxicity. This study aimed to observe the neurotoxic effects of low-dose MC-LR exposure by oral administration. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered orally every 2 days for 8 weeks with pure water and 0.2, 1.0, and 5.0 mug/kg MC-LR. The Morris water maze test was used to assess the spatial learning and memory capability of rats. The activation of astrocytes and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) in rat hippocampus were analyzed. Slight liver dysfunction was observed in the 5.0 mug/kg MC-LR-treated rats. Impairment of spatial learning and memory was also observed in the 5.0 mug/kg MC-LR-treated rats. Astrocytes in the hippocampus of the 5.0 mug/kg MC-LR-treated rats showed enhanced activation and cell density; the inflammatory indicators, NOS and NO, increased in accordance with astrocyte activation. This study showed that oral exposure of MC-LR had adverse affects on neurobehaviors, and induced inflammation in memory-related brain regions.
