Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) exhibit marked depressions of the regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGlu) in the mesiotemporal region. We hypothesised that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) who have a bilateral somatosensory or acoustic ( = temporolateral/SII-) aura can be differentiated from mTLE by rCMRGlu depressions primarily involving temporo-perisylvian locations. We therefore used this ictal semiology as a clinical criterion to define a subgroup of such patients and measured the rCMRGlu in 16 patients with TLE as evident from interictal and ictal EEG-video monitoring. Clinically, they presented with medically refractory complex partial seizures and were subjected to presurgical evaluation. The pattern of the interictal rCMRGlu in the TLE patients was different from that observed in patients with mTLE and showed significant depressions ipsilateral to the epileptic focus in mesial temporal and lateral temporal regions but spared the thalamus. The neocortical metabolic depressions were spatially more extended in right than in left TLE patients. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were either normal (n = 5) or revealed unilateral or bilateral hippocampal atrophy/sclerosis (n = 7), or temporal or extratemporal focal cortical dysplasia (n = 4). The selected TLE patients presented here comprise a heterogeneous group showing most pronounced metabolic depressions in the lateral temporal cortex. Thus, our data suggest that non-invasive metabolic imaging can assist in identifying the neocortical symptomatogenic zone in putative temporo-perisylvian lobe epilepsy.
