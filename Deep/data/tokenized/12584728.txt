The serotonin (5HT) transporter (5HTT) regulates serotonergic neurotransmission by mediating the reuptake of 5HT from the synaptic cleft. Although lacking the high affinity and selectivity of the 5HTT, the brain expresses a large number of other transporters, including the polyspecific organic cation transporters (OCTs). OCT1 and OCT3, members of the potential-sensitive organic cation transporter gene family, physiologically transport a wide spectrum of organic cations. In addition, both transporters mediate low-affinity 5HT transport and, therefore, may participate in the clearance of excessive 5HT. Because concentrations of extracellular 5HT are increased in the brain of 5HTT-deficient mice, they are a model for investigating the role of OCTs in 5HT system homeostasis. Here, we analyzed OCT1 and OCT3 gene expression in the brain of 5HTT knockout mice by semiquantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. We demonstrate that, in 5HTT-deficient mice, OCT3 mRNA concentrations were significantly increased in the hippocampus, but not in other brain regions, including cortex, striatum, cerebellum, and brainstem. In contrast, no difference in OCT1 expression was detected between 5HTT knockout and control mice. Up-regulation of OCT3 expression and enhanced low-affinity 5HT uptake may limit the adverse effects of elevated extracellular 5HT and may play a critical role in maintaining 5HT-dependent functions of the hippocampus in the absence of 5HTT.
