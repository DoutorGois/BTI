Zinc was added to the perfusate of rat hippocampal slices to determine the effect on the potentiation of evoked responses in subfield CA3 following paired-pulse stimulation of mossy fibres. Paired-pulse potentiation across a range of interpulse intervals and currents was significantly depressed by 50 and 500 microM zinc chloride. Additionally but only at the higher concentration, the amplitude of the first evoked potential was significantly increased. These results provide further evidence of a role for zinc in hippocampal neurotransmission.
