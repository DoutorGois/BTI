Repeatedly it was reported that a short ischemic episode may ameliorate biochemical and morphological impairment upon succeeding severe ischemia. We investigated whether the pattern of respiratory enzyme activity (RA), adenine nucleotides, and membrane potential in hippocampal slices following low-dose in vivo (20 mg/kg) and high-dose in vitro (1 mM) application of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-np), a specific inhibitor of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), indicates a similar tolerance phenomenon. One hour in vivo treatment decreased RA, spectrophotometrically quantitated by intensity of staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC), to 48 +/- 5% (mean +/- SE; P<0.01). Intermittent increase after 2 h (79 +/- 5%; P<0.05) was followed by gradual decline to 48 +/- 16% (P<0.01) after 8 h. The intermittent increase predominated in stratum pyramidale of hippocampal region CA1 (CA1sp) vs CA3 (CA3sp) (89 +/- 6% vs 57 +/- 6% of control; P <0.01). ATP levels paralleled the intensity of average (CA1sp, CA3sp, plus CA1 stratum radiatum) TTC staining (r=0.93). After pretreatment of 3-np in vivo for 1 h, no further decrease of RA upon 30-min in vitro treatment was seen in any region. At all other times, RA declined further upon in vitro treatment (P<0.01). Compared to 1-h in vivo treatment, hyperpolarization of CA1sp pyramidal cells upon in vitro application of 1 mM 3-np was reduced after 8-h pretreatment in vivo (P<0.04). At this time, depolarization upon glibenclamide (10 muM), an antagonist at KATP-channels, was reduced. We conclude that the severity of impairment of oxidative phosphorylation upon repeated inhibition of SDH in vivo and in vitro is not increased in an additive manner. At appropriate times, relative protection against further decrease of energy metabolism is observed-chemical preconditioning. Activation of KATP-channels is associated with chemical preconditioning.
