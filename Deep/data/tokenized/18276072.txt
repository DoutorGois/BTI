The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-EMF) exposure during morphine treatment on dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) density in the rat dorsal hippocampus following withdrawal. Rats were exposed to ELF-EMF (20 Hz, 14 mT) or sham exposed for 1h per day before injection of morphine (10mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 12 days. The saline control group was sham exposed for the same period. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the density of D2Rs on the 1st, 3rd and 5th morphine withdrawal days. The results showed that the density of D2Rs in sham-exposed morphine-treated rats on the 1st and 3rd days of morphine withdrawal was significantly lower than that of the saline control group. The ELF-EMF-exposed morphine group also exhibited a significantly lower density of D2Rs on the 1st and 3rd withdrawal days relative to the sham-exposed morphine group. However, the D2R density in both groups tended to recover as morphine withdrawal days increased. The results suggest that dorsal hippocampal D2Rs are sensitive to morphine withdrawal and that this is potentiated by ELF-EMF pre-exposure during morphine treatment.
