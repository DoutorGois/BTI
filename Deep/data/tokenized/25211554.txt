The availability of markers able to provide insight into protein changes in the central nervous system after fatal traumatic brain injury (TBI) is limited. The present study reports on the semi-quantitative assessments of the immunopositive neuroglial cells (both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) and neurons for S100 protein (S100), as well as neuronal specific enolase (NSE), in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum with regard to survival time and cause of death. Brain tissues of 47 autopsy cases with TBI (survival times ranged between several minutes and 34 d) and 10 age- and gender-matched controls (natural deaths) were examined. TBI cases were grouped according to their survival time in acute death after brain injury (ABI, n = 25), subacute death after brain injury (SBI, n = 18) and delayed death after brain injury (DBI, n = 4). There were no significant changes in the percentages of S100-stained astrocytes between TBI and control cases. The percentages of S100-positive oligodendrocytes in the pericontusional zone (PCZ) in cases with SBI were significantly lower than in controls (p < 0.05) and in the ABI group (p < 0.05). In the hippocampus, S100-positive oligodendrocytes were significantly lower in cases with ABI and SBI (both, p < 0.05), compared with controls. It is of particular interest that there were also S100-positive neurons in the PCZ and hippocampus in TBI cases after more than 2 h survival but not in ABI cases or controls. The percentages of NSE-positive neurons in the hippocampus were likewise significantly lower in cases with ABI, compared with controls (p < 0.05) but increased in cases with SBI in PCZ (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the present findings emphasize that S100 and NSE-immunopositivity might be useful for detecting the cause and process of death due to TBI. Further, S100-positivity in neurons may be helpful to estimate the survival time of fatal injuries in legal medicine.
