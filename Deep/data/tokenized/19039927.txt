Experiments on hippocampal slices of CBA mice showed that the probability of spontaneous epileptiform discharges recorded in the field CA1 pyramidal layer is higher in animals predisposed to catalepsy compared to mice with low predisposition to catalepsy. Presumably, some factors determining predisposition to catalepsy modulate synchronization of neuronal activity in the hippocampus; this suggests using hippocampal slices as a model for studies of neurophysiological mechanisms of hereditary predisposition to catalepsy.
