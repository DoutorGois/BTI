Exogenous phospholipases have been used extensively as tools to study the role of membrane lipids in receptor mechanisms. We used in vitro quantitative autoradiography to evaluate the effect of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA glutamate receptors in rat brain. PLA2 pretreatment induced a significant increase in alpha-[3H]amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate ([3H]AMPA) binding in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the stratum moleculare of the cerebellum. No modification of [3H]AMPA binding was found in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampus at different ligand concentrations. [3H]-Glutamate binding to the metabotropic glutamate receptor and the non-NMDA-, non-kainate-, non-quisqualate-sensitive [3H]glutamate binding site were also increased by PLA2 pretreatment. [3H]Kainate binding and NMDA-sensitive [3H]glutamate binding were minimally affected by the enzyme pretreatment. The PLA2 effect was reversed by EGTA, the PLA2 inhibitor p-bromophenacyl bromide, and prolonged pretreatment with heat. Bovine serum albumin (1%) prevented the increase in metabotropic binding by PLA2. Arachidonic acid failed to mimic the PLA2 effect on metabotropic binding. These results indicate that PLA2 can selectively modulate certain subtypes of excitatory amino acid receptors. This effect is due to the enzymatic activity but is probably not correlated with the formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Independent of their possible physiological implications, our results provide the first autoradiographic evidence that an enzymatic treatment can selectively affect the binding properties of excitatory amino acid receptors in different regions of the CNS.
