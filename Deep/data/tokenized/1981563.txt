NMDA receptor antagonists produced differential effects on medial and lateral perforant path-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded in the dentate gyrus molecular layer of hippocampal slices. D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D(-)-APV) and 3[(+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) significantly reduced the peak amplitude and total area, but not the initial negative slope, of the medial perforant path-evoked EPSP. Neither antagonist affected any component of the lateral perforant path-evoked EPSP. In contrast, population spikes evoked by stimulation of either pathway were depressed.
