Neuropeptides are emerging as key components in the hippocampal neurogenic niche in health and disease, regulating many aspects of neurogenesis and the synaptic integration of newly generated neurons. This review focuses on the role of neuropeptide Y in the control of stem/precursor cells in the postnatal and adult hippocampus. It is likely that neuropeptide Y releasing interneurons are key sensors of neural activity, modulating neurogenesis appropriately. This is likely to be a fruitful area of research for extending our understanding of the control of stem cells in the normal and diseased brain.
