An antagonistic effect of calcium on the action of morphine was studied in rat hippocampal slices. The effect of repeated administration of morphine on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release and binding of [3H]nitrendipine, a calcium antagonist, was also examined. (1) In rat brain hippocampal slices, morphine enlarged the amplitude of the field potentials evoked in pyramidal neurons, disinhibiting them through basket cells. When the calcium concentration was elevated, potentiation of the field potentials by morphine was reduced. Decrease of the calcium concentration, on the other hand, enhanced the potentiating effect of morphine. Following repeated administration of morphine, its enhancing effect on the field potentials in slices was not observed. (2) In hippocampal membrane fractions obtained from rats repeatedly treated with morphine, enhancement of [3H]nitrendipine binding was observed. (3) In hippocampal slice preparations from rats receiving morphine repeatedly, K+ (45 mM)-stimulated [3H]GABA efflux was enhanced. The above results indicate that morphine antagonizes calcium, thereby reducing the release of transmitters. Furthermore, increase in calcium channels following repeated treatment of rats with morphine may explain the mechanism underlying development of tolerance.
