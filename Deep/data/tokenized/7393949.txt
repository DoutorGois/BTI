Incorporation of 32P into acid-extractable nuclear proteins was measured in the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, rest of the brain, and liver of rats submitted to various different behavioral treatments in a shuttle-box. After 5 min of classical conditioning, of avoidance without CS-US pairing, and of avoidance with CS-US pairing (standard shuttle avoidance), there was an increased 32P uptake by acid-extractable nuclear proteins in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus. The effect disappeared between 5 and 25 min of training. After 25 min of buzzers alone, or of footshocks alone, a similar 32P uptake change was noted in the same brain structure, which raises doubts as to the specificity of the phenomenon in terms of learning mechanisms.
