D-Ala2-Met-enkephalinamide injected into the lateral brain ventricle (i.c.v.) in a dose of 100 micrograms increased choline acetyltransferase (AchT) activity in the hypothalamus and thalamus. No changes of AchT activity in the striatum, hippocampus and cortex were found. D-Ala2-Met-enkephalinamide increased also acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity but only in the hypothalamus. Morphine (10 micrograms i.c.v.) increased AchT activity only in the thalamus. Our results and data from the literature suggest that enkephalins may effect the cholinergic neurons in the brain.
