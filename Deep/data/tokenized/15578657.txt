In a study examining for apoptosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), we observed the constitutive presence of activated caspase 3 in Bergmann glia. We then examined stroke-prone SHR as well as the normotensive strains Wistar, Wistar Kyoto, and Sprague-Dawley. In all these strains, we found that Bergmann glia expressed activated caspase 3 in nuclei. Furthermore, subpopulations of astrocytes in the granular layer of the cerebellar cortex, in the hippocampus, and spinal cord gray matter, particularly in the dorsal part of the dorsal horns, expressed nuclear activated caspase 3. This distribution corresponds to the distribution of astrocytes that express the glutamate transporter GLAST. We conclude that Bergmann glia and a subpopulation of astrocytes throughout the CNS express activated caspase 3 in nuclei to fulfill a yet-to-be defined non-apoptotic function. GLIA.
