We used resting-state fMRI to evaluate longitudinal alterations in local spontaneous brain activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) over a 2-year period. Data were acquired from 23 PD patients at baseline and follow-up, and 27 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) were used to identify differences in local spontaneous brain activity and grey matter volume. With disease progression, we observed a progressive decrease in ReHo in the sensorimotor cortex, default-mode network, and left cerebellum, but increased ReHo in the supplementary motor area, bilateral temporal gyrus, and hippocampus. Moreover, there was a significant positive correlation between the rates of ReHo change in the left cerebellum and the rates of change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-III scores. VBM revealed no significant differences in the grey matter volume among the three sets of acquisitions. We conclude that ReHo may be a suitable non-invasive marker of progression in PD.
