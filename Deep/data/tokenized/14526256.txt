Stem-cells have been identified in the adult human brain in two zones which are the subventricular zone and the gyrus dentatus of the hippocampus. Improvement of techniques aimed to identify, to localize and to follow the lineage of these cells have been crucial to the understanding of the following processes: a) identification of cellular proliferation, b) specific immunostaining of differentiated glial and neuronal cells, c) transplantations to decipher between intrinsic stem-cell properties and influence of the environment on the fate of the cell. Furthermore, it seems that stem-cells from other sources than the brain can differentiate into neurons both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this review is to sum up what is known about cerebral stem-cells and the challenging tools they mean for the future.
