Amphetamines are psychostimulants abused by man, that eventually leads to drug dependence. Amphetamine administration to rodents has been shown to provoke significant neurotoxicity involving dopaminergic nerve terminal degeneration. However, little information related to the effect of amphetamines on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and neurotoxicity in brain is currently available. Herein we report the biochemical alterations of lipids and proteins in brain sections from amphetamine-treated rodents using infrared microspectroscopy, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. The spectroscopic changes reveal for the first time the formation of beta-sheet-rich proteins in the cortex, but no significant protein alterations are visible in hippocampus region where hydroperoxide concentration is found to be lower relative to cortex. These result suggest that ROS generated by amphetamine-mediated oxidative stress induce formation beta-sheet-rich proteins which can be of amyloid beta-like character.
