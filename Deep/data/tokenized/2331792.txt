Intracellular activity was recorded from neurons in immature rat hippocampal slices. The presence of intrinsic inhibitory synaptic potentials as well as responses to serotonin were assessed in slices of 1, 2 or 3 postnatal weeks of age. Young (1 week) cells had only a marginal hyperpolarizing response to serotonin and no detectable intrinsic inhibitory synaptic potentials. At 2 weeks of age neurons already expressed a fast IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential). The responses to serotonin were different from those of adult cells in that they involved primarily a large decrease in input resistance with only small potential changes. In cells of this age serotonin caused a marked increase in spontaneous IPSP discharges and a blockade of a slow afterhyperpolarization. In 3-week-old rats the fast and slow components of the IPSP were present as in adult and the responses to serotonin included a large hyperpolarization associated with an increase in K conductance, a blockade of slow afterhyperpolarization and a blockade of a slow IPSP, as seen in adult cells. These results indicate that the complex pattern of reactivity to serotonin is differentially regulated in the developing brain.
