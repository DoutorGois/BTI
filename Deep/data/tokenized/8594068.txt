The consequences of an unilateral electrolytic entorhinal lesion on the functional activity in all major anatomically defined brain regions were evaluated in the rat. The 14C-2 deoxyglucose method served as a tool to quantify alterations of local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion at 4 days, 2 weeks, or 3 months after stereotaxic surgery. Apart from a few minor increases in the contralateral hemisphere, the predominant pattern consisted of reductions in the range of 10-40% in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Ipsilaterally, in extrahippocampal areas, LCGU had regained control levels at 2 weeks postlesion in contrast to hippocampal regions, where reductions were more pronounced than in other brain areas and partially persisted for up to 3 months. Interestingly, the termination zones of entorhinal fibers in the dentate gyrus did not regain control levels within 3 months. We conclude from the data that functional recovery of denervated primary target areas does not occur within 3 months after entorhinal lesions and that altered functional activity may be found beyond the primary target areas predominantly during the acute recovery period after the lesion. The data suggest that sprouting fibers do not reestablish a fully functional neuronal network during the recovery period.
