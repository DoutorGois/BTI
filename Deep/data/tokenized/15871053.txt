BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The results of the treatment of patients with deep, supratentorial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located in medial hemisphere or intraventricularly are presented. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The paper presents the results of treatment of 17 patients. AVMs were located in the trigonum of the lateral ventricle in 4 cases (23.5%), in the splenium of the corpus callosum and its neighborhood in 4 cases (23.5%), in the parahippocampal and lingual gyrus in 3 cases (17%), in the head of the caudate nucleus in 2 cases (12%), in the hippocampus and the nucleus amygdalae in 2 cases (12%), in the anterior part of the gyrus cinguli in 1 case (6%) and in the truncus of the corpus callosum in 1 case (6%). RESULTS: AVMs most often manifested as intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage (82%). The surgical treatment has been applied (total removal--90%), embolization with histoacryl glue (total embolization--20%) and irradiation with LINAC. The surgical treatment was performed in all patients with hemiparesis and intracerebral hematomas. CONCLUSION: The results of the surgical treatment are good and it fastest prevents recurrent hemorrhage from deep AVM. Incomplete embolization of AVM without the surgical treatment or radiosurgery is life threatening for the patients.
