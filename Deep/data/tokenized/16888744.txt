Environments with overlapping features are represented by distinct patterns of activity in the hippocampus, enabling information to be stored and retrieved with minimal interference. This orthogonalization of correlated inputs is thought to take place within the hippocampus itself. However, the orthogonalization process has been shown to take days to develop in CA1. This prolonged time course is in striking contrast to the fast encoding of behavioral memory by the hippocampus. To explore this apparent paradox, we asked whether orthogonalization depended on the type of remapping exhibited by the hippocampal network. We have previously distinguished two types of remapping, global remapping, which results in the activation of different assemblies of place fields, and rate remapping, which encodes differences between cue constellations by substantial changes in firing rate without a change in the place code. Global remapping has previously been shown to be expressed immediately at novel locations. Here we asked if rate remapping follows a slower time course. Ensemble activity was recorded simultaneously from CA3 and CA1 in rats exposed to two similar, novel environments. It was found that rate changes in response to novel sensory cue configurations can form immediately, just as during global remapping, in particular in CA3. The fast encoding of both spatial and nonspatial information in CA3 is consistent with a role for the autoassociative CA3 circuitry in the acquisition and expression of episodic memories.
