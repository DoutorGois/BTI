The gene encoding dysbindin-1 has recently been implicated in susceptibility to schizophrenia. In this issue of the JCI, Talbot et al. show that, contrary to expectations, dysbindin-1 is located presynaptically in glutamatergic neurons and is reduced at these locations in schizophrenia. Further studies of dysbindin-1 and the proteins with which it interacts can be expected to throw light on the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
