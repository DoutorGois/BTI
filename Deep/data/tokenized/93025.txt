Neurons of the nucleus reuniens thalami stained with Golgi methods are compared to cells in this nucleus labelled in retrograde fashion after hippocampal injections of horseradish peroxidase. The cellular morphology ranges from fusiform to multiangular with most cells showing radiating processes characteristic of neurons in the reticular core. Dendrites are long and relatively smooth, with a few sparsely distributed spinous processes. These cells are comparable to the cholinergic cells of the median septal/diagonal band area which also project into the hippocampal formation.
