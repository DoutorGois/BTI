Single intravenous injections of lithium hydroxybutyrate (10 mg/kg) to rabbits prevented the effects of stimulation of the dorsal nucleus of the raphe on the electrogenesis of the cortex and subcortical structures. At long-term administration (7 days, 10 mg/kg daily intramuscularly) lithium hydroxybutyrate prevented the influence of stimulation on the electrogram (EG) of this structure and the motor cortex but enhanced it with respect to EG of the amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus and caudate nucleus.
