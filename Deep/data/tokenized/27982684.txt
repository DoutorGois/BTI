The present study investigated the effects of nesfatin-1 on gastric distension (GD)-responsive neurons via an interaction with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor signaling in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and the potential regulation of these effects by hippocampal projections to VMH. Extracellular single-unit discharges were recorded in VHM following administration of nesfatin-1. The projection of nerve fibers and expression of nesfatin-1 were assessed by retrograde tracing and fluoro-immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Results showed that there were GD-responsive neurons in VMH; Nesfatin-1 administration and electrical stimulation of hippocampal CA1 sub-region altered the firing rate of these neurons. These changes could be partially blocked by pretreatment with the non-selective CRF antagonist astressin-B or an antibody to NUCB2/nesfatin-1. Electrolytic lesion of CA1 hippocampus reduced the effects of nesfatin-1 on VMH GD-responsive neuronal activity. These studies suggest that nesfatin-1 plays an important role in GD-responsive neuronal activity through interactions with CRF signaling pathways in VMH. The hippocampus may participate in the modulation of nesfatin-1-mediated effects in VMH.
