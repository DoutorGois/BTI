Zinc, copper and lead are known as inhibitory trace metals against brain (Na+-K+)-ATPase. Alcohol (4 g/kg intraperitoneally for 10 days, to rats) induced an elevated level of lead in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, whereas that of zinc was elevated only in latter region. Copper levels were found to be decreased in the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus, but increased in the spinal cord. Zinc and lead contents were decreased in the amygdala and hypothalamus. The activity of (Na+-K+)-ATPase was enhanced in the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus, but inhibited in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. It is suggested that alcohol acts differentially on brain zinc, copper and lead concentrations and (Na+-K+)-ATPase activity.
