Previous studies have shown that medial prefrontal cortical regions, such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), play a key role in the expression of remote spatial and contextual memory. To evaluate whether this role is conserved in hippocampal-independent tasks we trained mice in the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. Lidocaine-induced inactivation of the ACC blocked the expression of CTA tested one month (remote), but not one day (recent), after conditioning with either a weak or strong unconditioned stimulus (US). These data suggest that the ACC may play a conserved role in remote memory, regardless of memory strength or content.
