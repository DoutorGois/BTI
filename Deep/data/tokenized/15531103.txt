Activation of group I and group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) is thought to be required for long-term depression (LTD) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the perirhinal cortex. However, little is known about how activation of mGluRs leads to this form of synaptic plasticity. AMPA receptor phosphorylation has been implicated in several forms of modulation of synaptic transmission. In the CA1 area of the hippocampus, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent LTD is associated with the reduced phosphorylation of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit at serine 845 (GluR1-S845). Immunoblot analysis of perirhinal cortical neurons using GluR1 and GluR1-S845 phosphorylation state specific antibodies showed that stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) with forskolin (FSK) dramatically increased PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GluR1-S845. However, selective or simultaneous application of mGluR5 agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) and mGluR2/3 agonist (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG IV) did not produce detectable changes in GluR1-S845 phosphorylation. These results indicate that in the perirhinal cortex mGluR activation does not alter the phosphorylation state of GluR1-S845. Therefore, it is likely that the process involved in the modification of AMPA receptors in mGluR activation dependent LTD in the perirhinal cortex is mechanistically distinct from NMDA receptor-mediated LTD described in hippocampal neurons.
