CNS lesions trigger cell death in injured neurons and glia. Genes of the bcl-2 family play crucial roles in the control of apoptosis and cell survival in the CNS. Recently, it has been suggested that overexpression of bcl-2 induces axonal elongation and regeneration in vitro and in vivo. Here, we analyze the regenerative potential of bcl-2 overexpression in the axotomized entorhino-hippocampal connection in organotypic slice cocultures. Our results show that in slice cocultures from bcl-2-overexpressing mice, there is a decrease in the number of dead neurons in the entorhinal cortex. In addition, axonal regeneration is not enhanced after axotomy. Thus, in the entorhino-hippocampal formation in vitro, bcl-2 overexpression rescues neurons from axotomy-induced cell death but fails to enhance the regeneration of the entorhino-hippocampal connection.
