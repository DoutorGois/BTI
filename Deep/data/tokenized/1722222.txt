The distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was examined in the subiculum and hippocampus of the adult mouse (Mus musculus domesticus). A distinctly stratified AChE pattern was observed in both areas and was compared in detail with cytoarchitectural fields and layers. In the subiculum, the lateral plexiform layer was lightly stained superficially and moderately stained at depth, where it abutted the lateral, moderately stained cell layer. Medially, a moderately stained deep plexiform layer separated the darkly stained superficial plexiform layer from the equally AChE-intense cell layer. At depth, the subicular cell layer was delimited by a band of very high AChE activity. In regio superior of the hippocampus, AChE-intense bands delimited the moderately stained strata moleculare, radiatum, and oriens toward the subjacent layers. In the stratum pyramidale, precipitate insinuated between the cell bodies gave a dark appearance to the deep part of the layer. The homologous strata of regio inferior appeared darker, but the relative staining intensities corresponded largely to those in regio superior. AChE activity in the layer of mossy fibers was almost absent septally but increased gradually to very high levels temporally. The AChE staining pattern, in conjunction with cytochemical and morphological evidence, strongly suggests a division of the pyramidal cell layer of the mouse and rat into superficial and deep substrata and discourages the definition of a prosubiculum in rodents. A comparative analysis of the AChE pattern reveals that: 1) in the subiculum, differences between species are observed within a generalized pattern of medial darkly staining and lateral lightly staining portions; 2) in the hippocampus, a conservation of the AChE pattern is seen in strata associated with intrinsic hippocampal connection; while 3) numerous interspecific differences are found in the stratum moleculare.
