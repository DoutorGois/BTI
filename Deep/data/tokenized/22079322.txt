The aim of this study was to quantitatively investigate the chronic ethanol-induced cerebral metabolic changes in various regions of the rat brain, using the proton high resolution magic angle spinning spectroscopy technique. The rats were divided into two groups (control group: N=11, ethanol-treated group: N=11) and fed with the liquid diets for 10 weeks. In each week, the mean intake volumes of liquid diet were measured. The brain tissues, including cerebellum (Cere), frontal cortex (FC), hippocampus (Hip), occipital cortex (OC) and thalamus (Thal), were harvested immediately after the end of experiments. The ex vivo proton spectra for the five brain regions were acquired with the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence at 500-MHz NMR spectrometer. All of the spectra were processed using the LCModel software, with simulated basis-set file, and the metabolite levels were referenced to total creatine. In the ethanol liquid diet group, there were significant increases in the metabolites ratio levels, as compared to control (Cere: alanine, glutathione, and N-acetlyaspartate; FC: phosphocholine and taurine; Hip: alanine, glutamine, and N-acetylaspartate; OC: glutamine; Thal: alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, taurine, and free choline). However, in the ethanol liquid diet group, the myo-inositol levels of the OC were significantly lower. The present study demonstrates how chronic ethanol consumption affects cerebral metabolites in the chronic ethanol-treated rat. Therefore, this result could be useful to pursue clinical applications for quantitative diagnosis in human alcoholism.
