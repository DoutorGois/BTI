The effects of repeated exposure to a sublethal dose (60 micrograms/kg; 0.4 LD50) of soman on brain regional acetylcholine (ACh) and choline (Ch) levels, spinal cord cholinesterase (ChE) activity and on water consumption, body weight and gross behavioral changes were examined. Male rats were dosed once a week or three times a week and at 24 h after 2, 4 or 6 weeks of dosing, selected brain tissues and behavior were examined. During the 6-week period, there was no difference between control and soman-dosed rats in water consumption or body weight under either treatment regimen. The animals treated once a week adapted to this exposure regimen well. They exhibited no change in the levels of ACh or Ch in any of the brain areas when examined at the end of 2, 4 or 6 weeks, nor did they show any obvious signs of poisoning. The total ChE activity fluctuated between 70 and 100% of control. When treated three times a week, however, survivors (90%) of the soman-treated rats developed signs that progressed in severity to a hyper-reactivity syndrome which consisted of an exaggerated reaction to mild tactile stimuli. Brain ACh levels did not change and ChE activity showed inhibition of 40, 58 and 75% when measured at 2, 4 and 6 weeks, respectively. At the end of 6 weeks, the levels of Ch, except in the striatum, were significantly elevated in brainstem, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum (52%, 147%, 68%, 46%, and 91%, respectively), indicating that Ch metabolism in neuronal membranes may be altered following more frequent low-dose soman exposures.
