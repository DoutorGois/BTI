The effect of 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine (T3) on survival and morphology of primary cultured neurons of the fetal rat brain was studied. In defined conditions of serum-free culture media we found the death preventing effect of T3 in all tested neuronal populations cultivated at high initial densities of plating (10(5) cells/cm2). While the survival of cerebrocortical neurons was improved very slightly, the number of surviving hippocampal and septal neurons reached 127.2 +/- 2.0% or 134.8 +/- 12.3% of their respective controls. The septal neurons responded at normal physiological concentration of T3 (1 nM) in high density as well as in low density cultures (5 x 10(3) cells/cm2). Moreover the treatment with 10 nM of T3 caused significant extension of the axon elongation of septal neurons (194.5 +/- 15.7%). These findings suggest the direct positive effect of T3 on pure cell population of septal neurons derived from embryonic rat brain and support the evidence for the role of this peripheral hormone during neuritogenesis.
