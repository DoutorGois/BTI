New experimental data on the mnemotropic (nootropic) properties of the well-known drug polidan (a DNA derivative) are summarized. The results obtained by histological techniques showed changes in the brain structure, indicating protein synthesis activation under the action of polidan. These results confirm prognostic function of the concept of evolutionary-molecular basis of memory.
