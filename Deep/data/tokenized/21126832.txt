Despite the high incidence of toluene abuse in adolescents, little is known regarding the effect of binge exposure on neurochemical profiles during this developmental stage. In the current study, the effects of binge toluene exposure during adolescence on neurotransmitter levels were determined using high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ex vivo at 11.7T. Adolescent male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to toluene (0, 8000, or 12,000 ppm) for 15 min twice daily from postnatal day 28 (P28) through P34 and then euthanized either 1 or 7 days later (on P35 or P42) to assess glutamate (GLU), glutamine, and GABA levels in intact tissue punches from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior striatum and hippocampus. In the mPFC, toluene reduced GLU 1 day after exposure, with no effect on GABA, while after 7 days, GLU was no longer affected but there was an increase in GABA levels. In the hippocampus, neither GABA nor GLU was altered 1 day after exposure, whereas 7 days after exposure, increases were observed in GABA and GLU. Striatal GLU and GABA levels measured after either 1 or 7 days were not altered after toluene exposure. These findings show that 1 week of binge toluene inhalation selectively alters these neurotransmitters in the mPFC and hippocampus in adolescent rats, and that some of these effects endure at least 1 week after the exposure. The results suggest that age-dependent, differential neurochemical responses to toluene may contribute to the unique behavioral patterns associated with drug abuse among older children and young teens.
