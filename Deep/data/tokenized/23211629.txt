Resveratrol is indicated to be involved in neuroprotection and anti-inflammation in epileptic rats. The molecular mechanism is still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of resveratrol in nuclear factor-kappa B associated inflammatory responses induced by status epilepticus. Our data showed that seizures activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), increased the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B and promoted the expressions of inflammatory molecules including inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1beta. Futhermore, resveratrol significantly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B and the production of proinflammatory molecules via mTOR pathway. Additionally, we also proved that the inhibition of mTOR signal by resveratrol was mostly attributed to AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation. Altogether, our results suggest that resveratrol suppresses inflammatory responses induced by seizures partially via AMPK/mTOR pathway.
