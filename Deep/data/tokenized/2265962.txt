The present study was aimed to identify peculiarities of the polypeptide composition in three morphofunctionally different classes of neurons of the rat brainstem: giant multipolar neurons of n. reticularis gigantocellularis, relay sensory neurons of lateral geniculate body and pyramidal neurons of the pyramidal layer of the CA3 - CA4 fields of hippocampus. The method of free hand dissection of neurons and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) slab gel microelectrophoresis in our modifications were used. Polypeptide peculiarities for each class of investigated neurons have been found. Most of these polypeptides belong to the low molecular weight range (8.8-24.3 KD) of the polypeptide spectra and only some of them to the high one (64.6-75.3 KD).
