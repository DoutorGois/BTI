Chronic lymphocytic inflammation with pontine perivascular enhancement responsive to steroids (CLIPPERS) is an inflammatory central nervous system disorder that mainly involves in the brainstem, basal ganglia and cerebellum. We herein report the case of a patient with CLIPPERS, which was diagnosed based on the clinical and radiological features. After initially responded to steroid treatment, the patient developed limbic encephalitis. The patient presented with memory disturbance, a delirious state and emotional incontinence. A cerebrospinal fluid study revealed interleukin-6 elevation and enhanced bilateral hippocampal lesions were observed on MRI. The patient was successfully treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy. This is the first case of CLIPPERS with limbic encephalitis involving the bilateral hippocampus.
