The effects of hippocampal lesions on the processing and retention of visual and spatial information in birds and mammals is reviewed. Both birds and mammals with damage to the hippocampus are severely impaired on a variety of spatial tasks, such as navigation, maze learning, and the retention of spatial information. In contrast, both birds and mammals with damage to the hippocampus are not impaired on a variety of visual tasks, such as delayed matching-to-sample, concurrent discrimination, or retention of a visual discrimination. In addition, both birds and mammals with hippocampal damage display impairments in the acquisition of an autoshaped response, as well as alterations in response suppression. These findings suggest that the avian hippocampus is a functional homologue of the mammalian hippocampus, and that in both birds and mammals the hippocampus is important for the processing and retention of spatial, rather than purely visual information.
