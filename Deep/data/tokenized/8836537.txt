Bath application of L-fucose and 2-fucosyllactose (2FI) increases the potentiation of the population spike amplitude (POP-spike) and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) after tetanization of the Schaffer collaterals of the rat hippocampus. The ineffective isomers D-fucose and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FI) have no such effect. Since not only the maintenance of long-term potentiation LTP is influenced but also its induction is drastically improved, an effect of the sugars via the formation of glycoproteins but also via different actions on induction mechanisms is discussed.
