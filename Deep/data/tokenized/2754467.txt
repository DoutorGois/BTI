1. The dentate gyrus was activated by trains of stimulation to either the contralateral CA3 region or the ipsilateral angular bundle. Responses were monitored with recordings of extracellular field potentials and extracellular potassium ([K+]o. Maximal dentate activation was identified by the appearance of bursts of large-amplitude (20-40 mV) population spikes associated with a secondary rise in [K+]o and an abrupt negative shift of the DC potential. 2. Several parameters were defined to characterize features of maximal dentate activation. These included 1) time to onset of maximal dentate activation, 2) duration of maximal dentate activation, 3) stimulus threshold for maximal dentate activation, 4) threshold for afterdischarge production, and 5) afterdischarge durations. The time to onset of maximal dentate activation and the duration of maximal dentate activation depended on the stimulus intensity until, above a certain stimulus intensity, both parameters reached constant values. The total period of maximal dentate activation (during both stimulation and afterdischarge) was constant. 3. The characteristics of maximal dentate activation were then determined in kindled animals and compared with age-matched controls. Kindled animals had a significant increase in the total duration of maximal dentate activation and a decrease in the ratio of afterdischarge threshold to the threshold for maximal dentate activation to 1 from a ratio in control animals of 6. 4. In a set of urethan-anesthetized animals, the characteristics of maximal dentate activation before and after 36 stimuli were determined. One hour after the last of 36 stimulus-evoked seizures, there was a trend towards a decrease in the threshold for maximal dentate activation and in the time to its onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
