Nerve growth factor (NGF) decreases degeneration of cholinergic neurons, improves memory loss, and increases long-term potentiation and learning tasks. Therefore, NGF mimetics or NGF inducers may be important targets for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. Traditionally, Gongjin-dan (GJD) has been used clinically for the treatment of central nervous system disorders. In this study, we examined the effects of GJD on NGF mimetic activity in PC12 cells and the induction of NGF secretion in primary astrocytes. Moreover, we also measured neuron survival by MAP-2 staining in an immobilization stress rat model and induction of long-term potentiation by the MEA system in rat hippocampus slices treated with dexamethasone. The behavioral syndrome by novel object test was also performed in mice. GJD increased neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and NGF secretion in primary astrocytes. Also, it reduced neuronal cell death and increased long-term potentiation in the rat hippocampus. Moreover, the number of entries, the time spent and the distance moved in the center area of the test region by the mice was increased by oral administration of GJD in comparison with the distance moved over the total area. These data suggest that administration of GJD may improve memory and learning tasks via NGF regulation, and that it may have a potential for multiple function neuroprotection via NGF regulation.
