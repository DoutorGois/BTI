The hippocampus has sometimes been proposed to function as a cognitive map, a memory system that stores information about allocentric space. Work with experimental animals and memory-impaired patients has raised difficulties with this view by showing that the hippocampus is not performing an exclusively spatial function. However, the possibility has remained that the hippocampus plays a special role in spatial memory or a disproportionately large role in spatial memory compared to other kinds of memory. This study compared spatial and nonspatial memory in amnesic patients with lesions of the hippocampal formation or diencephalon. Subjects studied an array of 16 toy objects and were subsequently tested for object recall, object recognition, and memory for the location of the objects. Control subjects were tested after long retention intervals in order to equate their object memory performance with that of the patients. The main finding was that, when the performance of amnesic patients on the object memory tests was matched to the object memory performance of control subjects, spatial memory performance of the amnesic patients also matched the spatial memory performance of the control subjects. The results were the same for the two groups of patients. These findings suggest that the hippocampus is not especially involved in spatial memory. Spatial memory is simply one instance of a broader category of memory that requires the hippocampus. While cognitive mapping in its most abstract sense may describe hippocampal function, our results support alternative formulation, suggesting that the hippocampus is necessary for the rapid acquisition of relational, configural, or declarative (as opposed to purely spatial) information.
