Food-procuring conditioned reaction was elaborated in rats. A single injection of carbacholine into the dorsal area of the hippocampus elicited prolonged (for several days) stable amnesia, during which elaboration of a second habit in the same animals proved possible. After cessation of the agent action, the initially elaborated conditioned reaction recurred. The obtained results allow to interpret the amnesia elicited by injection of carbacholine into the hippocampus as a dissociated state.
