The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic efficacy of lithium in affective disorders are poorly understood; however, previous studies have established an influence of lithium on receptor-coupled and postreceptor signal transduction mechanisms, including the transcription factor c-fos. We investigated the effect of chronic lithium on basal, stress-, muscarinic-, and haloperidol-induced c-fos mRNA expression in various rat brain regions. Chronic lithium produced significant reductions in basal c-fos expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, confirming our previous report. Stress-induced c-fos was significantly attenuated in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and pituitary, was increased in the occipital cortex, and unchanged in the hypothalamus by chronic lithium. Pilocarpine-induced c-fos was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex and hippocampus by chronic lithium, but was enhanced in the occipital cortex and hypothalamus. Haloperidol-induced c-fos was augmented in the striatum and pituitary, but reduced in the frontal cortex by chronic lithium treatment. In regions in which haloperidol did not induce fos expression in control animals, fos levels after haloperidol were reduced after chronic lithium. One week after discontinuation of the lithium treatment, basal c-fos levels remained significantly lower in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, whereas the effects of stress, pilocarpine, or haloperidol on fos were normalized in most regions, except in the hippocampus, where the attenuated fos response to injection stress persisted. We suggest that repression of basal fos expression and inhibition and activation of inducible fos may be factors to be considered in the longer-term effects of lithium, leading to changes in expression of genes that regulate fos and are regulated by Fos, and ultimately to alterations in the functional activity of neural systems involved in the pathophysiology of affective disorder.
