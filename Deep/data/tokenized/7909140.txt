The excitatory amino acids (EAAs) L-aspartate and L-glutamate constitute the major neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain. This study established the influence of aging and oxidative stress on the release and uptake of EAAs. The high affinity uptake of D-[3H]aspartate in synaptosomal fractions of the neostriatum, hippocampus, and neocortex was not significantly different in Fisher 344/Norwegian Brown hybrid rats aged 3, 12, 24, and 37 months. Similarly, the K(+)-evoked efflux of endogenous aspartate and glutamate from neocortical minislices was also unaffected by age. To examine the possibility that EAA nerve terminals become more vulnerable to oxidative stress with age, the influence of an inhibitor of the electron transport chain (sodium cyanide) on EAA uptake and release was determined. Although cyanide inhibited D-[3H]aspartate uptake and potentiated the potassium-evoked efflux of aspartate and glutamate in a Ca(2+)-independent fashion, neither of these changes were influenced by age. Thus, the functional integrity of EAA nerve terminals and their vulnerability to oxidative stress are both preserved in normal aging. The potency of cyanide to inhibit D-[3H]aspartate uptake did, however, display regional variability: hippocampus > neocortex > neostriatum (IC50 = 1.2 +/- 0.2 mM, 1.9 +/- 0.1 mM and 2.7 +/- 0.2 mM, respectively), suggesting that EAA nerve terminals in the hippocampus may be selectively vulnerable to oxidative stress.
