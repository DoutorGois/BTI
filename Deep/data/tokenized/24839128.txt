Hypochondroplasia (HCH) is a genetic skeletal dysplasia, inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. About 50-70% of HCH patients have a mutation in FGFR3 gene and in the majority of cases it is a de novo mutation. Recent magnetic resonance imaging studies on relative large cohorts of HCH patients have showed a central nervous system involvement with a high incidence of characteristic temporal lobe and hippocampal abnormalities. To the best of our knowledge, this report shows the first magnetic resonance imaging prenatal detection of characteristic brain anomalies in a case of HCH, molecularly confirmed through postnatal FGFR3 analysis.
