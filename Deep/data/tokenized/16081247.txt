Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein has an important role in the migration, correct positioning and maturation of neurons during development. Though it is generally down-regulated in the postnatal period, expression of this large glycoprotein continues in the adult brain in some cell populations. In the present study, we examined the distribution of reelin-immunoreactivity (-ir) in the hippocampal formation of 9-month-old wildtype mice (WT). Then, reelin-ir in normal mice was compared to that of transgenic mice (APP/PS1) carrying mutated human APP and PS1 genes, which are linked to the familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The APP/PS1 mice were additionally burdened with a second risk factor for AD, namely depletion of circulating gonadal hormones by ovariectomy (APP/PS1 + OVX). The analyses revealed that in adult WT reelin-ir is expressed by Cajal-Retzius cells and a subgroup of interneurons throughout the hippocampal formation. In addition, layer II projection neurons in the lateral entorhinal subfields are reelin-ir. Interestingly, ovariectomy decreases the number of reelin-ir cells in the hilus in WT mice, whereas AD-related genotype alone induces only a non-significant reduction. Unexpectedly, additional stress, e.g., depletion of gonadal hormones, does not aggravate the slight reduction in the reelin cell number in the APP/PS1 mice. We propose that the changes in normal reelin-ir are linked to disturbances in repair mechanisms in which APP/PS1 and gonadal hormones are involved and which are perturbed in neurodegenerative conditions, namely AD.
