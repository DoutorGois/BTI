The transport of L-[3H]glutamate into crude synaptosomal membrane fractions prepared from cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, cortex, striatum, and midbrain was characterized. In all brain regions, greater than 95% of the accumulation of radiolabel was sodium-dependent and the concentration-dependence was consistent with a single high affinity site. Dihydrokainate and L-alpha-aminoadipate were region specific inhibitors of uptake; this inhibition was consistent with a competitive mechanism. In the forebrain regions examined, dihydrokainate inhibited transport with IC50s of approx. 100 microM (range from 80 to 170 microM). Transport in cerebellum was essentially dihydrokainate-insensitive L-alpha-Aminoadipate inhibited transport in forebrain regions with IC50s of approx. 700 microM (range from 590 to 800 microM) and inhibited transport in cerebellum with an IC50 of 40 microM. The inhibition data obtained with forebrain and cerebellar tissues were consistent with nearly homogeneous (greater than 80%) populations of non-interacting sites. Inhibition data obtained with tissue prepared from brainstem were best fit to a mixture of the two sites (35-50% of the type observed in cerebellum). Other previously identified uptake inhibitors, including DL-threo-hydroxyaspartate, L-aspartate-beta-hydroxamate, beta-glutamate, and L-cysteine sulfinate were not selective for the two types of transport. These data demonstrate that there are two pharmacologically distinct sodium-dependent high affinity transport systems with heterogeneous regional distributions.
