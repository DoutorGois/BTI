Cell-and explantatcultures from hippocampal region of embryonal rats and newborn rats were cultivated up to 4 weeks. Pyramidal neurons, multiformed neurons and granule cells were observed in the explantatcultures. In the cellcultures were observed small and big Neurons after 4 weeks in vitro. Mantenance and differentiation of cellcultures are possible only by showing in at least 60 000 cells/ml. The Morphology of neurons in vitro was related to in vivo.
