A total of 27 right-handed patients aged 7-30 years with diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were studied using standard MRI scans. Of these, 14 were aged below 13 years. The volumes of the lateral ventricles were measured using T1-weighted MRI images of sagittal sections of the brain to a precision of 3 mm3. External head sizes were also measured to allow ventricle volumes to be normalized. All patients underwent complex neuropsychological investigations. Memory was assessed, along with visual, auditory, tactile, and spatial recognition functions and the motor and speech spheres. Test data were assessed in terms of the severity of impairments associated with one brain structure or another on a tenpoint scale. Assessment points were summed for each hemisphere, for the "first area" (cortical structures), and all structures for statistical analysis. Neuropsychological testing revealed functional impairments predominantly of the frontal areas of the hemispheres, the hippocampus, and the reticular formation. Neuropsychological deficits were least linked with alterations in the postcentral and parietal areas of the cortex. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the normalized left lateral ventricle volume and the degree of neuropsychological impairments (r = 0.5127 at p = 0.0063) for the whole study group. The correlation was more marked on comparison of the normalized left ventricular volume and the severity of neuropsychological impairments related to the left hemisphere (r = 0.6303 at p = 0.0004). A relationship was seen between the volume of the intraventricular space and cortical functional impairments (r = 0.5071 at p = 0.0069) in patients less than 13 years old. A relationship between ventricular volume and linear head size was confirmed (r = 0.5759 at p = 0.0017), which was more marked in subjects less than 13 years old (r = 0.6833 at p = 0.01).
