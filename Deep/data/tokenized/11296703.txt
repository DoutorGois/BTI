Bilateral lesion of the striatum delayed time conditioning in rats, induced anxiety, rearranged normal correlation between the anxiety level and autochronometrical ability. These shifts progressed along with an augmentation of the striatum lesion extent. Combined striat- and hippocampectomy as well as the latter alone resulted in a complete absence of time counting learning irrespective of the brain lesion extent. In these animals anxiety was also more obvious.
