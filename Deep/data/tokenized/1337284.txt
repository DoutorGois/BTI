Recordings of synaptic population responses, post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) were made from area CA1 in hippocampal slices from ad libitum-fed rats at about 2 and 24 months of age, and also in animals at about 24 months of age that had been restricted to 60% of the caloric intake of control animals since weaning. Both PTP and LTP were greatly reduced in the old ad-lib animals. Calorically-restricted rats at about 24 months of age showed hippocampal responses with initial peak amplitudes more like those of 2-month controls than the ad-lib animals at 24 months. These observations suggest that calorie restriction preserves nervous-system functions, including indicators of plasticity such as LTP, which are otherwise lost in aging.
