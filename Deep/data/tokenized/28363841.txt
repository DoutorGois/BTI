AIM: In recent studies, it has been shown that the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin-2 Channels (TRPM2) and Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) inhibitors may have a protective effect on neurons. This study was aimed to investigate the protective effect of TRPM2 and PLA2 inhibitor N-(p-amylcinnamoyl) Anthranilic Acid (ACA) in a neurodegenerative model induced by Okadaic Acid (OKA). MAIN METHODS: OKA (200ng/10mul) was administered bilateral intracerebroventricularly as a single injection. KEY FINDINGS: OKA-treated rats showed significant impairments of spatial memory in Morris Water Maze Test. OKA-induced memory-impaired rats showed increased numbers of degenerated neurons and Caspase-3, tau phosphorylated ser396, beta-amyloid positive cells in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Furthermore, OKA-treated rats exhibited significantly increased MDA, TNF-alpha levels, and decreased SOD, GSH-PX enzyme activates and GSH levels of the tissues. ACA administration ameliorated OKA-induced memory impairment in rats. The ACA treatment also increased SOD and GSH-PX enzyme activation and GSH levels, and conversely decreased the levels of MDA, TNF-alpha. It was found that the numbers of the degenerated neurons and Caspase-3 positive cells of cortex and hippocampus regions were significantly reduced. SIGNIFICANCE: ACA administration attenuates the oxidative stress and neuroinflammation of OKA-induced neurodegeneration; and ameliorates the cognitive decline and neurodegeneration.
