Astrocytomas involving the limbic system are usually unilateral in nature. We report a very unusual case where a low-grade astrocytoma originating in the left temporal lobe spread to the right hippocampus through the hippocampal commissure to cause disabling amnesia and seizures. Some improvement in the memory deficit was facilitated by identification of complex partial status epilepticus. EEG should be performed in all patients with lesions of the limbic system and neuropsychological problems if ongoing seizure activity is not to be missed.
