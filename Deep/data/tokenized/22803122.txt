We performed morphological analysis of the structure of rat hippocampus after ablation of the left sensorimotor cortex. Four experimental groups were formed: two control groups (intravenous and intracerebral injections of the culture medium) and two experimental groups (intravenous and intracerebral transplantation of MSC). Ten weeks after surgery, disturbed cytoarchitectonics and great number of dead neurons were found in all zones of the hippocampus in animals of the control groups. In animals receiving cell therapy, no pathological changes in the structure of the hippocampus were found: hyperchromatic neurons were absent and the cells had regular shape and closely adjoined to each other.
