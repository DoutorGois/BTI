Timm's staining material has been detected in the rat hippocampus as early as day 1 postnatally. However, staining was diffuse and widespread and light granulation was observed only in the mossy fiber layer. By day 6 postnatally most diffuse staining had disappeared and the characteristic pattern of granulation had intensified in the mossy fiber layer. Pronounced staining of the mossy fibers became apparent from day 6.Electron microscopic autoradiography indicated that(65)Zn injected intraperitoneally into suckling pups became localized largely in the axons and axon terminals of the mossy fiber layer in the CA3 and CA4 regions of the Horn of Ammon.In vitro studies with hippocampal slices have demonstrated that zinc is accumulated by an active transport system, but the kinetic characteristics of this uptake do not appear to alter with age. Zinc located intracellularly in the hippocampus appears to be associated mainly with large molecular weight ligands, with more than 75% of newly acquired zinc being bound to substances having molecular weights greater than 70,000 Daltons.
