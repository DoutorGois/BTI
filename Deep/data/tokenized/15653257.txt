Administration of phencyclidine (PCP) to both humans and animals models the symptoms of schizophrenia. Brain concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) are reduced in this disease, reflecting neuronal dysfunction. This study investigates the effects in rats of a chronic intermittent regime of PCP on NAA and its precursor N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) in rat frontal and temporal cortex, hippocampus and striatum, determined by HPLC. We found significant PCP-induced deficits of NAA and NAAG only in the temporal cortex; NAAG was significantly elevated in the hippocampus. These changes closely reflect postmortem findings reported in schizophrenia.
