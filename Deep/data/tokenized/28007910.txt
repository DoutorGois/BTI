GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of lysosomal storage disorders which include Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease. Dysregulation of glutamate receptors has been recently postulated in the pathology of Sandhoff disease. Glutamate receptor association with neuronal pentraxins 1 and 2, and the neuronal pentraxin receptor facilitates receptor potentiation and synaptic shaping. In this study, we have observed an upregulation of a novel form of neuronal pentraxin 1 (NP1-38) in the brains of a mouse model of Sandhoff disease and Tay-Sachs disease. In order to determine the impact of NP1 on the pathophysiology of Sandhoff disease mouse models, we have generated an Np1-/-Hexb-/- double knockout mouse, and observed extended lifespan, improved righting reflex and enhanced body condition relative to Hexb-/- mice, with no effect on gliosis or apoptotic markers in the CNS. Sandhoff mouse brain slices reveals a reduction in AMPA receptor-mediated currents, and increased variability in total glutamate currents in the CA1 region of the hippocampus; Np1-/-Hexb-/- mice show a correction of this phenotype, suggesting NP1-38 may be interfering with glutamate receptor function. Indeed, some of the psychiatric aspects of Sandhoff and Tay-Sachs disease (particularly late onset) may be attributed to a dysfunctional hippocampal glutamatergic system. Our work highlights a potential role for synaptic proteins, such as NP1 and glutamate receptors in lysosomal storage diseases.
