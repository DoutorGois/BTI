AIMS: Previous studies have shown that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) stimulates glutamate release from hippocampal neurons. The present study was designed to understand the mechanism underlying S1P-induced spontaneous glutamate release from mossy fiber terminals in the hippocampus. MAIN METHODS: Slice patches were made from three different regions of neurons in rat hippocampal slices, and spontaneous alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (AMPA-mEPSCs) were monitored. KEY FINDINGS: Inhibitors of sphingosine kinase such as dimethylsphingosine (DMS) and 2-(p-hydroxyanilino)-4-(p-chlorophenyl) thiazole (HACPT), to suppress endogenous S1P production, significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous AMPA-mEPSCs elicited from CA3 pyramidal neurons, but not CA1 pyramidal neurons or dentate granular neurons. A similar decrease was also obtained with VPC23019, an inhibitor of S1P receptors, suramin, an inhibitor of S1P(3) receptor, U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, or GF109203X, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present study show that endogenous S1P regulates spontaneous glutamate release in a restricted hippocampal area, i.e., the release from mossy fiber terminals, via S1P(3) receptors linked to G(q) protein. This may represent fresh insight into the regulatory mechanism of spontaneous transmitter release.
