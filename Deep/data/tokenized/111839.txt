Systematic (i. p.) or intra-amygdaloid injections of kainic acid elicit typical generalised convulsive seizures with typical electrographic correlates. Depending on the survival time and the amount of neurotoxin administered, secondary pathological damage is invariably found in various brain structures removed from the injection site such as various hippocompal fields, midline thalamic nuclei and neocortical layers III and VI. Various lines of evidence are reported which suggest that the secondary pathological damage is not due to the spread of the neurotoxin but to the epileptic status it induces.
