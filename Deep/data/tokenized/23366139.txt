Neural decoding is an important approach for extracting information from population codes. We previously proposed a novel transductive neural decoding paradigm and applied it to reconstruct the rat's position during navigation based on unsorted rat hippocampal ensemble spiking activity. Here, we investigate several important technical issues of this new paradigm using one data set of one animal. Several extensions of our decoding method are discussed.
