The deposition of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in senile plaques and cerebral Abeta-amyloid angiopathy can be seeded in beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP)-transgenic mice by the intracerebral infusion of brain extracts containing aggregated Abeta. Previous studies of seeded beta-amyloid induction have used relatively short incubation periods to dissociate seeded beta-amyloid induction from endogenous beta-amyloid deposition of the host, thus precluding the analysis of the impact of age and extended incubation periods on the instigation and spread of Abeta lesions in brain. In the present study using R1.40 APP-transgenic mice (which do not develop endogenous Abeta deposition up to 15 months of age) we show that: (1) seeding at 9 months of age does not induce more Abeta deposition than seeding at 3 months of age, provided that the incubation period (6 months) is the same; and (2) very long-term (12 months) incubation after a focal application of the seed results in the emergence of Abeta deposits throughout the forebrain. These findings indicate that the presence of Abeta seeds, and not the age of the host per se, is critical to the initiation of Abeta aggregation in the brain, and that Abeta deposition, actuated in one brain area, eventually spreads throughout the brain.
