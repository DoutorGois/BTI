The purpose of this research was an assessment of MAP2 immunoreactivity in hippocampal neurons after administration of toxic doses of dexamethasone. Experiments were led on Albino-Swiss mouse males. The obtained results indicate that dexamethasone causes significant decrease of MAP2 immunoreactivity in hippocampal nerve cells of the CA3 region. Our results show damage of neuronal cytoskeleton in this area of the brain.
