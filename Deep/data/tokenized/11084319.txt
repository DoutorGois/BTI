In recent years we have learned a great deal about the molecular mechanisms underlying axonal elongation and navigation and the manner in which extracellular signals modify a growth cone's course of action. Yet, the mechanisms responsible for the earlier events of axonal and dendritic generation are just beginning to be understood. The recent advances in this exciting field highlight the importance of studies of cell migration and axonal elongation for our current understanding of the establishment of neuronal polarity.
