Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1-receptor blocker (ARBs), has been reported to exert beneficial effects on the central nervous system (CNS). However, the effect of telmisartan on cognitive impairment associated with type 1 diabetes is not well known. Here, we examined the possibility that telmisartan could improve memory function in a type 1 diabetic mouse model, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. STZ-induced diabetic mice subjected to the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task exhibited a significant decline of spatial learning and memory. Oral administration of telmisartan at two nonhypotensive doses (0.7 or 0.35 mg/kg) significantly improved memory deficits in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Telmisartan treatment markedly reduced Abeta(4)(2), APP, BACE1, RAGE, and NF-kappaB p65 of the hippocampus and cortex, but did not beneficially affect hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia in the STZ-induced diabetic mice compared with untreated diabetic mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that telmisartan ameliorates memory deficits in type 1 diabetic mice, at least partly because of attenuation of amyloidosis in the brain.
