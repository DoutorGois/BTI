AIM: To study the blockade of paeoniflorin (Pae) on I(Na) in the acutely isolated hippocampus neurons of mice. METHODS: The whole-cell patch clamp technique was used. RESULTS: Pae inhibited I(Na) in frequency-dependent and concentration-dependent manners, with an IC50 of 271 micromol/L. Pae 0.3 mmol/L shifted the activation potential of the maximal I(Na) from -40 mV to -30 mV, shifted the steady-state activation and inactivation curves toward more positive and negative potentials by 10.8 mV, and 18.2 mV, respectively, and postponed the recovery of I(Na) inactivation state from (4.2+/-0.7) ms to (9.8+/-1.2) ms. CONCLUSION: Pae inhibited I(Na) in mouse hippocampus neurons.
