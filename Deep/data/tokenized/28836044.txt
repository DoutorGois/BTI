Neurogenesis occurs during the embryonic period and ceases soon after birth in the neocortex, but continues to occur in the hippocampus even in the adult. The embryonic neocortex has radial glia or progenitor cells expressing brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP), whereas the adult hippocampus has radial granule progenitor cells expressing BLBP and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the subgranular zone. We previously found that embryonic hippocampal granule progenitor cells express GFAP, but not BLBP, indicating that these cells are different from both embryonic neocortical and adult granule progenitor cells. In the present study, as the first step towards understanding the mechanism of persistent hippocampal neurogenesis, we aimed to determine the stage at which embryonic-type granule progenitors become adult-type progenitors using mouse Gfap-GFP transgenic mice. During the embryonic stages, Gfap-GFP-positive (Gfap-GFP+) cells were distributed in the entire developing dentate gyrus (DG), whereas BLBP-positive (BLBP+) cells were mainly present in the fimbria and subpial region, and to some extent in the DG. Up to postnatal day 0 (P0), double-positive cells were scarcely detected. However, at P1, one-third of the Gfap-GFP+ cells in the DG suddenly began to weakly express BLBP. Thereafter, Gfap-GFP+/BLBP+ cells rapidly increased in number, and extended their radial processes in the inner granular cell layer. At P14 and in the adult, two-thirds of the Gfap-GFP+ cells in the subgranular zone showed BLBP immunoreactivity. These results suggest that the properties of hippocampal granule progenitor cells are rapidly altered from an embryonic to adult type soon after birth.
