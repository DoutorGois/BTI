Memory is sensitive to the short-acting anesthetic (2,6-diisopropylphenol) propofol, but the underlying mechanism is little known. Here, we have examined the effects of propofol on synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. We found that low dose of propofol (20 mg/kg, i.p.) did not affect the basal transmission, but enhanced prominently the development of long-term depression (LTD) and impaired the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP). The impairment of LTP maintenance and enhancement of LTD development may contribute to propofol-induced deficits in memory following propofol anesthesia.
