The present study describes the specific two-stage mechanism that intensifies blood supply to the brain area comprising amygdala, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, entorhinal cortex, and neocortex (AHBC). Cholinergic neurons from the nuclei of basal forebrain induce vasodilatory effect through release of acetylcholine. In physiological aging the efficacy of this neuronal system declines, while intensive formation of amyloidogenic peptides starts. These peptides at low, picomolar concentrations activate alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, thus enhancing angiogenesis and in so doing restoring blood supply to the AHBC area.
