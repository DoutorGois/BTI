On the model of shortly delayed defensive conditioned reflex in cats, it was shown in acute experiments that pharmacologically elicited change of NA system activity (clonidine, 0.2 and 1.5 mg/kg intravenously) and of DA system activity (apomorphine, 3 mg/kg intravenously) leads to a definite manifestation of electrographic correlates of memory trace, i.e. of conditioned evoked potential (EP) in examined brain structures, as well as of conditioned neurographic response (CNR) and conditioned skin-galvanic reaction (SGR). The increase of the NA system activity causes a rise of the number of conditioned EPs in the reticular formation, hippocampus and preoptic area along with an enhancement of CNR reproduction. The increase of the DA system activity contributes to the appearance of conditioned EPs in the hippocampus, amygdalar complex and central gray matter, together with an enhancement of the reproduction of conditioned SGR.
