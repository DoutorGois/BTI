Ortho- and antidromic responses recovered and remained robust for 5 h in slices exposed to transient hypoxia in low calcium, while responses remained depressed in slices made hypoxic in normal calcium. Elevating magnesium in addition to reducing calcium did not improve recovery compared to reducing calcium alone. Spreading depression-like hypoxic depolarization occurred earlier in low calcium than in control fluid. We conclude that loss of function was triggered by calcium uptake by neurons and not by cell swelling, and that activation of NMDA receptors probably played no part.
