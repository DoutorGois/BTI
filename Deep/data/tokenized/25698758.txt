The medial temporal lobe is implicated as a key brain region involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and consequent memory loss. Tau tangle aggregation in this region may develop concurrently with cortical Abeta deposition in preclinical AD, but the pathological relationship between tau and Abeta remains unclear. We used task-free fMRI with a focus on the medical temporal lobe, together with Abeta PET imaging, in cognitively normal elderly human participants. We found that cortical Abeta load was related to disrupted intrinsic functional connectivity of the perirhinal cortex, which is typically the first brain region affected by tauopathies in AD. There was no concurrent association of cortical Abeta load with cognitive performance or brain atrophy. These findings suggest that dysfunction in the medial temporal lobe may represent a very early sign of preclinical AD and may predict future memory loss.
