We investigated the trace eyeblink conditioning in decerebrate guinea pigs to elucidate the possible role of the cerebellum and brainstem in this hippocampus-dependent task. A 350-ms tone conditioned stimulus was paired with a 100-ms periorbital shock unconditioned stimulus with a trace interval of either 0, 100, 250 or 500 ms. Decerebrate animals readily acquired the conditioned response with a trace interval of 0 or 100 ms. Even in the paradigm with a 500-ms trace interval, which is known to depend critically on the hippocampus in all animal species examined, the decerebrate guinea pigs acquired the conditioned response, which had adaptive timing as well as in the other paradigms with a shorter trace interval. However, it took many more trials to learn in the 500-ms trace paradigm than in the shorter trace interval paradigms, and the conditioned response expression was unstable from trial to trial. When decerebrate animals were conditioned step by step with a trace interval of 100, 250 and 500 ms, sequentially, they easily acquired the adaptive conditioned response to a 500-ms trace interval. However, the frequency of conditioned responses decreased after the trace interval was shifted from 250 ms to 500 ms, which was not observed after the shift from 100 ms to 250 ms. These results suggest that the cerebellum and brainstem could maintain the 'trace' of the conditioned stimulus and associate it with the unconditioned stimulus even in the 500-ms trace paradigm, but that the forebrain might be required for facilitating and stabilizing the association.
