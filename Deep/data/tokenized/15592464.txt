Oscillatory spike timing in the hippocampus is regarded as a temporal coding mechanism for space, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To contrast the predictions of the different models of phase precession, we transiently turned off neuronal discharges for up to 250 ms and reset the phase of theta oscillations by stimulating the commissural pathway in rats. After recovery from silence, phase precession continued. The phase of spikes for the first theta cycle after the perturbation was more advanced than the phase of spikes for the last theta cycle just before the perturbation. These findings indicate that phase advancement that emerges within hippocampal circuitry may be updated at the beginning of each theta cycle by extrahippocampal inputs.
