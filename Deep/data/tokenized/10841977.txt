Application of bicuculline (20 microm) in a horizontal slice preparation of the rat limbic system induced epileptiform discharges ('bursts') that spread from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). These bursts were time locked, with the CA3-CA2 regions discharging first at a 0.1+/-0. 008Hz (n=30 slices) frequency, followed after 27+/-3 ms by the superficial layers of the EC and after 44.3+/-3 ms by the BLA. Application of 50 microM noradrenaline (NA) for 4 min reduced the burst frequency to 40% of its initial value. Pharmacological study of NA action on burst frequency revealed that it consisted of a beta adrenoreceptor-mediated increase and an alpha(2) adrenoreceptor-mediated decrease of epileptiform bursting frequency.
