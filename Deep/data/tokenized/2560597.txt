The distribution of choline acetyltransferase- and gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunoreactivity as well as acetylcholinesterase-, gamma-aminobutyrci acid-transaminase- and monoaminooxidase-positive structures in the basal forebrain, hippocampal formation and neocortex of young adult and aged rats was compared. The changes in the staining and density of the immuno- and histochemical positive nerve cells and fibers observed provide evidence for the involvement of different transmitters in normal ageing.
