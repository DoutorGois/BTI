Cocaine addiction is a disorder without diagnostic biomarkers or effective pharmacotherapy. Research on the glutamatergic system lacks longitudinal data starting before exposure to cocaine. We present findings in a rat model of cocaine self-administration that was followed-up longitudinally using the mGluR5 tracer (18)F-FPEB PET, 1H-MRS and behavioral tests. Methods: Forty-two Wistar rats were scanned with (18)F-FPEB PET and 1H-MRS before and after sucrose or IV cocaine self-administration, during withdrawal and relapse. All animals performed a rodent Iowa Gambling Task (rIGT) at baseline to evaluate decision-making. Baseline values were used in a mixed model to assess associations with later cocaine use and follow-up measurements were compared to the values before drug-exposure. Results: Pre-exposure rIGT scores was significantly related to both cocaine and sucrose use during the drug-exposure phase. However, only cocaine self-administration induced a decrease in (18)F-FPEB binding. This decrease was most pronounced in the bilateral hippocampus, where mGluR5 availability correlated with the amount of cocaine used during relapse. Compared to the sucrose group, a larger decrease was observed in the hippocampo-prefrontal cortex pathway. Pre-exposure glutamate and glycine concentrations in the prefrontal cortex were significantly associated with cocaine use during the drug-exposure phase. Moreover, prefrontal glutamate exhibited a distinct reversible decrease when animals had access to cocaine, but not sucrose. Conclusion: Baseline values of prefrontal glutamate and glycine are associated with future cocaine use. Furthermore, baseline rIGT scores are associated with both sucrose and cocaine. Finally, we found that both glutamate concentration and mGluR5 availability decrease during exposure to cocaine.
