We investigated the expression, activation, and distribution of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38s) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry in gerbil hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia to clarify the role of these kinases in delayed neuronal death (DND) in the CA1 subfield. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that activities of JNK, p38, and ERK in whole hippocampus were increased after 5 min of global ischemia. We used an immunohistochemical study to elucidate the temporal and spatial expression of these kinases after transient global ischemia. The immunohistochemical study showed that active JNK and p38 immunoreactivities were enhanced at 15 min of reperfusion and then gradually reduced and disappeared in the hippocampal CA1 region. On the other hand, in CA3 neurons, active JNK and p38 immunoreactivities were enhanced at 15 min of reperfusion and peaked at 6 hr of reperfusion and then gradually reduced but was continuously detected 72 hr after ischemia. Active ERK immunoreactivity was observed transiently in CA3 fibers and dentate gyrus. Pretreatment with SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, but not with PD98059, an ERK kinase 1/2 inhibitor, reduced ischemic cell death in the CA1 region after transient global ischemia by inhibiting the activity of p38. These findings indicate that the p38 pathway may play an important role in DND during brain ischemia in gerbil. Components of the pathway are important target molecules for clarifying the mechanism of neuronal death.
