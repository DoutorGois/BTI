Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph-2) is the key enzyme in serotonin biosynthesis. Serotonin is one of the main neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of various physiological functions and behavior patterns. The influence of chronic ethanol consumption on the expression of the Bdnf, Bax, Bcl-xL, and CASP3 genes was studied in the brain structures of B6-1473C (C/C) and B6-1473G (G/G) mice that had been obtained on the base of the C57BL/6 strain. The strains differed in the genotype for the C1473G single nucleotide polymorphism in the Tph-2 gene and in Tph-2 enzyme activity. It was found that chronic alcohol treatment led to a significant increase in the expression of the Bdnf gene in the midbrain of B6-1473G mice, but not in B6-1473capital ES, Cyrillic. Chronic alcohol treatment considerably decreased the expression of the ultimate brain apoptosis effector, caspase 3, in the frontal cortex, but increased it in the hippocampus of B6-1473G mice. At the same time, chronic ethanol administration reduced the level of the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL mRNA in the midbrain of B6-1473C mice. Thus, the C1473G polymorphism in the Tph-2 gene considerably influenced the changes in the expression patterns of genes involved in the regulation of neurogenesis and neural apoptosis induced by chronic ethanol treatment.
