Guanosine, a guanine-based purine, is an extracellular signaling molecule that is released from astrocytes and has been shown to promote central nervous system defenses in several in vivo and in vitro injury models. Our group recently demonstrated that guanosine exhibits glioprotective effects in the C6 astroglial cell line by associating the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway with protection against azide-induced oxidative stress. Astrocyte overactivation contributes to the triggering of brain inflammation, a condition that is closely related to the development of many neurological disorders. These cells sense and amplify inflammatory signals from microglia and/or initiate the release of inflammatory mediators that are strictly related to transcriptional factors, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB), that are modulated by HO-1. Astrocytes also express toll-like receptors (TLRs); TLRs specifically recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which has been widely used to experimentally study inflammatory response. This study was designed to understand the glioprotective mechanism of guanosine against the inflammatory and oxidative damage induced by LPS exposure in primary cultures of hippocampal astrocytes. Treatment of astrocytes with LPS resulted in deleterious effects, including the augmentation of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, NFkappaB activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased levels of oxygen/nitrogen species, and decreased levels of antioxidative defenses. Guanosine was able to prevent these effects, protecting the hippocampal astrocytes against LPS-induced cytotoxicity through activation of the HO-1 pathway. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory effects of guanosine were independent of the adenosinergic system. These results highlight the potential role of guanosine against neuroinflammatory-related diseases.
