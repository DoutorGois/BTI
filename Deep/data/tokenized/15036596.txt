The present study has characterized the cellular and temporal localization of the phospholipase D2 (PLD2) protein in the embryonic rat brain, using immunohistochemistry. PLD2 immunoreactivity was first observed in the choroid plexus and in the most ventricular zone of the lateral and third ventricles at embryonic day 15 (E15), followed by gradual restriction to the limited zone of ventricles at E20. In addition, PLD2 expression was high in the developing cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the cortex, PLD2 expression was observed in the marginal zone from the earliest stage (E15) and then declined and had completely disappeared by E20. Double-labelling studies demonstrated co-expression of the anti-class III beta-tubulin antibody in most of the PLD2 immunoreactive cells. Therefore, our findings suggest that PLD2 may be involved in early developmental processes of some neuronal progenitors.
