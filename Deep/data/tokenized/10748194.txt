Synaptic function requires proper localization of proteins at synaptic sites. Targeting of the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) relies on multiple signals within the protein, including twelve C-terminal amino acids. We now show that this C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95 mediates postsynaptic localization through a short tyrosine-based motif followed by a pair of hydrophobic amino acids. Consistent with a role in cellular trafficking, the tyrosine motif resembles the canonical motif for interactions with clathrin adaptor proteins. In fact, we find that the C-terminal targeting domain of PSD-95 is sufficient to mediate clathrin-dependent endocytosis when appended to a transmembrane protein. Furthermore, systematic mutagenesis reveals that endocytosis mediated by this domain depends on both the tyrosine motif and the dihydrophobic amino acid pair. Thus, postsynaptic targeting of PSD-95 requires a tyrosine-based signal that can mediate clathrin-coated vesicle formation.
