It has been demonstrated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in vitro, and in the dentate gyrus and CA1 region in vivo, that application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist, 1S, 3R-amino cyclopentane 2,3-dicarboxylic acid triggers a slow-onset potentiation of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. This study examined the involvement of group 1 and 2 mGluRs in this phenomenon in the CA1 region of freely moving rats. Drugs were applied via the lateral cerebral ventricle, and measurements were obtained from the CA1 region via permanently implanted electrodes. The group 1 mGluR agonists, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG, 20-100 nmol/5 microl) and trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (ADA, 100 nmol-1 micromol/5 microl) induced a dose-dependent potentiation of basal synaptic transmission. The mGluR antagonist R,S-alpha-methyl-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG, 1 micromol), and the group 1 mGluR antagonist, S-4-carboxyphenylglycine (4CPG, 100 nmol) completely inhibited the effects of both DHPG and ADA. The group 2 mGluR agonist, (S)-4-carboxy-3-hydroxy phenylglycine (4C3H-PG, 50-200 nmol/5 microl) induced a dose-dependent decrease of basal synaptic transmission. These results suggest that in the CA1 region in vivo, slow-onset potentiation may be mediated by group 1 mGluRs.
