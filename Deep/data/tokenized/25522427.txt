BACKGROUND: SKF83959 stimulates the phospholipase Cbeta/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway.
