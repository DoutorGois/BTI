Some forms of seizure activity can be stopped by gap junctional (GJ) blockade. Here, we found that GJ blockers attenuate hippocampal seizure activity induced by a novel seizuregenic protocol using Co(2+). We hypothesized that this activity may occur because of the altered expression of connexin (Cx) and/or pannexin (Panx) mRNAs and protein. We found a 1.5-, 1.4-, and 2-fold increase in Panx1, Panx2, and Cx43 mRNAs, respectively. Significant post-translational modifications of the proteins Cx43 and Panx1 were also observed after the Co(2+) treatment. No changes were observed in the presence of tetrodotoxin, indicating that seizure activity is required for these alterations in expression, rather than the Co(2+) treatment itself. Further analysis of the QPCR data showed that the Cx and Panx transcriptome becomes remarkably re-organized. Pannexin (Panxs 1 and 2) and glial connexin mRNA became highly correlated to one another; suggesting that these genes formed a transcriptomic network of coordinated gene expression, perhaps facilitating seizure induction. These data show that seizure activity up-regulates the expression of both glial and neuronal GJ mRNAs and protein while inducing a high degree of coordinate expression of the GJ transcriptome.
