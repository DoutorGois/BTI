Rats with lesions severing either the subcallosal fornix (Fo) or the medial half of the fimbria (Fi) were used. They were compared with control (Co) animals in a working memory task (serial alternation) and a reference memory task (cue-guided alternation). Neither task required spatial mapping strategy. Damaging the Fi, but not the Fo, caused a severe deficit in the serial alternation task. Analysis of individual performance revealed that Fi rats either adopted a "side strategy, " resulting in worse than chance performance. This active perseveration required intact working memory mechanism. In the cue-guided alternation task, Fo animals proved superior to Co and Fi rats. These findings are inconsistent with notions that the exclusive role of the hippocampus is spatial mapping or storing of recent memories. They indicate also differential involvement of the fimbria and fornix fibers in behavior.
