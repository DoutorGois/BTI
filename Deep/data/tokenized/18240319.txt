Long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy has proven a difficult phenomenon to examine in vivo, despite the ease with which it is induced in a variety of in vitro preparations. Prior exposure to an acute stressful episode does however seem to enhance the capacity of the hippocampus to exhibit LTD in vivo in male animals. In the present experiments, we examined the capacity for low-frequency stimuli (low-frequency stimulation (LFS)) to induce LTD in juvenile male and female animals following an acute stress episode. Interestingly, prior exposure to stress was only required for the induction of LTD in male animals, while both control and stressed female animals exhibited equivalent LTD. In animals that were exposed to ethanol in utero, a similar requirement for prior exposure to stress to elicit LTD was found for male, but not female animals. This prenatal ethanol exposure did not in itself alter the capacity for LTD induction in either sex; however, in utero food restriction did enhance LTD induction in both male and female animals, irrespective of whether they were exposed to stress just prior to being administered LFS. These results indicate that in utero dietary restriction more drastically affects CA1 LTD than in utero ethanol exposure. In addition, female animals seem to exhibit LTD in vivo in the absence of stress much more easily than their male counterparts.
