Previous studies involving exercise and memory showed that learning and memory were improved by exercise. This study was performed to find the effect of treadmill running on memory. Mid-term memory and swim speed were measured within 8 days. Twenty rats were divided into two groups, a control and a test group. Mid-term memory and swim speed were measured in the Morris water maze apparatus. Our results showed that treadmill running produced a significant enhancement on mid-term memory and swim speed in the test group, which may be mediated by specific molecular pathways.
