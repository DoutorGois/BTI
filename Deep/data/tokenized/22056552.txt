Impairments of cellular plasticity appear to underlie the pathophysiology of major depression. Recently, elevated levels of phosphorylated AMPA receptor were implicated in the antidepressant effect of various drugs. Here, we investigated the effects of an antidepressant, Tianeptine, on synaptic function and GluA1 phosphorylation using murine hippocampal slices and in vivo single-unit recordings. Tianeptine, but not imipramine, increased AMPA receptor-mediated neuronal responses both in vitro and in vivo, in a staurosporine-sensitive manner. Paired-pulse ratio was unaltered by Tianeptine, suggesting a postsynaptic site of action. Tianeptine, 10 muM, enhanced the GluA1-dependent initial phase of LTP, whereas 100 muM impaired the latter phases, indicating a critical role of GluA1 subunit phosphorylation in the excitation. Tianeptine rapidly increased the phosphorylation level of Ser(831)-GluA1 and Ser(845)-GluA1. Using H-89 and KN-93, we show that the activation of both PKA and CaMKII is critical in the effect of Tianeptine on AMPA responses. Moreover, the phosphorylation states of Ser(217/221)-MEK and Thr(183)/Tyr(185)-p42MAPK were increased by Tianeptine and specific kinase blockers of the MAPK pathways (PD 98095, SB 203580 and SP600125) prevented the effects of Tianeptine. Overall these data suggest that Tianeptine potentiates several signaling cascades associated with synaptic plasticity and provide further evidence that a major mechanism of action for Tianeptine is to act as an enhancer of glutamate neurotransmission via AMPA receptors.
