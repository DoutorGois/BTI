A causative role for nitric oxide has been postulated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods, we examined the effect of beta-amyloid plaques on nitric oxide-producing cells in transgenic mice which overexpress a mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP). In 14-month-old animals, nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-positive dystrophic neurites were observed frequently in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of all of 16 plaque-bearing transgenic animals and in none of 16 wild-type animals. Double labeling of NOS and beta-amyloid revealed that 90% of beta-amyloid plaques were associated with NOS-containing dystrophic neurites. In 7-month-old animals, beta-amyloid plaques were very rare, but those present were frequently associated with NOS-positive neuritic dystrophy. We conclude that beta-amyloid plaques induce neuritic dystrophy in cortical neurons containing NOS in this model of AD, and hypothesize that this finding may be relevant to the mechanism of beta-amyloid neurotoxicity in human AD.
