In the rat, there is a close relation between hippocampal theta rhythm and voluntary movements. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether motor deficits and subsequent recovery following cerebellar lesions may be accompanied by changes in hippocampal EEG. The results show that rats with severe motor dysfunctions displayed increased frequency of hippocampal theta that lasted beyond the recovery of motor deficits. Hippocampal theta that appeared along with gross automatic movements disappeared about 50 days postoperatively. The findings are discussed in terms of recovery of function and potential compensatory neural mechanisms.
