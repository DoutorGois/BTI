The following experiments were designed to determine if territorial stress, dietary sodium (Na), or the combination of stress and Na effect the rate of development of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR 4-18 wks) and if central catecholamines (C) were altered by these treatments. BP was significantly elevated from 2-8 weeks of stress treatment as compared to SHR controls. Norepinephrine (NE) levels in the nucleus tractus solitarius and amygdala (A), and dopamine (D) levels in the hippocampus and A showed significant elevations in the stressed group. High Na (3%) treatment combined with stress treatment produced an even further BP increase and elevated D levels in the amygdala, and elevated NE levels in the area postrema as compared to control SHR's. Selected brain C variables were able to correctly classify animals into high and low BP groups with 90-100% accuracy. Our data support the concept that there are important stress and Na effects upon brain neurochemistry which influence the development of hypertension in the SHR.
