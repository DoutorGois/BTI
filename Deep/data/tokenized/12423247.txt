Selective lesion of rat basal forebrain by the cholinergic immunotoxin 192IgG-saporin was used as an animal model to address the question of whether the changes in cortical glucose metabolism observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease may be related to impaired cholinergic transmission. At different times after creating the immunolesion, the isoenzyme pattern and steady-state mRNA levels of the key glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase were determined in cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain and nucleus caudatus. The loss of cholinergic input was accompanied by a persistent decrease in choline acetytransferase and acetylcholine esterase activities in the cortical target areas similar to the cholinergic malfunction seen in Alzheimer's dementia. The basal forebrain lesion induced by the immunotoxin resulted in a transient increase in phosphofructokinase activity peaking on day 7 after inducing the lesion in cortical areas. In parallel, an increased steady-state level of phosphofructokinase mRNA was determined by RT/real-time PCR and in situ hybridization. In contrast, analysis by western blotting and quantitative PCR revealed no changes in the phosphofructokinase isoenzyme pattern after immunolesion. It is concluded that common metabolic mechanisms may underlie the degenerative and repair processes in denervated rat brain and in the diseased Alzheimer's brain.
