The axons of dentate granule cells (mossy fibers) have been reported to appear in the regio superior (CA1) of the rat hippocampal formation following destruction of the pyramidal cells in the regio inferior (CA3). We undertook the present experiments to confirm this finding and to determine the requirements for this dramatic neuronal rearrangement. We found that extensive (greater than 80%) loss of CA3 cells, as well as the presence of surviving CA1 neurons within a narrow period of development (postnatal days 3-5) is necessary, however apparently not sufficient, for the appearance of CA1 mossy fibers. That the absence of normal target cells during a restricted period of mossy fiber development will lead to their association with novel targets suggests that much of the specificity of this developing connection depends on the presence of normal targets during a critical period.
