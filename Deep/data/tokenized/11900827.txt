Effects of temperature increase on the neuronal activity of hippocampal CA2-CA1 regions were examined by using optical and electrophysiological recording techniques. Stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals at the CA2 region evoked depolarizing optical signals that spread toward the CA1 region at 32 degrees C. The optical signal recorded by 49 pixels was characterized by fast and slow components that were closely related to presynaptic action potentials and excitatory postsynaptic responses, respectively. The optical signal was depressed by temperature increase to 38-40 degrees C. The temperature increase to 38 degrees C produced a hyperpolarization and a depression of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in single hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The depression of the neuronal activity induced by temperature increase was attenuated by application of glucose (22 mM) or pyruvate (22 mM). Adenosine (200 microM) did not block the presynaptic action potential but strongly depressed the excitatory postsynaptic response. 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (8-CPT) (10 microM), an antagonist for adenosine A(1) receptors, attenuated the depression of the excitatory postsynaptic response but not the inhibition of the presynaptic action potential at 38 degrees C. These results suggest that adenosine mediates the high-temperature-induced depression of the excitatory synaptic transmission but not that of action potential propagation in rat CA1 neurons.
