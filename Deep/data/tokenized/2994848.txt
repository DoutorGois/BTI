N6-cyclohexyl-[3H]adenosine [( 3H]CHA) was used for the in vitro visualization of the hippocampal adenosine A1 receptors in the gerbil. The strata radiatum and oriens of the hippocampus showed particularly high binding activity. Depletion of pyramidal cells and consequent severe decrease in [3H]CHA binding activity in the CA1 subfield were observed after transient ischemic insult. These results suggest that most adenosine receptors in the CA1 region are localized in association with pyramidal cells.
