An RFamide peptide named gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone, which directly inhibits gonadotropin synthesis and secretion from the anterior pituitary gland, has recently been discovered in the avian hypothalamus. It is not known whether the mammalian orthologs of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone and RFamide-related peptide (RFRP)-1 and -3 act in the same way. We used a newly generated antibody against the rat RFRP precursor combined with retrograde tract tracing to characterize the cell body distribution and fiber projections of RFRP-1 and -3 neurons in rats. RFRP-1/3-immunoreactive cell bodies were found exclusively within the dorsomedial hypothalamus. Immunoreactive fibers were observed in the septal-preoptic area, hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem, and hippocampus but not in the external zone of the median eminence. Intraperitoneal injection of the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold in rats resulted in the labeling of the majority of GnRH neurons but essentially no RFRP-1/3 neurons. In contrast, intracerebral injections of Fluoro-Gold into the rostral preoptic area and CA2/CA3 hippocampus resulted in the labeling of 75 +/- 5% and 21 +/- 8% of RFRP-1/3 cell bodies, respectively. To assess actions at the pituitary in vivo, RFRP-3 was administered as an iv bolus to ovariectomized rats and plasma LH concentration measured at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 30 min. RFRP-3 had no effects on basal secretion, but GnRH-stimulated LH release was reduced by about 25% at 5 min. Together these observations suggest that RFRP-3 is not a hypophysiotropic neuroendocrine hormone in rats.
