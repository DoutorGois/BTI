The effects of six prototype anticonvulsant drugs, phenytoin, carbamazepine, midazolam, phenobarbital, ethosuximide and sodium valproate, were evaluated in two different experimental models of epileptiform activity using the in vitro slice preparation from the rat hippocampus. The relative potencies of the agents were determined: a) in the complete absence of synaptic transmission by recording spontaneous burst firing from the CA 1 pyramidal cell layer in a low calcium high magnesium solution and b) during blocked synaptic inhibition by observing the activity of each drug upon orthodromically evoked population spikes in penicillin containing medium. The rank order of potencies was a) in low Ca2+: carbamazepine, phenytoin, midazolam, phenobarbital, valproate, ethosuximide; b) in penicillin containing medium: midazolam, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, ethosuximide. These observations illustrate that the use of multiple paradigms is warranted when examining the mechanisms of action of new anticonvulsants.
