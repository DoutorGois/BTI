Intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ouabain, a specific Na-K ATPase inhibitor, induces behavioral changes in rats resembling the manic phenotypes of bipolar disorder. The binding of ouabain to the Na-K ATPase affects signal events in vitro including Akt, a possible molecular target of mood disorders. However, the effects of ouabain on Akt in the brain need further clarification. In this study, we investigated changes in the phosphorylation state of Akt in the rat brain after ICV injection of ouabain. Consistent with our previous report, the locomotor activity of rats within 30 min after ouabain ICV injection changed according to the dose with higher doses of ouabain, 0.5 and 1 mM, inducing significant hyperactivity. In addition, ouabain administration induced a dose-dependent increase in the immunoreactivity of p-Akt (Ser473) in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus after 30 min, and reached statistical significance with 1mM of ouabain. Phosphorylation of GSK-3beta (Ser9), FOXO1 (Ser256), and eNOS (Ser1177), which are downstream molecules of Akt, was also increased in a dose-dependent manner within the same brain regions. Moreover, hyperactivity was seen for 8h after a single 1mM injection of ouabain and increased phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473), GSK-3beta (Ser9), FOXO1 (Ser256), and eNOS (Ser1177) was also observed in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Thus, intrabrain injection of ouabain induces activation of Akt signaling accompanied by hyperactivity, suggesting the possible role of Akt in ouabain rat model of mania.
