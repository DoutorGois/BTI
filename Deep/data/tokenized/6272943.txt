Unmyelinated fibres in the stratum radiatum (area CA1) were electrically stimulated in hippocampal slices from guinea pigs. The size of the evoked fibre volley was increased by a preceding conditioning stimulation to the same fibres, provided that the strength of the conditioning stimulus was larger than that of the test pulse. This facilitation was maximal for 20-30 ms interstimulus intervals and had a duration of about 200 ms. The results are compatible with an increased excitability (reduction in threshold) specific for fibres activated by the conditioning stimulation.
