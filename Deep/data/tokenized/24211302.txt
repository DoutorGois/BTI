Ghrelin, an orexigenic brain-gut hormone promoting feeding and regulating energy metabolism in human and rodents, was reported to enhance both adult neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory formation. However, it is still unclear whether ghrelin-induced hippocampus neurogenesis is responsible for its memory improvement. Using 5-bromo-2' deoxyuridien (BrdU) to birth-date newborn neurons and c-Fos expression to identify dentate gyrus (DG) neurons involved in memory processes, we checked here the effect of ghrelin treatment on adult neurogenesis and cognitive behaviors in mice. We further examined the possible effect of ghrelin on the recruitment of new neurons into the spatial memory traces in intact mice. We found that systemic ghrelin treatment (80mug/kg, ip injection once daily for 8days) stimulated neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, but had no effect on spatial memory formation. Consistently, it did not affect the incorporation of newborn neurons into the spatial memory circuits. On the contrary, local infusion of ghrelin (8ng/0.5mul into CA1 region of the hippocampus) impaired spatial memory formation, but did not affect adult neurogenesis. Our results thus suggested that ghrelin plays distinct roles in modulating adult neurogenesis and the memory acquisition in the hippocampus, the two processes may not be correlated and may be mediated by different mechanisms.
