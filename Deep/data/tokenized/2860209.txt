Changes in the uptake of various neurotransmitters were measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of male and female rats that were exposed to diazepam through the placenta or through the mother's milk during the prenatal or early postnatal period of rapid brain development. Earlier studies from our laboratory showed that early diazepam exposure has long-lasting behavioral consequences. The present results show that prenatally diazepam-exposed rat pups show significant reduction in choline uptake in the frontal cortex at 10 days of age. At 60 days of age, both pre- and postnatally exposed males, but not females, show significant differences from controls in terms of choline uptake, whereas postnatally exposed females whose behavior was shown previously to be profoundly affected by the diazepam exposure showed significant increase in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake in the hippocampus and reduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) uptake in the cortex at 60 days of age.
