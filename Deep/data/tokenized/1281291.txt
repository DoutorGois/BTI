Cytoskeletal preparation obtained from synaptosome fractions of rat cerebrum contained the activity of kinase C, which phosphorylated 17K Mr protein endogenous to the preparation. The kinase C activity associated with the synaptosome cytoskeletons is greater in the cerebellum and hippocampus than in the cerebrum. The enhancement rates of phosphorylation of the 17K Mr protein were 293%, 544%, and 526% in the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions of synaptosomes prepared from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, respectively. The 17K Mr protein was distinct from myelin basic protein (MBP) for the following reasons: 1) The electrophoretic mobility of the protein was slightly smaller than that of major MBP of rat in the polyacrylamide gel of 10-20% linear gradient, and the protein was not contained in the purified rat myelin. 2) The isoelectric point of the protein was in neutral range, whereas that of MBP was in alkaline one. 3) The 17K Mr protein did not cross-react with anti-MBP antibody. The protein was shown to be a major substrate contained in the cytoskeletal preparation of synaptosome obtained from cerebrum except for contaminating MBP. Only serine residue of the 17K Mr protein was phosphorylated by the kinase C endogenous to the preparation. The results suggest strongly that the synaptic role of protein kinase C through phosphorylation of the 17K Mr protein.
