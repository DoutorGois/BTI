Emotionality as well as cognitive abilities contribute to the acquisition and retrieval of memories as well as to the consolidation of long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of memory formation. However, little is known about the timescale and relative contribution of these processes. Therefore, we tested the effects of weak water maze training, containing both emotional and cognitive demands, on LTP in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The population spike amplitude (PSA)-LTP was prolonged in all rats irrespective of whether they memorized the platform position or not, whereas the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP)-LTP was impaired in good learners and enhanced in poor learners. We then dissociated the behavioral performance of rats during the water maze task by principal component analysis and by means of stress hormone concentrations into underlying "emotional" and "cognitive" factors. PSA-LTP was associated with "emotional" and fEPSP-LTP with "cognitive" behavior. PSA-LTP was depotentiated after the blockade of corticosterone binding mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) in trained animals, while fEPSP-LTP was unaffected. These results suggest that synaptic processing and encoding of emotional information in the hippocampal dentate gyrus is realized fast and further information transfer is detectable by the reinforcement of PSA-LTP, whereas that of cognitive memories is long lasting.
