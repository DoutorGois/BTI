Area CA1 of the rodent hippocampus is characterized by a highly lamina-specific and nonoverlapping termination of afferent fiber tracts. Entorhinal fibers terminate in stratum lacunosum-moleculare and commissural/associational fibers terminate in strata radiatum and oriens. It has been hypothesized that this fiber lamination depends on specific signals for the different afferent fiber tracts that are located on distinct dendritic segments of the postsynaptic neuron. In order to test this hypothesis, entorhinal and commissural/associational afferents to Ammon's horn were investigated in the adult reeler mutant mouse, in which developmental cell migration defects have disrupted the normal array of cells. Golgi staining revealed a deep and a superficial principal cell layer in the mutant. The morphology of the cells located in the deep pyramidal cell layer was considerably abnormal, whereas most cells located in the superficial pyramidal cell layer showed an almost normal cellular and dendritic morphology. Anterograde tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin revealed that the duplication and disorganization of the pyramidal cell layer in area CA1 are mirrored by the duplication and disruption of afferent fiber termination zones. In the zone above the abnormal deep pyramidal cell layer, i.e., between the two cell layers, entorhinal fibers as well as commissural/associational fibers terminate and intermingle. In contrast, in the zone above the fairly normal superficial pyramidal cell layer, entorhinal and commissural/associational fibers retain their normal fiber segregation. These data suggest that the normal laminar organization of the murine hippocampus depends on positional cues presented by their target cells.
