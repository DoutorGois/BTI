Ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) has recently gained substantial scientific interest. At field strengths of 7 Tesla (T) and higher UHF-MRI provides unprecedented spatial resolution due to an increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The UHF-MRI method has been successfully applied in various neurological disorders. In neuroinflammatory diseases UHF-MRI has already provided a detailed insight into individual pathological disease processes and elucidated differential diagnoses of several disease entities, e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and Susac's syndrome. The excellent depiction of normal blood vessels, vessel abnormalities and infarct morphology by UHF-MRI can be utilized in vascular diseases. Detailed imaging of the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease and the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease as well as sensitivity to iron depositions could be valuable in neurodegenerative diseases. Current UHF-MRI studies still suffer from small sample sizes, selection bias or propensity to image artefacts. In addition, the increasing clinical relevance of 3T-MRI has not been sufficiently appreciated in previous studies. Although UHF-MRI is only available at a small number of medical research centers it could provide a high-end diagnostic tool for healthcare optimization in the foreseeable future. The potential of UHF-MRI still has to be carefully validated by profound prospective research to define its place in future medicine.
