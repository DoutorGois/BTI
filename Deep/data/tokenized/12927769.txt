The sigma(1) (sigma(1)) receptor represents a unique intracellular neuronal protein modulating several neurotransmitter responses with relevant effects on cognitive functions. We examined here its expression and behavioral efficacy during aging. The sigma(1) receptor expression was examined in young (2 months old) and aged (24 months old) C57BL/6 mouse brain using comparative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The promnesic effect of PRE-084, a selective sigma(1) agonist, was assessed using a water-maze procedure. The sigma(1) mRNA expression was not affected during aging in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cortex or cerebellum. The sigma(1) immunolabeling was intense in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, hypothalamus and midbrain of the young mouse and the distribution appeared unchanged in the aged. The subcellular localization was similar in aged and younger animals, the protein being present on nuclear, mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticular and plasmic membranes. At the behavioral level, aged C57BL/6 mice showed deficits in the invisible platform learning, but not when the platform was visible. Animals subjected to a transfer test under repeated treatment with saline or PRE-084 significantly learned the new platform location. This study shows that sigma(1) receptor expression is preserved in aged animals and demonstrates the efficacy of a selective sigma(1) agonist against age-related memory deficits. Targeting this unique receptor may offer an original drug strategy during aging.
