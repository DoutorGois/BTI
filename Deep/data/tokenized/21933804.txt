Although neurogenesis continues throughout life in the mammalian brain, the issue of whether the stem cells that drive the process in vivo are self-renewing and multipotent remains unclear. In a recent landmark paper by Bonaguidi et al. (2011) published in Cell, the authors provide clonal evidence that neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus are indeed multipotent and undergo symmetric cell divisions.
