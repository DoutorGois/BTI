Cranial irradiation (IR) is commonly used for the treatment of brain tumors but may cause disastrous brain injury, especially in the hippocampus, which has important cognition and emotional regulation functions. Several preclinical studies have investigated the mechanisms associated with cranial IR-induced hippocampal dysfunction such as memory defects and depression-like behavior. However, current research on hippocampal dysfunction and its associated mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of overcoming the side effects of cranial radiation therapy in the hippocampus, is still very much in progress. This article reviews several in vivo studies on the possible mechanisms of radiation-induced hippocampal dysfunction, which may be associated with hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotrophin and neuroinflammation. Thus, this review may be helpful to gain new mechanistic insights into hippocampal dysfunction following cranial IR and provide effective strategies for potential therapeutic approaches for cancer patients receiving radiation therapy.
