Recently, PKC has been shown to play a pivotal role in physiological brain functions, connected with the memorizing processes and their correspondent progressive decline with brain aging. We have studied the age-dependent changes of PKC isoforms activity in connection with NOS expression and activity in specific brain areas such as hippocampus, cortex and striatum. Starting from middle aged rats, a significant inactivation of c-PKC isoforms occurred, with respect to young animals, in all the brain areas analysed. However, in middle aged animals, no significant changes in the protein level of the main PKC isoforms expressed in brain were demonstrated. Moreover, in the hippocampus and in the cortex of middle aged rats, an increased level of NOS activity--a substrate of PKC whose phosphorylation by the kinase inhibits NOS activity--has been demonstrated, reaching the same level that occurs in striatum. However, only in the hippocampus, deeply implicated in learning and memory functions, an increase of nuclear c-PKC activity and of i- and n-NOS mRNA levels was shown. Taken together, these results indicate that down-regulation of c-PKC activity occurring in middle aged rats, leads to higher levels of NO that may contribute to cell damage and to alter the neuronal physiological functions as described in older animals. Moreover, in the hippocampus, our results suggest a relationship between the translocation of c-PKC to the nucleus and the enhancement of the expression of i- and n-NOS.
