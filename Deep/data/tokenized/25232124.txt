Intracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) protein has been proposed as an early event in AD pathogenesis. In patients with mild cognitive impairment, intraneuronal Abeta immunoreactivity was found especially in brain regions critically involved in the cognitive deficits of AD. Although a large body of evidence demonstrates that Abeta42 accumulates intraneuronally ((in)Abeta), the action and the role of Abeta42 buildup on synaptic function have been poorly investigated. Here, we demonstrate that basal synaptic transmission and LTP were markedly depressed following Abeta42 injection into the neuron through the patch pipette. Control experiments performed with the reverse peptide (Abeta42-1) allowed us to exclude that the effects of (in)Abeta depended on changes in oncotic pressure. To further investigate (in)Abeta synaptotoxicity we used an Abeta variant harboring oxidized methionine in position 35 that does not cross the neuronal plasma membrane and is not uploaded from the extracellular space. This Abeta42 variant had no effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity when applied extracellularly, but induced synaptic depression and LTP inhibition after patch-pipette dialysis. Finally, the injection of an antibody raised against human Abeta42 (6E10) in CA1 pyramidal neurons of mouse hippocampal brain slices and autaptic microcultures did not, per se, significantly affect LTP and basal synaptic transmission, but it protected against the toxic effects of extracellular Abeta42. Collectively, these findings suggest that Abeta42-induced impairment of glutamatergic synaptic function depends on its internalization and intracellular accumulation thus paving the way to a systemic proteomic analysis of intracellular targets/partners of Abeta42.
