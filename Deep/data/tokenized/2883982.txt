The memorial effects of glutamate, LaCl3, ouabain, or anisomycin injection around the time of active avoidance training in mice were assessed in this study. Based on the Gibbs and Ng hypothesis of memory formation in chicks (Biobehav. Rev., 1 [1977] 113-136), it was predicted that these pharmacological agents would not only induce significant amnesia but, more specifically, short duration memory should be selectively impaired by glutamate and LaCl3, intermediate duration memory should be impaired by ouabain, and anisomycin should affect only long-lasting memories. Results of the experiments described below indicate these drugs are potent inhibitors of memory formation in rodents. In addition, LaCl3-induced amnesia was fully prevented by CaCl2. However, the mechanism by which glutamate and ouabain affected memory may not be exactly as described by Gibbs and Ng: gamma-D-glutamylglycine and diphenylhydantoin did not completely prevent glutamate- and ouabain-induced amnesias, respectively. Finally, all amnestic agents induced amnesia that developed within minutes of training, and the time course of development of amnesia for each drug could not be distinguished from one another. These data are discussed in terms of their implications for the Gibbs and Ng model of memory formation.
