A growing body of evidence indicates that adult neurogenesis is involved in the modulation of certain types of hippocampus-dependent memory. Recent studies suggest that newly born neurons play a key role in pattern separation mediated by the dentate gyrus, in systems consolidation, through which memory becomes progressively independent of the hippocampus, and in social memory-based reproductive behavior. Furthermore, neural activity and learning are now thought to regulate the proliferation of neuronal precursors as well as the survival and apoptosis of new neurons. Moreover, these processes also affect the development of the dendritic arbor and dendritic spines of new neurons, thereby modulating the integration of adult-born neurons into the functional neural circuit.
