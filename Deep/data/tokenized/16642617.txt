OBJECTIVE: To probe the mechanism of acupuncture for anti-aging. METHODS: In the senescence accelerated mouse the SAMP10 and the SAMR1, by using RT-PCR and DIG-labeled Northern blot technique, the expression differences of HSP84 and HSP86 genes in whole brain, cortex and hippocampus in the 4 groups,8-month SAMR1 control group, 8-month SAMP10 control group, 8-month SAMP10 acupuncture group and 8-month SAMP10 non-point acupuncture group were investigated. RESULTS: In the SAMP10 control group, the expression of HSP84 and HSP86 were down-regulated in the whole brain, the cortex and the hippocampus, and they were up-regulated after acupuncture, tending to the normal group. CONCLUSION: Brain aging of the SAMP10 mouse is related with abnormal expression of HSP84 and HSP86 genes, and acupuncture can strengthen the protection of cells, inhibit apoptosis and anti-oxidative stress through regulating expression of HSP84 and HSP86, hence anti-aging.
