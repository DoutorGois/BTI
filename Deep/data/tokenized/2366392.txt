Forensic autopsied brains from 57 cases were examined to establish histopathological criteria for normal aging and senile dementia. Senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), amyloid angiopathy and lipofuscin deposits were quantified in the occipital lobe and in the hippocampus. Histopathological data were analysed by the image analyzer. The primitive senile plaque (SPP) and lipofuscin deposits were observed over age of 50. The senile plaque with core (SPC) and NFT were presented in the cases above 70 year of age. There were close correlation between the individual age in non-demented, and the number, size and occupation ratio of SPC in the occipital lobe and hippocampus. In the dementia cases, the occupation ratio of SPC in the hippocampus and the number of SPP in the occipital cortex were significantly increased against the non-demented group.
