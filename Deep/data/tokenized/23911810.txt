Certain patterns of neural activity can induce N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity, one of the important foundations of memory. Here, we report that a patterned high-frequency stimulation (PHS) induces rat hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) in an NMDAR-independent manner that requires coactivation of GABA(A)Rs and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), and endocytosis of AMPARs. Thus, we disclose that a patterned high-frequency stimulation triggers GABAAR and mAChR-dependent LTD in the hippocampus.
