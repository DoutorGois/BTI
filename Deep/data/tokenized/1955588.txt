Undernutrition during early life is known to affect the morphology of the hippocampal formation. Recent advances in stereological techniques have made it possible to make relatively unbiased estimates of total cell numbers in well-defined brain regions. It was decided to use these methods to determine the effects of different levels of undernutrition during early postnatal life on the granule cells of the rat dentate gyrus. Male hooded Long Evans rats were undernourished between the 16th day of gestation and 30 postnatal days of age to two different levels. The daily food intake of level-1 and level-2 rats represented about 60 and 40%, respectively, of that eaten by well-fed, age-matched controls. Nutritional rehabilitation of the rats was commenced when they had reached 30 days of age by placing them on an ad libitum diet. Groups of control and experimental rats were killed at 70 and 212 days of age. The Cavalieri principle was used to determine the granule cell layer volume within the dentate gyrus, and the "dissector" method was used to determine numerical densities of these granule cells. These estimates were used to calculate the total numbers of granule cells. There were between 260,000 and 320,000 granule cells within the dentate gyrus of 70-day-old control and experimental rats. By 212 days of age, well-fed controls had an average of about 834,000 granule cells. The level-1 and level-2 previously undernourished rats had about 515,000 and 595,000 granule cells, respectively. Two-way analysis of variance procedures showed significant main effects of nutrition and age as well as a significant interaction between them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
