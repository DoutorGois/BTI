The effects of both REM sleep deprivation and its recovery on pontine and hippocampus muscarinic M2 receptors were investigated in synaptosomes using [3H]-AF-DX 384 as a ligand. Animals were divided into three groups: REM sleep deprivation group (small platforms 6.5 cm of diameter); stress group (large platforms 14 cm of diameter) and cage control group. In a second experiment REM sleep-deprived animals were allowed 48 h of recovery. REM sleep-deprived rats showed a reduction in M2 receptors compared with both intact and stress groups. Changes in M2 receptors were also observed after 48 h of recovery from REM sleep deprivation only in hippocampus. The enhancement of acetylcholine release during both REM sleep deprivation and recovery could explain the present findings.
