BACKGROUND: The role of the dominant hippocampus in verbal and episodic memory recall has been extensively investigated. However, there are categories of memory estimated independent of hippocampal function. In particular, factual knowledge is solely constituted from written or spoken input independent on undertaken experience, but the temporal structures involved are not well defined. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we mapped the activity of factual knowledge recall using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 60 patients scheduled for tumor or epilepsy surgery and in 18 patients resected within or close to the left mesial temporal lobe. Memory tests were performed preoperatively and postoperatively to investigate deficit symptoms in factual knowledge retrieval. RESULTS: We found a highly reproducible localized brain area within the parahippocampal gyrus, in the depth of the dorsal collateral sulcus, which was constantly involved in factual knowledge retrieval during fMRI tasks in 93% of patients (56/60) during recall of capital cities or multiplication tasks, in two thirds of the patients mainly on the dominant side. In addition, all 18 patients after surgery within this area showed postoperative factual knowledge deficits (56% permanent, 44% transitory), memory prognosis significantly correlating with the first day's factual knowledge retrieval task results. CONCLUSIONS: Using fMRI, we visualized a circumscribed brain area within the parahippocampal gyrus during factual knowledge retrieval, the lesioning of which led to factual knowledge deficits. Thus, impairment of factual knowledge retrieval may occur if resection is extended into the parahippocampal gyrus. Preoperative fMRI memory maps may contribute to avoiding such deficits.
