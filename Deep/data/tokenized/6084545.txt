Biogenic amines in pons and striatum have been dosed in twenty-four months old Wistar male rats. Choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and acetylcholine esterase (ACHesterase) activities, [3H] choline uptake by a synaptosomal preparation, [3H] quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been determined in hippocampus. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in plasma, in liver and in lungs and the characteristics of the skin collagen have been evaluated. Important differences are shown in comparison with three months old of the same strain animals.
