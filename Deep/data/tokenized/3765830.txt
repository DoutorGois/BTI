By means of the cited formula, integral indices of potential coherence of the following pairs of brain structures were calculated: hippocampus--frontal cortex, amygdala--frontal cortex, hippocampus--amygdala. In food-procuring behavior of dogs, the values of these indices increase simultaneously with the increase of the level of functional state of the brain structures. The values become higher under the action of a signal with a greater informational significance for alimentary need satisfaction than under the action of a signal with lesser informational significance.
