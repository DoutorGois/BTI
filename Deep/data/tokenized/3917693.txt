Experiments were performed on rabbits with electrochemotrodes implanted into the left and right dorsal hippocamp. The evidence was obtained for the first time as to the marked inhibitory effect of acupuncture on epileptogenic foci created by penicillin microinjections into the hippocamp. The most effective was stimulation of the Min-Men point. The antiepileptic effect was potentiated on combined stimulation of the Min-Men and Yao-Yan-Guan points. The efficacy of the procedure was significantly decreased on stimulation of the points of another acupunctural canal. The epileptiform activity was potentiated by affecting the knowingly inactive points. The antiepileptic effect of acupuncture was significantly reduced with an increase in the number of acupunctures. This might be connected with the development of tolerance to enkephalins by which the effect of acupuncture is most likely mediated.
