Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor alpha (Rab GDIalpha) is a regulator of the Rab small G proteins implicated in neurotransmission, and mutations of Rab GDIalpha cause human X-linked mental retardation associated with epileptic seizures. In Rab GDIalpha-deficient mice, synaptic potentials in the CA1 region of the hippocampus displayed larger enhancement during repetitive stimulation, which was apparently opposite to the phenotype of Rab3A-deficient mice. Furthermore, the Rab GDIalpha-deficient mice showed hypersensitivity to bicuculline, an inducer of epileptic seizures. These results suggest that Rab GDIalpha plays a specialized role in Rab3A recycling to suppress hyperexcitability via modulation of presynaptic forms of plasticity.
