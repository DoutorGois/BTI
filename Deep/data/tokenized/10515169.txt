The messenger RNAs encoding the flip and flop isoforms of the glutamate receptor subunits GluR1 and GluR2 were detected and quantified by in situ hybridization in the hippocampal formation of rats following intrahippocampal injection of tetanus on one side. The mRNAs encoding the flip isoforms of both GluR1 and GluR2 were significantly increased 4 weeks after injection. The GluR1 flip mRNA was significantly elevated only in the dentate gyrus, whereas significant increases in the GluR2 flip mRNA were seen in all hippocampal subfields examined. There were no significant changes in the mRNA encoding the flop isoforms of either GluR1 or GluR2. The significant changes in flip isoform mRNAs occurred on both sides.
