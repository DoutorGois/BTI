Male Wistar rats (3- and 20-month-old) were perfused i.c.v. with 1.5 micrograms of either nerve growth factor (NGF) or cytochrome C daily for 14 days. At the end of the infusion, the object-recognition test was carried out and extracellular acetylcholine levels (ACh) were measured in the cortex and hippocampus by transversal microdialysis technique. In 20-month-old control rats, the cortical and hippocampal ACh levels were 35 and 45% lower, respectively, than in 3-month-old rats and the ability to discriminate between a familiar and new object was impared. In the old rats treated with NGF, the ACh release as well as the behavioral performance showed no difference from those of young rats. These findings indicate that both ACh levels and memory impairment are improved in aged rats by NGF treatment and suggest that there is a relationship between object recognition and the activity of the forebrain cholinergic system.
