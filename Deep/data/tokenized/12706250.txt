In the present study, temporal changes of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (VGCC) immunoreactivities were evaluated in the gerbil hippocampus following ischemia. P/Q-type VGCC immunoreactivity was elevated in the hippocampus in the 3 h post-ischemic group. In the 30 min post-ischemic group, N-type VGCC immunoreactivity began to increase only in the CA1 region. L-type (alpha1C) VGCC immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the 12 h post-ischemic group. L-type (alpha1D) VGCC immunoreactivity began to increase in the CA1 region in the 30 min post-ischemic group and peaked in the 12 h post-ischemic group. These findings suggest that the altered VGCC immunoreactivities following ischemia may play an important role in the ischemic neuronal injury.
