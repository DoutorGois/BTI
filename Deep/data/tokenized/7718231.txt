Here we describe a technique that uses a recombinant vaccinia virus to transfect neurons in rat hippocampal slices. This technique allows the use of molecular biological manipulations on neuronal tissue while maintaining intact synaptic function. This method should be useful in testing specific hypotheses regarding the role of synaptic proteins.
