Standard volumetric neuroimaging studies have demonstrated preferential atrophy of subcortical structures among individuals with HIV. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated subcortical shape alterations secondary to HIV and whether advancing age impacts that relationship. This study employed 3D morphometry to examine the independent and interactive effects of HIV and age on shape differences in nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus in 81 participants ranging in age from 24 to 76 including 59 HIV+ individuals and 22 HIV-seronegative controls. T1-weighted MRI underwent a preprocessing pipeline followed by automated subcortical segmentation. Parametric statistical analyses were used to determine independent effects of HIV infection and age on volume and shape in each region of interest (ROI) and the interaction between age and HIV serostatus in predicting volume/shape in each ROI. Significant main effects for HIV were found in the shape of right caudate and nucleus accumbens, left pallidum, and hippocampus. Age was associated with differences in shape in left pallidum, right nucleus accumbens and putamen, and bilateral caudate, hippocampus, and thalamus. Of greatest interest, an age x HIV interaction effect was found in the shape of bilateral nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate, and thalamus as well as right pallidum and putamen such that increasing age in HIV participants was associated with greater shape alterations. Traditional volumemetric analyses revealed main effects for both HIV and age but no age x HIV interaction. These findings may suggest that age and HIV infection conferred additional deleterious effects on subcortical shape abnormalities beyond the independent effects of these factors.
