Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have been shown to be important for hippocampus-dependent memory, as well as activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In this study, we examined the role of mGluRs in the induction of two forms of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), in the neocortex of awake, freely-moving rats. The mGluR antagonist AIDA was administered during the induction of LTP or LTD in the motor cortex. There was a 50% reduction of LTP induced in the early component of the evoked response, but there was no effect on the late component and no effect on the induction of LTD. Thus, mGluRs contribute to at least one form of activity dependent synaptic plasticity in the neocortex.
