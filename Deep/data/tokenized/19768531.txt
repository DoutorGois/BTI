Cognitive deficits have been observed in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) due to hippocampal insults. Antioxidant vitamins D and E are suggested for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases like MS, while their mechanisms of action are not well understood. Here, we have tried to study the effects of these vitamins on demyelination, cell death, and remyelination of rat hippocampus following local ethidium bromide (EB) injection. Animals received 100 mg/kg vitamin E or 5 microg/kg of vitamin D3 for 2, 7, or 28 days. The extent of demyelination, myelin staining intensity, and expression of myelin basic protein and caspase-3 were investigated using histological and immunoblotting verification. Administration of EB alone caused demyelination, cell death, and afterward an endogenous repair. Vitamins E and D3 reduced the EB-induced damage and increased the endogenous remyelination of hippocampus. Although the anti-apoptotic effect of these vitamins and protection against demyelination were predictable based on their antioxidant effect, our results indicated the positive effect of vitamins E and D3 on process of remyelination by endogenous progenitor cells and supported their possible therapeutic effects in the context of demyelinating diseases like MS.
