The hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include the deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta), neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. The accumulation of activated glial cells in cognitive-related areas is critical for these alterations, although little is known about the mechanisms driving this event. Herein we used macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha(-/-))- or CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5(-/-))-deficient mice to address the role played by chemokines in molecular and behavioral alterations induced by Abeta(1-40). Abeta(1-40) induced a time-dependent increase of MIP-1alpha mRNA followed by accumulation of activated glial cells in the hippocampus of wild-type mice. MIP-1alpha(-/-) and CCR5(-/-) mice displayed reduced astrocytosis and microgliosis in the hippocampus after Abeta(1-40) administration that was associated with decreased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, as well as reduced activation of nuclear factor-kappaB, activator protein-1 and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein. Furthermore, MIP-1alpha(-/-) and CCR5(-/-) macrophages showed impaired chemotaxis in vitro, although cytokine production in response to Abeta(1-40) was unaffected. Notably, the cognitive deficits and synaptic dysfunction induced by Abeta(1-40) were also attenuated in MIP-1alpha(-/-) and CCR5(-/-) mice. Collectively, these results indicate that the MIP-1alpha/CCR5 signaling pathway is critical for the accumulation of activated glial cells in the hippocampus and, therefore, for the inflammation and cognitive failure induced by Abeta(1-40). Our data suggest MIP-1alpha and CCR5 as potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
