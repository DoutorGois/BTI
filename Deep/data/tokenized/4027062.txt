Disrupting medial temporal-lobe (MTL) activity for less than a second, either during the initial presentation of a complex scene or when it is presented again 1 min later, severely impairs recognition at the second presentation. MTL disruption during both presentation and recognition periods produces further impairment. These results are not consistent with views limiting MTL function solely to encoding or solely to retrieval mechanisms.
