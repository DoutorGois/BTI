Random-Bred-Swiss Mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 0.02 ml of a 10(-1) diluted suspension of yellow fever virus 17 D. The animals were sacrificed at selected times ranging from 1 day up to 168 days after inoculation. Brain sections were stained and then histologically investigated. Nerve cell necrosis in the cornu ammonis could be seen already 24 h after inoculation, again 24 h later inflammatory signs were found. There was no spatial correlation between nerve cell necrosis and inflammation.--Although the animals did not show clinical signs of infection for more than 2 weeks, nerve cell necrosis was still progressive, even in mice sacrificed 168 days after inoculation of the virus.--The implications of those findings are discussed and the definition of encephalitis established by Spatz is challenged.--The above described approach may also serve as a model for explaining etiological findings with regard to the pathogenesis of degenerative diseases of the central nerve system.
