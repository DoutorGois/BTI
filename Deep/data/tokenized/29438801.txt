Selective vulnerability or resilience to mood disorders is related to individual differences or personality. In the present study forced swim test (FST) was used as a tool for division of male rats according to their immobility behavior. The animals were subjected to a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUS). Depressive-like behavior and modifications in brain neurotrophin system of were examined after CUS exposure. The low immobile (LI) and high immobile (HI) rats demonstrated elusive differences in expression of BDNF ExVI mRNA and TrkA mRNA which was higher in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, respectively, of HI rats as compared to LI animals. Exposure to CUS resulted in development of depressive-like phenotype and increased anxiety in both subgroups; however, immobility in FST specifically decreased in the initially HI animals. In hippocampus of stressed LI rats, the contents of total BDNF mRNA decreased. In hippocampus of stressed HI rats, the content of TrkA mRNA increased whereas in frontal cortex, the content of BDNF exon I mRNA decreased in both LI and HI rats. The levels of BDNF ExIX and ExI as well TrkB mRNAs were higher in the hippocampus of HI rats as compared to LI rats. In general, the response of hippocampus to CUS was much more expressed as compared to frontal cortex. Thus, initially different stress coping strategies of rats in the FST (HI, LI) were associated with the development of similar behavioral phenotypes after chronic unpredictable stress; however, these phenotypes were associated with different alterations in neurotrophin systems of the brain.
