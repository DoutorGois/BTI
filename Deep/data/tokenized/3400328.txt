Study of dominating spectral maxima in delta-, theta- and alpha-ranges of the electrical activity of rabbits' neocortex and hippocampus showed that an increase of the frequency of the mesencephalic reticular formation stimulation from 60 to 200 imp/s led in both structures to an enhancement of the theta-rhythm (up to 130% in the neocortex and 147% in the hippocampus) and suppression of delta- and alpha-activity (correspondingly up to 67 and 34% in the neocortex and 37 and 48% in the hippocampus) with subsequent weakening of this effect at frequency increase up to 1000 imp/s. In the hippocampus, the reticular stimulation was more effective with respect to the theta- and delta-rhythms, and in the neocortex--with respect to the alpha-rhythm. In both structures the theta-rhythm amplitude changed less than the amplitude of the delta- and alpha-activities. Dependence of the amplitude of dominating rhythms on intensity of reticular formation stimulation differed from the analogous frequency dependence of the same rhythms.
