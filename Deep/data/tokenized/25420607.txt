RATIONALE: Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) agonists showed anti-amnesic properties in Alzheimer's disease models and anti-inflammatory properties in cerebrum ischaemia models. The agonist of Sig-1R was reported to up-regulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus of mice. Here, we investigate whether the activation of Sig-1R attenuates the learning and memory impairment induced by ischaemia/reperfusion and how it affects the expression of BDNF. OBJECTIVES: Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) was induced for 20 min in C57BL/6 mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sig-1R agonist, PRE084, sigma 1/2 non-selective agonist, DTG, Sig-1R antagonist and BD1047 were injected once daily throughout the experiment. Behavioural tests were performed from day 8. On day 22 after BCCAO, mice were sacrificed for biochemical analysis. RESULTS: PRE084 and DTG ameliorated learning and memory impairments in the Y maze, novel object recognition, and water maze tasks and prevented the decline of synaptic proteins and BDNF expression in the hippocampus of BCCAO mice. Furthermore, PRE084 and DTG up-regulated the level of NMDA receptor 2A (NR2A), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV) and CREB-specific co-activator transducer of regulated CREB activity 1 (TORC1). Additionally, the effects of PRE084 and DTG were antagonised by the co-administration of BD1047. CONCLUSIONS: Sig-1R activation showed an attenuation in the ischaemia/reperfusion model and the activation of Sig-1R increased the expression of BDNF, possibly through the NR2A-CaMKIV-TORC1 pathway, and Sig-1R agonists might function as neuroprotectant agents in vascular dementia.
