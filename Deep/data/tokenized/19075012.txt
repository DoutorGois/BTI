Chondroitin sulfate (CS) plays critical roles in central nervous system development and regeneration, and individual modifications of CS form a "sulfation code" that regulates growth factor signaling or neuronal growth. Although we have shown that CS-E polysaccharide, but not CS-A or -C polysaccharide, has an inherent ability to promote neurite outgrowth toward primary neurons, its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show the involvement of a plasma membrane-tethered cell adhesion molecule, contactin-1 (CNTN-1), in CS-E-mediated neurite extension in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line and primary hippocampal neurons. CS-E, but not CS-A, -C, or heparan sulfate, engaged CNTN-1 with significant affinity and induced intracellular signaling downstream of CNTN-1, indicating that CS-E is a selective ligand for a potential CS receptor, CNTN-1, leading to neurite outgrowth. Our data provide the first evidence that biological functions of CS are exerted through the CS receptor-mediated signaling pathway(s).
