Ca2+-ATPase is one of the most powerful modulators of intracellular calcium levels. In this study, we focused on chronological changes in the immunoreactivity and protein levels of Ca2+-ATPase in the hippocampus after 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia. Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity was significantly altered in the hippocampal CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus, but not in the CA2/3 region after ischemic insult. In the sham-operated group, Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity was detected in the hippocampus. Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity in the CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus, and its protein levels peaked 3 h after ischemic insult. At this time, CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate polymorphic cells showed strong Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity. Thereafter, Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity reduced in the CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus. One day after ischemic insult, Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity was observed in some CA1 non-pyramidal cells, and 4 days after ischemic insult, Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity was detected in astrocytes throughout the CA1 region, but Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus had nearly disappeared. Our results suggest that Ca2+-ATPase changes may be associated with a response to ischemic damage in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, and that increased Ca2+-ATPase immunoreactivity in the reactive astrocytes may be associated with the maintenance of intracellular calcium levels.
