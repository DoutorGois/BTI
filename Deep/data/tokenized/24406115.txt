Several studies have focused on the negative emotional state associated with drug abstinence. The peptide NPY plays an important role given its involvement in drug addiction, anxiety, and mood disorders. Interestingly, it is well established that outbred Swiss mice exhibit a prominent behavioral variability to ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization. Here, we investigated whether mice that were either susceptible or resistant to ethanol sensitization differed in their NPY expression during abstinence. The mice were treated daily with ethanol (2 g/kg, i.p.) or saline for 21 days. According to the locomotor activity after the last injection, the ethanol group was classified as sensitized (EtOH_High) or non-sensitized (EtOH_Low). To evaluate NPY expression, some of the mice were sacrificed at 18 h or 5 days of abstinence, and others were challenged at the 5th day of abstinence with ethanol (1.4 g/kg) and sacrificed after 1.5 h. At 5 days of abstinence, NPY expression increased in the orbital cortex, dorsomedial striatum, and dentate gyrus in the EtOH_High mice. These changes were counteracted by the ethanol challenge. In the EtOH_Low mice, NPY expression increased in the dentate gyrus only after 18 h of abstinence. Lastly, a decreased level of NPY was found in the prelimbic cortex of the EtOH_Low mice at 5 days of abstinence, and this was reversed by ethanol challenge. Therefore, behavioral variability in ethanol sensitization confers differential neurochemical features during the subsequent abstinence, including distinct patterns of NPY expression.
