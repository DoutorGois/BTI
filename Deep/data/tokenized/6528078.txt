The effects of bilateral microinjection of gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG, an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-T) were tested during the development of seizures induced by i.p. administration of 10 mg/kg of kainic acid. Intrahippocampal injection of GVG prevents the development of the seizures at an early stage in about half of the cases. In the remaining animals status epilepticus comparable to that of controls develops. Intra-amygdaloid injection reduces the severity of the seizures from the first motor limbic signs. Finally, intranigral injection prevents the appearance of convulsive status epilepticus or, when it develops, reduces its duration. The role that these three structures could play in the electro-clinical development of kainic acid-induced seizures is discussed.
