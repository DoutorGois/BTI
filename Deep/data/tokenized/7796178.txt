The exact role of the mammalian hippocampus in memory formation remains essentially as an unanswered question for cognitive neuroscience. Experiments with humans and with animals indicate that some types of mnemonic associative processes involve hippocampal function while others do not. Support for the spatial processing hypothesis of hippocampal function has stemmed from the impaired performance of rats with hippocampal lesions in tasks that require spatial discriminations, but not cued discriminations. Previous procedures, however, have confounded the interpretation of spatial versus cued discrimination learning with the number and kinds of irrelevant stimuli present in the discrimination. An empirical set of data describing a role of protein kinase C (PKC) in different mnemonic processes is similarly being developed. Recent work has implicated the activation of this serine-threonine kinase in a variety of learning paradigms, as well as long-term potentiation (LTP), a model system for synaptic plasticity which may subserve some types of learning. The present study employs the principles of component task analysis to examine the role of membrane-associated PKC (mPKC) in hippocampal-dependent memory when all factors other than the type of learning were equivalent. The results indicate that hippocampal mPKC is altered by performance in hippocampally-dependent spatial discriminations, but not hippocampally-independent cued discriminations and provide a general experimental procedure to relate neural changes to specific behavioral changes.
