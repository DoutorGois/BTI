We induced repeated focal cerebral ischemia in gerbils. Single 5-min ischemia produced neuronal damage limited to the ipsilateral CA1 and CA4 hippocampus. Two 5-min ischemic insults spaced at a 1-h interval caused selective neuronal damage to the CA1, CA3 and CA4 hippocampus, striatum, neocortex, and thalamus. Three 5-min ischemic insults at 1-h intervals produced infarction. Thus, repeated focal ischemia produced cumulative brain damage by conversion of sublethal damage into selective neuronal damage and of the neuronal damage into infarction.
