5-Methoxy-3-(di-n-propylamino)chroman (5-MeO-DPAC) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan after decarboxylase inhibition in rat striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex. The decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) turnover may have resulted from activation of 5-HT receptors on cell bodies of 5-HT neurons that project to the striatum and other brain regions, since 5-MeO-DPAC had earlier been reported to lack affinity for striatal binding sites.
