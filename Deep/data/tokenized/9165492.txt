The relationship between the behavioral effects and motor activity induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (150 mg/kg, ip) and brain polyamine concentration was studied in male Wistar rats. Motor activity was evaluated by an automated subtraction analysis system to measure the duration and vigor of any kind of movement. The behavioral modifications exhibited by the nonconvulsant NMDA-treated rats were evaluated according to the composition and sequence of behavioral components as: hypoactivity (pattern A), partially stereotyped activity (pattern B), and generalized stereotyped activity (pattern C). The concentration of polyamines in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was measured 8 and 24 h after drug injection. A relationship was found between the concentration of putrescine in both regions and the motor activity. In addition, the concentrations of putrescine also correlated with the vigor of the movements performed. Moreover, the putrescine concentration in the frontal cortex and hippocampus paralleled the behavioral patterns. The histological examination of the frontocortical and hippocampal areas did not reveal any evidence of damage. In conclusion, partially or generalized stereotyped activity elicited by systemic NMDA administration induces an increase in putrescine in the brain not linked to histological damage.
