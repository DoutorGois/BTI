A novel protein (NELF) was identified screening embryonic luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) neurons at different migrational states. Experiments in vitro revealed that NELF functions in olfactory axon outgrowth and subsequently alters LHRH neuronal migration. NELF was not restricted to LHRH neurons in the developing rodent. Multiple CNS and PNS tissues expressed this gene. To characterize the specific regions that express NELF in situ hybridization histochemistry was performed. Within the CNS, cells in the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and olfactory regions express NELF pre- and postnatally.
