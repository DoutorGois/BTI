It has been established that hippocampus, enthorhinal cortex, amygdala and substantia nigra (pars reticulata) lesions before head injury lead to a decrease of kainic acid-induced behavioral and electrographic seizure expressions. It can be concluded that after head injury the activation of limbic structures excitability due to excitation of "inputs" to these formations takes place. The obtained data indicate the significant role of nucleus caudatus in activation of posttraumatic brain excitatory mechanisms.
