Alteration of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 transporter (ABCB1) can plausibly cause drug-resistant epilepsy as it influences brain penetration of drugs. The CC genotype at the ABCB1 C3435T polymorphism was reported to be associated with multidrug resistance. A replication study in 401 drug-resistant and 208 drug-responsive subjects with epilepsy showed no significant association between the CC genotype and drug-resistant epilepsy. The authors suggest the initial association may have arisen by chance.
