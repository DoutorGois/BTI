Apolipoprotein E isoforms affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E-associated risk may be related to its binding to and clearance by cell surface receptors, including members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. We examined the brain expression of the most recently identified member of this receptor family, apolipoprotein E receptor 2, in human brain and placenta. We analysed apolipoprotein E receptor 2 messenger RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 protein by immunohistochemistry. Four exons of the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 message were alternately spliced in both fetal and adult brain tissue. Exon 5, encoding three of the seven ligand binding repeats, was absent in the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 messenger RNA examined. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 messages lacking exon 8, encoding an epidermal growth factor precursor repeat, exon 15, encoding the O-glycosylation region, or exon 18, encoding a cytoplasmic domain, were also present as minor splice variants in the brain and placenta. No differences were observed in the pattern of apolipoprotein E receptor 2 splicing between control and Alzheimer brains. Immunohistochemistry of mouse brain showed that apolipoprotein E receptor 2 was expressed in neurons throughout the brain, with strong expression in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, granule cells of the dentate gyrus, cortical neurons and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Thus, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 is the fourth apolipoprotein E receptor identified on neuronal cells.
