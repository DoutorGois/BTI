Using the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation, we studied the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal cells in tissue that was 'preincubated' (2-6 h in a large, static volume of oxygenated bathing medium) before being placed in an interface chamber for study. Striking differences were found in 'preincubated' vs 'non-preincubated' CA3 cells. The preincubated cells had more negative resting potentials, higher input resistance, lower threshold for stimulus-evoked burst discharge and larger hyperpolarizing afterpotentials. Cells in the preincubated CA3 region were also more likely to show spontaneous synchronized burst discharge, but were relatively resistant to hypoxia-induced spreading depression. CA1 cells were less dramatically affected by preincubation, showing little difference from their non-preincubated counterparts. Possible mechanisms involved in the CA3 preincubation effect, including glial buffering alterations and changes in Na+, K+-ATPase activity, are discussed.
