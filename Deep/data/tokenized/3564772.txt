Morphological studies have been made of the neocortical and archicortical structures in the spiny mouse Acomys cahirinus, the only maturely born species from the family Muridae. The data obtained reveal highly developed hippocampus as compared to the neocortex in this mouse, in contrast to relationships found in other mice and rats.
