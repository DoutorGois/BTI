The vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) may also act as a neuropeptide. ET-1 is formed by the catalytic action of endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) on big ET-1 and its cellular actions are mediated via ET(A) and ET(B) receptors. Although localisation of these components in rodent brain has been extensively investigated, no single study has mapped their distribution in human brain. Here we describe the localisation of ET-1 mRNA, ET-1, ECE-1, ET(A) and ET(B) receptors within 24 human brain regions. In situ RT-PCR has previously detected ET-1 mRNA in 22 areas (excluding the post-central gyrus and pineal gland), and ET-1 immunoreactivity was visualised in cells of all regions. Using specific antibodies we have immunolocalised ECE-1 and ET(B) receptors in cells of 24 areas, and ET(A) receptors in nine regions (choroidal epithelial cells, neurones in the diencephalon, hippocampus, amygdaloid, dentate nucleus, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, flocculo-nodular lobe and vermis). ET-1 mRNA, ET-1, ECE-1 and ET(B) receptors were observed in cortical pyramidal cells, neurones (brainstem, basal nuclei, thalamus, insula and claustrum, limbic region), cells in the anterior pituitary gland; nerve cell processes in the pars nervosa; pinealocytes and choroidal epithelial cells. Only ET-1 mRNA, ET-1, ECE-1, and ET(B) receptors were visualised in cerebral capillary endothelial cells. The presence of ET-1 mRNA, ECE-1 and ET-1 in 22 brain regions confirms ET expression and processing in human brain. The localisation of ET-1 and ET(B) receptors suggests receptor-mediated action akin to a neurotransmitter role for ET-1.
