Application of NMDA, or agents releasing nitric oxide (NO), onto the dendrites of hippocampal granule cells increased the levels of the mRNA encoding MAP2, a cytoskeletal component induced during periods of neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, local increases in the hybridisation signal in the molecular layer, representing dendritic MAP2 mRNA, occurred independently of changes in MAP2 mRNA levels in the cell body layer. The selective modulation of MAP2 mRNA in dendrites reveals a mechanism allowing a sustained stimulation of dendritic outgrowth to be confined to those regions of a neuron's dendritic arbour local to glutamate receptor stimulation.
