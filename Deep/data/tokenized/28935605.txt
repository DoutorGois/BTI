BACKGROUND: In the present study, we investigated the effects of pyridoxine on hippocampal functions and changes in protein profiles based on the proteomic approach. METHODS: Eight-week-old mice received intraperitoneal injections of physiological saline (vehicle) or 350mg/kg pyridoxine twice a day for 21days. RESULTS: Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 was up-regulated, while CB1 cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein 1 (CRIP1) was down-regulated, in the pyridoxine-treated group. Additionally, the serotonin and tyrosine hydroxylase was increased in the hippocampus of the pyridoxine-treated group than in that of the vehicle-treated group. Furthermore, discrimination indices based on the novel object recognition test were significantly higher in the pyridoxine-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group. Administration of CRIP1a siRNA significantly increases the discrimination index as well as cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. In addition, the administration of rimonabant, a CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist, for 3weeks significantly decreased the novel object recognition memory, the tyrosine hydroxylase level, the amount of cell proliferation, and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. Treatment with pyridoxine significantly increased novel object recognition memory, but slightly ameliorated rimonabant-induced reduction in serotonin, the tyrosine hydroxylase level, the amount of cell proliferation, and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pyridoxine promotes hippocampal functions by increasing serotonin and tyrosine hydroylase immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. This positive effect may be associated with CRIP1a and CB1 cannabinoid receptor function. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Vitamin-B6 enhances hippocampal functions and this is closely associated with CRIP1a and CB1 cannabinoid receptors.
