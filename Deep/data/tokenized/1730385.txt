The potential neuroanatomical specificity of astrocyte influence on neurite outgrowth was studied using an in vitro coculture system in which neurons from embryonic rat spinal cord or hippocampus were grown for 4 days in the presence of, but not in direct contact with, astrocytes derived either from the same region (homotopic coculture) or from different regions (heterotopic coculture) of the rat central nervous system. The results showed that axonal outgrowth was greatly enhanced in heterotopic cocultures in which spinal cord or hippocampal neurons were grown with astrocytes derived from their appropriate CNS target regions. This effect was remarkably specific, because the astroglia harvested from spinal or hippocampal target regions were not effective in promoting axon growth of nonafferent neuronal populations. Dendritic outgrowth was similar under all coculture conditions. These data suggest that diffusible signals, produced by astrocytes, can regulate neurite extension in vitro in a neuroanatomically specific manner and that axons are more sensitive than dendrites to the regional astrocyte environment.
