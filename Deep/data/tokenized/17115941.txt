The present study aimed to acquire more information on aging-related alterations, using proteomic and genomic analyses of hippocampus from young (8 months) and old (27 months) rats. In the old rats, the proteomic analysis identified changes in proteins related to the iron-mediated oxidative stress (OS) pathway, including reduction in antioxidant enzymes (e.g., peroxiredoxin, cytochrome c oxidase) and induction of ferritin. Furthermore, the neurofilament light peptide, associated with neurodegenerative processes, was enhanced and binding/ chaperone proteins were altered in old vs. young rats. At the genes levels, significant molecular changes related to neurodegeneration were identified in aged rat hippocampus. Thus, the effects of the potent neuroprotective compounds, the anti-Parkinson drug, rasagiline and the anti-Alzheimer drug, ladostigil (1 mg/kg, for 30 days) on gene expression in the hippocampus were further investigated. Both drugs reversed the effect of aging on the expression of various mitochondrial and key regulator genes involved in neurodegeneration, cell survival, synaptogenesis, oxidation, and metabolism. These results support the hypothesis that OS and mitochondrial dysfunction may play a pivotal role in aging and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, and can serve as potential clinical targets for future therapy.
