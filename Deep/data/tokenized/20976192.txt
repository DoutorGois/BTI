BACKGROUND: Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) is an enzyme that phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). DGKbeta is widely distributed in the central nervous system, such as the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. Recent studies reported that the splice variant at the COOH-terminal of DGKbeta was related to bipolar disorder, but its detailed mechanism is still unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we performed behavioral tests using DGKbeta knockout (KO) mice to investigate the effects of DGKbeta deficits on psychomotor behavior. DGKbeta KO mice exhibited some behavioral abnormalities, such as hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and reduced depression. Additionally, hyperactivity and reduced anxiety were attenuated by the administration of the mood stabilizer, lithium, but not haloperidol, diazepam, or imipramine. Moreover, DGKbeta KO mice showed impairment in Akt-glycogen synthesis kinase (GSK) 3beta signaling and cortical spine formation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that DGKbeta KO mice exhibit lithium-sensitive behavioral abnormalities that are, at least in part, due to the impairment of Akt-GSK3beta signaling and cortical spine formation.
