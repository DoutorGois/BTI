Recently, it has been reported that metformin may attenuate inflammation and directly act on the central nervous system. Using the HPLC method, in Wistar rats, we assessed the changes in metformin concentrations in various brain regions (pituitary gland, olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, frontal cortex), cerebrospinal fluid and plasma after single and chronic oral administration, in the model of systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (ip). Regarding the influence of systemic inflammation on metformin distribution, the pituitary gland demonstrated the highest its level after single and chronic administration (28.8 +/- 3.5 nmol/g and 24.9 +/- 3.2 nmol/g, respectively). We concluded that orally-dosed metformin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and differently accumulates in structures of the central nervous system.
