The quantitative receptor autoradiographic method we used revealed that specific [125I]endothelin-1 ([125I]ET-1) binding sites are highly concentrated in the choroid plexus (ChP), subfornical organ (SFO), lacunosum molecular layer of the hippocampus (LMol), and granular layer of the cerebellum (GC) of the rat brain. [125I]ET-1 bound to the rat ChP and LMol with a high affinity and to the SFO and GC with a low affinity. The possibility that ET-1 acts as a neuropeptide within the central nervous system by interacting with specific receptors would have to be considered.
