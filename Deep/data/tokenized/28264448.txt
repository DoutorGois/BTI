Paeoniflorin (PF) is an active ingredient of Paeoniae Radix which possesses the neuroprotective effect. However, so far, the neuroprotective mechanism of PF has still not been fully uncovered. The Ca(2+)/Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)/cAMP response element-binding (CREB) signaling pathway plays an important role in the intracellular signal transduction pathway involved in cell proliferation, cell survival, inflammation and metabolism. Herein, the neuroprotective roles of PF in the models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion in rats and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced excitotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons were investigated. Moreover, we attempted to confirm the hypothesis that its protection effect is via the modulation of the Ca(2+)/CaMKI)/CREB signaling pathway. In this study, PF not only significantly decreased neurological deficit scores and infarct volume in vivo, but also improved neurons' cell viability, and inhibited neurons' apoptosis and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration in vitro. Furthermore, PF significantly up-regulated p-CREB and p-CaMKII, and down-regulated calmodulin (CaM) in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that the protective effect of PF on cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury is possible through regulating the Ca(2+)/CaMKII/CREB signaling pathway.
