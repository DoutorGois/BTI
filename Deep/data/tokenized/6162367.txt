In 70 patients with epilepsy and severe behavioural disturbances with EEG changes in the temporal regions, we performed EEG investigations of deep temporal structures, temporal cortex and scalp, using Talairach's stereotactic apparatus. Taking into account the recorded changes we performed 115 stereotactic lesions on the medial amygdala (both unilaterally and bilaterally) and on the anterior hippocampus (cornu Ammonis). The results in epileptic processes were: total recovery in 11.4%, evident clinical improvement in 74.3% and no improvement in 14.3%. Similar results were obtained in behavioural disturbances. Bilateral amygdalotomy and unilateral hippocampotomy in selected cases may produce recovery or amelioration and make possible return to normal social life for epileptic patients with severe behavioural changes.
