The work deals with the results of surgical management of 61 patients with temporal-lobe epilepsy. The indications for the use of various types of operative interventions in this pathological condition are discussed. Positive results of treatment were obtained in 90.8--80.65% of cases. Deterioration in the patients' condition was not noted. It is emphasized that indications for surgical treatment must be determined as early as possible.
