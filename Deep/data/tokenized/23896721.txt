A balance between cell survival and apoptosis is crucial to avoid neurodegeneration. Here, we analyzed whether the pro-apoptotic protein PKCdelta, and the pro-survival PKCalpha and betaII, were dysregulated in the brain of R6/1 mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD). Protein levels of the three PKCs examined were reduced in all the brain regions analyzed being PKCdelta the most affected isoform. Interestingly, PKCdelta protein levels were also decreased in the striatum and cortex of R6/2 and Hdh(Q111/Q111) mice, and in the putamen of HD patients. Nuclear PKCdelta induces apoptosis, but we detected reduced PKCdelta in both cytoplasmic and nuclear enriched fractions from R6/1 mouse striatum, cortex and hippocampus. In addition, we show that phosphorylation and ubiquitination of PKCdelta are increased in 30-week-old R6/1 mouse brain. All together these results suggest a pro-survival role of reduced PKCdelta levels in response to mutant huntingtin-induced toxicity. In fact, we show that over-expression of PKCdelta increases mutant huntingtin-induced cell death in vitro, whereas over-expression of a PKCdelta dominant negative form or silencing of endogenous PKCdelta partially blocks mutant huntingtin-induced cell death. Finally, we show that the analysis of lamin B protein levels could be a good marker of PKCdelta activity, but it is not involved in PKCdelta-mediated cell death in mutant huntingtin-expressing cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that neurons increase the degradation of PKCdelta as a compensatory pro-survival mechanism in response to mutant huntingtin-induced toxicity that can help to understand why cell death appears late in the disease.
