Apoptosis of dentate granule cells is a typical feature of several animal models of disease. In 20 autopsy cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and global cerebral hypoxia caused by protracted shock or respiratory failure, we evaluated by light microscopy and in situ tailing whether this pattern of neuronal damage also occurs in humans. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, 4.0/mm2 (0-13.0/mm2) apoptotic neurons were observed in the dentate gyrus, in cerebral hypoxia 3.6/mm2 (0-19.9/mm2) (p>0.05), and in 10 aged-matched control cases dying rapidly from non-neurological diseases 0/mm2 (0-0/mm2) (median [range]) (p<0.001 versus SAH and hypoxia). Neuronal apoptosis in the dentate gyrus was most frequent, when death occurred later than 24 hours and less than 11 days after disease onset. Neuronal damage in the hippocampus was always necrotic. It was more severe in hypoxia than in SAH (median neuronal damage score 3 [range: 0-3] versus 0 [0-3], p<0.001). Apoptosis appears to be the predominant mechanism of death in dentate granule cells irrespective of the underlying disease, whereas neuronal death in the hippocampus generally is of necrotic morphology.
