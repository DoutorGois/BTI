Ischemic injury to the CNS results in loss of ionic homeostasis and the development of neuronal death. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ is well established, but there are few studies of changes in intracellular Cl- ([Cl-]i) after ischemia. We used an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation) to examine changes in [Cl-]i and GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses in hippocampal slices from adult rats. Changes in [Cl-]i were measured in area CA1 pyramidal neurons using optical imaging of 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium chloride, a Cl--sensitive fluorescent indicator. Oxygen-glucose deprivation induced an immediate rise in [Cl-]i, which recovered within 20 min. A second and more prolonged rise in [Cl-]i occurred within the next hour, during which postsynaptic field potentials failed to recover. The sustained increase in [Cl-]i was not blocked by GABA(A) receptor antagonists. However, oxygen-glucose deprivation caused a progressive downregulation of the K+-Cl- cotransporter (KCC2), which may have contributed to the Cl- accumulation. The rise in [Cl-]i was accompanied by an inability of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol to cause Cl- influx. In vivo, diazepam is neuroprotective when given early after ischemia, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not well understood. Here, we added diazepam early after oxygen-glucose deprivation and prevented the downregulation of KCC2 and the accumulation of [Cl-]i. Consequently, both GABA(A) responses and synaptic transmission within the hippocampus were restored. Thus, after oxygen-glucose deprivation, diazepam may decrease neuronal excitability, thereby reducing the energy demands of the neuron. This may prevent the activation of downstream cell death mechanisms and restore Cl- homeostasis and neuronal function
