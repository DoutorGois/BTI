A new assay of afterdischarge pattern evaluation is presented, using computerized automatic analysis where procedure of data reduction, known as syntactic analysis, was involved. Effects of phenobarbital and diazepam on afterdischarge pattern were also studied. Adopting Kalman filters technique and Markov chain midel a multi-channel analysis was performed. Significant differences between effects of two tested drugs on seizure activity propagation were found.
