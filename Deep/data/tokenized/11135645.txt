Impaired inhibition is thought to be important in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the most common form of epilepsy in adult patients. We report that, in experimental TLE, spontaneous GABAergic inhibition was increased in the soma but reduced in the dendrites of pyramidal neurons. The former resulted from the hyperactivity of somatic projecting interneurons, whereas the latter was probably due to the degeneration of a subpopulation of dendritic projecting interneurons. A deficit in dendritic inhibition could reduce seizure threshold, whereas enhanced somatic inhibition would prevent the continuous occurrence of epileptiform activity.
