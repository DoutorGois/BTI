Memory deficits are common among drug abusers and in those with chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, the mechanisms through which diverse neurophysiologic processes alter memory are not known. This review describes the current systems and rationale for studying memory formation, consolidation, and recall. Special attention is given to physiologic (hippocampal long-term potentiation) and behavioral animal models. The principles and methods described can be applied to studies of diverse clinical disorders.
