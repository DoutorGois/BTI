Rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal (nVH) lesions show postpubertal hypersensitivity to dopamine agonists, which may be reversed by neuroleptic treatment. In addition, the immobility response (IR) may be regulated by dopaminergic activity. We investigated the influence of the IR caused by clamping the neck of rats that had received bilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the ventral hippocampus at postnatal day 7 (PD7). At both ages, prepubertal (PD35) and postpubertal (PD56), the duration of the IR was significantly increased in animals with lesions when compared to controls. These findings indicate that nVH damage results in behavioral changes, such as enhancement of the IR, related to mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission.
