RATIONALE: Early-life adverse events, like maternal deprivation (MD), have been associated with the later development of mood and anxiety disorders. Scarce data are available describing behavioural and endocrine alterations in maternally deprived (DEP) animals during the periadolescent period. We hypothesize that a single episode of MD early in life would alter reward function and lead to a long-lasting behavioural and neuroendocrine changes during adolescence. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the effects of a single episode of MD in CD1 adolescent mice (postnatal day 35) on a range of tests for anxiety- and depression-related behaviours (open field, elevated plus maze and tail suspension test). We further assess whether these effects could affect cocaine self-administration behaviour. In order to correlate behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to stress, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were assessed in brain structures related to emotional and cognitive processes. RESULTS: During the cocaine self-administration, the time required for achieving the acquisition criteria was significantly increased and the breaking point values in progressive schedule were significantly reduced in DEP adolescent mice, suggesting impairment in rewarding functions. The behavioural tests also confirm an increase in anxiety- and depression-related behaviours in DEP adolescent mice. The results on BDNF level indicated a decrease in response to MD in amygdala and hippocampus, confirming the behavioural data. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated for the first time that a single episode of early MD can impair the motivation for cocaine consumption in adolescent mice and can be associated with anxiety- and depressive-like behaviour.
