starting by 6 h following diazepam injection and returning to approximately control values by 24 h. In situ hybridization showed elevated FGF-2 mRNA labeling in the hippocampal formation, mostly in the pyramidal layer of the CA1 and CA2 subfields and in the dentate gyrus hilar region. These results indicate that diazepam treatment up-regulates FGF-2 expression in select regions of the brain and suggest that GABA may promote neuroplasticity in concert with FGF-2.
