The [14C]2-deoxyglucose ( [14C]2-DG) uptake in the hippocampal formation of the rat was studied following enforced locomotor activity-induced theta (M theta). M theta was found to be essentially associated with an increase in 2-DG uptake in the stratum oriens of the hippocampal CA1-CA2 areas. These data contrast with our previous findings that physostigmine-induced theta (I theta) is specifically associated with a decrease in 2-DG uptake in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of hippocampal CA1-CA2 areas. When both of our sets of radioautographic data are considered together, M theta and I theta appear to have a distinct neurophysiological basis.
