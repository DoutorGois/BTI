The aim of this study was to investigate whether D-fenfluramine (FEN) releases 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) selectively from dorsal raphe (DR) terminals. Male Wistar rats, 180-200 g, were implanted with microdialysis probes ir the amygdala (Am; N = 5) and dorsal hippocampus (DH; N = 6) and 5-HT levels were measured by electrochemical detection. Under basal conditions, 5-HT levels were approximately 50 and 230 fmol per 30 min sample, in the Am and DH, respectively. FEN (10 mg/kg. ip) produced a 3-4-fold increase in 5-HT release in the Am, but not in the DH. Since the Am is mainly innervated by DR fibers while the DH receives 5-HT input chiefly from the median raphe (MR), the present results support the view that FEN selectively releases 5-HT from DR terminals.
