We have determined the functional properties of single AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and kainate receptor channels present in CA1 cells in hippocampal slices, to shed light on the relationship between single-channel behaviour and synaptic currents in these cells. To derive basic properties of AMPA and kainate channels activated by their excitatory transmitter, we examined outside-out patches exposed to glutamate. The kainate agonist SYM 2081, was used to confirm the presence of kainate receptors. Channels activated by glutamate or SYM 2081 exhibited conductance levels of 2-20 pS. Properties of single channels depended on the glutamate or AMPA concentration used. We observed a marked increase in mean channel conductance (gamma) from gamma = 6.9, to 11.2 pS, when glutamate was increased from 10 mum to 10 mm. The kinetic behaviour of AMPAR channels was also influenced by agonist concentration, with an increase in 'bursty' events at higher concentrations. In contrast, kainate channels were characterized by brief openings without bursts. Consistent with the view that 'bursty' events arose from AMPARs, these openings decreased in the presence of the AMPAR blocker GYKI 53655. Furthermore, our experiments revealed a concentration-dependent increase in the number of conductance states during an individual AMPAR opening; AMPAR channels displayed up to four distinct levels. Our results are consistent with the view that the AMPAR channel conductance depends on the number of transmitter molecules bound in CA1 cells. We consider the implications of these findings for the change in EPSC properties during long-term potentiation (LTP).
