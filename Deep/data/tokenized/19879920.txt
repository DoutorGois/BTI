Using the study-specific templates and optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM), this study investigated abnormalities in gray and white matter to provide depiction of the concurrent structural changes in 13 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) compared with 14 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Consistent with previous studies, patients with AD exhibited significant gray matter volume reductions mainly in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, superior/middle temporal gyrus, thalamus, cingulate gyrus, and superior/inferior parietal lobule. In addition, white matter volume reductions were found predominately in the temporal lobe, corpus callosum, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Furthermore, a number of additional white matter regions such as precentral gyrus, cingulate fasciculus, superior and inferior frontal gyrus, and sub-gyral in parietal lobe were also affected. The pattern of gray and white matter volume reductions helps us understand the underlying pathologic mechanisms in AD and potentially can be used as an imaging marker for the studies of AD in the future.
