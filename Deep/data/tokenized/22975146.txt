Alpha (alpha)-asarone is a major effective compound isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Acorus gramineus, which is widely used in clinical practice as an antiepileptic drug; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we have characterized the action of alpha-asarone on the excitability of rat hippocampal neurons in culture and on the epileptic activity induced by pentylenetetrazole or kainate injection in vivo. Under cell-attached configuration, the firing rate of spontaneous spiking was inhibited by application of alpha-asarone, which was maintained in the Mg(2+)-free solution. Under whole-cell configuration, alpha-asarone induced inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) of 248 +/- 33 muM, which was inhibited by a GABA(A) receptor blocker picotoxin and a competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline but not a specific glycine receptor inhibitor strychnine. Measurement of tonic GABA currents and miniature spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents indicated that alpha-asarone enhanced tonic GABAergic inhibition while left phasic GABAergic inhibition unaffected. In both pentylenetetrazole and kainate seizure models, alpha-asarone suppressed epileptic activity of mice by prolonging the latency to clonic and tonic seizures and reducing the mortality as well as the susceptibility to seizure in vivo presumably dependent on the activation of GABA(A) receptors. In summary, our results suggest that alpha-asarone inhibits the activity of hippocampal neurons and produces antiepileptic effect in central nervous system through enhancing tonic GABAergic inhibition.
