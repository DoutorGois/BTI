A patient with medically intractable seizures and mesial temporal sclerosis underwent a left anterior temporal lobectomy and amygdalohippocampectomy. After 4 months, his seizures recurred and a left temporal, subdural grid of electrodes was placed to localise his seizure focus. Stimulation through the grid evoked four distinct "memories", or experiential phenomena, despite absence of the ipsilateral medial temporal lobe. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of experiential phenomena evoked by cortical stimulation in the absence of the ipsilateral medial temporal lobe.
