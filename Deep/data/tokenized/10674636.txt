A train of low-frequency afferent stimuli (LFS, 1 Hz, 1000 pulses), given 60 min prior to a tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses), suppresses the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in which a short-term potentiation decreases gradually back to the pre-tetanic level within 40-50 min (LTP suppression). We investigated the effects of adenosine A1 or A2 receptor antagonists (8-cyclopentyltheophylline (8-CPT) and CP-66713, respectively) on LTP suppression in CA1 neurons of guinea pig hippocampal slices. When the LFS was delivered in the presence of 8-CPT (1 microM), LTP suppression was not significantly affected. However, when LFS was delivered in the presence of CP-66713 (10 microM), LTP suppression was inhibited, leading to successful LTP induction. These results indicate that endogenous adenosine, acting via A2 receptors, is involved in the mechanism of LTP suppression.
