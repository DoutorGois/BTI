Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain. The spectrum of tau pathologies expands beyond the traditionally discussed disease forms like Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and argyrophilic grain disease. Emerging entities and pathologies include globular glial tauopathies, primary age-related tauopathy, which includes neurofibrillary tangle dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and aging-related tau astrogliopathy. Clinical symptoms include frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal syndrome, Richardson syndrome, parkinsonism, pure akinesia with gait freezing and, rarely, motor neuron symptoms or cerebellar ataxia. Some disorders show specific neuroimaging features, while examination of the cerebrospinal fluid awaits markers for in vivo stratification of cases. The possibility of cell-to-cell propagation is a novel aspect of the pathogenesis of tauopathies, which is partly reflected by the hierarchic involvement of anatomic regions. This concept might have relevance for the development of therapies. For cost-effective screening for tau pathologies in neuropathologic practice, examination of the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia is recommended. Uncommon morphologies or unusually extensive forms of tau pathologies should raise the suspicion of a genetic background. Ongoing multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand the whole spectrum and significance of tau pathologies.
