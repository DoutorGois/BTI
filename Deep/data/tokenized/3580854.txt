The binding capacities of the novel antagonist pirenzepine and the agonist carbamylcholine were examined autoradiographically to compare their abilities to reduce the binding of 1-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-1-QNB). This technique, which is applicable to any muscarinic ligand, permits a direct comparison between the binding of carbamylcholine and pirenzepine in the same assay. Analysis of the binding curves generated by standard scintillation counting of whole-brain slices indicated that the ligands bound heterogeneously to muscarinic receptors in the brain. Following apposition of slides to tritium-sensitive film, the binding profile for each ligand was examined visually and by microdensitometry. Regional analyses indicated that the agonist carbamylcholine displayed highest potency for thalamic nuclei, lower potency for cortical regions, and the lowest affinity for layers of the hippocampus. The M1-selective ligand pirenzepine displayed the highest potency for the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, with lower inhibition levels in the cortex, and the lowest levels of inhibition found in the thalamus. The distribution of high affinity agonist sites was found to be distinct from the distribution of high-affinity antagonist binding sites. In a separate assay, the regional inhibition of pirenzepine and scopolamine was compared for the hippocampus and the forebrain. While scopolamine did not distinguish between muscarinic receptor sites in the hippocampus and cortex, pirenzepine inhibited [3H]-1-QNB labeling in the hippocampus significantly greater than in the cerebral cortex, providing additional evidence for the hypothesis that pirenzepine is a selective antagonist.
