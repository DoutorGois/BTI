An overview is presented of general principles for intracerebral grafting of embryonic brain tissue to the adult mammalian brain. Special reference is made to the development and use of the dissociated neuronal cell suspension method. Examples are drawn primarily from experiments where embryonic ventral mesencephalon is transplanted to adult striatum and embryonic septal-diagonal band area is transplanted to the hippocampal formation. Results related to the cell viability in vitro and in vivo and to axonal outgrowth are the main focuses of this overview.
