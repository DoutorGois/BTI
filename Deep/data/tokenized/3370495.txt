Neuropeptide Y (NPY) stimulates the hydrolysis of inositol phospholipid in rat brain miniprisms. The stimulation was two-fold in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus, and 1.5-fold in the striatum. NPY produced no significant effects on basal inositol monophosphate levels in hypothalamic miniprisms. However, those basal levels were much higher than in the other brain regions.
