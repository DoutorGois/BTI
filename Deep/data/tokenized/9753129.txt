Selective immunolesioning of the basal forebrain cholinergic system by 192 IgG-saporin, which leads to a dramatic loss of the cholinergic innervation in cortical and hippocampal regions, facilitates the development of hippocampal kindling in rats. The aim of the present study was to explore whether grafted cholinergic neurones are able to reverse the lesion-induced increase of seizure susceptibility. Intraventricular 192 IgG-saporin was administered to rats which 3 weeks later were implanted with rat embryonic, acetylcholine-rich septal-diagonal band tissue ('cholinergic grafts') or cortical tissue/vehicle ('sham grafts') bilaterally into the hippocampal formation. After 3 months, the grafted animals as well as non-lesioned control rats were subjected to daily hippocampal kindling stimulations. In the animals with cholinergic grafts, which had reinnervated the hippocampus and dentate gyrus bilaterally, there was a marked suppression of the development of seizures as compared with the hyperexcitable, sham-grafted rats. This effect was significantly correlated to the density of the graft-derived cholinergic innervation of the host hippocampal formation. The kindling rate in the rats with cholinergic grafts was similar to that in non-lesioned controls. These results provide further evidence that the intrinsic basal forebrain cholinergic system dampens kindling epileptogenesis and demonstrate that this function can be exerted also by grafted cholinergic neurones.
