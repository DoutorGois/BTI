The aim of the present study was to investigate whether changes in brain 5-HT concentrations affect the expression of BDNF mRNA in rat brain. Brain 5-HT concentration in the rat was elevated by combined treatment with tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan, tranylcypromine alone, by a single dose of the 5-HT releasing agent p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) or by the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor paroxetine. 5-HT was depleted by either multiple p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) or PCA injections. The extent of 5-HT depletion following pCPA or PCA was monitored using 5-HT immunocytochemistry. BDNF mRNA abundance in treated rats and the corresponding vehicle injected control rats was studied by in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH). Two hours after the combined administration of tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan BDNF mRNA abundance in the dentate gyrus was significantly decreased but increased in the frontal cortex. Tranylcypromine alone or a single injection of PCA had similar effects on BDNF mRNA expression to the combination of tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan, i.e. they caused significant reductions of BDNF mRNA expression in dentate gyrus and increased it in frontal cortex. Paroxetine also reduced BDNF mRNA in DG but was without effect in frontal cortex. Multiple injections of both pCPA or PCA resulted in marked reductions of 5-HT immunoreactive axons in the hippocampus, pCPA being more effective. Both drugs significantly increased BDNF mRNA abundances in the dentate gyrus. Multiple PCA injections also increased BDNF mRNA expression in parietal cortex, while pCPA induced 5-HT depletion was ineffective. These results suggests that 5-HT modulates BDNF mRNA levels in rat brain.
