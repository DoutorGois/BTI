The highest expression level of a 70-kDa heat shock protein family member Hspa2 is detected specifically in meiotic and post-meiotic male germ cells, which is reflected by original name of this protein, i.e., testis-specific Hsp70. However, this chaperon protein could be also detected in certain somatic tissues. Here, the extra-testicular expression pattern of mouse Hspa2 was analyzed. We found expression of Hspa2 in various epithelial cells including lining of bronchioles and oviduct, columnar epithelium of endometrium, epithelial reticular cells of thymus, transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder, or ependymal cells covering walls of the ventricular system of the brain. Surprisingly, Hspa2 was a putative secretory protein in intestine, endometrial glands and subcommissural organ. Hspa2 was detected in central and peripheral nervous system: in neuron's bodies and fiber tracts, in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, in enteric ganglia of the gastrointestinal tract. Hspa2 was also expressed in smooth muscles and at low level in immune system (in germinal centers associated with B-lymphocyte production). In addition to somatic tissues listed above, Hspa2 was detected in oocytes arrested at diplotene of the first meiotic division.
