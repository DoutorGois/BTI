PURPOSE: After focal status epilepticus, focal alterations of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) have been demonstrated in the epileptogenic zone by using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR)imaging (DWI). Effects of flumazenil on an epileptogenic focus have been demonstrated by EEG recordings, but not by functional MRI. We hypothesized that dynamic spatiotemporal alterations of brain diffusion of the epileptogenic focus after application of flumazenil will be detectable by DWI and correlate with the epileptogenic zone. METHODS: Twelve adult patients considered for epilepsy surgery with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; n = 7), extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETE; n = 2), and TLE+ETE (n = 3) were prospectively examined with DWI interictally (serving as baseline) and 10 min after application of 1 mg flumazenil i.v. RESULTS: The baseline interictal ADC was significantly elevated in the hippocampus on the ictogenic side in the patients with TLE (p = 0.002) as compared with healthy volunteers. The following changes of the mean ADC were seen in different regions of interest (ROIs) after injection of flumazenil: decreases in the hippocampus on the seizure-onset side by 14.8% (p = 0.005); decreases in the parahippocampal gyrus on both sides by 6.8% (epileptogenic side; p = 0.044) or 7.9% (nonepileptogenic side; NS), respectively; decreases in the cortex on the nonictogenic side by 7.9% (p = 0.047); and no significant changes of the ADC in the other ROIs. CONCLUSIONS: ADC decreases measured after application of flumazenil were seen in the seizure-onset zone as revealed by EEG and structural MRI and are an indicator of focus localization in patients with TLE.
