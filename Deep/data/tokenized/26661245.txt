We tested hypothesis that activation of the prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor (IP receptor) signaling pathway in cerebral microvessels plays an important role in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP). In human brain microvascular endothelial cells activation of IP receptor with the stable analogue of PGI2, iloprost, stimulated expression of amyloid precursor protein and a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), resulting in an increased production of the neuroprotective and anticoagulant molecule, soluble APPalpha (sAPPalpha). Selective agonist of IP receptor, cicaprost, and adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, also enhanced expression of amyloid precursor protein and ADAM10. Notably, in cerebral microvessels of IP receptor knockout mice, protein levels of APP and ADAM10 were reduced. In addition, iloprost increased protein levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. PPARdelta-siRNA abolished iloprost-augmented protein expression of ADAM10. In contrast, GW501516 (a selective agonist of PPARdelta) upregulated ADAM10 and increased production of sAPPalpha. Genetic deletion of endothelial PPARdelta (ePPARdelta(-/-)) in mice significantly reduced cerebral microvascular expression of ADAM10 and production of sAPPalpha. In vivo treatment with GW501516 increased sAPPalpha content in hippocampus of wild type mice but not in hippocampus of ePPARdelta(-/-) mice. Our findings identified previously unrecognized role of IP-PPARdelta signal transduction pathway in the production of sAPPalpha in cerebral microvasculature.
