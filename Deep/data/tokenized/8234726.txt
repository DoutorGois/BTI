The authors describe a four-coil surface phased-array coil for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the temporal lobes. On the basis of measurements in a phantom, the signal-to-noise ratio of the array is 1.67 times or more better than that obtained with a standard quadrature head coil in the region of the hippocampi. The higher sensitivity of this phased array permits use of imaging pulse sequences for which the head coil is inadequate.
