Cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization at high magnification in some rat brain regions where CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) is thought to produce its pharmacological effects. The labeling of the dentate gyrus and the sparse but intensively stained cells found in the CA1 layer, stratum radiatum and hilus could correspond to interneurons involved in hippocampal neural activity, in agreement with excitatory responses induced by local injection of CCK-8. The intense labeling of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus and more generally the presence of CCK mRNA in the periaqueductal gray and thalamus ventrobasal nuclei could account for the various effects of CCK in pain transmission.
