Immunohistochemical study of the cholinergic innervation of the hippocampal cells containing glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and calcium binding proteins: parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D28k (CB) and calretinin (CR) was conducted on 5 adult rat brains. Analysis of sections with double immunostaining for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT; the marker of cholinergic cells, fibres and terminals) and respectively either GAD or PV, CB, CR, using confocal laser-scanning microscope shows that the intensive cholinergic innervations receive GAD, PV and CB-positive hippocampal cells. Cholinergic afferentiations of the CR-positive neurones are considerably fewer.
