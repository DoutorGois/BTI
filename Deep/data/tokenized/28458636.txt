Relating individual differences in cognitive abilities to neural substrates in older adults is of significant scientific and clinical interest, but remains a major challenge. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of cognitive aging have mainly focused on the amplitude of fMRI response, which does not measure neuronal selectivity and has led to some conflicting findings. Here, using local regional heterogeneity analysis, or Hcorr , a novel fMRI analysis technique developed to probe the sparseness of neuronal activations as an indirect measure of neuronal selectivity, we found that individual differences in two different cognitive functions, episodic memory and letter verbal fluency, are selectively related to Hcorr -estimated neuronal selectivity at their corresponding brain regions (hippocampus and visual-word form area, respectively). This suggests a direct relationship between cognitive function and neuronal selectivity at the corresponding brain regions in healthy older adults, which in turn suggests that age-related neural dedifferentiation might contribute to rather than compensate for cognitive decline in healthy older adults. Additionally, the capability to estimate neuronal selectivity across brain regions with a single data set and link them to cognitive performance suggests that, compared to fMRI-adaptation-the established fMRI technique to assess neuronal selectivity, Hcorr might be a better alternative in studying normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases, both of which are associated with widespread changes across the brain.
