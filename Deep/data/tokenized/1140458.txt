Different stages of natural slow-wave sleep were studied in rabbits with the aid of spectro-correlation analysis using the direct input of data to the computer. The main findings regularly observed after sleep were as follows: the decrease of synchronization between biopotentials led from different brain structures, the absence of uniform Q-band rhythms and the reduced coherence of this band, phase discrepancy between low-frequency components. Thereupon the state of inhibition is concluded to be characterized by the spatio-temporal discrepancy in the brain electric activity.
