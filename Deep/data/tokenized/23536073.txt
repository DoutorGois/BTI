Many presynaptic transcripts have been observed in axons, yet their role in synapse development remains unknown. Using visually and pharmacologically isolated presynaptic terminals from dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, we found that ribosomes and beta-catenin mRNA preferentially localize to recently formed boutons. Locally translated beta-catenin accumulates at presynaptic terminals, where it regulates synaptic vesicle release dynamics. Thus, local translation of beta-catenin is a newly described mechanism for axons to independently functionalize nerve terminals at great distances from cellular somata.
