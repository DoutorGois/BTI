Dynamics of the hippocampal theta-activity was studied during performance of a stably elaborated habit with drinking reinforcement. It has been shown that during running and in other forms of behaviour, belonging to the class of voluntary movements, the theta-activity takes place within the band of 7.5--12 c/s; during emotional stress without locomotion its frequency amounts to 6--7.5 c/s, during lapping movements it is equal to 5-6 c/s, during emotionally motivated and behavioral inactivation--to 2.5--5 c/s. In accordance with the data obtained in conditions of spontaneous behaviour, the observed facts allow to consider the wide spectrum of the hippocampal theta-rhythm not as a continuous, one-band, functionally uniform frequency, reflecting the continuum of arousal by its intensity,--but as consisting of discrete frequency bands which are functionally connected with different forms of behavior.
