OBJECTIVES: Rufinamide, a voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker, is widely used for the clinical treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated that VGSC blockers have neuroprotective properties against ischemic damage following experimental cerebral ischemia. However, protective effects of rufinamide against cerebral ischemic insults have not been addressed. Therefore, in the present study, we firstly examined neuroprotective effects of rufinamide using a gerbil model of transient global cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Gerbils were established by the occlusion of common carotid arteries for 5 min. The gerbils were divided into vehicle-treated sham-operated group, vehicle-treated ischemia-operated group, 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated sham-operated groups, and 50 and 100 mg/kg rufinamide-treated ischemia-operated groups. Rufinamide was administrated intraperitoneally once daily for 3 days before ischemic surgery. To examine neuroprotective effects of rufinamide, we carried out cresyl violet staining, neuronal nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-Jade B histofluorescence staining. In addition, we examined gliosis using immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes) and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (a marker for microglia). RESULTS: We found that pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide effectively protected pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) area after transient global cerebral ischemia. In addition, pre-treatment with 100 mg/kg of rufinamide significantly attenuated activations of astrocytes and microglia in the ischemic CA1 area. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that rufinamide can display neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemic insults and that its neuroprotective effect may involve the attenuation of ischemia-induced glial activation.
