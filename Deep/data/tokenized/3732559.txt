Functional activity of hypothalamic structures was studied in endocrinological and electrophysiological experiments as well as in vitro studies. Functional changes of limbic-hypothalamic relations and control mechanisms of gonadotropin secretion under the effect of pineal polypeptides and in relation to lactation, were analysed.
