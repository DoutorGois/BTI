We describe a model of self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE) induced by stimulation of the perforant path in free-running rats. In this model, seizures can be transiently suppressed by intrahippocampal injection of a blocker of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid/ kainate synapses but return in the absence of further stimulation when the drug ceases to act. However, seizures are irreversibly abolished by blockers of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors given locally or systemically. SSSE is enhanced by substance P and its agonists and blocked by its antagonists. SSSE induces novel expression of substance P-like immunoreactivity in hippocampal principal cells. These changes and those in other limbic peptides may contribute to the maintenance of SSSE and to the modulation of hippocampal excitability during epileptic seizures. NMDA
