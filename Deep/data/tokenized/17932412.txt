In the adult brain, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) can be beneficial by contributing to memory formation or can be detrimental by causing neurodegeneration, and it is of great interest to understand this dichotomy. Currently, it remains largely unknown which mechanisms are regulated by Cdk5. Recent studies by Hawasli et al. and Qu et al., however, are significant advances towards mechanistic insights. Hawasli et al. demonstrate that Cdk5 regulates protease-directed degradation of an important synaptic receptor, which impacts memory formation. Qu et al. show that Cdk5 inhibits the activity of an enzyme that metabolizes reactive oxygen species, which then leads to neurodegeneration. These two studies hold promise for establishing treatments to prevent cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
