The entorhinal afferences to Fascia dentata and Stratum lacunoso-moleculare of CA1 could be visualised by means of anterograde axoplasmic transport 5 days after L-[5-3H]-proline injection into the entorhinal cortex. Furthermore, the macromolecule-bound tracer was found in the perikarya of granule cells and mossy fibres as well as in the cell bodies of the CA1 pyramids. These findings indicate that labelled material, released from the axonal terminals of the perforant pathway, is taken up by these neurons.
