Nucleolar protein 1 (Nol1) is a cell cycle dependent gene highly expressed in proliferating tissues. In order to test whether Nol1 could be used as a marker of dividing neural stem cells within mouse brain, Nol1 expression was analyzed using mouse carrying a gene trap modification of Nol1 gene. High Nol1 expression was found within the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, cerebral and cerebellar cortex. Nol1 was expressed not only in the dividing cells within the brain, but as well in the postmitotic neurons. This suggested a general role of Nol1 in assembling of ribosomes in cells with high protein production.
