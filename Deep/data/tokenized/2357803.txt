The dendritic tree was quantified in granule cells from the dentate gyrus in rats at weaning age. While the number of dendritic branch segments was at adult levels, the length of dendritic segments was shorter than in adults. There were sex differences in the number of dendritic segments (female greater than male) but not in the length of individual segments or in the total length of the dendritic tree. Comparisons to adult sex differences indicate that the sex differences in the dendritic tree of weaning age rats are not permanent.
