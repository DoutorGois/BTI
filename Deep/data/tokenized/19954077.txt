OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of prenatal and postnatal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure on spatial learning and memory, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B) mRNA and protein level in frontal cortex and hippocampus of rat pups and to explore the mechanism of developmental neurotoxicity induced by PFOS. METHODS: Twenty-eight pregnant rats were randomly divided into three groups in proportion of 3:2:2, including control group (C), low dose group (L) and high dose group (H) by means of randomized number table, which respectively received 0, 7.2, 14.4 mg/kg PFOS feed from pregnancy day 0 to postnatal day (PND) 30 by free feedings. The animal models of prenatal and postnatal non-exposure (CC), prenatal exposure (LC and HC), postnatal exposure (CL and CH), and prenatal and postnatal exposure (LL and HH) to PFOS were established by cross-fostering method. The spatial learning and memory were measured by water maze experiment,the NR2B mRNA levels in frontal cortex of rat pups was determined with semi-quantitative RT-PCR, NR2B protein express in cerebral cortex (frontal and temporal cortex) and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, CA4 and DG regions) of rat pups was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The escape latency of CL, CH, LL and HH groups pups in water maze experiment were (99.83 +/- 25.77) s, (111.30 +/- 17.82) s, (106.40 +/- 18.71) s, (107.70 +/- 16.85) s, and longer as compared with CC group [(54.90 +/- 26.69) s] (q value were 4.349, 4.773, 6.026 and 5.641, respectively, P <0.01). The number of errors of HH group rat pups entering dead end was (22.30 +/- 7.56) at the training day 4, and it was significantly higher than that of CC group (9.80 +/- 4.64) (q = 5.173, P < 0.01). The NR2B mRNA levels of frontal cortex of pups in HC group at PND1, and LC group, HC group and HH group at PND14 were (0.167 +/- 0.008), (0.364 +/- 0.035), (0.341 +/- 0.030) and (0.328 +/- 0.045) respectively,which were significantly lower than CC group (0.271 +/- 0.060) and (0.465 +/- 0.067) (q values were 3.547, 3.739, 4.597 and 5.006, respectively, P< 0.05 ). The results of immunohistochemistry indicated that NR2B protein express of the hippocampus CA1 region of pups in LC group was (0.091 +/- 0.005), and showed significant lower than CC group which was (0.123 +/- 0.009) at PND1 (q = 5.209, P <0.05). At PND14, the effect of PFOS extended to cerebral cortex and hippocampus regions. At PND28, the effects of PFOS were showed in hippocampus CA1, CA3 and temporal cortex regions. CONCLUSION: Prenatal and postnatal exposure to PFOS should result in the spatial learning and memory damage,and the mechanism might be possibly involved in the decrease of NR2B level in cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation regions.
