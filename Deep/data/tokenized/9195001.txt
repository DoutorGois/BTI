The effect of protein-energy malnutrition on the muscarinic receptor density as indicated by 3H-N-methylscopolamine binding, and acetylcholinesterase activity was studied in several brain areas (hippocampus, motor area, somatosensory area, and basal ganglia) of adult female rats. Malnutrition tended to cause a decrease in muscarinic receptors in the motor cortex (undernourished 350.0 +/- 33.5 vs. control 410.0 +/- 26.9 fmol/mg protein) and somatosensory cortex (undernourished 357.1 +/- 35.9 vs. control 416.7 +/- 29.4 fmol/mg protein). However, significant decreases in muscarinic receptor occurred in the hippocampus (undernourished 319.2 +/- 31.7 vs. control 403.1 +/- 43.6 fmol/mg protein) and basal ganglia (undernourished 297.0 +/- 11.8 vs. control 401.3 +/- 17.7 fmol/mg protein). No significant differences in acetylcholinesterase activity or protein content were observed between control and undernourished animals in any of the brain areas studied.
