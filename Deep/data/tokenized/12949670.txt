We studied the effects of individual or combination treatment with monoclonal antibodies 5F5-B6 in ultralow doses specifically marking mossy fibers in rat hippocampus and antibodies to S100 protein during long-term post-tetanic potentiation in hippocampal slices. The possible mechanisms of changes produced by therapeutic administration of antibodies in ultralow doses were revealed.
