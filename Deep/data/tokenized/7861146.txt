Slices of hippocampal area CA1 were used to test inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism for their effects on glutamate/aspartate release from the CA3-derived Schaffer collateral, commissural, and ipsilateral associational terminals. Test compounds [3 microM nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and 1 microM 3-[3-(4-chlorobenzyl)-3-tert-butylthio-5- isopropylindol-2-yl]-2,2-dimethyl-propanoic acid (MK-886)] that reduced the production and release of 5-lipoxygenase metabolites also selectively reduced the K(+)-evoked release of aspartate. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (100 microM) selectively enhanced the release of glutamate. At a concentration (100 microM) that nonselectively depressed the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites, NDGA markedly depressed the release of aspartate, glutamate, and GABA. An inhibitor of the 12-lipoxygenase and an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase did not affect the K(+)-evoked release of any transmitter amino acid. These results suggest that a 5-lipoxygenase product selectively enhances aspartate release and a cyclooxygenase product selectively depresses glutamate release. They are also consistent with previous evidence that arachidonic acid and/or platelet-activating factor enhances the release and depresses the uptake of glutamate and aspartate. The K(+)-evoked release of excitatory amino acids is much more sensitive to modulation by lipid mediators than is GABA release. Activation of NMDA receptors may enhance the K(+)-evoked release of glutamate and aspartate from CA1 slices by stimulating the production and release of lipid modulators.
