This study shows a decrease in soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor-alpha (sAbetaPPalpha) levels, but no change in sAbetaPPbeta, in the rat hippocampus during healthy aging, associated with the weaker expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of hippocampal slices. Exogenous application of recombinant sAbetaPPalpha increases NMDAR activation in aged animals and could rescue the age-related LTP deficits described. In contrast, it does not affect basal synaptic transmission or glutamate release. These results indicate that improving synaptic sAbetaPPalpha availability at synapses helps in reducing the functional NMDAR-related deregulation of hippocampal networks linked to aging.
