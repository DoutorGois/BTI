Electrical activity of the olfactory bulb, olfactory tubercle amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus and neocortex during physiological sleep was studied in chronic experiments in unanesthetized unrestrained dogs;A synchronous high-frequency sinusoidal rhythm of 36-42 Hz was found in the amygdala and olfactory structures in the paradoxical phase of sleepmthis olfacto-amygdaloid rhythm, unlike that of aroused animals, was not the result of olfactory stimulation and persisted in dogs with trachael breathing; Its generation is probably of central origin; A comparison of the dynamics of this electrical activity with somatic, autonomic and teeg-correlates of sleep gives reasons to regard the olfacto-amygdaloid rhythm of 36-42 Hz as a specific EEG-correlate of the paradoxical sleep stage in dogs
