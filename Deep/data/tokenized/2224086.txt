The obtained findings have shown that dominating inter-impulse intervals in the area of 1000 and more ms, and multimodality of their distribution occur in benzene, toluol, xylol injection within time-structure of some neurons activity of sensomotor cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and lateral hypothalamus. The particularities of neuronal activity of the studied structures were revealed by the injection of chemical substances in natural and artificially produced food motivation. The mechanism of neurons activity blockade in benzene and its homologous injection was suggested to be linked with their influence upon mediator process, and perhaps, peptide factors participating in the formation of neuronal activity.
