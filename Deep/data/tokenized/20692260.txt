Production of new neurons continues throughout life in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and is influenced by both endocrine and social factors. In sheep parturition is associated with the establishment of a selective bond with the young based on an olfactory learning. The possibility exists that endocrine changes at parturition together with interactions with the young modulate cell proliferation in the neurogenic zones. In the present study, we first investigated the existence of cell proliferation in sheep. Newly born cells labeled by the cell proliferation marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were found in the SVZ, the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and the DG and completely co-localized with Ki-67, another mitotic marker. Forty to 50% of the BrdU-labeled cells contained GFAP suggestive of the presence of neural stem cells. Secondly, parturition with or without interactions with the lamb for 2 days, down-regulated the number of BrdU-labeled cells in the 3 proliferation sites in comparison to no pregnancy. An additional control provided evidence that this effect is specific to early postpartum period: estrus with interactions with males did not affect cell proliferation. Our results provide the first characterization of neural cell proliferation in the SVZ, the DG and unexpectedly in the MOB of adult sheep. We hypothesize that the down-regulation of cell proliferation observed in the early postpartum period could facilitate the olfactory perceptual and memory demands associated with maternal behavior by favouring the survival and integration of neurons born earlier.
