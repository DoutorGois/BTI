Amylin, a 37-amino-acid amyloidogenic peptide, bears biophysical similarities to the amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) deposited in Alzheimer's disease. Using embryonic rat hippocampal cultures we tested whether amylin induces neurotoxicity similar to that previously observed with A beta(1-40). Treatment with human amylin(1-37) resulted in prominent toxicity as assessed by phase-contrast microscopy and quantification of lactate dehydrogenase in the medium. Amylin-induced neurotoxicity was morphologically similar to that induced by A beta(1-40). In contrast, the nonamyloidogenic rat amylin showed negligible neurotoxicity despite having 95% sequence similarity to human amylin. Only full-length human amylin was toxic; various amylin peptide fragments including amino acid residues 20-29 were nontoxic at similar concentrations. These studies suggest that unrelated amyloidogenic peptides like human amylin and A beta can adopt a similar neurotoxic conformation in vitro. Similar conformation-dependent neurotoxicity may drive the prominent neurite degeneration around compacted but not diffuse deposits of A beta in Alzheimer's disease.
