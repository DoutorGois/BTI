OBJECTIVE: To investigate changes of learning ability and somatostatin (SS) changes after positive acceleration (+Gz) exposures. METHOD: Eighty male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group (Con), +6 Gz/3 min group (+6 Gz), and +10 Gz/3 min group (+10 Gz), 8 rats in each group. Changes of learning ability in rats were observed at 0 d, 2 d, 4 d and 6 d after +Gz exposure. SS in hippocampus was measured by RIA at 0 d, 2 d and 4 d after +Gz exposures (there were 8 rats every time, in each group). RESULT: In Y-maze test, number of correct response decreased significantly (P<0.01), and total reaction time increased significantly (P<0.01) in +6 Gz and +10 Gz groups as compared with control group; number of correct response and total reaction time in +10 Gz group changed significantly at 0 d (P<0.01 or P<0.05) as compared with +6 Gz group. RIA showed that, content of SS in hippocampus declined at 0 d and 2 d (P<0.05 or P<0.01) in +6 Gz and +10 Gz groups as compared with control group. CONCLUSION: +Gz exposure could impair learning ability of rats, and inhibit expression of SS in hippocampus.
