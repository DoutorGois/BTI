The article reviews the literature data and results obtained by the authors concerning synaptic plasticity and remodeling of synaptic organelles in the central nervous system. Modern techniques of laser scanning confocal microscopy and serial thin sectioning for in vivo and in vitro studies of dendritic spines including a correlation between morphological changes and synaptic transmission efficiency are discussed, particularly, in relation to long-term potentiation. Organization of different types of dendritic spines and involvement of filopodia in spine genesis are examined. Significance of serial ultrathin sections for unbiased quantitative stereological analysis and three-dimensional reconstructions is discussed. The contact of one dendritic spine with two presynaptic boutons (multiple synapses) on both CA1 mushroom dendritic spines is discussed. The analyzed findings suggest new ideas for organization and functioning of synapses.
