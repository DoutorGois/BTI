In recent years the present authors and others have sought to determine the neurochemical composition of the dilated neuronal processes found within neuritic plaques of patients with Alzheimer's disease. To date a number of neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems have been observed within different plaques, yet at present it is unclear whether individual human plaques contain more than one transmitter substance. In the present study a highly sensitive dual-immunolabeling procedure was employed and it was demonstrated that substance P and somatostatin-immunoreactive profiles coexist within single senile plaques of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Coexistence of somatostatin and substance P immunoreactivity within plaques was observed in the hippocampus and amygdala but not in the neocortex, although the latter region contained plaques within which somatostatin and substance P existed alone. The frequency with which we observed one or more neuropeptide within plaques was relatively low and in fact most plaques contained neither substance P nor somatostatin immunoreactivity. In addition, a large number of swollen peptidergic processes were observed outside of plaques. The significance of these observations with respect to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease is discussed.
