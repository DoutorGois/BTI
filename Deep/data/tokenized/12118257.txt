Here we report that low concentrations of alcohol (1-3 mM) increased Cl(-) currents gated by a recombinant GABA(A) receptor, alpha(4)beta(2)delta, by 40-50% in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We also found greater hippocampal expression of receptors containing alpha(4) and delta subunits, using a rat model of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in which 1-3 mM alcohol preferentially enhanced GABA-gated currents, and low doses of alcohol attenuated anxiety and behavioral reactivity. The alcohol sensitivity of delta-containing receptors may underlie the reinforcing effects of alcohol during PMS, when eye saccade responses to low doses of alcohol are increased.
