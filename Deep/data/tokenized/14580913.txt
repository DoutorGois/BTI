The cell-substrate interaction of primary hippocampal neurones with thin films of TiN was studied in vitro. TiN films of different surface chemistries and topographies were deposited by pulsed DC reactive magnetron sputtering and closed field unbalanced magnetron sputter ion plating by Teer Coatings Ltd., Hartlebury, UK to result in TiN films with similar surface chemistries but different topographical features. TiN films were characterised using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The neuron-substrate interaction was examined using environmental scanning electron microscopy (FEG-ESEM) for morphological information. Bromodeoxyuridine and TUNEL assays were used to identify proliferating neurones as well as apoptotic neurones. Fluorescent staining for MAP-2 was used to label neuronal network formation. Primary hippocampal neurones were found to attach and spread to all of the TiN film chemistries and topographies investigated. Neuronal network morphology appeared to be more preferential on the nitrogen rich TiN films and also with reduced nanotopographical features.
