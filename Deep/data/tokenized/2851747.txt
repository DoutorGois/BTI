We have studied the regulation of adrenal function in male rats treated neonatally with monosodium glutamate (MSG) and in littermate controls. When 6-7 months old, MSG-treated rats presented reduced body, adrenal and pituitary weight, obesity, atrophy of the optic nerve and damage of the arcuate nuclei (ARN) of the hypothalamus. MSG-treated rats showed increased serum corticosterone (CORT) levels under resting conditions; after ether stress the increase in serum CORT was greater in MSG animals when compared to littermate controls. Plasma ACTH followed the same trend although it reached significance after ether stress only. Both circulating CORT and ACTH were normally suppressed by dexamethasone (DEX) administration. Levels of corticosteroid binding globulin were also increased, whereas daily circadian rhythm of serum CORT was blunted. We also determined cytosolic receptors in areas suggested to participate in the negative feedback of glucocorticoids at the central level. Binding of (3H)-DEX in MSG rats was similar to controls in hippocampus, whole hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, but a significant reduction (approximately equal to 50%) was obtained after microdissection in the area normally occupied by the ARN, without changes in the ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus. These results suggest that the ARN may be involved in the regulation of the pituitary-adrenal axis, although the abnormalities observed in the MSG syndrome partially differ from those in rats with hippocampal damage, previously studied in our laboratory.
