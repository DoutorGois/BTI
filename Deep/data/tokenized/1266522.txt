In 16 rabbits with chronic implanted electrodes the authors convened an electrostimulation of the hypocampus, the amygdale body and new cortex which brought to emotional-affective and EEG convulsive reactions. These reactions were inhibited by karbamazepine (150 mg/kg) and methindion (100 and 200 mg/kg) introduced into the gastrum. Karbamazepine possessed most inhibiting effect. The tranquillizing effect of methindion exceedes its anticonvulsive action, due to which it can be used both as an anticonvulsant and tranquilizing preparation. For this reason its combined effect should be most effective in temporal epilepsy.
