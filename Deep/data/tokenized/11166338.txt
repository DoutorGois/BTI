Previous studies showed that the type II Ca(2+)/calmodulin- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases (CaMKII and PKA) are affected by long-term antidepressant treatment in presynaptic and somatodendritic compartments, respectively. This study describes the long-term effects of the selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor reboxetine on PKA and CaMKII, in both the microtubule and subsynaptosomal fractions of rat brain. Unlike other antidepressants, chronic reboxetine induced in the cerebrocortical soluble and microtubule fractions a decrease in the [(32)P]cAMP binding to the type II PKA regulatory subunit. No change in the cAMP-dependent endogenous phosphorylation of the protein substrate, microtubule-associated protein 2 was observed. In the hippocampal subsynaptosomal fractions (synaptic vesicles and synaptosomal membranes) reboxetine induced a robust increase in the activity but not in the expression of CaMKII. An increase in the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of presynaptic substrates was also detected. These findings showed that reboxetine modulates post-receptor signal transduction systems in rat brain.
