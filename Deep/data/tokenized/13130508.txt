We have investigated the role of dopaminergic receptors in modulation of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) expression in rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, two brain regions important for cognition. We found that FGF-2 expression is upregulated by quinpirole, a D2 agonist, in prefrontal cortex and to a lesser extent in hippocampus. This modulation was specific for dopamine D2 receptors because no effect was observed when the dopamine D1 and D3 agonists, SKF38393 and 7-OH-DPAT, respectively, were administered. Our findings show that activation of dopaminergic D2 receptors modulates FGF-2 expression in rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Our data highlight the complex modulation of FGF-2 expression in limbic areas pointing to this trophic molecule as a putative target of drugs used against acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.
