High-frequency activation of the entorhinal cortical (perforant path) inputs to the rat dentate gyrus can produce a long-term potentiation (LTP) of perforant path-dentate evoked responses. In this paper we examined the enhanced LTP effects produced by coactivation of septal and entorhinal inputs to the dentate gyrus. Trains of electrical stimulation applied to the two inputs were found to increase the magnitude of LTP to a level above that produced by trains applied to the perforant path alone. The largest LTP increments were observed when the septal trains were applied less than 100 ms prior to the perforant path trains. If the septal trains followed the perforant path trains there was no additional increment in LTP magnitude, regardless of the intertrain interval. The relationship of this cooperativity effect to mechanisms of associative learning is discussed.
