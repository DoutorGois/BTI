BACKGROUND: The protein p11 (also called S100A10) is downregulated in human and rodent depressive-like states. Considerable experimental evidence also implicates p11 in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs and electroconvulsive seizures, in part due to its interaction with specific serotonin receptors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been linked to the therapeutic activity of antidepressants in rodent models and humans. In the current study, we investigated whether BDNF regulates p11 in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We utilized primary neuronal cultures, in vivo analyses of transgenic mice, and behavioral techniques to assess the effects of BDNF on p11. RESULTS: Results indicate that BDNF stimulates p11 expression through tropomyosin-related kinase B (trkB) receptors and via the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced changes in p11 in vivo correlate with changes in ligand binding to the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B, the subcellular localization of which is known to be regulated by p11. Behavioral studies demonstrate that p11 knockout mice are insensitive to the antidepressant actions of BDNF. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data demonstrate that p11 levels are regulated by BDNF in vitro and in vivo and that the antidepressant-like effect of BDNF in two well-established behavioral models requires p11. These data support a role for p11 in the antidepressant activity of neurotrophins.
