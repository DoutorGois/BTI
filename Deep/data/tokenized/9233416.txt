A series of 54 patients operated on for temporal epileptogenic lesions is reported: 36 had slow growing tumours, 18 supratentorial cavernous angiomas. The patients were divided into two different groups according to the presence of seizures controlled (group 1) or not controlled (group 2) by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). All the patients underwent preoperative scalp EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They were operated on by pure lesionectomy, associated with amygdalo-hippocampectomy in 8 cases of uncontrolled seizures. Postoperatively they underwent MRI examination which revealed an incomplete lesionectomy in 12 cases. Patients were followed up after surgery for at least 2 years, 6 of them were reoperated on for the persistence (or regrowth) of the tumour. The results of epilepsy outcome are reported. These cases underline the importance of preoperative electroclinical study, in order to determine the relationship between lesion location and epileptic focus. If good concordance is present, a complete lesionectomy is enough to cure the patient. In other cases associated amygdalo-hippocampectomy leads to better results, while more complicated cases may need preoperative stereo-EEG studies.
