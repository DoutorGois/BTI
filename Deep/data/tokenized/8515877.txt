We have analyzed by in situ hybridization the distribution of Fx (an actin-sequestering peptide) mRNA in the brain of young and old rats. The strongest Fx mRNA-specific hybridization signal was located in the hippocampo-entorhinal cortex; this mRNA was also found in the piriform cortex, amygdala, lateral septum and neocortex. Northern blot analysis confirmed the prominent expression of the Fx transcript in the hippocampus and showed a notably lower amount of this mRNA in the hippocampus of old rats suggesting an influence of aging on the expression of this gene. The possible implication of Fx in synaptic plasticity and in long-term potentiation is discussed.
