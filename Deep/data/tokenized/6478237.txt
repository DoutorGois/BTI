In an appetitive learning task in mice, stimulation of the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) 30 min after training produced an improvement in retention 24 h later, as well as faster extinction of conditioning. This effect persisted in animals with bilateral lesions of the perforant path. In addition, the threshold for hippocampal after-discharges produced by LEC stimulation was raised significantly in perforant-path lesioned animals. The results indicate a functional dissociation between hippocampal and cortical mechanisms involved in memory consolidation.
