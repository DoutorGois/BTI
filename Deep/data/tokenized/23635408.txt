BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition with increased risk for further cognitive decline. A considerable challenge lies in predicting which patients will eventually convert to dementia. OBJECTIVE: To study prediction of dementia in MCI using neuropsychological tests, commonly used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and hippocampal volume. METHODS: Twenty-one MCI patients converting to dementia, 21 stable MCI patients, and 26 controls were included in the study with a follow-up time of two years. The study participants underwent comprehensive examinations at inclusion: a neuropsychological assessment comprising 20 tests, MRI scanning with subsequent hippocampal volumetry, and CSF analyses of T-tau, P-tau, and Abeta42. RESULTS: Neuropsychological tests, hippocampal volume, and the CSF markers Abeta42, P-tau, and T-tau all predicted conversion from MCI to dementia. A combination of all classes of markers was the most successful at predicting dementia (AUC 0.96) with a memory test (RAVLT) as the best individual predictor (AUC 0.93). Similar findings are reported for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSION: Neuropsychological tests were the best individual predictors of dementia. A combination of markers improved the predictive ability with the combination of neuropsychological tests, CSF, and hippocampal volume as the best predictors of dementia.
