The effects of alpha-tocopherol on neurons of fetal rat brain were studied in tissue culture. alpha-Tocopherol supported the survival and enhanced neurite extension of neurons cultured from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and septum. The survival effect was observed at concentrations of 10(-9) to 10(-6) M. More than 60% of the cortical neurons could survive for 9 days at 10(-7) or 10(-6) M alpha-tocopherol, whereas almost all neurons died within 2 days in its absence. These results suggest that alpha-tocopherol may be involved in mechanisms regulating neuronal survival and neurite formation in the central nervous system, and indicate that alpha-tocopherol may be an excellent reagent to facilitate neuronal survival in culture.
