Excitatory and inhibitory ionotropic receptors are regulated by protein kinases and phosphatases, which are localized to specific subcellular locations by one of several anchoring proteins. One of these is the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP150), which confers spatial specificity to protein kinase A and protein phosphatase 2B in the rat brain. The distribution of AKAP150 was examined at rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell asymmetric and symmetric post-synaptic densities and with respect to the distribution of markers of excitatory (vesicular glutamate transporter 1, glutamate receptor subunit 1) and inhibitory receptors (vesicular GABA transporter, GABA receptor type A beta2/3 subunits, gephyrin) and the Golgi marker, trans-Golgi network glycoprotein 38. AKAP150 was close to asymmetric synapses, consistent with numerous molecular and biochemical studies suggesting its interaction with components of the excitatory postsynaptic density. In contrast, we did not find AKAP150-immunoreactivity associated with inhibitory synapses in rat CA1 neurons, despite reports demonstrating an in vitro interaction between AKAP150 and GABA receptor type A receptor beta subunits, and the reported co-localization of these proteins in rat hippocampal cultures. There was some overlap between AKAP150 and GABA receptor type A receptor beta2/3-immunoreactivity intracellularly in perinuclear clusters. These findings support previous work indicating the integration of kinase and phosphatase activity at excitatory synapses by AKAP150, but do not support a role for selective targeting of AKAP150 and its accompanying proteins to inhibitory synapses.
