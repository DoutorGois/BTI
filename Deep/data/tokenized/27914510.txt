The aim of the study was to determine the effect of maternal diets administered since day 1 of gestation and containing dairy lipids or vegetable oils differing in the supply of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) (equilibrated or deficient) and of Lactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum) on the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) accretion in the pups at postnatal day 14 in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) for brain structures and in the liver and adipose tissue for peripheral tissues. Maternal milk fatty acid composition was also assessed by analyzing the fatty acid composition of the gastric content of the pups. DHA was higher in mice supplemented with L. fermentum than in mice in the deficient group in HC and PFC and also in liver and adipose tissue. This increase could be linked to the slight but significant increase in C18:3n-3 in the maternal milk. This proportion was comparable in the dairy lipid group for which the brain DHA level was the highest. L. fermentum may have a key role in the protection of the brain during the perinatal period via the neuronal accretion of n-3 PUFAs, especially during n-3 PUFA deficiency.
