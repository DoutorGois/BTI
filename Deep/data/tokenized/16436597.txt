Neuronal activity in posterior cingulate cortex (CGp) is modulated by visual stimulation, saccades, and eye position, suggesting a role for this area in visuospatial transformations. The goal of this study was to determine whether neuronal responses in CGp are anchored to the eyes, head, or outside the body (allocentrically). To discriminate retinocentric from nonretinocentric spatial referencing, the activity of single CGp neurons was recorded while monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed delayed-saccade trials initiated randomly from three different starting positions to a linear array of targets passing through the neuronal response field. For most neurons, tuning curves, segregated by fixation point, aligned more closely when plotted with respect to the display than when plotted with respect to the eye, suggesting a nonretinocentric frame of reference. A second experiment differentiated between spatial referencing in coordinates anchored to the head or body and allocentric spatial referencing. Monkeys shifted gaze from a central fixation point to the array of previously used targets both before and after whole-body rotation with respect to the display. For most neurons, tuning curves, segregated by fixation position, aligned more closely when plotted as a function of target position in the room than when plotted as a function of target position with respect to the monkey. These data indicate that a population of CGp neurons encodes visuospatial events in allocentric coordinates.
