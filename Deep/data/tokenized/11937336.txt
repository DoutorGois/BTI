(1S,2R)-1-Phenyl-2-[(S)-1-aminopropyl]-N,N-diethylcyclopropanecarboxamide (PPDC, ), which is a conformationally restricted analogue of the antidepressant milnacipran [(+/-)-1], represents a new class of potent NMDA receptor antagonists. A series of PPDC analogues modified at the carbamoyl moiety were synthesized. Among these, (1S,2R)-1-phenyl-2-[(S)-1-aminopropyl]-N,N-dipropylcyclopropanecarboxamide (4d) was identified as the most potent NMDA receptor antagonist in this series and clearly reduced the MMDA receptor mediated potentiation of rat hippocampal slices, a model of long-term potentiation (LTP). The three-dimensional structure of 4d was also analyzed in detail to clarify the receptor-binding conformation.
