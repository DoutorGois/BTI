Maternal folate status during pregnancy may influence central nervous system (CNS) development in offspring. However, the recommended intakes of folic acid for women of childbearing age differ among countries and there is still no consensus about whether folic acid should be supplemented continuously throughout pregnancy. We hypothesized that folic acid supplementation may be more beneficial for offspring's neurobehavioral development if prolonged throughout pregnancy instead of being limited to the periconceptional period. In this study, three groups of the female rats were fed folate-normal, folate-deficient, or folate-supplemented diets throughout pregnancy. In another group, the female rats were fed folate-supplemented diet from mating for 10 consecutive days and then fed folate-normal diet for remainder days of pregnancy. The results showed that maternal folate deficiency increased plasma homocysteine (Hcy) concentration in dams, delayed early sensory-motor reflex development, impaired spatial learning and memory ability, and caused ultrastructural damages in the hippocampus of offspring. Maternal folic acid supplementation would be more effective on improving early sensory-motor reflex development and spatial learning and memory ability in offspring if prolonged throughout pregnancy instead of being limited to the periconceptional period. In conclusion, prolonged maternal folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy would be more effective in neurobehavioral development of offspring in rats.
