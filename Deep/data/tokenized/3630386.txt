By thermovision technique and images digital processing, thermal fields and reactions of dorsal cortical surface of 15 white rats were studied through the intact skull in various times after transplantation of the embryonal visual cortex, amygdala and hippocampus into the visual cortex. After operation significant thermoasymmetries arise outside transplantation area which in early periods (2-15 days) are dynamic, and in 5-5.5 months become stabilized. At successful implantation, transplantat area in background state in late terms is not thermodistinct, and in pseudo-transplanted animals--is cooled. In transplantat area, a changed thermoreaction to light stimulation is recorded, and in early terms it is connected with thermal flow from neighbouring cortical sites.
