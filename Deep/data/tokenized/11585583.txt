We investigated the distribution of phospholipase D1 (PLD1) protein in the developing rat hippocampus using an affinity-purified peptide antibody against PLD1. Immunoreactivity for PLD1 was first seen in some scattered cells in the hippocampus at embryonic day 18. At postnatal day 1 (P1), many PLD1 immunoreactive cells were observed in the CA1 and CA3 sectors, subiculum and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. During the first postnatal week, there was an abrupt increase of immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus, and their number and intensity peaked at P7. During the second postnatal week, there was an abrupt decrease in the number of immunoreactive hippocampal neurons. By P14, no significant labeling was found in the hippocampus. These results corresponded well with those from Western blot analysis, suggesting that PLD1 may regulate the developmental processes of hippocampal neurons.
