In 20 cats spatial conditioned reflexes were elaborated manifested in the animal's stay on an "active" square of the floor attended in different sessions with stimulation (100 imp/s; 0.3 ms, 2 or 6 V) of the septum, the lateral hypothalamus or the hippocampus. Stimulation of the septum and lateral hypothalamus with a 2 V current resulted in an accelerated heart rate, while a 6 V current produced its slowing down. Self-stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus with a 6 V current produced on initial acceleration of the heart rate with a subsequent gradual slowing down. The data obtained attest that both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic parts of the brain are involved in the formation of positive emotions.
