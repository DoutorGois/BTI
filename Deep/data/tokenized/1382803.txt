Activation of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons causes down-regulation of the protein ligatin, a receptor for phosphoglycoproteins and a marker protein for membrane-vesicle transport systems. This reduction occurs at both physiologic and excitotoxic levels of glutamate stimulation and is accompanied by a significant decrease in steady state levels of ligatin mRNA. Reduction in ligatin mRNA occurs within 60 min and persists 24 h later. Steady state levels of mRNAs encoding cyclophilin, an ubiquitous cytosolic protein, and neuron specific-enolase (N-SE) are not diminished by glutamate receptor activation, demonstrating that down-regulation of ligatin mRNA was not a result of general catabolism. Further, this reduction in ligatin mRNA occurred without induction of HSP 70. Pharmacological studies using selective antagonists and agonists indicate that this down-regulation of ligatin gene expression is predominantly mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subclass of EAA receptors and that Ca2+ is required. This is the first report that EAA receptor activation in hippocampal neurons can pretranslationally down-regulate gene expression in a rapid and long-lasting manner under physiologic, as well as cytotoxic conditions. The data support the hypothesis that modulation of neuronal gene expression may represent a molecular mechanism mediating some of the long-lasting functional and pathophysiological effects of EAA on cell function.
