Changes in spectra of electrical activity of rat brain structures were studied during simulation of pain-depressive syndrome by the combination of deafferentation pain syndrome developed after the sciatic nerve section with subsequent induction of dopamine deficit-dependent depressive state formed in animals via systemic administration of neurotoxin MPTP. Changes in spectra of the electrical activity of the nucleus accumbens, frontal neocortex, amygdala, and caudate putamen during the development of pain-depressive syndrome pointed to the formation of a new functional state as compared to depressive state and pain syndrome simulated individually. Alterations in the state of hippocampus did not reach the level of statistical significance.
