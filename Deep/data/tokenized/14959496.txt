The effect of forelimb deafferentation (median nerve transection) on postnatal development of hippocampal synaptic transmission was studied. Paired-pulse paradigm was applied to determine the properties of short-term plasticity, such as paired-pulse facilitation (PPT) in hippocampal slices. Significant changes in the time course of the PPT development were observed after the forelimb deafferentation. It was shown that the earlier described decrease in a population spike amplitude can be related not only to modification of synaptic efficacy but to some destructive processes, i.e., elimination of synapses and neurons. It was followed by the period by intensive formation of new synapses. The data suggest that there is no acceleration or delay in hippocampal development after the forelimb deafferentation but new intrahippocampal networks are formed.
