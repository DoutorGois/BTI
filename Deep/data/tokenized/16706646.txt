Cytochemically evidenced COX activity was compared with levels of immunohistochemically stained mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded subunits (CO I and CO IV) in the dentate gyrus outer molecular layer (OML) and cerebellar granular layer (GL) of adult and old rats. COX activity decreased significantly in aging, whereas CO I and CO IV levels were significantly increased both in GL and OML of old animals. These findings suggest that the age-related decay of the mitochondrial metabolic competence is not caused by a reduction of COX subunits levels, but causal events affecting mitochondria as discrete morphofunctional units of the cellular bioenergetic machinery.
