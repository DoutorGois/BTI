Recently antibodies against neuronal receptors have been identified as cause of a new type of encephalitis. The anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDA-R) encephalitis is the prototype of these disorders. Patients have a high incidence of teratomata. Removal of teratoma is considered the essential treatment of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. Here, we aimed to investigate whether neurologically asymptomatic individuals suffering from ovarian teratomata may have positive anti-NMDA-R antibodies to be detected by an established assay. Over a time period of 15 months, all patients suffering from ovarian teratomata without neurological symptoms were included in this prospective study. Twenty consecutive patients were pair matched to patients with other benign ovarian disease and healthy controls. Preoperatively, patients had a gynaecological examination, transvaginal ultrasound, neurological examination and determination of anti-NMDA-R antibodies. None of the patients or controls presented with neurological symptoms. All tumours could be removed completely by laparoscopy. Anti-NMDA-R antibodies were absent in the group of patients with teratomata as well as in patients with benign ovarian tumours and healthy controls. Testing for anti-NMDA-R antibodies revealed negative findings in well-characterised patients with ovarian teratomata lacking neurological symptoms. Our data support the current clinical practice that a systematic screening for anti-NMDA-R antibodies in teratoma patients is not indicated.
