The extent increase of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) autophosphorylation in various brain regions of rat reached a maximum value, one hour after s.c. administration of AVP(4-8). The increase in the cortex amounted to 192% of the control (P < 0.001), while in the hippocampus only 40% (P < 0.05). The autophosphorylation of CaMK II was dependent on both Ca2+ and CaM. Western blotting with anti-CaMK II alpha monoclonal antibody showed that the content of CaMK II alpha in cortex did not show detectable change in 1 h as compared to the control group. ZDC(C)PR, an antagonist of AVP(4-8), markedly blocked the effect of AVP(4-8), suggesting that AVP (4-8) stimulated CaMK II autophosphorylation is mediated through its receptor.
