Much of the recent data on cells, synapses, and other structures in the dentate gyrus and hippocampus as a function of age are packing density or volume fraction data. In order to estimate total numbers, volumes, or surface areas of cells, synapses, vessels, etc., as a function of age, the total volumes of the subregions of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus must be known. The volumes of these subregions, visualized with the Timm stain, have been determined in 24 F344 rats from 4 to 37 months of age. Volumes of the various structures showed age-related increases which were statistically significant for the perforant path zone of the dentate gyrus molecular layer, as well as the total molecular layer, the hilus, and regio inferior and total mossy fiber systems. If the 4-month age group is eliminated from consideration, only the ratio of the volume of the mossy fiber zones to the volume of the perforant path zones of the dentate molecular layer increases significantly with age. Our general finding of lack of volumetric reorganization of the subdivisions of the hippocampal region between 12 and 37 months suggests that studies of the packing densities of structures in most of these zones may be considered comparable across ages, assuming comparability of sampling regions.
