The experimental data concerning some aspects of neuroimmunology were analysed. The problems of likeness between immune and nervous systems (origin, functions, common substances, etc.) and particularly the participation of immunomodulators in the mechanisms of neural memory are under discussion. It was shown that administration of immunomodulator neurotropin (NSP) results in more steady consolidation and retention of feeding and avoidance behavior, and some neurophysiological mechanisms of that phenomena were revealed. Among them were the reorganization of neuronal interspike patterns in cortex and hippocampus; increasing the levels of vegetative (heart rate, respiration) and behavior parameters of learning during conditioning. Whole this complex of changes was retrieved during intersignal periods. The results suggest that one of the mechanisms of immunomodulators action on the learning and memory is the activation of reverberation processes in brain.
