Recent advances in molecular genetics provide strong evidence for a relationship between hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and hippocampus-dependent memory. The alpha-CaM kinase II knock-out mouse and transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of CaM kinase II clearly demonstrate that CaM kinase II plays a prominent role in hippocampal LTP and hippocampus-dependent memory. Furthermore, the observation that there is a diversity of silent as well as functional synapses has shed light on the molecular basis of learning and memory during development as well as in adult brain. Here we present a working model of CaM kinase II activity as a memory molecule in hippocampal LTP and describe molecular targets of CaM kinase II involved in the establishment of functional synapses following LTP induction.
