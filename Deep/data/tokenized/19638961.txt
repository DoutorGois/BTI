Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have become the primary delivery agent for somatic gene transfer into the central nervous system (CNS). To date, AAV-mediated gene delivery to the CNS is based on serotypes 1-9, with efficient gene transfer to neurons only-selective and widespread transduction of glial cells have not been observed. Recently, additional endogenous AAVs have been isolated from nonhuman primate tissues. In this study, transduction obtained with AAV serotypes bb2, cy5, rh20, rh39, and rh43 was compared to that obtained with AAV8, another nonhuman primate isolate previously shown to perform well in mammalian brain. Titer-matched vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter, driven by the constitutive CAG promoter, were injected into the hippocampus, striatum, or substantia nigra (SN) of adult rats. More widespread neuronal transduction was observed following infusion of cy5, rh20, and rh39 than observed with AAV8. Of interest, preferential transduction of astrocytes was observed with rh43. To optimize glial transduction, vector stocks driven by cell-specific promoters were generated-widespread and targeted transduction of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes was observed using rh43 and AAV8, driven by the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) promoters, expanding the utility of AAV for modeling and treating diseases involving glial cell pathology.
