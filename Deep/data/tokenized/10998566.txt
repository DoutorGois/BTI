We investigated the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) in rat hippocampal and striatal slices, where EPO receptors have been known to exist. EPO stimulated dopamine release from rat striatal slices. Acetylcholine (ACh) release from rat hippocampal slices was not affected by EPO, but high K(+)-induced ACh release was considerably enhanced by EPO. Nitric oxide (NO) production from the hippocampus and the striatum was not affected by EPO. NO-synthase activity was not changed by EPO in the hippocampus or the striatum. These results suggest that EPO stimulates dopamine- and acetylcholine-release without affecting NO production.
