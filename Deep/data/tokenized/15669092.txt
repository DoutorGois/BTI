Estrogens play important roles in the brain, acting through two receptor types, ERalpha and ERbeta, both recognized as transcription factors. In this study, we investigated the ERbeta mRNA and protein expression in the male and female rat brain, focusing on the hippocampus, and comparing with well-known ERalpha expression patterns. Extranuclear ERbeta localization, as shown by light microscopic immunocytochemistry and tissue fractionation experiments, was noted in the hippocampus, whereas nuclear ERbeta was present in the amygdala. Despite these marked differences in subcellular localizations, similar expression levels of ERbeta proteins as well as the profile of ERbeta mRNA isoforms were observed in the two brain structures. ERalpha was localized to the nucleus more so than ERbeta, yet not without an extranuclear component. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic estrogen receptors may play an important role in hippocampal physiology.
