Neurogranin (Ng) is a Ca(2+)-sensitive calmodulin-binding neuron-specific protein that has been implicated in the regulation of numerous post-synaptic signalling pathways. Here, we investigate the effects of 5 months low level ethanol consumption (approximately 20% of total calories intake) on Ng mRNA expression in the brain of adult (approximately 7-8 months) and aged (approximately 21-22 months) mice using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Results showed that ageing was accompanied by a decrease in amounts of mRNA coding for Ng, especially in the hippocampus (approximately 25% of adults) known to play a critical role in higher cognitive functions. Chronic ethanol consumption restored this decline up to pre-senescent (adult) levels without altering Ng mRNA levels in adult mice. On the basis of recent data indicating a central role for Ng in the regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial learning, our results suggest that moderate ethanol consumption might have a beneficial influence on cognitive deterioration during senescence. Such a possibility is in fact congruent with recent follow-up studies conducted in elderly people.
