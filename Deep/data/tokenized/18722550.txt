This study explored structural correlates of immediate and delayed face recognition in 22 nonsurgical patients with nonlesional, unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE, 10 left/12 right). We measured T2 relaxation time bilaterally in the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the fusiform gyrus. Apart from raised T2 values in the ipsilateral hippocampus, we found increased T2 values in the ipsilateral amygdala. Patients with right TLE exhibited impaired face recognition as a result of a decrease from immediate to delayed recognition. Higher T2 values in the right than left fusiform gyrus or hippocampus were related to worse immediate face recognition, but did not correlate with 24-hour face recognition. These preliminary results indicate that structural changes in the fusiform gyrus and hippocampus may influence immediate face recognition deficits, but have no linear influence on long-term face recognition in TLE. We suggest that long-term face recognition depends on a right hemispheric network encompassing structures outside the temporal lobe.
