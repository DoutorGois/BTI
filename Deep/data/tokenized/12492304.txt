Rats avoid unfamiliar foods and learn to prefer those that they smell on the breath of conspecifics. Hippocampal lesions produce rapid forgetting of this socially acquired memory. The authors report that NMDA receptor antagonists impair this memory. Rats given CPP were trained in the social transmission of food preference task. Normal rats showed robust memory 72 hr later. CPP-injected rats performed normally 24 hr, but randomly 72 hr, after training. Spatial context was irrelevant: Rats trained and tested in different rooms performed the same as rats trained and tested in 1 room. MK801 and intrahippocampal injections of APV produced amnestic effects similar to CPP. Thus, NMDA receptor activation is crucial for the persistence of socially acquired, hippocampus-dependent, nonspatial memory.
