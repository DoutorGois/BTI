Stem cell niches exist around the lateral ventricle and in the subgranular layer of the dentate gyrus, supporting adult neurogenesis. Recently, a third germinal layer, the subcallosal zone has been identified supporting the generation of oligodendrocytes in the adult brain. We have previously described a proliferative role for neuropeptide Y on precursors in the dentate gyrus, caudal subventricular zone and subcallosal zone under basal conditions and in the dentate gyrus after seizures. Here we sought to determine a role for neuropeptide Y in seizure-induced proliferation in the subcallosal niche. Using the chemoconvulsant kainate and neuropeptide Y(-/-) mice with controls, we show an effect of neuropeptide Y on basal proliferation and demonstrate a significant reduction in seizure-induced proliferation in the subcallosal zone.
