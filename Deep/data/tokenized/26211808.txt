BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Kv 7 channel activator flupirtine is a clinical analgesic characterized as 'selective neuronal potassium channel opener'. Flupirtine was found to exert comparable actions at GABAA receptors and Kv 7 channels in neurons of pain pathways, but not in hippocampus. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Expression patterns of GABAA receptors were explored in immunoblots of rat dorsal root ganglia, dorsal horns and hippocampi using antibodies for 10 different subunits. Effects of flupirtine on recombinant and native GABAA receptors were investigated in patch clamp experiments and compared with the actions on Kv 7 channels. KEY RESULTS: Immunoblots pointed towards alpha2, alpha3, beta3 and gamma2 subunits as targets, but in all gamma2-containing receptors the effects of flupirtine were alike: leftward shift of GABA concentration-response curves and diminished maximal amplitudes. After replacement of gamma2S by delta, flupirtine increased maximal amplitudes. Currents through alpha1beta2delta receptors were more enhanced than those through Kv 7 channels. In hippocampal neurons, flupirtine prolonged inhibitory postsynaptic currents, left miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) unaltered and increased bicuculline-sensitive tonic currents; penicillin abolished mIPSCs, but not tonic currents; concentration-response curves for GABA-induced currents were shifted to the left by flupirtine without changes in maximal amplitudes; in the presence of penicillin, maximal amplitudes were increased; GABA-induced currents in the presence of penicillin were more sensitive towards flupirtine than K(+) currents. In dorsal horn neurons, currents evoked by the delta-preferring agonist THIP (gaboxadol) were more sensitive towards flupirtine than K(+) currents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Flupirtine prefers delta-containing GABAA receptors over gamma-containing ones and over Kv 7 channels.
