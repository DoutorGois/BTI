Lithium oxybutyrate microinjections (10 mg/ml) produce a depressant action on spontaneous bioelectrical activity of the cortex and subcortical structure. The drug brings down excitability of the motor cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, thalamus, posterior hypothalamus and mesencephalic reticular formation; it also raises excitability of the tonsils. The depressant effect of lithium oxybutyrate is superior to that of lithium chloride.
