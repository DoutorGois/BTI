Rats were given suction lesions of the presumptive frontal cortex on embryonic day 18 (E18) and subsequently tested, as adults, on tests of spatial navigation (Morris water task, radial arm maze), motor tasks (Whishaw reaching task, beam walking), and locomotor activity. Frontal cortical lesions at E18 affected cerebral morphogenesis, producing unusual morphological structures including abnormal patches of neurons in the cortex and white matter as well as neuronal bridges between the hemispheres. A small sample of E18 operates also had hydrocephaly. The animals with E18 lesions without hydrocephalus were behaviorally indistinguishable from littermate controls. The results demonstrate that animals with focal lesions of the presumptive frontal cortex have gross abnormalities in cerebral morphology but the lesions leave the functions normally subserved by the frontal cortex in adult rats unaffected. The results are discussed in the context of a hypothesis regarding the optimal times for functional recovery from cortical injury.
