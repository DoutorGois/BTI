The present study examined the effect of the bite-raised condition on the number of dendritic spines on hippocampal pyramidal cells in SAMP8 mice and related the results with learning ability in a water maze test. Aged mice in the bite-raised condition had reduced learning ability and a lower number of CA1 pyramidal cell dendritic spines. The results suggest that the bite-raised condition exacerbates the age-related spatial learning impairment, and that this may be due to the degeneration of hippocampal dendritic spines.
