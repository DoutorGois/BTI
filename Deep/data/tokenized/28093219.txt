Aberrant glucocorticoid secretion is implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety). Glucocorticoids exert biological effects via mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors. Previous data from our laboratory indicate that GR antagonism/modulation (i.e., mifepristone, CORT 108297) regulate endocrine, behavioral, and central stress responses. Because of the dynamic interplay between MR and GR on HPA axis regulation and emotionality, compounds targeting both receptors are of interest for stress-related pathology. We investigated the effects of CORT 118335 (a dual selective GR modulator/MR antagonist) on endocrine, behavioral, and central (c-Fos) stress responses in male rats. Rats were treated for five days with CORT 118335, imipramine (positive control), or vehicle and exposed to restraint or forced swim stress (FST). CORT 118335 dampened corticosterone responses to both stressors, without a concomitant antidepressant-like effect in the FST. Imipramine decreased corticosterone responses to restraint stress; however, the antidepressant-like effect of imipramine in the FST was independent of circulating glucocorticoids. These findings indicate dissociation between endocrine and behavioral stress responses in the FST. CORT 118335 decreased c-Fos expression only in the CA1 division of the hippocampus. Imipramine decreased c-Fos expression in the basolateral amygdala and CA1 and CA3 divisions of the hippocampus. Overall, the data indicate differential effects of CORT 118335 and imipramine on stress-induced neuronal activity in various brain regions. The data also highlight a complex relationship between neuronal activation in stress and mood regulatory brain regions and the ensuing impact on endocrine and behavioral stress responses.
