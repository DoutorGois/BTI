Plasma membrane GABA transporters participate in neural signaling through re-uptake of neurotransmitter. The domains of the transporter that mediate GABA translocation and regulate transport are not well understood. In the present experiments, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the GABA transporter GAT1 regulated substrate transport rates. This domain directly interacted with syntaxin 1A, a SNARE protein involved in both neurotransmitter release and modulation of calcium channels and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) chloride channels. The interaction resulted in a decrease in transporter transport rates. These data demonstrate that intracellular domains of the GABA and protein-protein interactions regulate substrate translocation, and identify a direct link between the machinery involved in transmitter release and re-uptake.
