Chronic thiamine deficiency may be responsible for pathologic changes in the brains of alcoholics, and subclinical episodes of this vitamin deficiency may cause cumulative brain damage. In the present work, the chronic effects of ethanol and its association to a mild thiamine deficiency episode (subclinical model) on neocortical and hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity were assessed along with their possible association to spatial cognitive dysfunction. The results indicate that in the beginning of the neurodegenerative process, before the appearance of brain lesions, chronic ethanol consumption reverses the effects of mild thiamine deficiency on both spatial cognitive performance and acetylcholinesterase activity without having significant effects on any morphometric parameter.
