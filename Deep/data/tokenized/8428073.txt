Memory is composed of dissociable systems that accomplish different forms of learning and that are mediated by distinct neural networks. Knowledge about the psychological nature and neural basis of specific memory systems has come primarily from lesion analysis, but this year functional brain imaging has provided a new source of convergent evidence. Recent findings are reviewed that provide new information about a limbic-diencephalic system critical for learning new declarative information, a temporal lobe system that stores long-term semantic knowledge in a domain-specific fashion, an occipital system that subserves visuoperceptual implicit memory, and a fronto-thalamo-neostriatal system that mediates the executive component of working memory and that plays an important role in some forms of sensorimotor skill learning.
