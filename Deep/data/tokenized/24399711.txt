BACKGROUND: Topiramate, a new generation antiepileptic agent with a complex mechanism of action, has a broad pharmacological profile which includes a neuroprotective effect. It has been proven to be efficacious in treating alcohol dependence through a previously confirmed association with memory processes. METHODS: Topiramate was administered in single doses of 120 and 40 mg/kg and multiple doses of 60 mg/kg for 12 days. Its influence on the spatial memory of rats was evaluated using the Morris water maze test. The time needed to localize the platform, the distance travelled and time spent in the platform zone were recorded. RESULTS: Single doses of topiramate induce deterioration of spatial memory, with high doses having more pronounced and longer lasting effects. Multiple administration of a medial dose does not significantly affect the learning process. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of topiramate on the hippocampus-related memory processes may play a key role in its "anti-alcohol" effect.
