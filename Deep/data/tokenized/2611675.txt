Immunohistochemical screening of the cat limbic system using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) revealed that MAb R2D5 specifically labeled a subset of layer 3 cells in the entorhinal cortex, while leaving layer 2 cells unlabeled. The apical dendrites of the R2D5-positive layer 3 cells tended to gather and formed columnar structures which penetrated layer 2 and climbed to the surface of entorhinal cortex.
