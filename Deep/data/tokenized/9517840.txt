We examined the relationship between the density of serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) uptake sites and extracellular 5-HT concentration in the rat brain using microdialysis with two different models, lesions with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (50 microg in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 15 days before) and sublines of rats genetically selected displaying extreme values of platelet 5-HT uptake. Compared to controls, lesioned rats had a reduced cortical concentration of 5-hydroxyindoles (45%), unchanged basal extracellular 5-HT in the DRN and ventral hippocampus (VHPC), and reduced basal 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations (46%, DRN; 22%, VHPC). Yet the perfusion of 100 mmol/L KCl or 1 micromol/L citalopram elevated dialysate 5-HT significantly more in the DRN and VHPC of controls. In genetically selected rats, platelet 5-HT content and uptake were highly correlated (r2 = 0.9145). Baseline dialysate 5-HT (VHPC) was not different between high and low 5-HT rats and from normal Wistar rats. However, KCl or citalopram perfusion increased dialysate 5-HT significantly more in high 5-HT than in low 5-HT rats, and the former displayed a greater in vivo tissue 5-HT recovery. Significant but small differences in the same direction were noted in [3H]citalopram binding in several brain areas, as measured autoradiographically. Thus, basal extracellular 5-HT (but not 5-HIAA) concentrations are largely independent on the density of serotonergic innervation and associated changes in uptake sites. However, marked differences emerge during axonal depolarization or reuptake blockade. The significance of these findings for the treatment of mood disorders in patients with neurological disorders is discussed.
