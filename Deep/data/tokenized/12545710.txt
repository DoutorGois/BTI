Clinical data showed that periodic alterations of estrogen and progestin in some women patients with catamenial epilepsy might affect seizure susceptibility. In the present study, in order to explore the roles of estrogen and progestin in epilepsy and elucidate their mechanisms of action, we utilized animal seizure models induced by intracerebroventricular(i.c.v) coriaria lactone(CL) and intraperitoneal(i.p.) bemegride(Be), studied the effects of estrogen and progestin on central nervous system(CNS) functions in behavior, electrophysiological, cellular, molecular and gene levels by means of neuroelectrophysiology, flow cytometry, high performance liquid chromatography, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization techniques. From our observation we concluded that ovarian hormones are neuroactive steroids and new neuromodulaters, they could affect the excitability of CNS by regulating immediate early genes, amino acid neurotransmitters and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor(NMDAR).
