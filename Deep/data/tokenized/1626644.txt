The content of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA was determined in the hypothalamus, as well as in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland of the alcohol-preferring AA and alcohol-avoiding ANA rats under basal conditions. In addition the content of beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta-EPLIR) was measured in nine brain regions, the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland and the serum. The content of beta-EPLIR was significantly higher in the septum and significantly lower in the amygdala, and periaqueductal gray matter of the AA rats, while there was no significant difference between the AA and ANA rats in the arcuate nucleus plus median eminence, nucleus accumbens, caudate, hippocampus, and cortex. HPLC analysis indicated no significant differences in the relative proportions of non-acetyl and acetyl forms of beta-endorphin peptides in the hypothalamus, distinct brain regions, and anterior and neurointermediate lobes of the pituitary gland, between the AA and ANA rats. The content of POMC mRNA but not of beta-EPLIR was significantly higher in the hypothalamus and neurointermediate lobe of the AA rats, while the content of both beta-EPLIR and POMC mRNA were significantly higher in the anterior pituitary of the AA than of the ANA rats. Thus, there are genetically determined differences in the pituitary and brain beta-endorphin system between the AA and ANA rats, which may be important in controlling the differences in the voluntary ethanol consumption exhibited by these animals.
