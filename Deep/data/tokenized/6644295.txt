In vivo specific binding of [3H]diazepam was not altered by a single electroconvulsive shock given 5, 30, or 60 min, or 24 h previously, nor 24 h after the last of 10 daily shocks. Similarly, in vivo [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline carboxylate binding was not changed in the brains of animals that had been given a single electroconvulsive shock 30 min previously or a series of 10 daily shocks. Brain areas examined included cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum. However, cortical binding of [3H]diazepam was increased by 32% in animals which were present in the same room while another was being injected and killed. This may represent a response to stress and/or anxiety.
