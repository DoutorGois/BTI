Injection of 0,5 microgram of kainic acid into the globus pallidus of rabbits carrying chronically implanted electrodes and cannulas, resulted in an increase of cerebral electrical activity up to appearance of epileptoidal discharges. These effects were prevented by diazepam pretreatment. Behavioral changes produced by kainic acid were biphasic; ipsilateral rotations or postural asymmetries, observed in the early phase, gave way later to contralateral asymmetries. Kainic acid facilitated sniffing episodes, which appeared simultaneously with epileptoidal discharges in the hippocampus. The stimulation of globus pallidus neurons with kainic acid resulted also in electrical activation of the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus. The results indicate that the majority of the neurons of globus pallidus display selective sensitivity to kainic acid and that the globus pallidus is functionally connected with the hippocampus and the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus.
