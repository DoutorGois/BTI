We investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) the distribution of caldendrin, the founding member of a novel family of neuronal calcium-binding proteins closely related to calmodulin, in human forebrain. Caldendrin immunoreactivity was unevenly distributed, with prominent staining in the paleo- and neocortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. With the exception of the hypothalamus, labeling was restricted to the somato-dendritic compartment of neurons. This distribution completely matches that reported in rat, indicating that the cellular function is most likely conserved among species. Therefore, one prerequisite for functional studies in rodent models aimed at elucidation of mechanisms with relevance for humans can be based on the present findings.
