OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of ischemic preconditioning on chaperone hsp70 expression and protein aggregation in the CA1 neurons of rats, and to further explore its potential neuroprotective mechanism. METHODS: Two-vesseloccluded transient global ischemia rat model was used. The rats were divided into sublethal 3-min ischemia group, lethal 10-min ischemia group and ischemic preconditioning group. Neuronal death in the CA1 region was observed by hematoxylineosin staining, and number of live neurons was assessed by cell counting under a light microscope. Immunochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to observe the distribution of chaperone hsp70 in the CA1 neurons. Differential centrifuge was used to isolate cytosol, nucleus and protein aggregates fractions. Western blot was used to analyze the quantitative alterations of protein aggregates and inducible chaperone hsp70 in cellular fractions and in protein aggregates under different ischemic conditions. RESULTS: Histological examination showed that ischemic preconditioning significantly reduced delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus CA1 region (P < 0.01 vs 10-min ischemia group). Sublethal ischemic preconditioning induced chaperone hsp70 expression in the CA1 neurons after 24 h reperfusion following 10-min ischemia. Induced-hsp70 combined with the abnormal proteins produced during the secondary lethal 10-min ischemia and inhibited the formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates (P < 0.01 vs 10-min ischemia group). CONCLUSION: Ischemic preconditioning induced chaperone hsp70 expression and inhibited protein aggregates formation in the CA1 neurons when suffered secondary lethal ischemia, which may protect neurons from death.
