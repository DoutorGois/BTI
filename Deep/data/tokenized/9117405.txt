Mice infected with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) mixture develop severe immunosuppression, neurotransmitter abnormalities and cognitive impairments in the absence of significant viral or macrophage invasion of the CNS. The time-course of the changes in glial activation have been characterized in an effort to understand the cellular basis of the neurobehavioral abnormalities observed in these mice. Glial activation was determined by measuring the relative changes in F4/80 protein and GFAP immunoreactivity using immunoblots. Augmented F4/80 expression preceded that of GFAP, with global elevations of 4-6-fold at 3 weeks, sustained for up to 12 weeks after inoculation. GFAP immunoreactivity increased 2-fold only in the cerebral cortex and striatum 5 weeks postinfection, declining to control levels by 12 weeks. Immunohistochemistry revealed significant increases in microglial size and staining intensity in the cortex, corpus callosum and striatum, with the development of a unique population of highly ramified, intensely stained microglia and microglial nodules in the corpus callosum and striatum. No evidence of ameboid microglia was found. Astrocyte size and degree of ramification was increased in the hippocampus, cortex, striatum and corpus callosum. Thus, microgliosis is an early event in LP-BM5 infection, preceding astrocytosis, neurotransmitter loss, and development of cognitive deficits. Activated microglia may secrete neurotoxins leading to the neurochemical alterations and cognitive deficits observed in these mice. Because gliosis and microglial nodule formation are hallmarks of HIV-1 encephalopathy, LP-BM5 MuLV-infected C57/B16 mice may afford insights into the mechanisms contributing to the early stages of this syndrome.
