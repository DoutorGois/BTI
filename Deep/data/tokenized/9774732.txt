The specific dopamine uptake inhibitor, GBR 12783 was tested on the retention performance of a one-trial passive avoidance test. For a moderate electric shock intensity, GBR 12783 (10 mg/kg), injected before acquisition session, improved retention performance. Scopolamine (0.125-0.5 mg/kg) completely blocked the promnesic effect of GBR 12783. Moreover, GBR 12783 increased hippocampal acetylcholine release in vivo. These data suggest that the promnesic effect of GBR 12783 is mediated by an increase in the septo-hippocampal cholinergic transmission.
