PURPOSE: Periodic epileptiform discharges (PEDs) are an uncommon, abnormal EEG pattern seen usually in patients with acute diseases and less frequently in chronic conditions, such as mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). Evaluate the clinical histories, neuroimaging findings, and serial electrophysiological studies prior to the appearance of PEDs in patients with mTLE secondary to hippocampal sclerosis (HS). METHODS: We searched 19, 375 EEGs (2006-2012) for the presence of PEDs secondary to mTLE due to HS. RESULTS: 12 patients were included. The patients with PEDs had a high prevalence of psychiatric comorbilities, including major depression (50%), interictal psychosis (16%) and dementia (8%). All of the patients had intractable epilepsy with similar clinical findings. We observed a sequential neurophysiological worsening of the EEG patterns prior to the appearance of PEDs. Five patients with PEDs underwent epilepsy surgery and four were seizure free at follow-up 15 (+/-9) months. CONCLUSIONS: PEDs are rare in patients with mTLE and HS and their presence in these cases could reflect clinical severity and neurophysiologic worsening, clinically manifested by intractable epilepsy and severe psychiatric comorbidities. The presence of PEDs in EEGs of patients with mTLE, however, was not associated with poor postsurgical seizure-freedom.
