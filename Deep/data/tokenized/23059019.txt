Prune homolog 2 (Drosophila) (PRUNE2) encodes a BCH motif-containing protein that shares homology with the Cayman ataxia-related protein Caytaxin. Caytaxin is a substrate of caspase-3 and is specifically expressed at the presynapse of vesicular-type glutamate transporter (VGLUT)-positive neurons, where it plays a role in glutamate neurotransmission primarily in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Here, we showed that a novel Prune2 isoform contains a BCH motif and localizes predominantly to the synaptic cytosol, similar to Caytaxin. However, the isoform is expressed predominantly in the olfactory bulb and layer Ia of the piriform cortex, where Caytaxin is scarcely expressed. The isoform expression is upregulated during development, similar to that in the presynaptic-localizing proteins Synapsin I and Bassoon. Prune2 and its previously identified isoforms have been shown to be a susceptibility gene for Alzheimer's disease, a biomarker for leiomyosarcomas, a proapoptotic protein, and an antagonist of cellular transformation. In addition, a novel isoform may develop new roles for Prune2 at the synapse in olfactory systems.
