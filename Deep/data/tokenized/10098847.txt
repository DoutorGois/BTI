We have studied the activation of phospholipase D (PLD) by glutamate in rat cultured astrocytes by measuring the PLD-catalyzed formation of [32P]phosphatidylbutanol in [32P]Pi-prelabeled cells, stimulated in the presence of butanol. Glutamate elicited the activation of PLD in cortical astrocytes but not in cortical neurons, whereas similar glutamate activation of phosphoinositide phospholipase C was found in both astrocytes and neurons. The extent of PLD stimulation by glutamate was similar in astrocytes from brain cortex and hippocampus, but no effect was found in cerebellar astrocytes. In cortical astrocytes, the glutamate response was insensitive to antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors and was reproduced by agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with a rank order of agonist potency similar to that reported for group I mGluR-mediated phosphoinositide phospholipase activation [quisqualate > (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine > (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid]. The response to (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid was inhibited by the mGluR antagonist (S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine and, less potently, by 1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid and 4-carboxyphenylglycine, two antagonists of group I mGluRs that display higher potency on mGluR1 than on mGluR5. The mGluR5-selective agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine also activated PLD in astrocytes. These findings indicate the involvement of group I mGluRs, most likely mGluR5, in the glutamate activation of PLD in cultured rat cortical astrocytes.
