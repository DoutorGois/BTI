The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of maternal lead (Pb) exposure on the expression of interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL 6, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampus of mice offspring. Pb exposure initiated from the beginning of gestation to weaning. Lead acetate (PbAc) administered in drinking solutions was dissolved in distilled deionized water at the concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1% groups ,respectively. On the postnatal day 21, the Pb levels in their blood and hippocampus were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The expression of IL 1beta, IL 6, and GFAP in hippocampus was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The Pb levels in blood and hippocampus of all Pb-exposed groups were significantly higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and GFAP was increased in Pb-exposed groups in comparison with the control group (p < 0.05). The high expression of IL-1beta, IL-6, and GFAP in the hippocampus of pups may contribute to the neurotoxicity associated with maternal Pb exposure.
