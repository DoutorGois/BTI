The in vitro autoradiographic distribution of calcium channel antagonist binding sites for 1,4-dihydropyridine and phenylalkylamine has been investigated in rat, guinea pig and human brain. 1,4-dihydropyridine ([3H] (+) PN200-110) and phenylalkylamine ([3H] (-) D-888) binding sites are identically distributed in the brain of the three mammalian species studied. High densities of calcium antagonist binding sites are present in brain areas enriched in synaptic contacts such as the hippocampus, cortex and striatum. Low to moderate densities of sites are found in other regions such as the thalamus, hypothalamus and brain stem. These data demonstrate the existence of specific calcium antagonist binding sites in mammalian brain including man. These sites are discretely distributed with highest concentrations present in the hippocampus and cortex. Moreover, the similar distribution of binding sites for [3H] (+) PN200-110 and [3H] (-) D-188 suggests that 1,4-dihydropyridine and phenylalkylamine bind to the same receptor site complex in mammalian brain.
