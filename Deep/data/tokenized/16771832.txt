The anti-convulsant properties of angiotensin IV (Ang IV), an inhibitor of insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) and somatostatin-14, a substrate of IRAP, were evaluated in the acute pilocarpine rat seizure model. Simultaneously, the neurochemical changes in the hippocampus were monitored using in vivo microdialysis. Intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) administered Ang IV or somatostatin-14 caused a significant increase in the hippocampal extracellular dopamine and serotonin levels and protected rats against pilocarpine-induced seizures. These effects of Ang IV were both blocked by concomitant i.c.v. administration of the somatostatin receptor-2 antagonist cyanamid 154806. These results reveal a possible role for dopamine and serotonin in the anti-convulsant effect of Ang IV and somatostatin-14. Our study suggests that the ability of Ang IV to inhibit pilocarpine-induced convulsions is dependent on somatostatin receptor-2 activation, and is possibly mediated via the inhibition of IRAP resulting in an elevated concentration of somatostatin-14 in the brain.
