The glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) content was investigated using immunoblotting techniques in the septum and hippocampus of the rat after bilateral lateral fimbria transection. Seven days after surgery GFAP content increased significantly both in the septum (140% of control) and hippocampus (120% in dorsal, the less denervated, and 145% in the most denervated ventral part), indicating the occurrence of reactive gliosis. The GM1 treatment caused statistically significant attenuation of GFAP increment in all hippocampal parts. In contrast, GM1 treatment has no influence on the increase of GFAP content in the septum. Results suggest a differential effect of GM1 on the two gliotic reactions formed as a consequence of the lesion at the level of the source of innervation (septum) and the target (hippocampus).
