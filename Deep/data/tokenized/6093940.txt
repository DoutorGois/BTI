Tetanic but not low frequency stimulation of the perforant path in rat hippocampal slices results in changes in the metabolism of phosphoinositides and phosphatidic acid. The phosphorylation of other, non-inositol lipids was not affected by the high frequency stimulation. The observed changes in phosphoinositide metabolism are complex and biphasic, lasting at least 4 h after the termination of the tetanus. The present data support the notion that membrane phosphoinositides play a role in synaptic function.
