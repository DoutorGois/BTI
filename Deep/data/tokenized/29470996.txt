OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to detect functional changes in default-mode network of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance images and the evaluation of subcortical grey-matter structures volumes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NMO patients (n = 28) and controls patients (N=19) were enrolled. We used the integrated registration and segmentation tool, part of FMRIB's Software Library (FSL) to segment subcortical structures including the thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus and amygdalae. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were post-processed using the Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized Decomposition into Independent Components, also part of FSL. Average Z-values extracted from the default-mode network were compared between patients and controls using t-tests (p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant). RESULTS: There were areas of increased synchronization in the default-mode network of patients compared to controls, notably in the precuneus and right hippocampus (corrected p <0.01). The frontal area had decreased synchronization in patients compared to controls (corrected p <0.01). There were no observed differences between patients and controls in subcortical volumes or average Z-values values for default-mode network. CONCLUSION: The hyperactivity of certain default-mode network areas may reflect cortical compensation for subtle structural damage in NMO patients.
