Bitemporal injections of puromycin that primarily affect the hippocampal-entorhinal area induce amnesia of aversive maze-learning in mice for 3 days after training but are ineffective 6 or more days after training. At these later times, additional puromycin sites covering widespread forebrain areas are necessary to induce amnesia, a result that we attribute to the cerebral spread of the engram during the 6-day period. We have reported that blockade of about 60% of cerebral beta-adrenergic receptors by a single, subcutaneous injection of (-)-propranolol, a nonselective beta-receptor antagonist, inhibited engram spread for 60-90 days, at which time engram spread spontaneously occurred. In the present experiments using single doses of antagonists that appeared to block 60% of beta 2- or beta 1-adrenergic receptors, it was found that the selective beta 2 antagonist ICI 118,551 was without effect on engram spread, whereas the selective beta 1 antagonist betaxolol inhibited the spread for at least 3 months. Propranolol's effect consequently appears to be accounted for by its blockade of beta 1 receptors.
