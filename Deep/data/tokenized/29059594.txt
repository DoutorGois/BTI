In Alzheimer's disease, the hippocampus is characterized by abundant deposition of amyloid peptides (amyloid beta [Abeta]) and neuroinflammation. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a form of plasticity that contributes to cognition and can be influenced by either or both pathology and neuroinflammation. Their interaction has been studied before in rapidly progressing transgenic mouse models with strong overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and/or presenilin 1. So far, changes in AHN and neuroinflammation remain poorly characterized in slower progressing models at advanced age, which approach more closely sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Here, we analyzed 10- to 26-month-old APP.V717I mice for possible correlations between Abeta pathology, microglia, and AHN. The age-related increase in amyloid pathology was closely paralleled by microglial CD68 upregulation, which was largely absent in age-matched wild-type littermates. Notably, aging reduced the AHN marker doublecortin, but not calretinin, to a similar extent in wild-type and APP.V717I mice between 10 and 26 months. This demonstrates that AHN is influenced by advanced age in the APP.V717I mouse model, but not by Abeta and microglial activation.
