The recall of information stored in the hippocampus involves a series of corticocortical backprojections via the entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and one or more neocortical stages. Each stage is considered to be a pattern association network, with the retrieval cue at each stage the firing of neurons in the previous stage. The leading factor that determines the capacity of this multistage pattern association backprojection pathway is the number of connections onto any one neuron, which provides a quantitative basis for why there are as many backprojections between adjacent stages in the hierarchy as forward projections. The issue arises of why this multistage backprojection system uses diluted connectivity. One reason is that a multistage backprojection system with expansion of neuron numbers at each stage enables the hippocampus to address during recall the very large numbers of neocortical neurons, which would otherwise require hippocampal neurons to make very large numbers of synapses if they were directly onto neocortical neurons. The second reason is that as shown here, diluted connectivity in the backprojection pathways reduces the probability of more than one connection onto a receiving neuron in the backprojecting pathways, which otherwise reduces the capacity of the system, that is the number of memories that can be recalled from the hippocampus to the neocortex. For similar reasons, diluted connectivity is advantageous in pattern association networks in other brain systems such as the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala; for related reasons, in autoassociation networks in, for example, the hippocampal CA3 and the neocortex; and for the different reason that diluted connectivity facilitates the operation of competitive networks in forward-connected cortical systems.
