Stimulus-specific neuronal responses in the central auditory pathway of Psammomys obesus were studied with deoxyglucose autoradiography. Responses were revealed mainly in the inferior colliculus. With whole head sectioning and subsequent gentle freeze-drying, excellent structural preservation was achieved. With the use of double-tritiated deoxyglucose, Ultrofilm 3H and vacuum-contact exposure, a mean spatial resolution of 43 micron Full Width Half Maximum was achieved.
