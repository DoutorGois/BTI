Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by a cascade of pathologic changes. A widely discussed theory indicates that amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are the causative agents of AD. Silibinin, a flavonoid derived from milk thistle, is well known for its hepato-protective activities and we have reported the neuroprotective effects of silibinin. In this study, we investigated the role of estrogen receptors (ERs) in silibinin's neuroprotective effect on Abeta1-42-injected rats. Results of Morris water maze and novel object-recognition tests demonstrated that silibinin significantly attenuated Abeta1-42-induced memory impairment. Silibinin attenuated ERs and PI3K-Akt pathways, as well as modulated mitogen-activated protein kinases in the hippocampus of Abeta1-42-injected rats. Taken together, silibinin is a potential candidate in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
