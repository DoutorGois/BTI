We report histopathological findings in 300 consecutive surgical specimens from epilepsy surgery during 6 years. Our material was mainly from temporal lobe epilepsy (70.33%). In 44% the diagnosis was hippocampal sclerosis. There were tumors in 15% of cases and neuronal migration disorders in 10%. The most common tumors were gangliogliomas (42.22%) and dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (20%). We review the more frequent diagnosis in epilepsy surgery based on this series and comparing with literature.
