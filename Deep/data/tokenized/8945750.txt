Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) plays important roles in the regulation of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebellum. We found that the expression of tPA mRNA in the visual cortex was increased significantly by the peripheral administration of L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-threo-DOPS; 100 mg/kg, i.p.), which we had previously shown to have a promotive effect on ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. When plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; 100 muM in an osmotic minipump) was infused into the kitten visual cortex, OD plasticity was suppressed; i.e. a significantly large number of binocular cells was recorded in the PAI-1 infused cortex following monocular deprivation. These results, therefore, suggest that the PA system is involved in the promotive effect of L-threo-DOPS in OD plasticity.
