Regulation of neurotransmitter receptor localization is critical for synaptic function and plasticity. In this issue of Neuron, Matsuda and colleagues (Matsuda et al., 2016) uncover a transsynaptic complex consisting of neurexin-3, C1q-like proteins, and kainate receptors that drives glutamate receptor clustering at hippocampal synapses.
