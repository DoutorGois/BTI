The effect of morphine on the binding of 3H-nitrendipine was studied in rat hippocampal preparations. Treatment of slices with morphine followed by the preparation of membrane fractions revealed the presence of low affinity binding sites. The effect of morphine was antagonized by naloxone. The effect was not observed when the membrane fraction was incubated with morphine. These results suggest that morphine changes the affinity of calcium for its channels and reduces its influx.
