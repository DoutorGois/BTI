Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been suggested to play an important role in neuronal plasticity. In this study, we investigated the effects of BDNF on short-term transmitter release from cultured CNS neurons. Rapid and transient glutamate and aspartate releases induced by BDNF were observed from cultured cortical, hippocampal, striatal and cerebellar neurons. We furthermore investigated the mechanism of release induced by neurotrophins from cerebellar granule cells, since granule cells represent a large homogeneous glutamatergic population. NGF and NT-3 elicited neurotrophin-induced release of glutamate as well as BDNF from the cerebellar granule neurons. The release was dependent on intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. Pretreatment with K252a and also TrkB-IgG completely blocked the glutamate and aspartate release elicited by BDNF, but not by NGF. The cerebellar granule neurons expressed trkB and p75 mRNAs at high levels, but not trkA mRNA. These results suggested that while BDNF induced release via TrkB, NGF-elicited release was not mediated by Trks. Furthermore, in the experiment using the styryl dye FM1-43, which selectively labels synaptic vesicles, neither BDNF nor NGF evoked dye loss, suggesting that neurotrophin-induced excitatory amino acid release occurs through a non-exocytotic pathway.
