We examined the effects of estradiol benzoate (E2) on the protein expression of calcineurin in amygdaloid and hippocampal structures of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Significant decreases in levels of calcineurin immunolabeling were seen in the medial and basomedial, but not central or basolateral, amygdala. Estrogen also reduced calcineurin immunoreactivity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, but not in the CA3 region, hilus or ventral or dorsal dentate gyrus structures of hippocampus. These results indicate that E2 acts on calcineurin in a neuroanatomically specific manner and may be involved in estrogen-mediated regulation of gene expression.
