Ablation of olfactory bulbs in rats reduced male sexual behavior, and altered the distribution of wheel-running activity between the light and dark phases of a 12:12 LD photoperiod. These effects were partially reversed by the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline. Olfactory bulbectomy also altered serotonin metabolism (5-HIAA/5-HT ratio) in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and corpus striatum. These observations support the hypothesis that olfactory bulbectomy in rodents serves as a model of agitated hyposerotonergic depression.
