Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality during childhood. TBI enhances formation of reactive oxygen species that cause neuron damage and apoptosis. alpha-Lipoic acid (LA) is a free radical scavenger and biological antioxidant. We investigated the effects of LA treatment on the parietal and prefrontal cortex, and on the hippocampal regions of the brain in 7-day-old rat pups that had been subjected to contusion injury. Forty-two male rats were divided randomly into a control group, a TBI group and a TBI + LA treated group. LA was administered 30 min after TBI through an intragastric tube once daily for 2 days. Forty-eight hours after TBI, the animals were sacrificed and tissues were examined for apoptosis and density of neurons. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and active caspase-3 immunostaining were used to detect apoptosis. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels also were measured. Histological evaluation showed that LA treatment significantly reduced TBI-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus, prefrontal and parietal cortex; TUNEL- and caspase-3-positive cells also were decreased in the same regions. In addition, LA administration increased GPx and SOD activity in the prefrontal cortex. It appears that LA may be beneficial for TBI in rats.
