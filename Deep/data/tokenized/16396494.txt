Mice polytransgenic for chromosome 21 genes DSCR3, 5, 6, 9, and TTC3 within the Down Syndrome Critical Region-1 represent an animal model for Down Syndrome (DS). In a proteomic approach, we show a series of altered hippocampal protein levels that may be caused by overexpression of at least one of the five chromosome 21 genes and that fit fear-conditioned memory defects and were observed to be dysregulated in human fetal DS.
