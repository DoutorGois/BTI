The authors studied the effects of a combination of pentoxifylline and nimodipine on cerebral lipid peroxidation in postischemic rat brain. Pentoxifylline (40 mg/kg) and nimodipine (3 mg/kg) were administered per os 30 min before 5 min of ischemia (four-vessel occlusion model of transient ischemia). The extent of peroxidation in brain tissue (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum) was then estimated by assay of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The concentration of TBARS was significantly lower in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the group treated with the combination of drugs than in untreated ischemic rats. However, this concentration was not significantly different from that found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of other groups premedicated with nimodipine or pentoxifylline alone. The tested drugs had no effect on TBARS in the striatum. The hypothesis that the combination of drugs would have a synergistic effect on postischemic lipid peroxidation was therefore not confirmed.
