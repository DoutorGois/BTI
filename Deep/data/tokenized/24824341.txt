Pain and learning memory have striking similarities in synaptic plasticity. Activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors 2B subunits (NR2B-NMDAs) is responsible for the hippocampal LTP in memory formation. In our previous studies, we found the significant enhancement of CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in rats with chronic visceral pain. However, it is unclear whether the NR2B-NMDAs are required for the LTP in chronic visceral pain. In this study, a rat model with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was established by colorectal distention (CRD). The sensitivity of visceral pain and HFS-induced LTP at SC-CA1 synapses were significantly enhanced in IBS-like rats (p<0.05). In addition, hippocampal NR2B protein levels significantly increased in IBS-like rats (p<0.05). To test whether NR2B-NMDAs are responsible for the LTP, effects of Ro 25-6981, a selective antagonist of NR2B-NMDAs, on field potential in CA1 region were investigated in vitro. Our results demonstrated that Ro 25-6981 dose-dependently inhibited the facilitation of CA1 LTP in IBS-like rats. The plausible activation mechanism of hippocampal NR2B-NMDAs in the LTP enhancement was further explored. Western blot data indicated that expression of tyrosine phosphorylated NR2B protein in hippocampus significantly enhanced in IBS-like rats. Accordingly, genistein, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, dose-dependently blocked the facilitation of hippocampal LTP in IBS-like rats. Furthermore, EMG data revealed that intra-hippocampal injection of Ro 25-6981 dose-dependently attenuated the visceral hypersensitivity. In conclusion, hippocampal NR2B-NMDAs are responsible for the facilitation of CA1 LTP via tyrosine phosphorylation, which leads to visceral hypersensitivity.
