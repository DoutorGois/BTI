Mongolian gerbils exposed to relatively short (7 or 15 min) unilateral or bilateral occlusions of the common carotid artery develop, 20 h after release of the clipping, characteristic morphologic changes in the H3 sector of the hippocampus. Ultrastructural study of these changes revealed an eccentric shift of the nuclei associated with chromatolytic perikarya which showed a dense accumulation of lysosomes and mitochondria in their central parts. The Golgi apparatus was recognizable only by clusters of vesicles, and this change was associated with a negative thiamine pyrophosphatase reaction.
