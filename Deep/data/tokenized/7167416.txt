Glycine, 0.5 mg icvtr, elevated the striatal acetylcholine (ACh) level 30 and 45 min after the injection, and accelerated ACh synthesis 15-45 min after the administration. Only doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg produced these effects. Glycine elevated the choline acetyltransferase activity in the striatum, but did not affect acetylcholine esterase. Studies in vitro did not demonstrate an effect of glycine on ACh synthesis in the rat cortex, striatum, and hippocampus.
