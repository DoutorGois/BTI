Aged Tg2576 mice show abnormalities in hippocampal morphology and physiology and display behavioral deficits in spatial navigation tasks consonant with a deficit in the functional properties of the hippocampus. However, the nature of the spatial representations disrupted by the "Swedish" mutation of the amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) is unclear. In an effort to characterize the memory deficits in Tg2576 mice, the spontaneous object exploration paradigm was used to interrogate spatial and object memory in mice. With object arrays of comparable size, 16-month-old Tg2576 mice showed a normal object familiarity/novelty effect but impaired memory for the location of objects when 2 objects exchanged locations (topological transformation; Experiment 1). In contrast, Tg2576 mice showed preferential exploration of familiar objects when they were moved to previously unoccupied locations (Experiment 2), irrespective of whether the transformation altered the metric properties of the object array (Experiments 3). These results suggest that Tg2576 mice are able to form representations of the identity of objects and a memory of the spatial organization of objects in an arena. In contrast, conjunctive memory for specific object-location associations is severely impaired in aged Tg2576 mice.
