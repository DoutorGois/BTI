When the septal area in young adult rats is denervated by a lesion of the fimbria-fornix, adrenergic fibers proliferate within the denervated area. The same operation performed on aged animals gives rise to a qualitatively similar but quantitatively less pronounced response. This reduction in reactive growth may reflect a decreased capacity of the aged brain to remodel its circuitry and restore lost function.
