This study examined the effect of catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) Val(158)Met genotypes on the co-activation of brain areas involved in cognition during a working memory (WM) task. The pattern of concomitant region of interest (ROI) activation during WM performance varied by genotype: Val/Val showing the least and Met/Met the most covariance. There were no differences of performance on the WM task between the COMT genotypes. However, relatively better performance was associated with less concomitance of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cingulate cortex for Val/Val, but more concomitance of DLPFC with AH for Met/Met. Within genotypes WM performance was significantly correlated with rCBF to the amygdala/hippocampus (AH) for Val/Val (r = 0.44, p = 0.009), to the parietal lobe for Val/Met (r = 0.29, p = 0.03), and to the thalamus for Met/Met (r = 0.32, p = 0.04). Different genotypes showed different regional specificity and concomitant activation patterns suggesting that varying dopamine availability induces different brain processing pathways to achieve similar WM performance.
