The functional integrity of hippocampal muscarinic and noradrenergic receptors was assessed utilizing phosphatidyl inositol (PI) hydrolysis. Four months following septal lesions an enhanced hippocampal PI response to carbachol stimulation (61%) was observed while no effect was found in maximal noradrenergic stimulation.
