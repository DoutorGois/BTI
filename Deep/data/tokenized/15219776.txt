Hyperactivity of the stress response has long been recognized as maladaptive. The hippocampus, a brain structure important in mediating this response, is known to be affected by chronic stress, a situation reported to induce changes in adenine nucleotide hydrolysis in the rat. The enzymes catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine in the synaptic cleft are thought to have a role in modulating and controlling synaptic transmission. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acute and repeated restraint stress on the ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolyses in rat hippocampal synaptosomes. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to acute or repeated (15 and 40 days) stress, and ATPase-ADPase, and 5'nucleotidase activities were assayed in the hippocampal synaptosomal fraction. Acute stress induced increased hydrolyses of ATP (21%), ADP (21%) and AMP (40%). In contrast, ATP hydrolysis was increased by 20% in repeatedly stressed rats, without changes in the ADP or AMP hydrolysis. The same results were observed after 15 or 40 days of stress. Therefore, acute stress increases ATP diphosphohydrolase activity which, in association with 5'-nucleotidase, contributes to the elimination of ATP and provides extracellular adenosine. Interestingly, increased ecto-ATPase activity in response to chronic stress reveals an adaptation to this treatment.
