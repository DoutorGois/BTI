Transient forebrain ischemia of 5-min duration causes delayed neuronal death (DND) of vulnerable CA1 neurons in the gerbil hippocampus, which can be prevented by "preconditioning" with a short ischemic stimulus of 2.5-min duration. While a key role of excitatory glutamate receptors for both phenomena has been widely accepted, little is known about the postischemic regulation of central cannabinoid (CB1) receptors. The present study was designed to test whether ischemic preconditioning is associated with specific alterations of protein expression and/or ligand binding of these receptors compared to ischemia severe enough to induce DND. Gerbils were subjected to either a 5-min ischemic period resulting in DND of CA1 neurons, or a 2.5-min period of ischemia usually used for preconditioning. Postischemic hippocampal CB1 receptor protein expression was investigated immunohistochemically, while postischemic ligand binding of [3H]CP 55940 to CB1 receptors was analyzed by quantitative receptor autoradiography in both experimental groups after 24, 48, and 96 h (n=4-5 per time point), respectively, and compared to sham-treated gerbils (n=10). Short-term ischemia of 2.5-min duration caused a transient reduction of hippocampal CB1 receptor protein expression, while receptor binding density was permanently decreased. In contrast, 5-min ischemia did not alter protein expression or ligand binding up to 48 h. Based on these data, postischemic down-regulation of hippocampal CB1 receptors, specifically seen after short-term ischemia usually used for preconditioning, may participate in the mechanisms of endogenous postischemic neuroprotection.
