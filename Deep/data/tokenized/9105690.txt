Both glucocorticoid excess and decreased serotonergic (5-HT) transmission may cause depression. The recently cloned 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors have high affinity for antidepressants. Here, we show that pharmacological adrenalectomy increases 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor mRNA expression in specific hippocampal subfields, effects partly reversed by corticosterone replacement. Increased 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor expression may provide a basis, in part, for the therapeutic actions of adrenal steroid synthesis inhibitors in resistant depression.
