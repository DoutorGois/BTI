In the present study, the role of octreotide (OCT) in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling as well as in acute convulsion models was evaluated. Mice were allocated in groups as (1) control saline; (2) acute PTZ (PTZ-a; 60 mg/kg, i.p.), as a single convulsive dose; and (3) kindled (PTZ-k) receiving nine subconvulsive doses of PTZ (40 mg/kg, i.p.) for 17 days. Groups 4-7 received either valproic acid (VPA) 50 mg/kg or OCT (50 mug/kg, Sandostatin(R)) 30 min by oral gavage before PTZ-a or PTZ-k. The median seizure stage, latency onset of first stage 4/5 seizures, and incidence of convulsing animals were recorded. Cortical dopamine (DA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-10, caspase (Casp)-3, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and nitric oxide (NO) were assessed in addition to inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) that was evaluated immunohistochemically in a different set of groups. OCT halted PTZ-induced epilepsy delaying convulsion latency via modulating MPO and TNF-alpha and normalizing IL-10 with both treatment regimens. In PTZ-k, it decreased Casp-3 activity, NO level, and iNOS immunoreactivity. OCT in both paradigms decreased DA concentration. The current investigation implicates a crucial role for OCT in modulating PTZ-induced kindling by regulating inflammatory and apoptotic effects.
