The features of the exploratory behavior in the open field, of the learning of a conditioned-reflex food-procuring reaction, and of the shift in the level of biogenic amines of the brain was studied in Wistar rats with local injections of the specific neurotoxins 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). It was shown that damage to the structure of the serotoninergic or catecholaminergic systems of the frontal cortex and hippocampus caused by local injection of 6-OH-DA and 5,7-DHT into the neocortex is accompanied by multidirectional changes in the exploratory behavior and learning of the animals.
