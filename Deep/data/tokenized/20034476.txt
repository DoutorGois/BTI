Recent researches have shown that antioxidant compounds may have certain neuroprotective effect against the neurotoxicity of seizures at cellular level. Ubiquinone (UQ), an antioxidant compound, exhibits a wide range of therapeutic effects that are attributed to its potent antioxidant capacity. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of UQ in rats, against the observed oxidative stress during seizures induced by pilocarpine. Wistar rats were treated with either 0.9% saline (i.p., control group), UQ (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p., UQ5, UQ10 and UQ20 groups), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p., P400 group), or co-administration of pilocarpine with UQ group rats 30 min prior to UQ administration. After the treatments all groups were observed for 24 h. The antioxidant enzymatic activities as well as the hydroperoxide concentrations were measured using spectrophotometric methods and the results were analyzed. In pilocarpine group there was a significant increase in hydroperoxides concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity. However, no alteration was observed in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Antioxidant treatment significantly reduced the hydroperoxide content and increased the superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities in rat hippocampus during seizures induced by pilocarpine. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that oxidative stress in hippocampus occurs during seizures induced by pilocarpine, which indicates that brain damage induced by the oxidative process plays a crucial role in seizures pathogenic consequences. Our result also suggests that ubiquinone can exert significant neuroprotective effects that might be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
