The effects of chronic administration of naloxone, morphine and met-enkephalin on benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in rat brain were determined 2 and 50 days after treatments were accomplished. Two days after naloxone treatment (75 micrograms/h s.c. for 14 days), enhanced BDZ receptor binding was observed in cingulate, frontal, piriform, entorhinal and sensorimotor cortices; amygdala complex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and central gray. Two days after morphine treatment (20 mg/kg i.p. daily for 6 days), increased BDZ receptor binding was detected in cingulate, frontal, piriform, entorhinal and sensorimotor cortices; amygdala complex, hippocampus and substantia nigra. Two days after met-enkephalin treatment (10 micrograms/h i.c.v. for 6 days) enhanced BDZ receptor binding was shown only in sensorimotor cortex. No significant changes were observed 50 days after the treatments were completed. These data indicate an important interaction between GABAergic and opioid peptide systems.
