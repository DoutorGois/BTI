Oxidative stress due to excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species in the brain as seen in certain neurodegenerative diseases can have deleterious effects on neurons. Hydrogen peroxide, endogenously generated in neurons under normal physiological conditions, can produce an excess of hydroxyl radical via a Fenton mediated mechanism. This may induce acute oxidative injury if not scavenged or removed effectively by antioxidants. There are several biochemical assay methods to estimate oxidative injury in cells; however, they do not provide information on the biochemical changes as the cells get damaged progressively under oxidative stress. Raman microspectroscopy offers the possibility of real time monitoring of the chemical composition of live cells undergoing oxidative stress under physiological conditions. In the present study, a hippocampal neuron coculture was used to observe the acute impact of hydroxyl radicals generated by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of Fe(2+) (Fenton reaction). Raman peaks related to nucleic acids (725, 782, 1092, 1320, 1340, 1420, and 1576 cm(-1)) showed time-dependent changes over the experimental period (60 min), indicating the breakdown of the phosphodiester backbone as well as nuclear bases. Interestingly, ascorbic acid (a potent antioxidant) when cotreated with Fenton reactants showed protection of cells as inferred from the Raman spectra, presumably by scavenging hydroxyl radicals. Little or no change in the Raman spectra was observed for untreated control cells and for cells exposed to Fe(2+) only, H2O2 only, and ascorbate only. A live-dead assay study also supported the current observations. Hence, Raman microspectroscopy has the potential to be an excellent noninvasive tool for early detection of oxidative stress that is seen in neurodegenerative diseases.
