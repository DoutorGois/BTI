Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-beta peptide have been implicated as proximal neurotoxins in Alzheimer's disease. However, the identity of the neurotoxic aggregate(s) and the mechanisms by which these species induce neuronal dysfunction remain uncertain. Physiologically relevant experimentation is hindered by the low endogenous concentrations of the peptide, the metastability of Abeta oligomers, and the wide range of observed interactions between Abeta and biological membranes. Single-molecule microscopy represents one avenue for overcoming these challenges. Using this technique, we find that Abeta binds to primary rat hippocampal neurons at physiological concentrations. Although amyloid-beta(1-40) as well as amyloid-beta(1-42) initially form larger oligomers on neurites than on glass slides, a 1:1 mix of the two peptides result in smaller neurite-bound oligomers than those detected on-slide or for either peptide alone. With 1 nM peptide in solution, Abeta40 oligomers do not grow over the course of 48 h, Abeta42 oligomers grow slightly, and oligomers of a 1:1 mix grow substantially. Evidently, small Abeta oligomers are capable of binding to neurons at physiological concentrations and grow at rates dependent on local Abeta42:Abeta40 ratios. These results are intriguing in light of the increased Abeta42:Abeta40 ratios shown to correlate with familial Alzheimer's disease mutations.
