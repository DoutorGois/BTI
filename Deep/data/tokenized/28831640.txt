Glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) exert actions on the hippocampus that are important for memory formation. There are correlations between vascular dysfunctions and GR-related gene expression. Both vascular dysfunction and GR gene expression decline occur during the ageing process. Therefore, hypotensors, which have effects on improving vascular dysfunction, may be able to ameliorate GR gene expression decline in ageing mice and improve ageing-mediated memory deficits. In this study, we hypothesized that hypotensors could alleviate the decline of GR gene expression and ameliorate age-induced learning and memory deficits in a D-gal-induced ageing mice model. In line with our hypothesis, we found that chronic D-gal treatment decreased GR and DCX expression in the hippocampus, leading to learning and memory deficits. Amlodipine (AM) and puerarin (PU) treatment improved GR gene expression decline in the hippocampus and ameliorated the learning and memory deficits of D-gal-treated mice. These changes correlated with enhanced DCX expression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus. Furthermore, PU treatment conveyed better effects than AM treatment, but combination therapy did not enhance the effects on improving GR expression. However, we did not find evidence of these changes in non-D-gal-treated mice that lacked GR gene expression decline. These results suggest that AM and PU could improve D-gal-induced behavioural deficits in correlation with GR gene expression.
