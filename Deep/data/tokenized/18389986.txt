OBJECTIVE: To examine Pueraria mirifica (Leguminosae) containing-phytoestrogen effect on synaptic density and involvement of estrogen receptor. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The level of synaptophysin, a presynaptic vesicle protein, was measured using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry in hippocampal primary cell cultures at 6 days in vitro. RESULTS: P. mirifica and 17beta-estradiol (0.1 microM) treatment for 4 days, but not for 2 days, significantly increased synaptophysin immunoreactivity and level of synaptophysin. P. mirifica up to 60 microg/ml resulted in a dose related increase in the level of synaptophysin immunoreactivity. The classical estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182 780, significantly blocked P. mirifica-induced increase in synaptophysin. CONCLUSION: P. mirifica-containing phytoestrogen affects synaptic density by inducing synaptophysin expression via estrogen receptor.
