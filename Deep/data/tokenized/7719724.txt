The effects of ibotenic acid lesions of the mammillary bodies (MM) on the sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake (SDHACU) velocity into both the hippocampus and the frontal cortex were investigated in this study in either a quiet or an active (exploration of a T-maze) condition. Results showed that MM lesion globally produced a significant decrease of both hippocampal and cortical SDHACU. However, the magnitude of this decrease was not significantly different in the active as compared to the quiet condition. These findings suggest that MM lesion alters the tonically but not phasically active transynaptic control of cortical and hippocampal cholinergic activities.
