The origins of human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis are still not well understood. Hippocampal sclerosis and temporal lobe epileptogenesis involve a series of pathologies including hippocampal neuronal loss and gliosis, axonal reorganization, and maybe hippocampal neoneurogenesis. However, the causality of these events is unclear as well as their relation to the factors that may precipitate epileptogenesis. Significant differences between temporal lobe epileptogenesis in the adult and immature brain may require differential approaches. Hereditary factors also may participate in some cases of hippocampal sclerosis. The key point is to identify the significance of these age-dependent changes and to design preventive treatments. Novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis may include rational use of neuroprotective agents, hormonotherapy, immunizations, and immunotherapy.
