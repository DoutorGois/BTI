On 22 rabbits with bipolar electrodes chronically implanted in the dorsal hippocampus and the mid-brain reticular formation, it has been established that a submaximal physical load in non-trained animals results in a stable drop of excitability of the studied structures. In the process of a 30-day training programme the hippocampus excitability was lowered, while the reticular formation excitability after a short-term lowering increased and returned to the initial level on the 20th day of training. On the EEG of the studied structures, high-amplitude activity predominated, local blood flow increased only in the reticular formation. The nature of functional interrelations of the studied structures changed both in the non-trained animals and during training.
