Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the cDNA region that codes for the large intracellular loop of the beta 3 subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptors (GABAAR/BZDR) from rat brain. The amplified cDNA was inserted into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-3X and a fusion protein containing glutathione-S-transferase and beta 3 intracellular loop moieties was expressed in bacteria. The fusion protein was affinity-purified and it was used to raise a rabbit anti-beta 3 antiserum. The anti-beta 3 antiserum immunoprecipitated the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor from rat and bovine brain. Immunoblots of the affinity-purified GABAAR/BZDR from bovine brain revealed that the anti-beta 3 antiserum reacted with a 57 kDa peptide, whereas the monoclonal antibody 62-3G1 that recognized both beta 2 and beta 3 reacted with 55 and 57 kDa peptides. The anti-beta 3 antiserum showed specificity for the beta 3 subunit vs beta 2 and beta 1.
