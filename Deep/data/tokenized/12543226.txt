Prior stress exposure is known to alter the activation response to a subsequent stressor. In the present study, we examined neurochemical, neuroendocrinological, and behavioral correlates of short-term adaptation to homotypic stressors administered 60 min apart. An initial electric footshock significantly induced extracellular levels of both serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) in the rat hippocampus (650% and 200% above baseline, respectively), as measured by in vivo microdialysis. A rapid habituation in this response was evident in the inability of a second footshock to evoke similar increases. In contrast, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response was augmented further after the second shock session: plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were 18.1, 316.5, and 441.6 mg/ml in nonstressed, one-footshock-, or two-footshock-treated rats, respectively. In a social interaction paradigm, rats subjected to a single footshock showed several fear- and anxiety-related behaviors such as increases in freezing and decreases in rearing and active approach for social interaction. Exposure to a second footshock completely blocked the freezing response and restored rearing behavior without affecting the disruption in social interactions. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that neurochemical and neuroendocrine adaptations to short-term homotypic stressors differentially contribute to expression of different fear and anxiety-like responses in the rat.
