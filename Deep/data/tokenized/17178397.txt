In a new study in this issue of Neuron, Jakubs and colleagues report that adult-generated hippocampal granule cells develop particular functional properties when their birth is induced by epileptic seizures. The new neurons showed reduced excitatory synaptic input and decreased excitability. Their functional integration was thus adjusted to the prevailing functional state in the network. By this means, adult neurogenesis might contribute to network homeostasis in the epileptic temporal lobe.
