The objective was to study age-related changes in sleep-wake stages in the rat by using precise polyphysiograph criteria for stage identification. Cortical and hippocampal electroencephalogram, and ocular and myographic activities were recorded in young, middle-aged, and old male Wistar rats to define 6 stages: active and quiet wake (AW, QW); light and deep slow wave sleep (SWS: S1, S2); intermediate stage of sleep (IS); and paradoxical sleep (PS). The old rats displayed a decrease in S1, S2, and IS, accompanied by an enhancement of AW. No age changes were found for QW and PS. It is suggested that the consolidation of SWS is primarily disturbed in the old rats, which may lead to a facilitation of wake.
