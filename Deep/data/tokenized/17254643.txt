Exposure to banana scented salty water produced a preference for that smell in rats tested under a sodium appetite (experiment 1), and exposure to almond scented sweet water produced avoidance of that smell when rats were tested after developing an aversion to the sweet taste (experiment 2). The consolidation of this within-event learning was disrupted when exposure to the solutions were followed by social isolation. These results duplicate the disruptive effect of social isolation on context learning and raise the possibility that within-event learning like context learning may involve the hippocampal formation.
