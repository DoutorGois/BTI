Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP), originally isolated from soluble fraction of young rat hippocampus and released from hippocampus by the stimulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, enhances the cholinergic phenotype development in vitro. HCNP precursor protein (HCNP-pp) has multiple functions, not only acting as the precursor of HCNP but also serving as an inhibitor of phosphorylation of Erk and contributing to neuronal growth and memory formation. In this study, the accumulation of HCNP and/or HCNP precursor in hippocampus was found to progress from 2 to 5 months of age in senescence-accelerated mouse-prone 8 (SAM P8). This HCNP surge in the hippocampus appears to correspond to the age of onset of memory deterioration, reduction of amount of NMDA-type receptor, and morphological aberration in this dementia model mouse, SAM P8. The present findings, together with our previously published results, suggest that the HCNP and/or HCNP precursor is involved in the dysfunction of the cholinergic neuronal system and memory deterioration in this model mouse via NMDA-type receptor signaling and the activation of the MAP cascade.
