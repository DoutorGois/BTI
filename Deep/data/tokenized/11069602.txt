The possibility that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in the induction of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus has been the subject of considerable investigation. However, many of the conclusions have been drawn from the use of relatively nonspecific PKC inhibitors. In the present study we have examined the role of PKC in tetanus-induced LTP of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices obtained from adult rats. In particular, we have investigated the possible role of PKC in a molecular switch process that is triggered by the synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors and regulates the induction of LTP. We find that the three PKC inhibitors examined, chelerythrine, Ro-31-8220 and Go 6983, all block the setting of the molecular switch at concentrations consistent with inhibition of PKC. In contrast, these inhibitors are without affect on the induction of LTP, even when applied in very much higher concentrations. A PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMPS, had no effect on either process. We suggest that neither PKC nor PKA is required to induce LTP at this synapse. However, PKC is involved in the regulation of LTP induction, via the molecular switch process.
