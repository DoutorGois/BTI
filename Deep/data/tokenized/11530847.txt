The induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation is modulated by many afferent influences from a number of subcortical structures known to be intimately involved in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. It has been demonstrated in slice and anesthetized preparations that norepinephrine (NE) is one of these major neuromodulators involved in the induction of LTP. However, the majority of these studies have not been conducted in the freely moving animal. Recently, we developed surgical procedures and instrumentation techniques to simultaneously record electrophysiological and neurochemical data from the hippocampal formation. The present study uses these techniques to examine the underlying neurochemical changes in the hippocampus associated with the induction of hippocampal dentate LTP in the freely moving adult rat. These findings establish baseline levels of NE that can be used to evaluate the impact of various tetanization paradigms as well as the effect of a variety of insults on hippocampal plasticity.
