The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of the hippocampus was examined in adult freely moving rats that had had all of the neocortex, including the cingulate cortex and cingulum, removed at birth. Both the cholinergic and serotonergic forms of rhythmical slow activity (RSA or theta) were present in the dorsal hippocampus and retained their normal relation to behavior. The results show that following decortication, inputs to and connections within the hippocampus apparently retain the ability to produce normal EEG. Since adult decortications abolish serotonergic RSA, the results also suggest that following neonatal injury there is reorganization within remaining serotonergic projections to the hippocampus that spare this form of RSA.
