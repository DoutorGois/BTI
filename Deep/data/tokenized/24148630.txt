Supratentorial hemangioblastomas (HBs) are exceedingly rare tumors accounting for 5%-10% of all HBs and usually present in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Isolated HBs of the central nervous system also occur as a result of spontaneous mutation in the absence of any clinical manifestations of VHL disease. Of 13 temporal lobe HBs, only one non-VHL case was reported in the hippocampus. We describe the TRICKS findings in a case of isolated hemangioblastoma in the hippocampus without VHL disease. To our knowledge, this is the second case report of a hippocampal non-VHL hemangioblastoma.
