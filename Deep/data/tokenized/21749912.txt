Functional studies indicate that the dopamine D5 receptor is involved in synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. However, previous anatomical studies have detected D5 receptor labelling primarily on the soma and main dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and on dendritic spines in monkey but not in rats. In order to get a better understanding of putative dopamine function in the hippocampus, we quantified the D5 receptor immunoreactivity on the pyramidal cell somas and on spines and dendrites in stratum radiatum and stratum oriens in the hippocampal CA1 region of rats by quantitative immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy. The quantitative immunogold results revealed a higher labelling density on dendritic spines, notably at their synaptic membranes, compared to pyramidal cell somas and dendrites. Hence, dopamine could have effects on spines as well as on somas and dendrites. The labelling density was similar on spines in stratum oriens and stratum radiatum, but the presence of labelling varied between the spines within each stratum, indicating that the effect of dopamine could be diverse between different spines.
