Male rats of the strains with low (LE) high excitability (HE) of the nervous system have been used in this study. Half of the animals of each strain were neurotized in accordance with the Hecht's scheme. In the hippocampal slices of the non-neurotized LE rats there was a significant increase of the populational spike amplitude during development of LTP as compared with the opposite group of the animals. The LTP formation in the LE strain of rats caused a decrease in the S-100 protein content in the water-soluble, and an increase in the membrane-bound fraction of the protein. Similar results we have observed with the non-inbred Wistar rats but not with the HE strain of the animals. The levels of the water-soluble S-100 protein fraction were also higher in the hippocampuses and entorenal cortices, but not in the cerebellae of the LE strain, as compared with the HE strain of the rats. No differences have been found in the membrane-bound fraction of S-100 protein.
