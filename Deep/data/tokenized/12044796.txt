We performed an autoradiographic study of [D-Ala(2),MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO)-sensitive [(3)H]naloxone binding to micro-opioid receptors and of [(3)H][D-Pen(2),D-Pen(5)]enkephalin (DPDPE) binding to delta-opioid receptors in the rat brain after 4- or 21-day treatments with paroxetine, reboxetine and moclobemide to investigate the participation of these receptors in the adaptive mechanisms occurring during the delay of action of new generation antidepressants. Paroxetine increased micro-opioid receptor binding site density in cingulate and insular cortices, dorsal endopiriform nucleus (4 days) and olfactory tubercle (21 days) and decreased it in thalamus (21 days). Reboxetine increased it in amygdala (4 days), hippocampus and thalamus (21 days) and decreased it in dorsal raphe (4 days). Moclobemide increased it in hippocampus (4 days) and decreased it in anterior olfactory nucleus, frontal cortex, amygdala and hypothalamus (21 days). Moclobemide increased delta-opioid receptor binding site density in frontal cortex and amygdala (4 days) and decreased it in amygdala and colliculi (21 days). Opioid receptors displayed distinct patterns of adaptations in response to the three antidepressants studied.
