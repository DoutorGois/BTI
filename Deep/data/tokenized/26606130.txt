We previously developed orthosteric M1 muscarinic agonists (e.g. AF102B, AF267B and AF292), which act as cognitive enhancers and potential disease modifiers. We now report on a novel compound, AF710B, a highly potent and selective allosteric M1 muscarinic and sigma1 receptor agonist. AF710B exhibits an allosteric agonistic profile on the M1 muscarinic receptor; very low concentrations of AF710B significantly potentiated the binding and efficacy of carbachol on M1 receptors and their downstream effects (p-ERK1/2, p-CREB). AF710B (1-30 microg/kg, p.o.) was a potent and safe cognitive enhancer in rats treated with the M1 antagonist trihexyphenidyl (passive avoidance impairment). These effects of AF710B involve sigma1 receptor activation. In agreement with its antiamnesic properties, AF710B (at 30 nM), via activation of M1 and a possible involvement of sigma1 receptors, rescued mushroom synapse loss in PS1-KI and APP-KI neuronal cultures, while AF267B (1 microM) was less potent in PS1-KI and ineffective in APP-KI models, respectively. In female 3xTg-AD mice, AF710B (10 microg/kg, i.p./daily/2 months) (i) mitigated cognitive impairments in the Morris water maze; (ii) decreased BACE1, GSK3beta activity, p25/CDK5, neuroinflammation, soluble and insoluble Abeta40, Abeta42, plaques and tau pathologies. AF710B differs from conventional sigma1 and M1 muscarinic (orthosteric, allosteric or bitopic) agonists. These results highlight AF710B as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. improving cognitive deficits, synaptic loss, amyloid and tau pathologies, and neuroinflammation) with a superior profile over a plethora of other therapeutic strategies.
