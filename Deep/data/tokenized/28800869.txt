Glutamatergic and GABAergic systems play key roles in the hippocampus and affect the pathogenesis of anxiety- and memory-related processes. Some investigations have assessed the role of balancing the function of these two systems in different areas of the central nervous system (CNS) as an approach to manage the related disorders. We investigated the anxiety and avoidance memory states using the test-retest protocol in the elevated plus maze to understand the role of GABAB receptors (GABABRs) in relation to the NMDA receptor blockade by D-AP5 (an NMDA receptor antagonist). Also, we examined the function of Ca(2+) ions by blocking its entrance to the cell using SKF96365 (a Ca(2+) channel blocker). The drugs were injected into the CA3 region before the test. Our data showed that D-AP5 induced anxiolytic-like behaviors and impaired the avoidance memory. Injection of baclofen (a GABABR agonist), but not phaclofen (a GABABR antagonist) induced anxiolytic-like behaviors. Neither baclofen nor phaclofen altered avoidance memory-related behaviors. When baclofen was injected before D-AP5, it potentiated the anxiolytic-like behaviors induced by D-AP5, but counteracted its effect on avoidance memory. Phaclofen pretreatment attenuated D-AP5-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors, but potentiated its effect on avoidance memory. The effect of baclofen application before D-AP5 on anxiety and phaclofen application before D-AP5 on avoidance memory at the heist doses were accompanied by a decrease in locomotion. The application of SKF96365 did not alter anxiety-like behaviors but induced avoidance memory impairment. SKF96365 application before the combination of baclofen and D-AP5 counteracted the effects produced by the combination of baclofen and D-AP5 on anxiety and memory states. Our findings showed that the CA3 GABABRs had a critical role in anxiolytic-like behaviors and avoidance memory deficit induced by D-AP5 and confirmed the role of Ca(2+) ions in the observed results.
