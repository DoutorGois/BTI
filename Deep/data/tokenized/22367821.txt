Although primary neuronal cell cultures are a valuable source of in vitro insight for many neurobiologists, all current gene expression technologies for these cells have significant drawbacks. Some of these limitations of current gene expression protocols include toxicity, transient expression, a requirement for postnatal neurons, and/or low efficiency. To date, many types of experiments were not possible because of these limitations. Here, we outline a methodology by which primary cultured neurons can be transduced at any age, after plating, with virtually no toxicity and continued gene expression for the lifetime of the culture. This method involves the use of adeno-associated viral vectors, which have the potential to be highly useful for either upregulation or downregulation of single or multiple genes, including neurotrophins, other neuroprotective genes, and neurotoxins.
