The temporal sequence of electrophysiological and biochemical correlates of epilepsy induced by systemic injection of kainic acid (15 mg/kg i.p.) was investigated in male rats. A significant decrease in the hippocampal concentration of glutamate and aspartate was observed 20 min after the injection. These decreases preceded both electrographic and behavioral manifestations of epilepsy, thus suggesting a causal relationship between acidic amino acid changes and the genesis of kainate-induced hyperactivity. About 30-45 min after kainate injection, a decrease in glutamate, aspartate, glycine and taurine and no change in GABA concentration were observed. Bioelectrical activity, recorded in the regio inferior (CA3) of the hippocampus or in the fascia dentata revealed the presence of high frequency bursts separated by a long-lasting depression of discharge. About 55-75 min after the injection, the number of spikes in each burst increased and the duration and frequency of interictal pauses decreased. This stage was characterized by a decrease in glutamate and aspartate, restoration to normal of glutamine, glycine and taurine and a decrease in GABA.
