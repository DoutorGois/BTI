Saturable [3H]-8OHDPAT binding to 5HT-1A receptors in membranes prepared from hippocampus and frontal cerebral cortex of alcohol-preferring P rats and of alcohol-nonpreferring NP rats has been compared. The Bmax values or densities of recognition sites for 5HT-1A receptors in both brain areas of the P rats are 39 and 131 percent, respectively, higher than those in the NP rats. The corresponding KD values are 38 and 44 percent lower in the P rats than in the NP rats, indicating higher affinities of the recognition sites for the 5HT-1A receptors in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of the P rats. These findings indicate either an enrichment of 5HT-1A receptor density during selective breeding for alcohol preference or an upregulation of 5HT-1A receptors developed as an adaptation to lower presynaptic concentrations of 5HT found in these brain areas of P rats as compared with the NP rats.
