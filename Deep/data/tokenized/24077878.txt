Vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4), is a member of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities protein family. VPS4 is composed of VPS4A and VPS4B, VPS4B plays an important role in the lysosomal degradation pathway, intracellular protein trafficking, virus budding and abscission of cytokinesis. However, information regarding its distribution and possible function in the central nervous system is limited. Therefore, we performed a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult rats and detected the dynamic changes of VPS4B in hippocampus CA1 subregion. We found that the VPS4B expression was increased strongly after MCAO and reached the peak after 3 days. VPS4B mainly located in the cytoplasm of neurons, but not astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, there was a concomitant up-regulation of active caspase-3. In vitro studies indicated that the up-regulation of VPS4B may be involved in oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced PC12 cell death. And knock-down of VPS4B in cultured differentiated PC12 cells by siRNA showed that VPS4B promoted the expression of active caspase-3. Collectively, all these results and MTT assay suggested that the up-regulation of VPS4B played an important role in the pathophysiology after MCAO, and further research is needed to have a good understanding of its function and mechanism.
