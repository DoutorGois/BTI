[3H]5,7 Dichlorokynurenic acid ([3H]DCKA) was used to define conditions for obtaining selective binding to strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors. The parameters were established in sections of human brain prior to localizing the receptors sites by autoradiography. The binding of [3H]DCKA was of high affinity (Kd = 14.5 nM), readily reversible (K-1 = 0.216 min-1), and specific (60% specific binding determined by inhibition with 100 microM glycine or D-serine). High levels of strychnine-insensitive glycine receptors were identified in several brain areas including portions of the cerebral cortex (Bmax in middle temporal gyrus: 174.0 fmol/mg tissue), basal ganglia, hippocampal formation, and midbrain. These results identify regions where glycine receptors may be involved in modulating NMDA-mediated channel activity.
