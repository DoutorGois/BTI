The contents of parvalbumin in various nervous tissues of the rat were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and its cellular distribution was immunohistochemically examined by peroxidase-antiperoxidase methods. The antibody, raised in rabbits using rat skeletal muscle parvalbumin, did not cross-react with other Ca2+-binding proteins such as calmodulin or S-100 proteins. The RIA demonstrated the wide distribution of the antigen, with very high levels in the cerebellum (3,217 +/- 519 ng/mg protein). The immunohistochemical description by Celio and Heizmann [Nature 293, 300-302 (1981)] was confirmed concerning the existence of the antigen in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum; nonpyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex; and medium-sized cells of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. In addition to these neurons, we found the parvalbumin-like immunoreactivity in the large neurons of the superior vestibular nucleus and the neurons of the medial superior olive nucleus. In the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-containing nuclei such as substantia nigra, caudatoputamen, and globus pallidus, parvalbumin-positive cells and fibers were rare. In the medial lemniscus of the midbrain which contains no GABA, parvalbumin-immunoreactive fibers were prominent. The possibility was discussed that parvalbumin exists in a specific population of neurons that differ from those containing GABA.
