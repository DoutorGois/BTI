Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy biochemical characteristics in early stages of schizophrenia were examined. N-acetylaspartate, choline and creatine were measured in hippocampus, anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of 24 first episode and 30 ultra-high risk patients. Careful LCModel analyses revealed no differences between the patient groups and 31 healthy controls, casting doubt upon the idea of metabolic changes in early stages of psychosis.
