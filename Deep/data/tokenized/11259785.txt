Equimolar replacement of 10 mM glucose by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) causes substantial depression followed by a sharp and sustained potentiation of CA1 field EPSPs. In the present experiments, similar applications of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, which is also taken up by cells but is not phosphorylated, had only a weak blocking action and elicited no potentiation. Possible explanations for the marked effects of 2-DG include a more rapid block of glycolysis and the production of phosphorylated derivatives of 2-DG.
