Chronic consumption of lithium leads to a significant decrease in GABA receptor binding in frontal cortex of rat brain with no change in the binding characteristics in the remaining part of the cortex and in the hippocampus. In conclusion, the effect of lithium on the muscimol receptor is brain region-specific and due to a change in the number of receptors rather than in the affinity constant.
