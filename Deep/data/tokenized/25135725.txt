The changes of microRNA expression in rat hippocampus after traumatic brain injury (TBI) were explored. Adult SD rats received a single controlled cortical impact injury, and the ipsilateral hippocampus was harvested for the subsequent microarray assay at three time points after TBI: 1st day, 3rd day and 5th day, respectively. We characterized the microRNA expression profile in rat hippocampus using the microRNA microarray analysis, and further verified microarray results of miR-142-3p and miR-221 using quantitative real-time PCR. Totally 205 microRNAs were identified and up-/down-regulated more than 1.5 times. There were significant changes in 17 microRNAs at all three time points post-TBI. The quantitative real-time PCR results of miR-142-3p and miR-221 indicated good consistency with the results of the microarray method. MicroRNAs altered at different time points post-TBI. MiR-142-3p and miR-221 may be used as potentially biological markers for TBI assessment in forensic practice.
