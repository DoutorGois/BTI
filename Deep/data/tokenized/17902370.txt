In experiments in white Wistar rats of three-age groups (immature, mature and old rats) content of glial fibrous acidic protein (GFAP) was investigated in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and brain stem after the carrying out of laparotomy. The correlation between emotional activity and the level of GFAP has been found in the given structures of a brain. In immature animals, the activation of emotional component of behaviour was accompanied by decrease in polypeptide's soluble and insoluble fractions in brain stem by 16% and 18%, respectively (p<0.05) in relation to intact animals. In mature rats, the operative trauma was accompanied by the lowering of grooming and lowering of the level of soluble fraction of GFAP in all structures. In old rats, laparotomy evoked accumulation of polymerized and depolymerized forms of GFAP in hippocampus by 34% and 48% (p<0.05), respectively.
