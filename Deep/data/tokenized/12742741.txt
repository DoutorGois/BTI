Electrophysiological recordings were made from Fischer rats engineered to express the human presenilin 1 gene carrying the M146V mutation. Extracellular recordings of field excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSPs) were made to investigate EPSP properties, paired pulse responses, posttetanic potentiation, and long-term potentiation in the stratum radiatum and dentate gyrus of hippocampal slices maintained in vitro. Transgenic rats aged approximately 6 months showed no differences from their wild-type littermates in any of these properties. However, at 18 months, long-term potentiation in the CA1 was facilitated in the transgenic rats with a different pattern of synaptic enhancement. No changes were observed in paired pulse facilitation (PPF) or post-tetanic potentiation (PPT) and no changes were seen in the dentate gyrus. Field potential amplitudes were significantly greater and PPF was enhanced in the CA1 of all older rats. Intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells of the older group of rats revealed no differences in the passive or active membrane properties of cells in the two groups, but intracellularly recorded EPSPs were significantly longer.
