The distribution of NMDA receptors in the normal human hippocampus has been investigated using the non-competitive channel blocking agent, MK801. The pattern of specific [3H]MK801 binding was broadly similar to that previously described for agonist binding although differences included equal densities in h1 and h2 regions where binding was mainly confined to the pyramidal layer and stratum radiatum.
