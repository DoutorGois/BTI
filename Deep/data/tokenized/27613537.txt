Guanosine, the endogenous guanine nucleoside, prevents cellular death induced by ischemic events and is a promising neuroprotective agent. During an ischemic event, nitric oxide has been reported to either cause or prevent cell death. Our aim was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of guanosine against oxidative damage in hippocampal slices subjected to an in vitro ischemia model, the oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) protocol. We also assessed the participation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes activity on the neuroprotection promoted by guanosine. Here, we showed that guanosine prevented the increase in ROS, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite production induced by OGD. Moreover, guanosine prevented the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential in hippocampal slices subjected to OGD. Guanosine did not present an antioxidant effect per se. The protective effects of guanosine were mimicked by inhibition of neuronal NOS, but not of inducible NOS. The neuroprotective effect of guanosine may involve activation of cellular mechanisms that prevent the increase in nitric oxide production, possibly via neuronal NOS.
