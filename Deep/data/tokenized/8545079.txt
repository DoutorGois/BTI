The effects of water-immersion restraint stress (WS) on chronically nicotine-administered rats were studied in the blood and various regions of the brain. Serotonin (5-HT) levels increased in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum following the administration of nicotine. 5-HT levels increased in all the brain regions following stress. Nicotine decreased stress-induced increased levels of 5-HT in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Nicotine administration alone increased 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Stress alone also increased 5-HIAA levels in all the brain regions. In the cortex, 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels further increased following the administration of a combination of stress and nicotine compared to rats given stress alone. In the blood as well as in all the brain regions, except the cerebellum, stress or nicotine administration did not affect tryptophan levels. Stress given to nicotine-administered rats resulted in a decrease in tryptophan levels in the blood and plasma. Although 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were not influenced by stress and/or nicotine administration, the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio increased in the blood and plasma of rats administered with nicotine and exposed to stress. The effects of nicotine on the serotonergic system depend upon the kind of stress given together with the organs and brain regions involved.
