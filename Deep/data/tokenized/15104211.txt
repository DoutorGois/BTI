Hypertension, aging and a range of neurodegenerative diseases are associated with increased oxidative damage. The present study examined whether superoxide (O2*-) levels in brain are increased during aging in female rats, and the role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and oestrogen in regulating O2*- levels. Young adult (3 month) and old (11 month) female spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone rats (SHRSP) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were studied. O2*- levels were measured in brain homogenates by lucigenin chemiluminescence and SOD expression by Western blotting. Ageing significantly increased brain O2*- levels in WKY (cortex +216%, hippocampus +320%, striatum +225%) and to a greater extent in SHRSP (cortex +540%, hippocampus +580%, striatum +533%). Older SHRSP showed a decline in cortical Cu/Zn SOD expression compared to young adult SHRSP. Oestrogen did not attenuate O2*- levels. The results show a significant age-dependent increase in brain O2*- levels which is exaggerated in SHRSP. The excess cortical O2*- levels in the SHRSP may be associated with a down-regulation of Cu/Zn SOD but are not related to a decrease in oestrogen.
