The physiological properties of hippocampal slices from intact or adrenalectomized (ADX) BALB/c mice were studied in vitro. Mouse hippocampal slices displayed features similar to those observed in other species in terms of postsynaptic characteristics of response to stratum radiatum stimulation. In adrenalectomized mouse, the amplitude of population spike was reduced whereas the latency of population spike and cell responses to paired stimuli volleys were unchanged. The role of the endocrine status in this modification is discussed.
