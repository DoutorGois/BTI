The structure and topography of the damages in the central nervous system of mature (35th week of pregnancy and more) human newborns, who died in the perinatal period due to hypoxia, have been investigated. Two homogenous groups were separated: In the first group hypoxia was due to placental pathology, in the second group it was the result of umbilical cord pathology. The greatest damages of the cells in paleocortex were found in the region of Ammon's horn, in neocortex the most seriously injured were parietal and occipital lobes.
