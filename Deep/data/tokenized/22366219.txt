Cholinergic deficit is one of the most remarkable symptoms and plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, the protective effects of Akebia saponin D (ASD) on learning and memory impairments induced by excitatory neurotoxin ibotenic acid injection were examined in vivo. Our findings suggest that ASD (90 mg/kg, p.o.) would exert a rescue effect on rats both in behavioral performances in Morris water maze and Y maze and cholinergic functions detected by chemical methods. We further investigated in the hippocampus and found ASD could regulate apoptosis-related proteins expression following ibotenic acid injection. Additionally, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family phosphorylations were inhibited after ASD treatment, implicating that the MAPK signaling pathway could be involved in the mechanism underlying neuroprotection of ASD against ibotenic acid-induced excitotoxicity.
