The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel-complex is widely distributed in the hippocampus, particularly in the CA1 region, in the terminal field of CA3 pyramidal axons and in the fascia dentata, in the terminal field of the perforant pathway. In the present study, we have examined, in the rat, the effect of specific lesions of various neuronal populations of the hippocampus on the distribution of several markers of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-channel complex. Anoxic-ischemic treatment produced a destruction of CA1 pyramidal cells (postsynaptic element): this was associated with a 50% loss of N-methyl-D-aspartate, glycine and N-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine binding sites. In contrast, the destruction of CA3 pyramidal cells and their axons (presynaptic element) by kainate treatment did not induce significant changes in the density of binding sites. The present results therefore strongly support an exclusively postsynaptic localization of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-channel complex in CA1; the possibility of a localization of the remaining binding sites on glial cells or interneurons is discussed. In the molecular layer of the fascia dentata, the anoxic-ischemic treatment produced a partial destruction of the median perforant pathway (presynaptic element) associated with a decrease in the density of N-methyl-D-aspartate, N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl)piperidine and glycine binding sites; this suggests that, in contrast to CA1, in the molecular layer of the fascia dentata, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-binding sites are located both pre- and postsynaptically.
