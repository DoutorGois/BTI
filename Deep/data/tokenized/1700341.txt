When WGA-HRP (wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate) was injected into the amygdala (lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei) or entorhinal cortex of the cat, a number of nonpyramidal neurons in Ammon's horn were retrogradely labeled. The results indicate that some non-pyramidal neurons in Ammon's horn send projection fibers to the amygdala and entorhinal cortex.
