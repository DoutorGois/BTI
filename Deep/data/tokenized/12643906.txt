The newly synthesized linoleic acid derivative, FR236924, induces a long-lasting facilitation of hippocampal neurotransmission based on a persistent enhancement in the activity of presynaptic nicotinic ACh receptors via a PKC pathway and the ensuing increase in glutamate release, not only in vitro but in vivo at a low dosage (2mg/kg, ip), which suggested the possibility of its use as a promising anti-dementia drug.
