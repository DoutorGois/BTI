The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of polydatin on cognitive function in rats self-administered with chronic ethanol levels. The levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) were also determined. In the in vivo study, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to establish an ethanol-administered rat model. Cognitive function was measured using the Morris water maze and the level of Cdk5 expression was measured to evaluate the effect of polydatin treatment. Cdk5 kinase activity and cell survival rate in primary hippocampal neuron cultures treated with ethanol or ethanol and polydatin were measured in the in vitro study. Polydatin reversed the performance impairments in chronic ethanol treated rats in Morris water maze test, and decreased unregulated Cdk5 expression. Moreover, polydatin increased cell survival rate, and decreased Cdk5 activity in the ethanol-treated primary culture of hippocampal neurons. The study results suggest that polydatin exhibits neuroprotective potential for ethanol induced neurotoxicity, both in vivo and in vitro, which is most likely related to its ability to target Cdk5 in neurons.
