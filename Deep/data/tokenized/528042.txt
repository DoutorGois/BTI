Dorsal septum is an intermediary centre in between the hippocampus and hypothalamus and it has got inhibitory influence over the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Stimulation of the dorsal septum manifested with fall in adrenocortical output whereas its lesion has opposite response. Ventral septum is a facilitatory area regarding activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. It is a balancing centre lying in between the higher central nervous system structures and the hypothalamus. Stimulation and lesion of the ventral septum led to rise and fall in adrenal venous 17-OHCS output respectively. Adrenocortical response to stress of burn was not blocked or inhibited following lesion of the dorsal as well as ventall septum.
