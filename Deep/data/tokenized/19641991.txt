Calretinin (CR)-immunoreactive interneurons are well known as the interneuron specific interneurons in the hippocampus. CR-immunoreactive neurons form cellular network and regulate the activity of other GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus. In the present study, we investigated age-related changes in CR-immunoreactive neurons and protein levels in the gerbil hippocampus during normal aging. In all subregions of the gerbil hippocampus, the number of CR-immunoreactive neurons was significantly decreased in the postnatal month 6 (PM 6) group compared to that in the PM 1 group. Thereafter, CR-immunoreactive neurons were decreased with age. In addition, the number of CR-immunoreactive cells in the subgranular zone were significantly decreased in the PM 6 group. We also observed that CR protein levels were decreased gradually with age. These results indicate that both CR immunoreactivity and its protein level were decreased with age in the gerbil hippocampus during normal aging.
