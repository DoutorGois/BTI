Folium Ginkgo extract(EGb761) has been proved able to significantly prolong the survival time of mice suffering from cerebral ischemia induced by occluding bilateral common carotids, and reduce the inhibition of cerebral GSH-Px and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activities during reperfusion processes of these mice. Pretreatment with EGb761 also helps alleviate the subcellular damages in hippocampus of cerebral ischemic mice.
