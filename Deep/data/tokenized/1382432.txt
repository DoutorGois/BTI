This study examined the effects of electroconvulsive shock (ECS) on interstitial concentrations of serotonin (5-HT), its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), acetylcholine and choline, and the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) in the hippocampus of freely moving rats using online brain microdialysis. The effects of ECS on 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and HVA were compared to the effects of seizures induced by the convulsant agent flurothyl. Interstitial concentrations of 5-HT increased several fold in response to ECS and this increase was accompanied by a significant increase in the concentration of HVA. Acetylcholine and choline concentrations were also increased significantly by ECS. The ECS-induced increase in interstitial 5-HT was markedly reduced when the voltage-dependent sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 mumol/L) was added in the perfusion solution, indicating that the observed increase was of neuronal origin. Interstitial concentrations of 5-HT also increased in response to flurothyl-induced seizures and this increase was accompanied by a significant increase in the concentration of HVA. These results provide direct in vivo evidence that interstitial concentrations of 5-HT increase several fold in response to both ECS- and flurothyl-induced seizures. These observations are discussed in relation to the hypothesized role of 5-HT in ECS-induced memory deficits.
