The effects of ventral intrahippocampal injections of atropine sulfate on patterned single alternation (PSA), a discrimination task that requires intact short-to-intermediate-term memory, were examined in the developing rat at 16-17 and 28-32 days of age. Atropine treatment disrupted simple acquisition in some 16- to 17-day-old pups by interfering with approach to the goal, but did not eliminate PSA at either 8- or 15-s intertrial intervals when approach was normal. In the older rats, atropine treatment delayed the onset and reduced the magnitude of PSA, indicating a reduced memory-based discrimination. These results provide additional support for an increasing role of muscarinic receptors in learning and memory as this system matures in the developing rat, and suggest different mechanisms for PSA at the two ages.
