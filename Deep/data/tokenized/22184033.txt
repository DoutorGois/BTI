Thyroid hormones modulate the physiology of the hippocampus in humans, where glutamate plays an important role as neurotransmitter. The aim of this work was to study the effect of hypothyroidism on hippocampal glutamate extracellular levels, release, uptake, and synthesis. The effects of PDC (a glutamate transporter inhibitor) and ouabain (a Na(+) /K(+) -ATPase inhibitor) infusion on microdialysate glutamate and aspartate levels of CA3 hippocampal region were evaluated. Animals were assigned to one of the following groups: hypothyroid group (Hyp), receiving methimazole (anantithyroid drug); replacement group (Hyp + T(4) ), receiving antithyroid treatment plus thyroxine; and euthyroid control group (Eut). Dialysate fractions were collected every 15 min to determine basal glutamate levels for 1 hr. Then, PDC (10 mM) or ouabain (100 muM) was infused for 30 min. Results showed lower glutamate and aspartate basal levels in Hyp than in Eut groups. PDC infusion increased amino acids levels in all groups, whereas ouabain infusion increased glutamate and aspartate levels only in the Eut group. The infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX; a voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor) prevented the glutamate increase in euthyroid rats. The Hyp + T(4) group showed glutamate levels similar to those found in the Eut group. Additionally, glutaminase activity in hippocampus was lower in the Hyp group than in the Eut or Hyp + T(4) group. Results suggest that high-affinity glutamate transporters are not altered by hypothyroidism; however, decreased hypotyroidism reduced vesicular glutamate release in the CA3-hippocampal region as a consequence of diminished glutamate synthesis.
