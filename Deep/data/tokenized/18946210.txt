Homing (racing) pigeons (Columba livia f.d.) are well-known for their homing abilities, which are thought to be based on a genetic predisposition, multimodal learning and spatial cognition. On average, the hippocampus, a forebrain structure that processes spatial information, is larger in homing pigeons compared to other non-homing pigeon breeds or their wild ancestor, the rock dove. Here we show that this characteristic hippocampus volume is dependent on flying and navigational experience. Twenty homing pigeons originating from the same breeding stock were raised in the same loft under identical constraints. After fledging, 10 of them were allowed to fly around the loft, gain navigational experience and participate successfully in races. The other 10 stayed permanently in the loft and thus did not share the navigational skill experienced by the first group. After reaching sexual maturity, individuals of both groups were sacrificed and morphometric analyses were carried out to measure the volumes of total brain, telencephalon, hippocampus and 12 other brain structures. Individuals with experience in flying and navigation had an 11.2% larger hippocampus relative to the telencephalon compared to non-experienced individuals (p = 0.028). This effect is not seen in any of the other measured brain subdivisions. Given that plasticity in hippocampal volume has a genetic component, our results confirm that there is also an experience component, and that has certain implications for navigational ability. Evidently, experience is a precondition to full hippocampal development.
