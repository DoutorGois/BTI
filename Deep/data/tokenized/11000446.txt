GABA is involved in both clinical depression and in animal models of depression; however, the roles of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors in specific brain regions are not clear. Changes in densities of both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors have been reported with the learned helplessness animal model of depression and with chronic antidepressant drug treatment. However, some of these findings are discrepant. Thus, we used quantitative autoradiography to study the GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors in learned helplessness and we used an experimental paradigm that allows non-specific effects of stress to be differentiated from learned helplessness. Densities of GABA binding were measured in prefrontal cortex, septum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala. In the septum, learned helpless rats had increased densities of GABA(A) receptors and rats that did not become helpless after inescapable stress had decreased GABA(B) receptor densities. No significant group differences of GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptor densities were observed in any other brain region studied. These results suggest a unique role for the septum in modulating GABA in the learned helplessness animal model of depression.
