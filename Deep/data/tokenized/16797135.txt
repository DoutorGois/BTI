Large dense core vesicles (approximately 100 nm) contain neuroactive peptides and other co-transmitters. Smaller dense core vesicles (approximately 80 nm) are known to contain components of the presynaptic active zone and thought to transport and deliver these components during developmental synaptogenesis. It is not known whether excitatory axons in area CA1 contain such dense core vesicles, and whether they contribute to synaptic plasticity of mature hippocampus. Serial section electron microscopy was used to identify dense core vesicles in presynaptic axons in s. radiatum of area CA1 in adult rat hippocampus. Comparisons were made among perfusion-fixed hippocampus and hippocampal slices that undergo synaptogenesis during recovery in vitro. Dense core vesicles occurred in 26.1+/-3.6% of axonal boutons in perfusion fixed hippocampus, and in only 17.6+/-4.5% of axonal boutons in hippocampal slices (P<0.01). Most of the dense core vesicle positive boutons contained only one dense core vesicle, and no reconstructed axonal bouton had more than a total of 10 dense core vesicles in either condition. Overall the dense core vesicles had average diameters of 79+/-11 nm. These small dense core vesicles were usually located near nonsynaptic membranes and rarely occurred near the edge of a presynaptic active zone. Their size, low frequency, locations, and decrease following recuperative synaptogenesis in slices are novel findings that merit further study with respect to small dense core vesicle content and possible contributions to synapse assembly and plasticity in the mature hippocampus.
