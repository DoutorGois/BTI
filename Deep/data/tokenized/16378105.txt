OBJECTIVE: To study the alteration of hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S)/ cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) system during recurrent febrile seizures (FS) in the hippocampus of developing rats. METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into control group (n=8) and hyperthermia-treated group (n=22). Which was subdivided into FS group (n=8) and H group(no seizure occurred, n=9) according to whether seizures occurred. The plasma level of H(2)S was detected by the spectrophotometer. The expression levels of CBS gene and protein were examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry respectively. RESULTS: The plasma levels of H(2)S were increased significantly in FS group compared with those of control group or H group. The expression levels of CBS gene and protein were enhanced in FS group compared with those of control group or H group. CONCLUSION: The expression levels of H(2)S/ CBS system were up-regulated during recurrent FS.
