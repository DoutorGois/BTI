A panel of hybridoma clones producing monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) to the antigens of synaptosomes from rat brain cortex was generated. In immunocytochemical experiments 5F5-B6 Mabs stained stratum moleculare in hippocampus and cerebellum of adult rats intraventricular introduction of 5F5-B6 Mabs was shown to block LTP formation in fascia dentata and to change the evoked potential and population spike amplitude.
