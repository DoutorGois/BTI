The estrogen-synthesizing enzyme aromatase is abundant at the synapse in the zebra finch hippocampus (HP), and its inhibition impairs spatial memory function. To more fully test the role of local estradiol (E2) synthesis in memory, the HP of adult male zebra finches was exposed to either control pellets or those containing the aromatase inhibitor 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD), ATD and E2, ATD and the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) agonist G1, or the antagonist G15 alone. Birds were tested for spatial memory acquisition and performance, and HP levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD95 were measured. ATD-treated birds took longer to reach criterion than control birds, whereas acquisition in ATD+E2 and ATD+G1 birds was indistinguishable from control and ATD treatments. Interestingly, all G15 birds failed to acquire the task. Following a retention interval, ATD birds took the longest to reach the (formerly) baited cup and made the most mistakes. ATD+E2 animals displayed the lowest retention latencies and made fewer mistakes than ATD-treated birds, and ATD+G1 birds did not significantly differ from controls in retention latencies. The amount of PSD95 in the HP was lowest in ATD-treated animals compared with birds with silicone-only-implanted craniotomies, ATD+E2, and ATD+G1 birds, who did not differ in this expression. Thus, spatial memory acquisition and performance appear aromatase and E2 dependent, an effect more reliably revealed after consolidation and/or recall compared to acquisition. E2 may exert this effect via GPERs, resulting in an increase in PSD95 levels that may modify receptor activity or intracellular signaling pathways to increase synaptic strength.
