Limbic cholinergic activity is critically involved in the retention of learned aversions tasks. The purpose of these experiments was to assess the role of cholinergic mechanisms of the dorsal hippocampus in the acquisition of both odor and potentiated odor aversions through taste aversion. Cholinergic activity was increased by physostigmine (Phys). When Phys was applied before the presentation of an odor-taste compound during acquisition, the potentiation of odor-aversion was disrupted, while taste aversion was left intact. When hippocampal cholinergic activity was reduced with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (Scop), enhancement of potentiated odor aversion was observed, again with no effect on taste aversion. Moreover, when Phys was applied before an odor alone it also disrupted odor avoidance in two different odor tests conditioning situations, i.e., odor was followed immediately by lithium chloride or foot shock. Neither Scop nor Phys had any effect on taste or potential odor aversions when applied to fronto-parietal cortex. These results suggest that cholinergic activity of the hippocampus is involved in the acquisition of odor aversion conditioning.
