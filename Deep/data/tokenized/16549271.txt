At excitatory synapses onto hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and subsequent down-regulation of protein phosphatases has a crucial role in the induction of long-term potentiation by low-frequency patterns of synaptic stimulation. Because the second messenger cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate can regulate the activity of different forms of the cyclic AMP degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase, we examined whether increases in cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate can modulate long-term potentiation induction in the mouse hippocampal CA1 region through effects on cyclic AMP signaling. Using the cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast or the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-D,L-penicillamine to elevate cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate levels we found that increases in cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate strongly inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation by low-frequency patterns of synaptic stimulation where protein kinase A activation is required for long-term potentiation induction. In contrast, zaprinast and S-nitroso-D,L-penicillamine had no effect on the induction of long-term potentiation by high-frequency patterns of synaptic stimulation that induce long-term potentiation in a protein kinase A-independent manner. Directly activating protein kinase A with the phosphodiesterase-resistant cyclic AMP analog 8-Br-cAMP, blocking all phosphodiesterases with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, or inhibiting protein phosphatases rescued long-term potentiation induction in zaprinast-treated slices. Together, these results suggest that increases in cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate inhibit long-term potentiation by activating phosphodiesterases that interfere with the protein kinase A-mediated suppression of protein phosphatases needed for long-term potentiation induction. Consistent with the notion that this cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate-mediated inhibitory pathway is recruited by some patterns of synaptic activity, blocking cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate production strongly facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation by long trains of theta-frequency synaptic stimulation. Together, our results indicate that increases in cyclic guanosine 3',5'monophosphate can act as a long-term potentiation suppressor mechanism that selectively constrains the induction of protein kinase A-dependent forms of long-term potentiation induced by low-frequency patterns of synaptic stimulation.
