Previous work has shown that unilateral manipulation of vibrissae in the rat can lead to behavioral asymmetries and to neuronal changes in the basal ganglia: in brief, vibrissae stimulation led to increases in neostriatal dopamine release, whereas unilateral removal of vibrissae led to asymmetries in striatal afferents and to bilateral changes in mesencephalic dopamine mechanisms which were related to the occurrence of behavioral asymmetries and the later recovery therefrom. In the present study, the analysis of neuronal mechanisms possibly affected by vibrissae manipulation was extended to the nerve growth factor and the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA. Unilateral stimulation or removal of the vibrissae did not lead to significant changes in tissue levels of nerve growth factor in the neostriatum, parietal cortex (including the barrel cortex) or the hippocampus. In contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area was affected by vibrissae removal but not by stimulation, as a bilateral increase in labeling was observed on the level of individual neurons. This effect was only observed in animals tested 4 h after vibrissae removal but not after 10 days. The results are discussed with respect to the interaction of vibrissae function with the basal ganglia, the neurotransmitter dopamine and mechanism of functional recovery.
