Axonal regeneration is normally limited within myelinated fiber tracts in the CNS of higher vertebrates. Numerous studies suggest that CNS myelin contains inhibitors that may contribute to abortive axonal growth. In contrast to the evidence of myelin-associated neurite inhibitors, embryonic neurons transplanted into the CNS can regenerate extensively within myelinated tracts in vivo. It has been speculated that embryonic neurons do not yet express the appropriate receptors for myelin-associated inhibitors. Recently, however, extensive regeneration from transplanted adult neurons has also been reported within myelinated tracts of the CNS, casting doubt on the role myelin-associated inhibitors play in abortive regeneration. The present study reexamined the potential of white matter to support neurite growth in vitro. By the use of Neurobasal medium, neurons were cultured onto unfixed cryostat sections of mature rat CNS tissue. As documented previously, robust neuronal attachment and neurite outgrowth occurred on gray matter but these neurites were sharply inhibited by white matter. In addition, however, increased rates of neuronal attachment directly to white matter occurred with neurite outgrowth comparable in length with that on gray matter but limited to directions parallel to the fiber tract. Frequently, the same section of white matter was found to inhibit neurite outgrowth from neurons on gray matter while supporting parallel neurite outgrowth from neurons on white matter. These results suggest that whether white matter supports or inhibits axonal growth depends on the geometric relationship between the axon and the fiber tract; more specifically, white matter supports parallel growth but inhibits nonparallel growth.
