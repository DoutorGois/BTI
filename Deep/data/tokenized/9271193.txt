Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) are proteins that are required for cholinergic neurotransmission. Present knowledge concerning the organization of cholinergic structures has been derived primarily from immunohistochemistry for ChAT. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of mRNAs and the corresponding proteins for ChAT and VAChT by in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. The patterns of distribution of perikarya containing ChAT mRNA. ChAT protein, VAChT mRNA and VAChT protein were similar in most regions, and co-localization in the same neuron of mRNAs for ChAT and VAChT, that of ChAT mRNA and ChAT protein, and that of VAChT mRNA and VAChT protein were demonstrated. However, in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, ChAT-immunoreactive perikarya were present, but they did not contain mRNAs for ChAT and VAChT, and VAChT protein. On the other hand, in the cerebellum, Purkinje cell bodies contained VAChT mRNA and VAChT protein, but they did not contain either ChAT mRNA or ChAT protein. Axon bundles were clearly revealed by immunohistochemistry for ChAT, but they were not detected by that for VAChT. Both ChAT and VAChT antibodies revealed preterminal axons and terminal-like structures. In the forebrain, they were present in the olfactory bulb, nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, olfactory tubercle, lateral septal nucleus, amygdala, hippocampus, neocortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus and median eminence of the hypothalamus. In the brainstem, they were localized in the superior colliculus, interpeduncular nucleus and some cranial nerve motor nuclei, and further in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. These results indicate strongly that ChAT and VAChT are expressed in most of the cholinergic neurons, and that immunohistochemistry for VAChT is as useful to detect cholinergic terminal fields as that for ChAT.
