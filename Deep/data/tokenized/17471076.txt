Synaptotagmin IV is a product of immediate early-response gene. It is involved in the regulated neurosecretion in the brain. Its putative role, however, in vesicular transport and localization in secretor y vesicles is still a matter of debate. Here we followed the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptotagmin IV protein upregulation in the hippocampus, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, nucleus amygdalae, piriform and entorhinal cortices of rats with kainate-induced seizures. We found that upregulation pattern paralleled the direction of depolarization through the hippocampus and also reflecting seizure activity spreading to other brain regions. We speculate that synaptotagmin IV may have a role in the vesicular transport of the upregulated peptides and proteins involved in the plasticity and/or neurodegeneration provoked by the kainate.
