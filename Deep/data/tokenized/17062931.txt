OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of Baisong tablets (BST) on synapse protein synatotagmin (SYT) and synaptophysin (SYN) of hippocampus in chronic stress depression in rats. METHODS: Twenty eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated to 4 groups: a normal control group,a model group,a fluoxetine (FXT) group and a BST group. The normal control rats were fed in a natural environment. Rats of the model, FXT and BST groups were singly housed and given an chronic unpredicted sequence of mild stressors. The distribution and expression differences of SYT and SYN in the hippocampus of rats in different groups were investigated with in situ hybridization and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Expressions of SYT and SYN in the hippocampus of model rats were significantly reduced, compared with that of the normal control (P<0.05); and the expressions of SYT and SYN were significantly increased in the hippocampus of the FXT and BST groups, compared with that of the model group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The expressions of SYT and SYN protein and their mRNA decrease in the hippocampus of stress-model rats. BST can up-regulate their expression.
