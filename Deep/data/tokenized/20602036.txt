The purposes of the present study were to verify monoamines (dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT)), and their metabolites (3,4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)) contents in rat hippocampus after lipoic acid (LA) administration. Wistar rats were treated with 0.9% saline (i.p., control group) and LA (10, 20 or 30 mg/kg, i.p., LA10, LA20 and LA30 groups, respectively). After the treatments all groups were observed for 24 h. The NE and DA levels were increased only in 20 mg/kg dose of LA in rat hippocampus. Serotonin content and in their metabolite 5-HIAA levels was decreased in same dose of LA. On the other hand, in DOPAC and HVA levels did not show any significant change. The alterations in hippocampal monoamines can be suggested as a possible of brain mechanism of action from this antioxidant. The outcome of the study may have therapeutic implications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
