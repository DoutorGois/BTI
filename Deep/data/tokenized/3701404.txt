The action of histamine on CA1 pyramidal cells was studied in a hippocampal slice preparation. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and tetraethylammonium (TEA), histamine had little effect on the calcium spikes. Using the single-electrode voltage-clamp technique, the actions of histamine on membrane currents were tested. In TTX, histamine (1 microM) decreased outward current only at potentials more depolarized than approximately -50 mV, where calcium-mediated potassium current is predominant. In the presence of manganese, histamine was without effect. Histamine (10 microM) did not affect the transient outward potassium current (A-current), the inward M-current resulting from small hyperpolarizing steps, or the inward Q-current elicited by larger hyperpolarizing steps. Blocking potassium currents with TEA or replacing calcium with barium revealed a slow inward current normally carried by calcium. With TTX present to block sodium currents, histamine (10 microM) did not reduce the inward current. The outward current reduced by a maximally effective concentration of histamine (10 microM) can be further decreased by manganese. The results support the conclusion that histamine selectively decreases the calcium-mediated potassium conductance in CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus. The possibility is raised that there is a component of calcium-mediated potassium current that is insensitive to histamine.
