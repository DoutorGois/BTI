AIMS: Lower androgen level in elderly men is a risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It has been reported that androgen reduces amyloid peptides (Abeta) production and increases Abeta degradation by neurons. Activated microglia are involved in AD by either clearing Abeta deposits through uptake of Abeta or releasing cytotoxic substances and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we investigated the effect of androgen on Abeta uptake and clearance and Abeta-induced inflammatory response in microglia, on neuronal death induced by Abeta-activated microglia, and explored underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Intracellular and extracellular Abeta were examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Amyloid peptides (Abeta) receptors, Abeta degrading enzymes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by RT-PCR, real-time PCR, and ELISA. Phosphorylation of MAP kinases and NF-kappaB was examined by Western blot. RESULTS: We found that physiological concentrations of androgen enhanced Abeta42 uptake and clearance, suppressed Abeta42 -induced IL-1beta and TNFalpha expression by murine microglia cell line N9 and primary microglia, and alleviated neuronal death induced by Abeta42 -activated microglia. Androgen administration also reduced Abeta42 -induced IL-1beta expression and neuronal death in murine hippocampus. Mechanistic studies revealed that androgen promoted microglia to phagocytose and degrade Abeta42 through upregulating formyl peptide receptor 2 and endothelin-converting enzyme 1c expression, and inhibited Abeta42 -induced pro-inflammatory cytokines expression via suppressing MAPK p38 and NF-kappaB activation by Abeta42 , in an androgen receptor independent manner. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that androgen promotes microglia to phagocytose and clear Abeta42 and inhibits Abeta42 -induced inflammatory response, which may play an important role in reducing the neurotoxicity of Abeta.
