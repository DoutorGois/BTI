Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is one of three mammalian SOD isozymes. Although there is knowledge of the functional role of EC-SOD in arteries, little is known about the function of EC-SOD in other tissues, including the brain. As a first step toward improving our understanding of EC-SOD in the brain, we studied the localization of EC-SOD in the central nervous system of the adult mouse using immunohistochemistry. We detected EC-SOD staining in a subpopulation of neurons throughout the brain as well as in tanycytes in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Particularly prominent EC-SOD staining was observed in neurons of the hilar region of the hippocampus, the lateral habenular nucleus of the thalamus, and the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Substantial numbers of neurons were distributed throughout the striatum and cortex; the morphology and distribution of these cells was similar to neurons previously shown to contain the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase. In contrast to other regions with prominent EC-SOD immunoreactivity, EC-SOD localization in tanycytes occurred in a region lacking a blood-brain barrier. The high levels of EC-SOD present in discrete populations of cells in these regions suggest that EC-SOD plays an important, specialized role in the physiology and/or pathology in the brain.
