No significant changes were recorded in the content of adrenalin or noradrenalin in the motor cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, mesencephalic reticular formation and caudate nucleus an hour after rabbits received a single injection of lithium hydroxybutyrate. The content of dopamine in the caudate nucleus rose, while that in the thalamus, hippocampus and mesencephalic brain formation concurrently dropped down.
