OBJECTIVE: Expressions of GABA and GABA(A)R-alpha1 in the brain of rats poisoned by Tetramine were analyzed to explore the intoxication mechanism. Methods Sixty rats were randomly divided into control, sham poisoned, high-dose poisoned (1.0 mg/kg tetramine) and low-dose poisoned (0.1 mg/kg) groups. The expressions of GABA and GABA(A)R-alpha1 in the brain of the poisoned rats were detected and analyzed by immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzer. Results The expressions of both GABA and GABA(A)R-alpha1 were diffusely seen in the brains of the control and shame poisoned rat groups with a moderate expression level, whereas the expressions of both GABA and GABA(A)R-alpha1 were decreased in the brains of the high-dose poisoned group. In the low-dose poisoned rat group, the expression of GABA initially decreased and reached its lowest level 6 hours after poisoning, and then started to show an increase and reached the level of control groups at day 3. The expressions level reached its peak at days 5-7 after poisoning and remained above the level of control groups till 10 days after poisoning. Similarly, the expression of GABA(A)R-alpha1 in the brains of the low-dose poisoned group initially decreased and reached its lowest level 6-12 hrs after poisoning, and then started to increase and reached the level of control groups at days 7-10 after poisoning, respectively. Conclusion The expression of both GABA and GABA(A)R-alpha1 decreased in the brains of the high-dose poisoned rat group and these changes of GABA and GABA(A)R-alpha1 expressions may be associated with underlying mechanism of tetramine poisoning.
