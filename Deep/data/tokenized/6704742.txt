Projections of the subnuclei of the interpeduncular complex were studied by the retrograde horseradish peroxidase technique in the rat. The pars caudalis and pars dorsalis magnocellularis project to the septum, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex; a part of the pars medialis and the pars paramediana, to the dorsal thalamus; all subnuclei, to the midbrain raphe; and the pars lateralis, to the dorsal tegmental nucleus.
