Acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus of Wistar strain rats with permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries was examined during a discrimination learning task using a microdialysis method. Such occlusion resulted in obvious impairment of the discrimination performance. The state, the basal value and released patterns, of ACh in the hippocampus differed in the sham-operated control and the experimental group, while ACh release was elevated during the dialysis experiment in both groups. These findings suggested that the bilateral occlusion produced persistent learning deficits from an early stage after the operation and that the impaired discrimination learning performance might be related to the diffusion of ACh in the hippocampus.
