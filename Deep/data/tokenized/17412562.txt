Several studies have demonstrated a controversial involvement of NO in epileptogenesis. The aim of this study is to compare the NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) reactivity in the temporal cortex between surgical specimens of patients with intractable epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis and autopsy controls. Brain samples of patients and postmortem controls were stained with the NADPH-d technique. Sprouting and larger areas of NADPH-d reactive neurons were found in the temporal cortex of epileptic patients.
