Long-term potentiation (LTP) is characterized by a long lasting increase in the efficacy of neurotransmission which may consist of two phases. First an induction phase, with an absolute requirement for post-synaptic activation. Second, a maintenance phase, possibly involving pre-synaptic mechanisms. An essential function for calcium ions in the induction of LTP has been established and a particular emphasis has been placed on the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation in gating a postsynaptic influx of calcium. We now report that pharmacological blockade of intraneuronal calcium release with 20 microM dantrolene-sodium (dantrium) completely blocks the induction of LTP in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice. This drug inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and also diminishes the rise in intraneuronal calcium ion concentrations elicited by NMDA receptor activation in cultured CA1 pyramidal cells. Dantrolene does not block NMDA gated membrane currents or voltage activated Ca2+ currents in these cells. We suggest that release of intraneuronal calcium, rather than calcium influx may be the critical post-synaptic feature underlying LTP induction. We do not however exclude a pre-synaptic involvement in the specificity and/or maintenance of long-term potentiation.
