Considerable excitement has been generated as of late over reports that fragments of the amyloid precursor protein can be neurotoxic both in vivo and in vitro. In this brief report we study the neurotoxicity of the fragment corresponding to amino acids 25-35 of the beta-amyloid protein in the hippocampus in vivo. Under the conditions studied, we do not observe any evidence of consistent, dose-related damage above that seen with vehicle alone.
