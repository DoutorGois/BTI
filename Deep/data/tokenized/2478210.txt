Serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in rat brain were analysed 24 hours after 7-, 15-, 29- days lithium hydroxybutyrate (LH) injections (10 mg/kg daily). After 7 days the drug reduced 5-HT in hypothalamus and 5-HIAA in the mid brain by 35%. After 15 days LH decreased 5-HT in striatum, hypothalamus by 32 and 17% and 5-HIAA in thalamus, hypothalamus by 28 and 44% respectively. After 29 days LH diminished 5-HT in striatum, hippocampus, amygdala by 24, 29 and 32% and 5-HIAA--in hypothalamus by 42%. The role of adaptative changes and stabilization processes in the central serotoninergic system in mechanism of LH psychotropic effects is discussed.
