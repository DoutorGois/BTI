Postmortem changes in catecholamines, indoleamines, and their metabolites in rat brain regions following decapitation were determined by LCEC. In the three regions studied neurotransmitter levels declined after decapitation, whereas the metabolite levels increased. Microwave irradiation at 10 kW rapidly inactivated brain enzymes and thus prevented the postmortem changes.
