We examined long-term behavioural effects of neonatal lesions of the cholinergic basal forebrain obtained by intracerebroventricular injections of 192 IgG saporin (192 IgG-Sap). Five-month-old Wistar male rats (injected with 192 IgG-Sap or phosphate-buffered saline on postnatal day 7) were tested using operant chambers with two nose-poking holes, delivering one food pellet immediately or five pellets after a delay. The length of delay progressively increased over days (from 0 to 100 s). When compared with controls, 192 IgG-Sap rats showed a slight preference for smaller immediate over larger delayed rewards, thus indicating elevated intolerance to delay (i.e. more impulsivity). Sibling animals were tested in a computerized radial maze (baited vs. nonbaited arm procedure). 192 IgG-Sap rats appeared slower than controls in accomplishing the task. The neonatal 192 IgG-Sap lesion did not alter cortical levels of serotonin and/or its metabolites, but induced a marked cortical cholinergic loss. Our data suggest that a prolonged basal forebrain cholinergic hypofunction produces (i) an impairment in cognitive performances that is detectable only when highly complex tasks are used; (ii) a slight enhancement of the impulsive behavioural profile. This animal model may thus be useful to investigate some cognitive deficits and other secondary symptoms seen in Alzheimer's disease.
