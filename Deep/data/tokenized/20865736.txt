Changes in the rate of dentate granule cell neurogenesis and in the fate of newborn granule cells have been implicated in the development and progression of epilepsies. Strategies to normalize neurogenesis in chronic epilepsy models are thought to increase our understanding of the functional consequences of aberrant neurogenesis in the epileptic brain. Therefore, we modulated neurogenesis in an amygdala kindling paradigm in rats by targeted irradiation of the hippocampus using a medical linear accelerator device. Selective irradiation normalized the hippocampal cell proliferation rate in kindled animals. Both, in kindled and nonkindled rats the number of BrdU/NeuN-labeled newborn neurons was reduced in response to irradiation. Whereas kindling resulted in a pronounced increase in the number of neuroblasts identified based on doublecortin-labeling, irradiation prevented the expansion of the neuroblast population. Moreover, irradiation counteracted the kindling-associated increase in hilar basal dendrites, and kept the fraction of cells with basal dendrites at control levels. Despite the efficacious modulation of neurogenesis, irradiation did not affect the rate of kindling progression. Both, the number of stimulations as well as the cumulative afterdischarge duration to reach respective seizure stages were comparable in animals with and without irradiation. In addition, pre- and postkindling thresholds as well as seizure parameters recorded at threshold stimulation remained unaffected by irradiation. In conclusion, the fact that the efficacious modulation of neurogenesis by irradiation did not exert any effects on kindling acquisition and kindled seizures suggests that newborn neurons do not critically contribute to the hyperexcitable state in the chronic epilepsy model used.
