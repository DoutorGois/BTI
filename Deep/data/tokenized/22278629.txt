Puerarin (CAS Number 3681-99-0), a major isoflavone glycoside purified from Pueraria lobata, was reported to possess antioxidative and estrogen-like biological activities. Recent studies showed that puerarin protects different cell types from damage caused by a variety of toxic stimuli. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of puerarin against Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons, as well as the underlying mechanism(s). Following exposure of cells to Abeta25-35, cell survival and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and catalase (CAT) activities were reduced while production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was increased. Preincubation of the cells with puerarin prior to Abeta25-35 exposure increased cell survival and GSH-Px and CAT activities and decreased ROS production. It was previously shown that overactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) is implicated in Abeta-induced cell death. In this study, Abeta25-35 treatment is found to increase GSK-3beta activity and pretreatment with puerarin preventesAbeta-induced activation of GSK-3beta based on Western blot analysis. In addition, puerarin is shown to activate protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, an important upstream kinase of GSK-3beta, possibly promoting subsequent GSK-3beta inhibition. Our data suggest that puerarin attenuates cell death induced by Abeta25-35 via various mechanisms, which might be beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
