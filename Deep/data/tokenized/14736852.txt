Although interactions between backpropagating action potentials and synaptic stimulations have been extensively studied in pyramidal neurons, dendritic propagation and the summation of these signals in interneurons are not nearly as well known. In this study, two-photon imaging was used to explore the basic properties of dendritic calcium signaling in CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons. In contrast to hippocampal pyramidal neurons, the backpropagating action potential-evoked calcium transients in dendrites of interneurons underwent a distance-dependent increment. Although, in proximal dendrites, an increment could be attributed to a smaller dendrite diameter, distal dendrites did not show such dependence. Calcium responses in interneurons had a smaller amplitude, slower rise time, and decay than in pyramidal neurons. To explore the factors underlying the difference, we compared the calcium-binding capacity in interneurons and in pyramidal neurons. Our finding that endogenous calcium buffers had a higher level in interneurons may primarily explain the different kinetics and amplitudes of calcium transients. Synaptic stimulation-evoked calcium transients were also larger at distant dendritic locations. The spread of these signals was restricted to 12-13 microm long dendritic compartments. Supporting the reported lack of long-term potentiation in these interneurons, we found only sublinear or linear summations of calcium responses to coincident synaptic inputs and backpropagating spikes.
