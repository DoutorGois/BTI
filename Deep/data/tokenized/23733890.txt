Fkbp5 is genetically linked to stress-related diseases. Fkbp5 knockout mice are available and widely used to explore the role of Fkbp5 in health and disease. We found that these mice carry a gene duplication of glyoxylase-1, which explains why glyoxylase-1 levels are increased in the Fkbp5 knockout mice.
