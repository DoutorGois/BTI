The synaptic organization of projections to the subiculum from superficial layers of the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex was analyzed in the rat, using anterograde neuroanatomical tracing followed by electron microscopical quantification. Our aim was to assess the synaptic organization and whether the two projection components (lateral, medial) within the perforant pathway are qualitatively and quantitatively similar with respect to the types of synapses formed and with respect to the postsynaptic targets of these entorhinal projections. The tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected into the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex, respectively, and resulting anterograde labeling in the subiculum was studied. For each of the two projection components, we analyzed in four animals (2 x 2) a total of 100 synapses/animal with respect to features of the synapse type, i.e. asymmetrical or symmetrical, as well as regarding their postsynaptic target, i.e. dendritic shaft or spine. No clear differences were observed between the two pathways. The majority of the synapses were of the asymmetrical type, making contact with spines (78%) or with dendritic shafts (14%). A low percentage of symmetrical synapses targeted dendritic shafts (4.2%) or spines (1.3%). About 2.5% of the synapses remained undetermined. The findings indicate that the majority of entorhinal fibers reaching the subiculum exert an excitatory influence primarily onto principal neurons, with a much smaller feed forward inhibitory component. Only a small percentage of entorhinal fibers in the subiculum appears to be inhibitory, largely influencing interneurons.
