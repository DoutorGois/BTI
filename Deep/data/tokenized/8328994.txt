A distribution study was carried out on Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) dosed orally with 14C-labelled N-N'-dicyclopropyl-methyl-piperazine-dichlor-hydrate 14C-Ino 2628-CZ and sacrificed 2, 8 and 24 h after dosage, using whole-body autoradiography. It is demonstrated that radioactivity is found in all the body; high intakes occur in melanin containing tissues, in blood-forming organs, and in accessory genital glands. Moreover, radioactivity crosses the blood-brain barrier and is mainly localized in hippocampus, caudate, putamen and frontal cortex.
