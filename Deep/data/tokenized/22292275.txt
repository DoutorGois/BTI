The study has shown that influence of acute hypoxia in perinatal period leads to structural changes in motor and visual of the neocortex for 20 postnatal days in the form of disturbance of the structural organisation of the neocortex layers. Different fields of hippocampus in perinatal period differently react to hypoxia, and evidence of existence of a long-term perinatal hypoxia was obtained. It is established that after action of acute hypoxia in all the fields there is a cellular destruction, and thinning of pyramidal neurones layers. The most expressed cellular destruction takes place in fields CA4 and CA3. In process of augmentation, the destruction of cells remains appreciable in the field CA4, reduced in the field CA3 and not found in the field CA1; however, in fascia dentate, the destruction of granular neurones with age augmentation increases. Along with in reduction of the dimensions of cellular bodies pyramidal neurones in all fields of hippocampus takes place. Also in all fields of hippocampus, activation of astrocytic reaction occurs, more expressed in the field CA4. The hypoxia influence in the early postnatal period can affect synaptogenes, particularly the formation of giant synapses in a dentate fascia. Study of functional features of the excitatory system of such animals has shown that hypoxia can induce appreciable disturbances of behavioural responses. In rats, disturbances of inhibiting functions of the cerebral cortex, raised anxiety, and spatial learning and working memory disturbances have been noted.
