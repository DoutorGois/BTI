The presence of glucocorticosteroid and progesterone binding sites in the human brain has been investigated with an in vitro autoradiographic approach using [3H]RU 38486. The present data revealed that the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum, the fimbria and the amygdala showed a different pattern of [3H]RU 38486 labeling using various unlabeled steroids (RU 38486, RU 28362, cortisol, RU 27987 and dexamethasone). RU 38486 is the best competitor in all these structures. The hippocampus seems to possess mainly glucocorticosteroid binding sites whereas the entorhinal cortex and the subiculum reveal the presence of both glucocorticosteroid and progesterone binding sites. Furthermore, the amygdaloid complex and the fimbria show a high density of glucocorticosteroid binding sites.
