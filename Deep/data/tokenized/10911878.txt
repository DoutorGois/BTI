Using quantitative structural MRI protocols, we examined the effects of age on alterations in entorhinal cortex (EC) volume. The left EC was found to be smaller than the right in both young and healthy aged subjects. More importantly, the right EC, but not the left, was significantly smaller in elderly participants compared to young controls. In an attempt to determine the earliest sites of involvement in mild and incipient Alzheimer's disease (AD), we compared entorhinal and hippocampal volume in (1) healthy elderly controls, (2) patients with very mild AD, and (3) elderly patients who were evaluated for cognitive complaints, but did not meet criteria for dementia. Both patient groups differed from controls in EC volume, but not from each other. In contrast, the two patient groups differed in hippocampal volume from controls, as well as from each other, with the mild AD cases showing the greatest atrophy. These results suggest that degeneration of the EC and hippocampal formation occurs before the onset of overt dementia. In fact, follow-up clinical evaluations available on 23 of 28 nondemented patients indicated that 12 of 23 had converted to AD. Converters could be best differentiated from nonconverters on the basis of entorhinal volume.
