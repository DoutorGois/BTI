In an attempt to discover the changes of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain of diabetic state, we investigated the level of SOD in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ-diabetic rats) using enzyme activity assay, Northern blotting analysis of mRNA levels and Western blotting of enzyme amount. Five discrete brain regions, cerebrocortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, the remaining non-cortex cerebrum (NCC area) and cerebellum, were examined in STZ-diabetic rats to compare with age-matched normal rats. Higher levels of Mn-SOD including the activity, mRNA expression and immunoblot of enzyme were found in all areas of the brain from STZ-diabetic rats as compared with that in Wistar rats. Except in the cerebellum, similar changes of Cu,Zn-SOD were found in the brain of STZ-diabetic rats. These results indicate an increase of SOD both gene expression and activity in the brain of STZ-diabetic rats. This alteration of SOD may be one of the important factors for the vulnerability of the brain to oxygen free radicals or may be related to the pathophysiology of diabetes.
