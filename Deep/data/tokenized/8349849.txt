Insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF I and IGF II) and insulin itself, which are structurally related polypeptides, play an important role in regulating brain growth and development as well as in the maintenance of its normal functions during adulthood. In order to provide a substrate for the better understanding of the roles of these growth factors, we have investigated the anatomical distribution as well as the variation in the density of [125I]IGF I, [125I]IGF II, and [125I]insulin receptor binding sites in developing and adult rat brain by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. The distributional profile of [125I]IGF I, [125I]IGF II, and [125I]insulin receptor binding sites showed a widespread but selective regional localization throughout the brain at all stages of development. The neuroanatomic regions which exhibited relatively high density of binding sites with each of these radioligands include the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, choroid plexus, and cerebellum. However, in any given region, receptor binding sites for IGF I, IGF II, or insulin are concentrated in anatomically distinct areas. In the cerebellum, for example, [125I]IGF II receptor binding sites are concentrated in the granular cell layer, [125I]insulin binding sites are localized primarily in the molecular layer, whereas [125I]IGF I receptor binding sites are noted in relatively high amounts in granular as well as molecular cell layers. The apparent density of sites recognized by each radioligand also undergoes remarkable variation in most brain nuclei, being relatively high either during late embryonic (i.e., IGF I and IGF II) or early postnatal (i.e., insulin) stages and then declining gradually to adult levels around the third week of postnatal development. These results, taken together, suggest that each receptor-ligand system is regulated differently during development and thus may have different roles in the process of cellular growth, differentiation, and maintenance of the nervous system. Furthermore, the localization of [125I]IGF I, [125I]IGF II, and [125I]insulin receptor binding sites over a wide variety of physiologically distinct brain regions suggests possible involvement of these growth factors in a variety of functions associated with specific neuronal pathways.
