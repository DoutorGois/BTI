(1) The effects of isoflurane and halothane (at nominal concentrations of 4%) were studied on a high conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channel using inside-out patches from cultured rat hippocampal neurons. (2) With physiological-like concentrations of K+ across patches (140 mM internal and 5 mM external), unitary activity from a 4 pA channel (conductance near 100 pS) was evident in excised patches. (3) Isoflurane or halothane had no effects on unitary properties of K (Ca) including channel amplitudes and open and closed times. The channel open probability was also unchanged in the presence of the volatile agent. The results suggest that macroscopic high conductance K (Ca) currents in hippocampal neurons would be relatively insensitive to high concentrations of inhalational anaesthetics.
