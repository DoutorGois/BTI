Light optic and electron microscopic techniques were used to examine the brain of rats with visible neurological status recovered at day 4 following a 10-minute systemic circulatory arrest caused by compression of a vascular fascicle. Compensatory and recovering processes were shown to be the major processes in the brain at this time of a postresuscitative period. The highest magnitude of these processes was observed in the frontal and occipital cortex, the lowest was found in the hippocampal section CA3-5. Slight destructive changes in the cells were identified only at the ultrastructural level. The findings may aid to find measures that stimulate reparative processes in the central nervous system after a history of hypoxia.
