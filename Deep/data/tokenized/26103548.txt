Blood vessels (BVs) not only serve as conduits for oxygen and nutrients but may also fulfill perfusion-independent functions. A growing body of data suggests that blood vessels are an integral component of stem cell niches, including stem cell niches in the adult brain. This review summarizes in vivo studies supporting the contention that blood vessels may indeed control function of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) residing in the two major neurogenic niches of the adult brain, namely the sub-ventricular zone and the hippocampus. The review discusses different modes of BV-NSC communication and possible mechanisms by which BV may modulate NSC behavior and responses to external stimuli.
