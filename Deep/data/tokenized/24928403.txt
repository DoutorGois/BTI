Stansin 6 a tetrasaccharide resin glycoside isolated from the root of Ipomoea stans was evaluated as anticonvulsant and neuroprotective in kainic acid-induced seizures of rats. Intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid (10 mg/kg) induced typical behavioral seizures such as wet dog shakes and limbic seizures, and histopathological changes in the hippocampus (degeneration and loss of pyramidal cells in CA1 to CA4 areas). Stansin 6 (10-80 mg/kg) had no effect on the behavior of rats and did not induce hippocampal damage. Pretreatment with stansin 6 inhibited convulsions in rats from kainic acid-induced seizures, reduced the degeneration pattern in the CA3 region, decreased astrocytic reactivity, and reduced the expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha induced by kainic acid. These results suggest that stansin 6 possesses neuroprotective and anticonvulsant activities.
