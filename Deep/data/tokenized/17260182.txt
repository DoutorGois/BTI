Rabies is diagnosed by FAT in the impression smears of brain tissues. In this study, an attempt was made to diagnose rabies using in situ polymerase chain reaction (ISPCR). A digoxigenin-labelled double-stranded probe specific for a portion of the 'N' gene of rabies virus was used. Positive signals were identified as blue dots in the intraneuronal and neuropil areas.
