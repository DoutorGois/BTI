Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with alpha synuclein pathology and slowly progressive dementia. Progenitor abnormalities have previously been reported in the subventricular zone (SVZ) adjacent to the lateral ventricle. To evaluate changes in neural stem cells and progenitors in the hippocampal neurogenic niche, immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the neural stem cell markers Musashi 1, nestin, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), doublecortin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were examined in age-matched control and DLB groups. Staining was quantified in the hippocampal SVZ, subgranular layer (SGL) and ependymal cell layer (EPL). There was a significant loss in DLB of Musashi 1 (P < 0.01) in all areas, an increase in PCNA in hippocampal SVZ (P = 0.01) and SGL (P = 0.05), and an increase in doublecortin in the hippocampal SVZ (P = 0.04) and EPL (P = 0.02). This is the first report of the changes in neurogenic markers in the hippocampal SVZ and EPL in DLB and may offer the potential for understanding disease pathology and in the devising of treatment.
