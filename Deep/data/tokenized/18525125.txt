MicroRNAs have essential functional roles in brain development and neuronal specification but their roles in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unknown. Using a sensitive qRT-PCR platform we identified regional and stage-specific deregulation of miRNA expression in AD patient brains. We used experimental validation in addition to literature to reveal how the deregulated brain microRNAs are biomarkers for known and novel pathways in AD pathogenesis related to amyloid processing, neurogenesis, insulin resistance, and innate immunity. We additionally recovered miRNAs from cerebrospinal fluid and discovered AD-specific miRNA changes consistent with their role as potential biomarkers of disease.
