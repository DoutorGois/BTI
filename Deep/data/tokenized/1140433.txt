In chronic experiments on dogs polarization of some cerebral structures could exert an inhibiting, stimulating, or merely a modulating effect on the initial level of involuntary motor activity by changing the trace processes underlying formation of hyperkineses. The simultaneous polarization of the caudate nucleus and motor cortex with DC of 0.5-6.0 mcA was found to reduce or even abolish the involuntary motor reactions, the degree of the effectiveness depending on the degree of their stability.
