G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades may be key substrates for the antidepressant effects of chronic electroconvulsive seizures (ECS). To better understand changes in these signaling pathways, alterations in levels of mRNA's encoding regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) protein subtypes-2, -4, -7, -8 and -10 were evaluated in rat brain using northern blotting and in situ hybridization. In prefrontal cortex, RGS2 mRNA levels were increased several-fold 2 h following an acute ECS. Increases in RGS8 mRNA were of lesser magnitude (30%), and no changes were evident for the other RGS subtypes. At 24 h following a chronic ECS regimen, RGS4, -7, and -10 mRNA levels were reduced by 20-30%; only RGS10 was significantly reduced 24 h after acute ECS. Levels of RGS2 mRNA were unchanged 24 h following either acute or chronic ECS. In hippocampus, RGS2 mRNA levels were markedly increased 2 h following acute ECS. More modest increases were seen for RGS4 mRNA expression, whereas levels of the other RGS subtypes were unaltered. At 24 h following chronic ECS, RGS7, -8 and -10 mRNA levels were decreased in the granule cell layer, and RGS7 and -8 mRNA levels were decreased in the pyramidal cell layers. Only RGS8 and -10 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in hippocampus 24 h following an acute ECS. Paralleling neocortex, RGS2 mRNA content was unchanged in hippocampus 24 h following either acute or chronic ECS. In ventromedial hypothalamus, RGS4 mRNA content was increased 24 h following chronic ECS, whereas RGS7 mRNA levels were only increased 24 h following an acute ECS. The increased RGS4 mRNA levels in hypothalamus were significant by 2 h following an acute ECS. These studies demonstrate subtype-, time-, and region-specific regulation of RGS proteins by ECS, adaptations that may contribute to the antidepressant effects of this treatment.
