MRI-based linear measurements of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus complex (HPC) discriminated 39 subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease, from 15 patients with other dementias and 33 miscellaneous controls without evidence of dementia. The best discriminating parameter was the left height of the HPC at the level of the mammillary bodies, with a sensitivity of 79.49% and a specificity of 68.75%. The diagnostic value of these results is discussed considering the volumetric data found in the current literature.
