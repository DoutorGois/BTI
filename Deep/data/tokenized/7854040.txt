Expression of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) mRNA in the rat brain after transient forebrain ischemia was investigated by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Thirty min after the start of recirculation, IL-1 beta mRNA was induced in the several brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus where neuronal degeneration was reported to be observed after transient forebrain ischemia. The hybridization signals were observed both on the glial cells and around the vascular walls.
