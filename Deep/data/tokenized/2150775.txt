Acute ethanol ingestion impairs memory in humans at concentrations associated with mild intoxication. A possible neurophysiological correlate of this effect is the suppression by ethanol of long-tem potentiation (LTP), a persistent increase in synaptic efficiency which has been proposed as a substrate for memory. However, in previous studies ethanol has been shown to impair LTP only at very high concentrations, near the lethal level in humans. We now report that ethanol can significantly reduce LTP in rat hippocampus at concentrations as low as 5 mM, a level attainable following ingestion of a single alcoholic drink. We also demonstrate that the potency of ethanol in depressing LTP correlates well with its potency in inhibiting the response to N-methyl-D-aspartate, an agonist at the glutamate receptors implicated in LTP induction. The influence of low ethanol concentrations on LTP may contribute to the memory impairment associated with its use in humans.
