Bilateral partial damage to the hippocampal perforant paths in rats produced impaired two-way active avoidance performance, while the behavior in open field, passive and one-way active avoidance remained unchanged. Total disruption of the perforant path projection resulted in increased open field activity and impaired one-way active avoidance, but normal passive avoidance behavior. The results are discussed in terms of reduced sensory information to the hippocampal formation.
