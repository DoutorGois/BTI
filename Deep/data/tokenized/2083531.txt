Whether endogenous opioid peptides were involved in the inhibitory action of the hippocampus (HPC) on luteinizing hormone (LH) release was studied examining the effect of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, on the inhibitory action of electrical stimulation of the HPC and also by examining the effect of metenkephalin administration in the HPC, on preovulatory release of LH in proestrous rats. In rats treated with saline at 13:00 h, either sham stimulation or electrical stimulation of the dorsal HPC, which was performed acutely under ether anesthesia, significantly inhibited the afternoon rise in serum LH. In animals treated with naloxone at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg body weight, the afternoon rise in LH appeared smaller than that in the control group. However, statistical analysis showed no significant difference in LH values compared to the control group. Direct administration of met-enkephalin at a dose of 10 micrograms at 13:00 h through a chronically implanted cannula in the HPC did not induce any significant change in the afternoon rise in LH, regardless of whether it induced behavioral seizures or not. The results suggest that opioid peptides in the HPC do not play a significant role in the inhibitory action of HPC on LH release. Opioids existing in areas other than the HPC may play a certain, but small role.
