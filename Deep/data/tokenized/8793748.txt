1. The role of voltage-gated calcium channels in the generation of activity-induced alkaline shifts in extracellular pH (pHo) was studied in rat hippocampal slices (area CAI) by means of Ca(2+)-and H(+)-selective microlectrodes inserted into the stratum pyramidale and/or stratum radiatum. 2. After complete pharmacological blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors and gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, trains (5-10 Hz, 5-10s) of antidromic spikes in pyramidal neurons were associated with a fast alkaline transient of up to 0.17 pH units and a fall in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]o). The alkaline shift was strongly enhanced upon inhibition of extracellular carbonic anhydrase. 3. Application of 100 microM Ni2+ plus 100 microM Cd2+ inhibited both the fall in [Ca2+]o and the alkaline transient triggered by antidromic spikes. The alkaline shift was abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. 4. In the absence of postsynaptic receptor antagonists, alkaline transients linked to a given level of synaptic excitation in s. radiatum were strongly suppressed after blockade of somatic (and, consequently, of dendritic "backpropagating") spikes by microdrop application of tetrodotoxin to the cell-body layer. 5. We have previously shown that activity-induced alkaline transients in the CAI region are due to an influx of Ca2+ into neurons, which triggers an influx of H+ ions probably caused by activation of a plasmalemmal Ca2+/H+ ATPase. The present results indicate that much (in s. pyramidale perhaps all) of the pH-changing influx of Ca2+ is mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.
