Accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) and cholinergic degeneration are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD), soluble Abeta42 levels were detected in the septum by 2 months of age, reaching their highest levels at 3-6 months and decreasing at 12 months. Deficits in the number of septal cholinergic neurons and the length of hippocampal cholinergic axons were observed starting at 4 months in 3xTg-AD mice. Our results show that septal Abeta and septohippocampal cholinergic pathology in 3xTg-AD mice occur at an early stage of disease.
