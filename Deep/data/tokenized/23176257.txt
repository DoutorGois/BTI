BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: KCNQ2-5 channels are voltage-gated potassium channels that regulate neuronal excitability and represent suitable targets for the treatment of hyperexcitability disorders. The effect of Chlor-N-(6-chlor-pyridin-3-yl)-benzamid was tested on KCNQ subtypes for its ability to alter neuronal excitability and for its anticonvulsant potential. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effect of 4-Chlor-N-(6-chlor-pyridin-3-yl)-benzamid was evaluated using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from CHO cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing different types of KCNQ channels. Epileptiform afterdischarges were recorded in fully amygdala-kindled rats in vivo. Neuronal excitability was assessed using field potential and whole cell recording in rat hippocampus in vitro. KEY RESULTS: 4-Chlor-N-(6-chlor-pyridin-3-yl)-benzamid caused a hyperpolarizing shift of the activation curve and a pronounced slowing of deactivation in KCNQ2-mediated currents, whereas KCNQ3/5 heteromers remained unaffected. The effect was also apparent in the Retigabine-insensitive mutant KCNQ2-W236L. In fully amygdala-kindled rats, it elevated the threshold for induction of afterdischarges and reduced seizure severity and duration. In hippocampal CA1 cells, 4-Chlor-N-(6-chlor-pyridin-3-yl)-benzamid strongly damped neuronal excitability caused by a membrane hyperpolarization and a decrease in membrane resistance and induced an increase of the somatic resonance frequency on the single cell level, whereas synaptic transmission was unaffected. On the network level, 4-Chlor-N-(6-chlor-pyridin-3-yl)-benzamid caused a significant reduction of gamma and theta oscillation peak power, with no significant change in oscillation frequency. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data indicate that 4-Chlor-N-(6-chlor-pyridin-3-yl)-benzamid is a potent KCNQ activator with a selectivity for KCNQ2 containing channels. It strongly reduces neuronal excitability and displays anticonvulsant activity in vivo.
