Opiates and endogenous opioid peptides play an important role in reward-mediated behaviors, including self-stimulation. Two strains of rats, LC2-Hi and LC2-Lo, selectively bred for high vs. low rate of lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation, were employed in the present study. Quantitative autoradiography was performed on brains of adult male rats of each strain, using the mu opioid receptor agonist 3H-DAGO. Strain differences in receptor density were observed in the nucleus accumbens and in ventral areas of the hippocampus.
