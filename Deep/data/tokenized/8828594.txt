Systemic injection of kainic acid produces a characteristic regional and cellular pattern of neuronal loss in the central nervous system by mechanisms which may be relevant to an understanding of neurodegenerative disorders. It has previously been found, by measuring the binding of a glial marker ligand, that analogues of adenosine, such as R-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA), can prevent kainate-induced damage of the hippocampus at doses as low as 10 micrograms/kg, i.p. The use of gliotic markers, however, is open to misinterpretation, and the present work was designed to re-examine purine protection against kainate using histological methods. The results show that R-PIA, at a dose of 25 micrograms/kg i.p. in rats, can protect against the neuronal damage caused by kainate and that this protection could be completely prevented by the simultaneous administration of 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine, indicating the involvement of adenosine A1 receptors in the protection.
