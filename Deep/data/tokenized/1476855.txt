The activities of the enantiomers of BM-5 were examined to measure muscarinic cholinergic selectivity in the central nervous system. Autoradiographic studies assessed the ability of each enantiomer to inhibit the binding of [3H]-(R)-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-(R)-QNB) to muscarinic receptors in the rat brain. (+)-(R)-BM-5 inhibited [3H]-(R)-QNB binding to rat brain sections at concentrations below 1.0 microM, while 100-fold higher concentrations of (-)-(S)-BM-5 were required for comparable levels of inhibition. Analysis of the autoradiograms indicated that both stereoisomers had a similar distribution of high affinity binding sites. Each enantiomer displayed higher affinity for muscarinic receptors in the superior colliculi and lower affinity for receptors in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. (+)-(R)-BM-5 and oxotremorine inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity in the cerebral cortex with efficacies comparable to that for acetylcholine. (+)-(R)-BM-5 was 26-fold more potent than (-)-(S)-BM-5 in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. Oxotremorine-M and carbamylcholine stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in the cerebral cortex. Oxotremorine had lower activity and (+)-(R)-BM-5 was essentially inactive at comparable concentrations. The difference in activity of the two enantiomers indicates a remarkable stereochemical selectivity for muscarinic receptors. The stereoselectivity index is comparable for both the autoradiographic assays (48) and measures of adenylyl cyclase activity (26) in the cerebral cortex.
