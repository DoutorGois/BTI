We propose a general computer model of a synapse, which incorporates mechanisms responsible for the realization of both short- and long-term synaptic plasticity-the two forms of experimentally observed plasticity that seem to be very significant for the performance of neuronal networks. The model consists of a presynaptic part based on the earlier 'double barrier synapse' model, and a postsynaptic compartment which is connected to the presynaptic terminal via a feedback, the sign and magnitude of which depend on postsynaptic Ca(2+) concentration. The feedback increases or decreases the amount of neurotransmitter which is in a ready for release state. The model adequately reproduced the phenomena of short- and long-term plasticity observed experimentally in hippocampal slices for CA3-CA1 synapses. The proposed model may be used in the investigation of certain real synapses to estimate their physiological parameters, and in the construction of realistic neuronal networks.
