Carbachol-induced hippocampal EEG theta-rhythms were recorded simultaneously from the CA1 and dentate areas in rat hippocampal brain slices. Phase shifts ranging from 0 to 180 degrees between the CA1 and dentate theta generators were observed. The differences in slow wave theta phase relations between in vitro and in vivo preparations were interpreted as resulting from deafferentation of the hippocampal slices.
