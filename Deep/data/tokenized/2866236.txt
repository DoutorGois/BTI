Ibotenate, a rigid structural analogue of glutamate, markedly enhances the hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids, as reflected by the stimulation of [3H]inositol monophosphate formation in rat hippocampal slices prelabeled with [3H]inositol and treated with Li+. Quisqualate, homocysteate, L-glutamate, and L-aspartate also induce a significant (albeit weaker) increase in [3H]inositol monophosphate formation, whereas N-methyl-D-aspartate, kainate, quinolinate, and N-acetylaspartylglutamate are inactive. The increase in [3H]inositol monophosphate formation elicited by the above-mentioned excitatory amino acids is potently and selectively antagonized by DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, a dicarboxylic amino acid receptor antagonist. These results suggest that, in the hippocampus, a class of dicarboxylic amino acid recognition sites is coupled with phospholipase C, the enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane inositol phospholipids.
