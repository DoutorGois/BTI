Although a wide variety of drugs are available for treatment of epilepsy, many patients with epilepsy still experience uncontrolled seizures. In addition, there is a need for new drugs that can halt epileptogenesis after brain injury. Mechanisms that underlie seizure processes constitute potential target areas for the development of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). An understanding of the underlying mechanisms of interictal spike discharge and seizure spread is critical for the development of AEDs for treatment of partial seizures. Suppression of specific forms of voltage-dependent calcium currents and inhibition of GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition are two key target areas for new AEDs to treat primary generalized seizures. As researchers gain more understanding of the cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation, we should be better able to develop therapeutic agents designed to suppress seizure-provoking mechanisms and to enhance the brain's natural protective mechanisms.
