Primary tissue culture methods have been applied to various areas of the central nervous system, including cerebral cortex, spinal cord, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, mesencephalon, lower brain stem and retina. Experimental studies in vitro involving central neurotransmission are discussed here. Information gleaned from such studies impacts on neurotransmitter identification, neuronal development, patterns of receptor distribution, peptidergic transmission, transmitter metabolism, synaptogenesis and the regulation of synaptic development.
