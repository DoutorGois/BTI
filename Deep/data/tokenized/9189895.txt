IN order to study possible time-dependent changes in serotonin metabolism in rat brain, male Wistar rats were subjected to 3, 6 or 12 h total sleep deprivation (SD) by gentle handling. In addition two groups of rats subjected first to 6 h SD were allowed 2 or 4 h rebound sleep. Tissue concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured from several brain areas using HPLC/ECD. SD significantly increased the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and brain stem, indicating increased 5-HT turnover in those areas. After 2 and 4 h rebound sleep, the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was similar to that in controls. We conclude that a short SD increases 5-HT turnover in the rat brain for the duration of SD only.
