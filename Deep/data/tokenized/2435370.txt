The action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the supraoptic nucleus was investigated using guinea pig brain slices. GABA produced a membrane depolarization accompanied by a decrease in the input resistance. The action of GABA was concentration-dependent throughout a wide range of concentrations (10(-7)-10(-3) M). In none of the cells examined, a membrane hyperpolarization was observed. The reversal potential for the depolarization induced by GABA was about 25 mV positive to the resting membrane potential. The amplitude of the GABA-induced depolarization was increased to 1.5 X the control by reducing the external Cl- from 134.2 mM to 10.2 mM. The action of GABA was readily antagonized by relatively low concentrations of bicuculline (10(-5) M). The action of GABA in the hippocampus or in the anterior hypothalamus was markedly different from that in the supraoptic nucleus, i.e. GABA produced both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing responses in the hippocampus and consistently a hyperpolarization in the anterior hypothalamus. The depolarizing but not the hyperpolarizing response in the hippocampus was selectively blocked by picrotoxin (2 X 10(-5) M) or by bicuculline (10(-5) M). The depolarizing component was dependent on the external Cl- concentration and had a reversal potential similar to that of the depolarization induced by GABA in the supraoptic nucleus. The hyperpolarizing component was resistant to bicuculline and had a reversal potential about 30 mV negative to the resting membrane potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
