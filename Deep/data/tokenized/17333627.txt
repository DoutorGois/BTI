The effect of age on signaling lipids contents in rat liver and different brain regions (hippocampus, neocortex) were studied. The contents of free fatty acids in the brain, diacylglycerol in liver and ceramide in all tissues studied have been found to increase with age. Age-dependent accumulation of neutral and sphingolipids evokes the violation of cell sensitivity to extracellular signals.
