Effects of ischemia on the content of a ulinastatin (UT)-like substance in the murine cerebral cortex and hippocampus were studied. At 24 h post-ischemia, a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in the content of UT-like substance in the hippocampus but not the cerebral cortex and a concurrent increase in the activity of micro-calpain were observed. In in vitro experiments, a decrease was registered in the content of UT-like substance in the hippocampus in the presence of calcium. This decrease was inhibited by both EDTA and calpastatin treatments. These results implicate the destruction of UT-like substance by micro-calpain in the ischemic hippocampus.
