We investigated the time course of both MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) levels and its phosphorylation degree in the rat hippocampus during the first 90 min following the onset of soman-induced seizures. The quantitative immunoblot analysis of hippocampal extracts revealed that MAP2 increased significantly in response to a sustained epileptic activity (from 60 min of seizure duration). In addition, intense MAP2 dephosphorylation was also observed 60 to 90 min after the onset of seizures. The possible neuropathological consequences of these two early MAP2 changes are discussed in relation to the both excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors and subsequent dendritic spine alterations occurring in hippocampal neurons soon after soman intoxication.
