The effects of dithiothreitol (DTT) and, reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG), glutathione on the release of [3H]GABA evoked by glutamate and its agonists were studied in rat hippocampal slices. DTT had no effect on the basal release of [3H]GABA but it enhanced and prolonged the glutamate agonist-evoked release. This effect was abolished by (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohept-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801), a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, and blocked by Mg2+ ions. It was only slightly attenuated by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, and not affected by L-(+)-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (L-AP3), a selective antagonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptor. The effect of DTT on the NMDA-evoked release of GABA was only slightly affected by extracellular Ca2+ but completely blocked by verapamil even in the absence of Ca2+. GSH and GSSG attenuated or abolished the effects of DTT on the agonist-induced release of [3H]GABA. The results imply that the enhanced and prolonged release of GABA evoked by the coexistence of DTT and excitatory amino acids and attenuated by endogenous GSH and GSSG is a consequence of sustained activation of the NMDA receptor-governed ionophores, which contain functional thiol groups. DTT, GSH and GSSG may regulate the redox state and accessibility of these groups. In addition to the influx of extracellular Ca2+, DTT mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular pools distinct from those regulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors.
