The function of hippocampal theta oscillations has been subjected to constant speculation. Dynamic coupling of theta field potentials and spiking activity between the hippocampus and extra-hippocampal structures emphasizes the importance of theta-frequency oscillations in global spike-timing precision in the brain. Recent advances in understanding theta coupling between distant brain structures are discussed and explored in this article.
