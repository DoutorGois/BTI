Primary cilia extend from the surface of most vertebrate cells and display several signaling molecules, including the somatostatin receptor 3 (SSTR3), enabling cilia to play essential roles as chemical, osmotic and mechanical sensors. The SSTR3 is widely distributed in the adult rat brain, and also influences cell proliferation and apoptosis. To establish whether the SSTR3 is positioned to influence these developmental processes, we examined, using immunohistochemistry, the embryonic and postnatal development of SSTR3 expression in the rat hippocampal formation, and its association with newly born and mature neurons in adult rats. Elongated SSTR3-immunoreactive (-ir) cilia first appeared in the hippocampal formation CA3 region of postnatal day (P) 0 animals, and their density increased to high levels by P2, remained at high levels through to P30, but were at low levels in 5-month old rats. A similar developmental pattern was observed in the CA1 region, where SSTR3-ir ciliated structures were first detected on P2. In contrast, density levels in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus were very high by P30, and remained elevated in adult rats. SSTR3-ir cilia did not colocalize with neuroblasts in the hippocampal formation or olfactory bulb, but appeared to be localized to more mature cells in these regions. A few SSTR3-ir neurons were also observed in the hippocampal formation. These findings support the hypothesis that the ciliary SSTR3 is well positioned to influence the cell cycle and apoptotic processes during postnatal development, and in neurogenic regions of the adult rat brain.
