This study compares the effects of acute alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) administration in the hippocampus in adult (3 months) and middle-aged (15 months) rats at 15 days postinjection. Injection of 1 and 2.7 mM AMPA produced dose-dependent neurodegeneration, assessed by Nissl staining; a glial reaction shown by glial fibrillary acidic protein immunocytochemistry; and calcification, revealed by alizarin red staining. Furthermore, at both doses, these alterations were significantly greater in 3-month-old rats. Finally, at AMPA 2.7 mM, no significant changes in the density of hippocampal parvalbumin- or calbindin-immunoreactive neurons or in choline acetyltransferase, glutamate uptake, or GABA uptake activities were found in 15-month-old animals, whereas significant reductions in parvalbumin (-76%) and calbindin (-32%) immunostaining and in GABA uptake (-27%) were observed in 3-month-old animals compared to the respective sham-operated or control animals. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that in rats the vulnerability of hippocampal neurons and the glial and calcification reactions to AMPA-induced injury decreased with age between 3 and 15 months. Our results also indicate that hippocampal cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic systems show an adaptive response to excitotoxic damage in both adult and middle-aged animals.
