BACKGROUND: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is rarely considered as a diagnosis in children younger than 2 years. OBJECTIVE: To describe imaging features in conjunction with clinical information in patients with hippocampal sclerosis who are younger than 2 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR brain imaging and clinical information in five children in whom the diagnosis of HS was made both clinically and by MRI prior to 2 years of age. RESULTS: Imaging features establishing the diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis were bright T2 signal and volume loss, while the internal architecture of the hippocampal formation was preserved in almost all children. Clinically, all children had an infectious trigger. CONCLUSION: It is necessary for radiologists to consider HS in children with certain clinical features to plan an MRI protocol that is appropriate for detection of hippocampal pathology.
