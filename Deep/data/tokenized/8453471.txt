Embryonic neural tissue was transplanted into previously kindled rats. A thirteen- to fourteen-day embryonic hippocampal cell suspension was grafted in the stratum oriens near the CA2 area of the hippocampus. Almost 80% of the animals had a good recovery and became seizure-free. Injection of neocortical cells or saline did not show any positive effect on the kindling susceptibility. Although 20 day embryonic cell transplantation was also effective, the effect did not last as long as the 13- to 14-day embryonic transplantation. These observations open the possibility that the neural grafts may be used for therapy of medically intractable epilepsies.
