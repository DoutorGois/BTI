The activities of monoamine oxidases A and B towards 5-hydroxytryptamine and beta-phenethylamine, respectively, were compared in the left and right caudatus, hippocampus, parietal cortex, cerebellum and frontal cortex 6 months after gamma-irradiation (single dose of 23 Gy) of either the right hemisphere or of the whole rabbit brain (in which case, a dose of l6 Gy). No difference in monoamine oxidase A or B activities were found in any of the brain regions.
