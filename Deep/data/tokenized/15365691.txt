The effect of ethanol (EtOH) and acetaldehyde (AcH) on norepinephrine (NE) release was examined in the striatum and hippocampus of freely moving rats by means of in vivo microdialysis coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography and an electrochemical detector. Rats were treated intraperitoneally with EtOH (1 g/kg) or cyanamide (CY, 50 mg/kg, a potent aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor) plus EtOH (1 g/kg). No significant difference in NE levels in the dialysates was observed in the striatum and hippocampus in either the EtOH or CY+EtOH groups. NE levels in the hippocampal dialysates were about fivefolds higher than those in the striatum. The concentration of EtOH and AcH in the striatal dialysate reached a peak at 30 min after EtOH dosing and then gradually decreased in the CY+EtOH group. In the EtOH group the striatal concentration of EtOH also reached a peak at 30 min after EtOH dosing, and then gradually decreased while AcH was not detected. The present study suggests that there is no in vivo effect of brain EtOH or AcH on NE release in the striatum and hippocampus of awake rats.
