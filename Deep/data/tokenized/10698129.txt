The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible effect of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) on learning and memory by using the one-trial step-down inhibitory avoidance test in rats. The peptide was infused into hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex. MCH caused retrograde facilitation when given at 0 or 4 h post-training into hippocampus, but only at 0 h into amygdala. From these results, it seems that MCH modulates memory early after training by acting on both the amygdala and hippocampus and, 4 h after training, on the hippocampus.
