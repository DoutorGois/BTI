The damage of dorsal hippocampus in mice F1 from DBA/2J and C57BL/6J on the learning in conditions of free choice in a complex multialternative maze was studied. It was revealed that the HPC-mice were able to form a 4-links food-getting habit in the cyclic form. The main differences affected the conjugation of the investigate activity, behavioral efficiency and inhibition of mistakes. While these processes developed by the same exponential types in control, this conjugation were absent in HPC-mice. The main defects were found in stage of habit stabilization: motivational state stability reduced sharply and duration of transition from disorganization to organizing behavior increased. It is supposed that the hippocampus involved in learning and memory indirectly because its main role is organization of the dominant state providing the stability of attention for habit realization.
