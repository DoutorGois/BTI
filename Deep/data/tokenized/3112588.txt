The effects of zopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine compound that interacts with benzodiazepine receptors, on GABA turnover rate and GABA content in the rat striatum and hippocampus have been studied. Intraperitoneal administration of zopiclone reduced the GABA turnover rates in both the striatum and hippocampus, as estimated from the rate of GABA accumulation after inhibition of GABA transaminase by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). The effect of zopiclone on AOAA-induced accumulation of GABA in the hippocampus and striatum was blocked by the intraperitoneal injection of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-3505. Furthermore, zopiclone slightly but significantly decreased GABA content in the hippocampus, the decrease being blocked by coadministration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. Our results confirm that the GABAergic system plays a role in the mechanism of action of zopiclone.
