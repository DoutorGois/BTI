To determine the influence of intrinsic neurons of the dorsal hippocampus on dopamine (DA) turnover in other limbic areas, DA and its metabolites were assayed in several brain areas 14 and 28 days after bilateral ibotenic acid (IA) lesions of the dorsal hippocampus in the rat. The locomotor response to d-amphetamine was also assessed. Spontaneous locomotion was increased 14 but not 28 days postoperatively. There was no change in d-amphetamine-induced locomotion at any time. Presynaptic indices of DA turnover in the medial prefrontal cortex, anteromedial striatum and nucleus accumbens were not affected by the lesion. Unlike lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex, deefferentation of the dorsal hippocampus does not increase DA turnover in the basal ganglia.
