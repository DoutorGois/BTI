Nerve growth factor (beta-NGF) is known to have beneficial effects on cholinergic cell survival and to function both in vivo and in vitro. It has been speculated that this protein, or the lack of it, may be involved in the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We describe the measurement of beta-NGF content in 4 regions of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in AD brain compared with brain tissue from age-matched normal subjects using a sensitive sandwich immunoassay (ELISA). There was no difference in beta-NGF content in any region examined in AD compared with normal values despite the marked loss of cortical cholinergic function.
