The EEG responses to intraventricular administration of quinolinic acid (1.5 and 10 mg), pentylenetetrazole (500 micrograms) and kynurenine (200 and 400 micrograms) were studied. Quinolinic acid was found to produce the convulsive discharges in the EEG 30-60 sec after administration. Similar results were obtained following administration of pentylenetetrazole, the first EEG disturbances being recorded in both cases in the leads from the caudate nucleus and hippocampus. Kynurenine administered intraventricularly failed to change the initial EEG in rats. The possible triggering role of the caudate nucleus in the mechanism of quinolinic acid-induced convulsions is suggested.
