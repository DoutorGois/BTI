This study was to investigate the effects of ascorbic acid on the hippocampus of suckling rats in the presence of lead (Pb)-induced oxidative stress. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats received treatment with drinking water, divided into three groups, as follows: (1) distilled water; (2) 0.2% Pb; (3) 0.2% Pb+ascorbic acid (100mg/kg/day). Rat pups were euthanized at the age of 21days and their brain tissue was examined using light microscopy. Protein levels of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn SOD), and catalase (CAT) in the hippocampus were determined by Western blotting. We found a significant decrease in levels of Cu/Zn SOD and Mn SOD among Pb-exposed pups. Ascorbic acid supplementation appeared to negate the decrease in protein levels for Cu/Zn SOD and Mn SOD. In the case of CAT, there was no effect from Pb administration alone and Pb plus ascorbic acid appeared to increase the levels. In histopathology, ascorbic acid decreased the number of damaged cells in cornu ammonis areas CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) in hippocampus. Our results showed that administration of ascorbic acid during pregnancy and lactation could ameliorate some of the oxidative damage induced by Pb exposure in the developing rat hippocampus.
