The study of Golgi-impregnated lizard brains has revealed a scarce but heterogeneous neuronal population in the outer plexiform layer of the medial cortex. Some of the neuronal types detected here resemble the neurons of the dentate molecular layer of the mammalian hippocampus. According to their morphology, five intrinsic neuronal types have been clearly identified: short axon aspinous bipolar neuron (type 1, or sarmentous neuron), short axon aspinous juxtasomatic neuron (type 2, or coral neuron), short axon sparsely spinous multipolar neuron (type 3, or stellate neuron), short axon sparsely spinous juxtasomatic multipolar neuron (type 4, or deep stellate neuron), and sparsely spinous juxtasomatic horizontal neuron (type 5, or couchant neuron). Most neuronal types were identified as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and parvalbumin immunoreactive, and are thus probably involved in medial cortex inhibition. Moreover, a small fraction of them displayed beta-endorphin immunoreactivity. The distribution of these neuronal types is not uniform in the laminae of the outer plexiform layer. Type 1 (sarmentous) and type 3 (stellate) neurons overlap the axonal field projection coming from the dorsal cortex and the thalamus, whereas types 4 (deep stellate) and 5 (couchant) neurons overlap ipsi- and contralateral dorsomedial projection fields as well as raphe serotoninergic and opioid immunoreactive axonal plexi. Thus, these neuronal types may be involved in the control of specific inputs to the medial cortex by presumably feed-forward inhibition; nevertheless, feed-back inhibition may also occur regarding type 4 (deep stellate) neurons that extend deep dendrites to the zinc-rich bouton field.
