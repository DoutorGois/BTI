After unilateral dorsal hippocampectomy the binding of [3H]corticosterone to cytosol receptors in contralateral hippocampus was measured. For estimation of binding capacity the adrenals were removed bilaterally 24 h prior to sacrifice. The apparent maximal binding capacity (Bmax) for corticosterone in the contralateral hippocampus lobe was increased by 74 and 41%, respectively, 10 and 20 days after surgery. The data reveal a novel aspect of steroid receptor capacity control. It is suggested that compensation of altered amounts of receptor sites is an intrinsic property of the hippocampal corticosterone receptor system.
