Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA), anti-parvalbumin antiserum and an affinity-purified anti-mu opioid receptor antibody were used to triple-label neurons in the postnatal rat subiculum. VVA labeled a subset of mu opioid receptor-positive neurons that were also immunoreactive for parvalbumin. The morphology of the triple-labeled neurons was heterogeneous, and included multipolar, ovoid and pyramidal-shaped neurons. Neurons single-labeled for the mu opioid receptor, VVA or parvalbumin were also morphologically heterogeneous. The postnatal development of mu opioid receptor immunoreactivity (IR), parvalbumin-IR and VVA binding was investigated using triple-labeling immunocytochemistry. Mu opioid receptor-IR appeared first and was present at postnatal day 1 (P1). Parvalbumin-IR was first observed in somata at P10, followed by proximal and distal dendrites at P15 and P20 respectively. Faint VVA labeling was seen first at P10 and surrounded a limited number of neurons. The intensity of labeling and the number of neurons labeled with VVA increased between P10 and P20; however, both measures remained below adult levels at P20. This study further illustrates the neurochemical heterogeneity of interneurons in the hippocampal formation and shows the developmentally early appearance of mu opioid receptor-IR compared to the late appearance of VVA binding and parvalbumin-IR.
