Comparison of the time course of the content of brain-specific and brain-nonspecific proteins in five different structures of the central nervous system immediately and one or seven days after the conditioned reflex development has shown that functions of these proteins seem to be different. They are triggered at different stages of the conditioned reflex development irrespective of the fact that both proteins are likely to be implicated in the processes of information consolidation and storage.
