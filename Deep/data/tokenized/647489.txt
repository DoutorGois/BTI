A single intraperitoneal injection of 3-acetyl pyridine produces, within 24 hours of administration, signs of cerebellar ataxia and damage to the medulla oblongata and to the climbing fibers of the cerebellum. These changes are accompanied by changes in the concentration of certain amino acids in the appropriate areas. Glutamic acid is decreased in cerebellum, medulla, cortex, striatum, hippocampus, retina and olfactory bulbs, while taurine is specifically decreased in the cerebellum and medulla oblongata and aspartic acid in the retina. The concentrations of GABA and glycine are not modified in any of the areas studied. Glutamine is generally increased in concentration in areas of cell damage.
