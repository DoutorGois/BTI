In previous experiments rats pretreated with slow-release d-amphetamine (d-Amp) pellets for 4 1/2 days, given a 12-hr drug-free period, and then injected with d-Amp have been found to show a behavioral syndrome which has similarities to that induced by acute injections of the hallucinogens LSD and mescaline. The present results indicate that rats administered this same drug regimen have large decreases in Dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (Dopac), and homovanillic acid (HVA) in caudate nucleus, smaller decreases in DA with no changes in Dopac and HVA levels in nucleus accumbens, but no alterations in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5HIAA) levels in caudate, accumbens, brainstem and hippocampus. Increased 5HIAA levels are found in rats sacrificed with pellets intact following 3 days of continuous d-Amp administration, while sleep deprived and in motor stereotypies. The late and hallucinatory stage following continuous d-amp is correlated more closely with alterations in dopamine than of 5HT.
