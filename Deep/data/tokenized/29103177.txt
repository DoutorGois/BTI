Diabetes mellitus is associated with dementia, but whether diabetes is associated with Alzheimer's disease remains controversial. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid beta aggregation. We hypothesized that genes, involved in amyloid beta degradation, may be altered due to diabetes and thus participate in progression of Alzheimer's disease. Expression profiling of amyloid beta-degrading enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice and their correlation with expression of amyloid precursor protein in hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease patients were accessed. We found that matrix metalloproteinase 14 decreased in brain but not in other tissues of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, and was negatively correlated with expression of amyloid precursor protein in hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease patients. These findings suggested matrix metalloproteinase 14 may link insulin-deficient diabetes to Alzheimer's disease.
