A human cDNA for the voltage-sensitive potassium channel subunit Kv4.2 has been cloned and functionally characterized. The human Kv4.2 (KCND2) gene was mapped at 7q31-32. Kv4.2 mRNA is prominently expressed in human brain. Relatively high concentrations of Kv4.2 mRNA occurred in mRNA preparations of amygdala, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and thalamus. Kv4.2 mRNA was not detected in human heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. The derived Kv4.2 open reading frame consists of 630 amino acids. In comparison to rat Kv4.2, the human Kv4.2 sequence is highly conserved showing amino acid sequence differences at five positions only. The Kv4.2 subunits were expressed heterologously in human embryonic kidney (293) cells and mediated a rapidly inactivating, A-type outward K+ current. The gating kinetics of the Kv4.2-mediated currents were very similar to those of rat Kv4.2-mediated currents. Both the Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 subunits have been implicated in mediating the transient outward K+ current Ito in rodent cardiac myocytes. In contrast we did not detect Kv4.2. but solely Kv4.3 mRNA in human heart RNA preparations. This may suggest that Kv4.2 subunits do not contribute to the rapid transient outward K+ current of atrial and ventricular myocytes in humans.
