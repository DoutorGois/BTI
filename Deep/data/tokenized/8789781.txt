Domoic acid induces Fos in several brain regions controlling memory processing and gastrointestinal functions. In the present study, we determined serum levels of domoic acid that caused observable effects, and examined whether brain c-fos was a sensitive marker for the lowest observed neuroexcitatory effects in mice. Five different doses (0.25 to 4.0 mg/kg) of domoic acid were intraperitoneally administered to mice, and the serum concentration of domoic acid was monitored using a radioreceptor assay. The earliest neuroexcitatory effect of domoic acid on behavior was observed in the form of hyperactivity which occurred at 0.5 mg/kg (0.076 +/- 0.02 microgram/ml serum domoic acid, means +/- SE, n = 5). However, stereotypic behavior (scratching) was observed only at doses > or = 1.0 mg/kg (0.25 +/- 0.02 microgram/ml). At 2.0 mg/kg (0.54 +/- 0.04 microgram/ml) and higher, convulsions and seizures occurred. Domoic acid induction of c-fos mRNA was detected in the whole brain at 1.0 mg/kg, whereas increased Fos immunostaining was localized in the dentate granule cells and the pyramidal cells of hippocampal formation at doses as low as 0.5 mg/kg (0.076 +/- 0.02 microgram/ml). Our results indicate that Fos expression in the hippocampus is a sensitive biomarker for the neuroexcitatory effects of domoic acid, being induced at doses of domoic acid lower than those that elicit stereotypic behavior.
