Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) is a lipid mediator that elicits a neurotrophin-like action in embryonic hippocampal neurons in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effects of cPA and 2-O-carba-oleoyl-cPA (2ccPA), a metabolically stabilized cPA derivative, on ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. Transient occlusion for 8 min of bilateral carotid arteries besides permanent ligation of bilateral vertebral arteries was performed and morphological changes of the neurons were examined histologically 5 days after occlusion. cPA or 2ccPA was continuously administered for 5 days by means of an osmotic pump that was implanted subcutaneously before occlusion. Five days after occlusion, delayed neuronal death occurred in approximately 85% of the CA1 hippocampal neurons in the 0.2-2% bovine serum albumin vehicle control group. However, administration of cPA significantly increased the number of undamaged neurons in a dose-dependent manner. At the most effective concentration (18 mug/kg/5d), the number of undamaged neurons was increased to 4 times of that in the vehicle control group. 2ccPA also showed a neuroprotective effect, but it was less potent than that of natural cPA. These results indicate that systemic administration of both cPA and 2ccPA can protect neurons from ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus.
