A functional epileptogenic focus was created by repeated electrical stimulation of the limbic structures activated by the conditioned sensory stimulus. Seizure activity in response to the conditioned stimulus was observed only in the hippocampus though other limbic structures were also stimulated. After bilateral electrolytic lesion of the septum no highly synchronized seizure activity was observed in response to the conditioned signal. In this case spontaneous high amplitude activity was found. These observations permit suggesting that the hippocampus plays the role of an initiator of the seizure activity, whereas the functional connection between the septum and hippocampus promotes its final synchronization.
