The effects of selective D1 or D2 dopamine receptor agonists and the indirect dopamine agonist cocaine on hippocampal acetylcholine release in mice of the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 inbred strains were investigated using intracerebral microdialysis. The D1 SKF 38393 (10, 20, 30 mg/kg, i.p.), the D2 agonist LY 171555 (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg, i.p.) and cocaine (5, 10, 15 mg/kg, i.p.) all increased, dose-dependently, acetylcholine release in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice. Both the D1 agonist and cocaine did not produce any significant effect in DBA/2 mice. In the latter strain, however, LY 171555 produced a decrease in acetylcholine release that was evident after 60 min from injection of the doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, but not at the dose of 2 mg/kg. The effects observed in C57BL/6 mice as well as those produced by low doses of LY 171555 in the DBA/2 strain were consistent with previous results obtained in rats. The present results indicate major strain-dependent differences in the effects of dopamine agonists on hippocampal acetylcholine release in mice. Moreover, they suggest a complex genotype-related neural organization of dopamine-acetylcholine interactions in the mesolimbic system. Finally, the strain differences in the effects of the dopamine agonists on hippocampal acetylcholine release parallel previously reported strain differences in the effects of these substances on memory consolidation.
