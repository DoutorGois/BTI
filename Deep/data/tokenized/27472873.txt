Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and effective therapeutic drugs in the clinic are still lacking. Ideally, AD progression could be stopped at an early stage, such as at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. MCI refers to the clinical condition between normal aging and dementia. Patients with MCI experience memory loss but do not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of clinically probable AD. However, few MCI animal models have been established. Here, we used in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) recording and the Morris water maze (MWM) to evaluate the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) in mice. We found a relationship between cognitive behavior and LTP in vivo and determined the appropriate doses of STZ for a putative MCI animal model. Animals that received>/=150mug of STZ exhibited cognitive impairment in the MWM test, and few changes in behavior tests were observed in animals receiving less than 150mug of STZ. In vivo LTP recordings revealed that the induction of LTP decreased significantly in STZ-treated animals, even at the lowest dose (25mug/mouse), in a dose-dependent manner. Pathology analysis revealed STZ-induced neuron loss in a dose-dependent manner, both in the cortex and in the hippocampus, as evidenced by a significantly decreased neuronal number in the cohort treated with 75mug of STZ/mouse. Our study indicated that a low dose (25mug/mouse) of STZ impaired neural plasticity; at a higher dose of 75mug/mouse STZ, further LTP deficits were noted along with induced neuronal loss in both the cortex and the hippocampus, which could be considered a possible MCI or pre-MCI animal model; and finally, at 150mug/mouse STZ, dementia was induced, feasibly indicating a state of AD.
