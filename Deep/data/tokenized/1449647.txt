Rats that are brought into a novel environment or that are given stimulants or anti-muscarinic drugs exhibit high levels of motor activity. Application of moderate pressure on the sides of the snout of such rats results in immediate cessation of all movements for extended time periods. Hippocampal electrocorticograms show that hippocampal slow wave activity during such induced immobility is equivalent to the hippocampal slow wave pattern typically associated with spontaneous immobility. However, neocortical activity following scopolamine administration contains more 2-6 Hz irregular activity during spontaneous than induced immobility.
