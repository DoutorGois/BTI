Prolonged dissociated state of rats resulting from carbaholine stimulation of m-cholinoreceptors was studied by determining phosphorylation of synaptic membranes proteins. Unusually strong and prolonged activation was found in the process of phosphorylation of the hippocampus synaptic proteins under the influence of single carbaholine administration. Conclusion is made about direct participation of the hippocampus in mechanisms of memory dissociation and also about perspectiveness of the applied method for functional characteristics of separate brain structures.
