BACKGROUND: Physical exercise induces neuroprotection through anti-inflammatory effects and total sleep deprivation is reported an inflammatory process. We examined whether 7 weeks of exercise training attenuates markers of inflammation during total sleep deprivation (24-h wakefulness) in the rat brain and periphery. METHODS: Four groups of 10 rats were investigated: Sedentary control, Sedentary sleep-deprived, Exercised control, and Exercised sleep-deprived. Sleep deprivation and exercise training were induced using slowly rotating wheels and a motorized treadmill. We examined mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6) cytokine-related genes using real-time PCR, and protein levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, as well as circulating concentrations. RESULTS: Compared to Sedentary control rats, hippocampal and cortical IL-1beta mRNA expressions in Sedentary sleep-deprived rats were up-regulated (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively). At the protein level, hippocampal IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and cortical IL-6 contents were higher in Sedentary sleep-deprived rats (p < 0.001, p < 0.05, p < 0.05, respectively). Peripherally, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and norepinephrine concentrations were higher in Sedentary sleep-deprived rats compared to Sedentary control (p < 0.01, p < 0.001, p < 0.01, respectively). Exercise training reduced the sleep deprivation-induced hippocampal IL-1beta increases (mRNA expression and protein content) (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001), and TNF-alpha content (p < 0.001). At the periphery, exercise reduced sleep deprivation-induced increase of IL-6 concentration (p < 0.05) without effect on TNF-alpha and norepinephrine. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that a 7-week exercise training program before acute total sleep deprivation prevents pro-inflammatory responses in the rat hippocampus, particularly the IL-1beta cytokine at the gene expression level and protein content.
