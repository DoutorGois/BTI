We characterized eight aged beagles (maintained from birth in a laboratory colony) and one black Labrador using Bielschowsky's, thioflavine S, and Congo red staining, and antibodies to the beta-amyloid peptide, dystrophic neurites, and other plaque components. All plaques within these canine brains were of the diffuse subtype and were neither thioflavine S- nor Congo red-positive. The majority of plaques in the entorhinal cortex contained numerous neurons within them while plaques in the dentate gyrus did not. beta-Amyloid immunoreactivity was also present within select neurons and neuronal processes and was detected as a diffuse linear zone corresponding to the terminal fields of the perforant path. There was no significant correlation between extent of beta-amyloid accumulation and neuron number in entorhinal cortex. Neither tau-1, PHF-1, nor SMI-31-immunostaining revealed dystrophic fibers, confirming the classification of these plaques as diffuse. Canine plaques did not appear to contain bFGF- or HS-positive immunostaining. This may explain why neuritic involvement was not detected within these canine plaques. It is possible that the beta-amyloid within the canine brain has a unique primary structure or may not be in an assembly state that adversely affects neurons.
