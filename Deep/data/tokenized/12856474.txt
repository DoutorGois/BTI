We studied the protective effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) on brain damage by means of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) in rats. The TMZ group did not show any statistically significant difference from the control group with respect to SEPs. However, the percentage of cells with ischaemic cell damage in hippocampal regions was significantly smaller in the TMZ group than the control group. Trimetazidine reduced the number of damaged cells in the cerebral tissue during the ischaemia-reperfusion damage. It was suggested that higher doses of trimetazidine may further reduce the number of cells with ischaemic damage.
