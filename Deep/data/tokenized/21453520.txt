BACKGROUND: Microglial function is modulated by several factors reflecting the numerous receptors expressed on the cell surface, however endogenous factors which contribute to the age-related increase in microglial activation remain largely unknown. One possible factor which may contribute is interferon-gamma (IFNgamma). IFNgamma has been shown to increase in the aged brain and potently activates microglia, although its endogenous cell source in the brain remains unidentified. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were used to assess the effect of age and amyloid-beta (Abeta) on NK cell infiltration into the brain. The effect of the anti-inflammatory compound, atorvastatin was also assessed under these conditions. We measured cytokine and chemokine (IFNgamma, IL-2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and IFNgamma-induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10)), expression in the brain by appropriate methods. We also looked at NK cell markers, CD161, NKp30 and NKp46 using flow cytometry and western blot. RESULTS: Natural killer (NK) cells are a major source of IFNgamma in the periphery and here we report the presence of CD161+ NKp30+ cells and expression of CD161 and NKp46 in the brain of aged and Abeta-treated rats. Furthermore, we demonstrate that isolated CD161+ cells respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) by releasing IFNgamma. Atorvastatin, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, attenuates the increase in CD161 and NKp46 observed in hippocampus of aged and Abeta-treated rats. This was paralleled by a decrease in IFNgamma, markers of microglial activation and the chemokines, MCP-1 and IP-10 which are chemotactic for NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that NK cells contribute to the age-related and Abeta-induced neuroinflammatory changes and demonstrate that these changes can be modulated by atorvastatin treatment.
