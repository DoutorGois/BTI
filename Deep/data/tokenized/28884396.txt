Ginseng (Panax ginseng), an herbal medicine, has been used to prevent neurodegenerative disorders. Ginsenosides (e.g., Re, Rb1, or Rg1) were obtained from Korean mountain cultivated ginseng. The anticonvulsant activity of ginsenoside Re (20 mg/kg/day x 3) against trimethyltin (TMT) insult was the most pronounced out of ginsenosides (e.g., Re, Rb1, and Rg1). Re itself did not significantly alter tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-Upsilon (IFN-Upsilon), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) expression, however, it significantly increases the interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. In addition, Re attenuated the TMT-induced decreases in IL-6 protein level. Therefore, IL-6 knockout (-/-) mice were employed to investigate whether Re requires IL-6-dependent neuroprotective activity against TMT toxicity. Re significantly attenuated TMT-induced lipid peroxidation, protein peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species in the hippocampus. Re-mediated antioxidant effects were more pronounced in IL-6 (-/-) mice than in WT mice. Consistently, TMT-induced increase in c-Fos-immunoreactivity (c-Fos-IR), TUNEL-positive cells, and nuclear chromatin clumping in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were significantly attenuated by Re. Furthermore, Re attenuated TMT-induced proapoptotic changes. Protective potentials by Re were comparable to those by recombinant IL-6 protein (rIL-6) against TMT-insult in IL-6 (-/-) mice. Moreover, treatment with a phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002 (1.6 microg, i.c.v) counteracted the protective potential mediated by Re or rIL-6 against TMT insult. The results suggest that ginsenoside Re requires IL-6-dependent PI3K/Akt signaling for its protective potential against TMT-induced neurotoxicity.
