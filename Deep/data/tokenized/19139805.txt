We compared protein expression by Western blot analysis in four areas of postmortem brain from patients with schizophrenia and control subjects for several proteins that are often used as controls for Western blot studies: beta-tubulin, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and valosin-containing protein. We did not detect any differences in expression between subjects with schizophrenia and a comparison group. These results suggest that all four proteins are suitable loading controls for postmortem studies of schizophrenia.
