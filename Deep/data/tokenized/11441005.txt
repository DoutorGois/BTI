Hyperphosphorylated tau is the major component of paired helical filaments in neurofibrillary tangles found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Starvation of adult mice induces tau hyperphosphorylation at many paired helical filaments sites and with a similar regional selectivity as those in AD, suggesting that a common mechanism may be mobilized. Here we investigated the mechanism of starvation-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in terms of tau kinases and Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PP), and the results were compared with those reported in AD brain. During starvation, tau hyperphosphorylation at specific epitopes was accompanied by decreases in tau protein kinase I/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (TPKI/GSK3 beta), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), and PP2A activities toward tau. These results demonstrate that the activation of TPKI/GSK3 beta and cdk5 is not necessary to obtain hyperphosphorylated tau in vivo, and indicate that inhibition of PP2A is likely the dominant factor in inducing tau hyperphosphorylation in the starved mouse, overriding the inhibition of key tau kinases such as TPKI/GSK3 beta and cdk5. Furthermore, these data give strong support to the hypothesis that PP2A is important for the regulation of tau phosphorylation in the adult brain, and provide in vivo evidence in support of a central role of PP2A in tau hyperphosphorylation in AD.
