After a brief review of results reported so far regarding the stereotactic treatment of seizures, the author describes the results achieved with eight patients on whom stereotactic coagulation was performed in the right or left amygdala-hippocampus complex between 1976 and 1983 on account of drug-resistant partial seizures. Except for one case, in which the indications were purely clinical and it proved impossible to influence the frequency of seizures, seizures either ceased or their frequency was reduced. With a mean duration of 15 years, the period of pharmacoresistance until surgery was indicated was far longer than reported in the literature.
