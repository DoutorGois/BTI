We investigated the effect of ethanol on the binding of the gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) receptor ligand [3H]NCS-382 in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol (50-100 mM) did not alter the binding of [3H]NCS-382. Furthermore, acute (3g/kg, p.o.) as well as chronic (9-15 g/kg/day p.o. for 6 days) administration of ethanol also did not have any significant effect on the binding of [3H]NCS-382 in the rat cerebrocortical and hippocampal membranes. These observations suggest that ethanol does not interact directly with the GHB receptor in vitro or in vivo, and GHB receptor may not be involved in the pharmacological effects of ethanol.
