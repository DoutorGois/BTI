A series of N(1)- and N(2)-propargylphenelzine derivatives and analogues (1-7) was synthesized. In addition to their activity as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, two of the compounds, N(1)- and N(2)-propargylphenelzines (3 and 6), were found to be potent at preventing DSP-4-induced noradrenaline (NA) depletion in mouse hippocampus, suggesting that they have neuroprotective properties.
