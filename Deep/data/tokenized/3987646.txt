Experimental hyperthermic seizures in 15-day-old rats resulted in both an alteration in the benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding site in the hippocampal region and morphologic changes in hippocampal neurons. These alterations were not apparent until adulthood. Experimental adult animals also showed a reduced anticonvulsant response to a selective BDZ ligand when challenged with pentylenetetrazol. Developmental hyperthermic seizures may initiate dynamic changes in the hippocampus that contribute to adult functional impairment.
