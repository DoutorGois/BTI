The transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) plays an important role in opioids dependence. To better understand the role of CREB in opioids dependence and underlying signal pathways, we compared the effects of three ohmfentanyl stereoisomers ((-)-cis-(3R,4S,2'R) OMF (F9202), (+)-cis-(3R,4S,2'S) OMF (F9204), (-)-cis-(3S,4S,2'R) OMF (F9203)) and morphine on CREB phosphorylation and the expression of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) in hippocampus derived from mice which displayed conditioned place preference (CPP) behavior by Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analyses. Moreover, we studied the effects of OMF and morphine on CREB phosphorylation and colocalization of phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) with CaMKIV in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by Western blot, and confocal fluorescence microscopy analyses. The results showed that F9202, F9204 or morphine, which could induce CPP, enhanced CREB phosphorylation and the expression of CaMKIV in hippocampus from CPP mice without affecting total CREB protein level. The CREB phosphorylation of cultured hippocampal neurons was also enhanced and reached its peak level at 30 min upon exposure to F9202 (100 nM), F9204 (100 nM) or morphine (1 microM), while the total CREB protein level was not altered. KN-62 (10 microM), an inhibitor of CaM kinases, prevented CREB phosphorylation induced by morphine, F9202, and F9204 without change of total CREB level. The results of confocal fluorescence microscopy further demonstrated that the activated CREB (P-CREB) was colocalized with CaMKIV in nucleus. F9203, which could not induce CPP, failed to increase the CREB phosphorylation and the colocalization of P-CREB with CaMKIV both in hippocampus from CPP mice and in cultured hippocampal neurons. This is the first evidence to suggest that the increased CREB phosphorylation via CaMKIV signal pathway in hippocampus is relevant to opioids psychological dependence.
