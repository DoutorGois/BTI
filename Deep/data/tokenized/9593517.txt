We have employed mRNA differential display (DD) to generate a catalog of cDNAs whose expression in the hippocampus was regulated during long-term potentiation (LTP) in dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats. DD with 459 combinations of primer pairs revealed that 80 out of approximately 70000 bands displayed showed a reproducible change in their expression level. These cDNAs were categorized into seven groups according to changes in their temporal expression pattern. Some of these cDNAs were induced rapidly, but transiently, after the LTP induction, some induced rapidly and persistently, some induced slowly, and some down-regulated following LTP. This suggests that a complex molecular hierarchy underlies the maintenance of hippocampal LTP.
