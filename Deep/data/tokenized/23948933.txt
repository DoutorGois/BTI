Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in elderly. Chaperones may have a crucial role in AD due to their involvement in protein quality control, folding, and degradation. In this study, we investigated the mRNA and promoter DNA methylation levels of two chaperones, HSPA8 and HSPA9, in postmortem brain tissue (entorhinal and auditory cortices and hippocampus) from healthy elderly and AD subjects as well as in peripheral blood of healthy elderly and AD patients. mRNA quantification was performed by qRT-PCR and DNA methylation by mass spectrometry. In the peripheral blood, we did not observe a significant difference in HSPA8 and HSPA9 expression between elderly controls and AD. A significant downregulation of HSPA8 and HSPA9 was observed in AD across the three brain regions compared to the controls, suggesting their participation in AD pathogenesis. However, no important DNA methylation differences were observed, suggesting that other mechanism may be involved in controlling these genes expression.
