Loading neurons with membrane permeable Ca2+ indicators is a core experimental procedure in functional multineuron Ca2+ imaging (fMCI), an optical technique for monitoring multiple neuronal activities. Although fMCI has been applied to several brain networks, including cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, no studies have systematically addressed the dye-loading efficiency in different brain regions. Here, we describe the stainability of Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1AM in mouse acute brain slice preparations. The data are suggestive of the potential usability of fMCI in many brain regions, including olfactory bulb, thalamus, dentate gyrus, habenular nucleus, and pons.
