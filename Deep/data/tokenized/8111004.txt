Focal deposits of beta-amyloid (beta A) in the hippocampus have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. In this study we assessed the effects of bilateral injections into the hippocampus of beta A(25-35), a combination of beta A(25-35) with ibotenic acid (IBO), and IBO on spatial learning in the rat. Bilateral injections of beta A(25-35) into the hippocampus together with IBO (which by itself has no neurotoxic effects) produced a dramatic disruption in the acquisition of a spatial learning in the rat. Separate injections into the hippocampus of beta A(25-35) or the incubated form of beta A(25-35) alone failed to significantly affect maze acquisition in the rat. Histological examination revealed that only the combination of beta A(25-35) with IBO produced a lesion along with focal deposits in the hippocampus.
