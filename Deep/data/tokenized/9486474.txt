The light and electron microscopic localizations of single stranded DNA (SSD) protein, a marker of apoptosis and programmed cell death, in the gerbil hippocampus were examined by immunocytochemistry after transient brain ischemia. SSD-immunoreactive (IR) cells appeared from post-operative day 1 (PO 1) to PO 7 after 5- or 10-min ischemia. Immunoreaction was recognized in the nucleus of the CA1 pyramidal neurons without remarkable morphological changes on PO 1. These findings suggest that SSD degradation can occur during delayed neuronal death in the CA1, preceding the appearance of double strand breaks, one of the characteristic features of apoptosis.
