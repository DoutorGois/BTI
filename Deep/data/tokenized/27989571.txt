Left and right mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) exhibits similar functional and clinical dysfunctions, such as depressive mood and emotional dysregulation, implying that the left and right mTLE may share a common network substrate. However, the convergent anatomical network disruption between the left and right HS remains largely uncharacterized. This study aimed to investigate whether the left and right mTLE share a similar anatomical network. We examined 43 (22 left, 21 right) mTLE patients with HS and 39 healthy controls using diffusion tensor imaging. Machine learning approaches were applied to extract the abnormal anatomical connectivity patterns in both the left and right mTLE. The left and right mTLE showed that 28 discriminating connections were exactly the same when compared to the controls. The same 28 connections showed high discriminating power in comparisons of the left mTLE versus controls (91.7%) and the right mTLE versus controls (90.0%); however, these connections failed to discriminate the left from the right mTLE. These discriminating connections, which were diminished both in the left and right mTLE, were primarily located in the limbic-frontal network, partially agreeing with the limbic-frontal dysregulation model of depression. These findings suggest that left and right mTLE share a convergent circuit, which may account for the mood and emotional deficits in mTLE and may suggest the neuropathological mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of depression and mTLE.
