The experiments on rats with tests of avoiding "lighting square" and "threatening situation" and with the chemical stimulation of dorsal and ventral hippocampus with dopamine, 5-HT, GABA and glutamine acid, showed different functional significance of these monoamines and acidergic transmitters agents in the states of anxiety of heteromodal aversive genesis. It seems that the variations in the action spectrum of anxiolytics under study are due to unequal degree of 5-HT and GABA-ergic transmitter mechanisms of dorsal and ventral hippocampus.
