The phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a superfamily of enzymes that regulate spatio-temporal signaling by the intracellular second messengers cAMP and cGMP. PDE2A is expressed at high levels in the mammalian brain. To advance our understanding of the role of this enzyme in regulation of neuronal signaling, we here describe the distribution of PDE2A in the rat brain. PDE2A mRNA was prominently expressed in glutamatergic pyramidal cells in cortex, and in pyramidal and dentate granule cells in the hippocampus. Protein concentrated in the axons and nerve terminals of these neurons; staining was markedly weaker in the cell bodies and proximal dendrites. In addition, in both hippocampus and cortex, small populations of non-pyramidal cells, presumed to be interneurons, were strongly immunoreactive. PDE2A mRNA was expressed in medium spiny neurons in neostriatum. Little immunoreactivity was observed in cell bodies, whereas dense immunoreactivity was found in the axon tracts of these neurons and their terminal regions in globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Immunostaining was dense in the medial habenula, but weak in other diencephalic regions. In midbrain and hindbrain, immunostaining was restricted to discrete regions of the neuropil or clusters of cell bodies. These results suggest that PDE2A may modulate cortical, hippocampal and striatal networks at several levels. Preferential distribution of PDE2A into axons and terminals of the principal neurons suggests roles in regulation of axonal excitability or transmitter release. The enzyme is also in forebrain interneurons, and in mid- and hindbrain neurons that may modulate forebrain networks and circuits.
