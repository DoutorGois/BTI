Intensity of hippocampal RNA synthesis was studied in albino rats on days when elementary links of the chain motor conditioned reflex with food reinforcement were formed. A gradual increase in the nuclear RNA synthesis intensity was found in both learned and unlearned rats from the 1st towards the 5th day. This increase was, however, higher in the learned rats. A decrease was recorded in the difference in the intensity of the hippocampal nuclear RNA synthesis between the learned and unlearned rats from the 1st to the 5th day; this is possibly connected with the formation of certain mechanisms of memory consolidation, since the learned and unlearned rats differed in this property only.
