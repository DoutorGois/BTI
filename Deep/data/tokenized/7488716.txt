The use of geometrically simple networks formed by cultured neurons facilitates the electrophysiological study of biological computation. We used chemically patterned substrates for culturing SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells and embryonic rat hippocampal neurons to geometrically control their neurite outgrowth. On patterned substrates (parallel lines, 5-10 microns width), the neuroblastoma cells developed bipolar morphology with long neurite processes (approximately 200 microns) in the presence of retinoic acid. Hippocampal neurons cultured on substrates of hexagonal patterns extended their neurites preferentially along the circumferences of the hexagons and formed geometrically well defined network structures.
