Both the Mast Cell Degranulating (MCD) peptide and Dendrotoxin I (DTX(I)), two blockers of fast activation and slowly inactivating K+ channels, induced epileptiform seizures and brain damage after intracerebroventricular injection (200 pmol) in Sprague-Dawley rats. A considerable variation in the response of the rats was observed for each toxin. The neurodegeneration included the hippocampal formation, subiculum, septum, amygdala, and the cerebellum for both toxins, and the neocortex and anterior thalamic nuclei exclusively for DTX(I) treatment.
