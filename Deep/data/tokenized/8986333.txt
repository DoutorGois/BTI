A number of variables influence contextual, but not auditory-cue, fear conditioning. However, several of these variables (isolation, stimulus preexposure, retention interval, and age) affect generalized auditory-cue fear. More generalized fear was found when (a) rats were isolated in a novel environment than when returned to their home cages, (b) the retention interval was 3 hr rather than 24 hr, and (c) in 18-day-old compared with 25-day-old rats. Moreover, preexposure to the auditory cue eliminated the isolation effect. At a behavioral-psychological level, these variables may exert their effects by influencing the processes that construct a memory representation of the stimulus. At a neural systems level, they may influence processing carried out in the thalamo-corticoamygdaloid auditory pathway.
