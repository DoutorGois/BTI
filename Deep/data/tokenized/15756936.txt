Guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) was evaluated as a neuroprotective agent against the damage induced by glutamate in rat hippocampal slices submitted to glucose deprivation. In slices maintained under physiological conditions, glutamate (0.01 to 10 mM), Kainate, alpha-amino-3-hydroxi-5-methylisoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), 1S,3R-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), or L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (L-AP4) (100 microM) did not alter cell membrane permeability, as evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. In slices submitted to glucose deprivation, GMP (from 0.5 mM) prevented LDH leakage and the loss of cell viability induced by 10 mM glutamate. LDH leakage induced by Kainate, AMPA, NMDA or 1S,3R-ACPD was fully prevented by 1 mM GMP. However, glutamate uptake was not altered in slices submitted to glucose deprivation and glutamate analogues. Glucose deprivation induced a significant decrease in ATP levels which was unchanged by addition of glutamate or GMP. Our results show that glucose deprivation decreases the energetic charge of cells, making hippocampal slices more susceptible to excitotoxicity and point to GMP as a neuroprotective agent acting as a glutamatergic antagonist.
