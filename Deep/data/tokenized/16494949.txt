There is increasing interest in interfacing dissociated neuronal cultures with planar multielectrode arrays (MEAs) for the study of the dynamics of neuronal networks. Here we report on the successful use of three-dimensional tip electrode arrays (3D MEAs), originally developed for use with brain slices, for recording and stimulation of cultured neurons. We observed that many neurons grew directly on protruding electrode surface, appearing to make excellent contact. A larger than usual portion of extracellular spikes had large positive peaks, while most of the spikes from conventional two-dimensional electrode arrays had large negative spikes. This may be due to the direct capacitive coupling situation provided by relatively large electrode surface area.
