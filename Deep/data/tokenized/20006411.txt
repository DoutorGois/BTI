Hippocampal neurogenesis continuously declines in the aging brain but only little is known about age-related alterations in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus which accommodates different subpopulations of precursor cells. Here, we examined the age-related effects on total number and proliferation rate of distinct precursor cell populations in the dentate gyrus of 3 and 16 months old transgenic pNestin-GFP mice. Following a single injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) we observed a significant reduction of all proliferating precursor subtypes in aged mice compared to young controls. Stereological analysis further revealed that this decreased proliferation was not only caused by a general reduction in total number of precursor subtypes but also by a subtype-specific alteration of the proliferation rate. Whereas radial glia-like and early neuronal precursor cells demonstrate decreased proliferation rates, no difference was found for doublecortin-positive precursors. Additional long-term experiments further revealed that these age-related alterations in the proliferative zone were accompanied by a strongly decreased neurogenesis while hippocampal function was not impaired.
