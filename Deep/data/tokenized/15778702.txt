1. 4-(4-Fluorophenoxy)benzaldehyde semicarbazone (V102862) was initially described as an orally active anticonvulsant with robust activity in a variety of rodent models of epilepsy. The mechanism of action was not known. We used whole-cell patch-clamp techniques to study the effects of V102862 on native and recombinant mammalian voltage-gated Na+ channels. 2. V102862 blocked Na+ currents (I(Na)) in acutely dissociated cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Potency increased with membrane depolarization, suggesting a state-dependent mechanism of inhibition. There was no significant effect on the voltage dependence of activation of I(Na). 3. The dissociation constant for the inactivated state (K(I)) was approximately 0.6 microM, whereas the dissociation constant for the resting state (K(R)) was >15 microM. 4. The binding to inactivated channels was slow, requiring a few seconds to reach steady state at -80 mV. 5. The mechanism of inhibition was characterized in more detail using human embryonic kidney-293 cells stably expressing rat brain type IIA Na+ (rNa(v)1.2) channels, a major Na+ channel alpha subunit in rat hippocampal neurons. Similar to hippocampal neurons, V102862 was a potent state-dependent blocker of rNa(v)1.2 channels with a K(I) of approximately 0.4 microM and K(R) approximately 30 microM. V102862 binding to inactivated channels was relatively slow (k(+) approximately = 1.7 microM(-1) s(-1)). V102862 shifted the steady-state availability curve in the hyperpolarizing direction and significantly retarded recovery of Na+ channels from inactivation. 6. These results suggest that inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels is a major mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant properties of V102862. Moreover, understanding the biophysics of the interaction may prove to be useful in designing a new generation of potent Na+ channel blocker therapeutics.
