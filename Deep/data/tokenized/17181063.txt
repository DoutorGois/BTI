We demonstrated high sensitivity of the brain neurotransmitter system to high-molecular-weight heparin in Wistar rats. Single and repeated administration of heparin modulated the content of monoamines and neurotransmitter amino acids in the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex. Antistress activity of high-molecular-weight heparin and its positive effects on memory under experimental conditions suggest that this preparation in low doses can be used in the therapy of neurological and age-related diseases.
