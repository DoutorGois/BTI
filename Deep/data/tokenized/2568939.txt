A possible influence of botulinum A toxin on the modulation of evoked neurotransmitter release was investigated in hippocampus tissue. Rabbit hippocampal slices prelabelled with [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA), [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) or [3H]choline were superfused with physiological medium and were stimulated electrically during superfusion. The evoked release of [3H]NA, [3H]5-HT and [3H]acetylcholine [( 3H]ACh) was inhibited by botulinum A toxin in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Neither the inhibition of release of [3H]NA and [3H]5-HT by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine nor facilitation of release in the presence of alpha 2-antagonists were influenced by pretreatment of the tissue with botulinum toxin. The toxin caused no [32P]ADP ribosylation of synaptosomal proteins of hippocampus. The facilitation of the stimulation-induced [3H]NA and [3H]5-HT release by the specific protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) was significantly diminished by botulinum A toxin. These results show that the evoked transmitter release is inhibited by botulinum A toxin by a mechanism which does not involve ADP ribosylation or an interaction with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor mechanism.
