In this communication, the effect of acute treatment with lamotrigine (LTG) and topiramate (TPM) was investigated on release of the main excitatory amino acids (EAA) such as glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) in the hippocampus of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindled freely moving rats using microdialysis. The results showed that the level of Glu and Asp significantly decreased in the PTZ-kindled epileptic (EP) rat hippocampus after the 20 mg/kg LTG or 40 mg/kg TPM administration. But LTG gave rise to a better result than TPM in controlling EAA release.
