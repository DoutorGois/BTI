Increased expression of multidrug-resistance associated protein 1 in brain tissue has been reported which lead to multidrug resistance of refractory epilepsy. However, the mechanism of up-regulated expression is still unclear. In our previous study, we have found that the MAPK signaling pathway mediated the expression of P-glycoprotein. So in this study, we used a rat model of refractory epilepsy to examine whether p38 MAPK affect the expression of MRP1 and the concentrations of AEDs in the brain. The expression of MRP1 and p38 MAPK was detected by immunofluorescence, Western-blot and real time-PCR, while the concentration of AEDs was measured by microdialysis and HPLC. The result showed that SB202190, the specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, could down-regulate the expression of MRP1, while increase the concentrations of valproate and lamotrigine in hippocampus extracellular fluid of refractory epileptic rat. We demonstrate that p38 MAPK signaling pathway may be involved in drug resistance of refractory epilepsy by regulating MRP1.
