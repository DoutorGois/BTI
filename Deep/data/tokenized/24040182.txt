The Slit/Robo axon guidance families play a vital role in the formation of neural circuitry within select regions of the developing mouse nervous system. Typically Slits signal through the Robo receptors, however they also have Robo-independent functions. The novel Slit receptor Eva-1, recently discovered in C. elegans, and the human orthologue of which is located in the Down syndrome critical region on chromosome 21, could account for some of these Robo independent functions as well as provide selectivity to Robo-mediated axon responses to Slit. Here we investigate the expression of the mammalian orthologue EVA1C in regions of the developing mouse nervous system which have been shown to exhibit Robo-dependent and -independent responses to Slit. We report that EVA1C is expressed by axons contributing to commissures, tracts and nerve pathways of the developing spinal cord and forebrain. Furthermore it is expressed by axons that display both Robo-dependent and -independent functions of Slit, supporting a role for EVA1C in Slit/Robo mediated neural circuit formation in the developing nervous system.
