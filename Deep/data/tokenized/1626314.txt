The response of extracellular norepinephrine to the acute administration of amphetamine was assessed, using dialysis, in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in awake, behaving rats. Norepinephrine exhibited a pronounced and rapid dose- and time-dependent increase in response to 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg amphetamine, which corresponded closely to the time course of the behavioral profile. These results are consistent in with a possible role for norepinephrine in the behavioral response to amphetamine.
