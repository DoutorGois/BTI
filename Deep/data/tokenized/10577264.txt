Fibers of the global projection system ramify tremendously and distribute in the diverse region of the brain. Biogenic amines in the global projection system have been shown to facilitate formation and maintenance of synapses in the developing and adult brain. In terms of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor was shown to mediate the function of serotonin. We raised specific antibodies against 5-HT2A receptor protein. Virtually all the neurons in the cerebral cortex expressed 5-HT2A receptor. By using the function of biogenic amines to facilitate synapse formation and maintenance a novel approach can be developed in the neuroscience. That is to perturb biogenic amines, to change synaptic density, and to examine changes in the ability of learning and memory. Removing serotonin and acetylcholine for a week, at the maximum 58% of synapses are decreased in the hippocampus. The animals losing synapses spent a longer latency compared to intact animals in Morris water maze. The level of biogenic amines in the developing brain has been known to decrease tremendously by genetic diseases such as phenylketonuria, Down syndrome and autism as well as environmental factors such as nutrition and stress. In those situations synapses in the brain are suggested to be decreased. Synaptic mechanism for mental retardation and developmental disability by the cascade appears to contribute for understanding pathophysiology and a new therapy.
