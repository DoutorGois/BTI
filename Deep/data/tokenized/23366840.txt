Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) has provided remarkable relief to patients with brain disorders. Traditionally, DBS is performed through a single macroelectrode implanted at a specific deep brain structure (like the subthalamic nucleus for Parkinson's disease). Despite its great success, little is known about its mechanisms of action. We propose that using several microelectrodes for stimulation, instead of a single macroelectrode, may provide advantages including reduced tissue damage and increased brain area activated. We compare the area of brain affected by macroelectrode and microelectrode arrays implanted in rat hippocampus using stimulation-induced c-Fos expression and immunohistochemistry.
