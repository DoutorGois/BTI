OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit and related regulatory protein mRNA expression in the hippocampus and amygdala in immobilization stressed rats and effect of Xiaoyaosan (XYS) on them. METHODS: Immobilization model rats were established by binding for 3 h per day and intervened with XYS, the expression of AMPA receptor subunit (GluR1-4), N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) and protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) mRNA expression in model rats' CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus, dentate gyrus and amygdala were detected on day 7 and day 21 after modeling. RESULTS: On day 7, expression of GluR1 mRNA was significantly decreased in CA1 region (P < 0.05) and increased in CA3 region and amygdala (all P < 0.05); expression of GluR2 and GluR3 mRNA in amygdala (all P < 0.05) and GluR4 mRNA in CA1 region (P < 0.01) significantly increased, but the expression of NSF and PICK1 mRNA in amygdala only showed an increasing trend. XYS showed effective regulation on GluR4 mRNA in CA1 region (P < 0.01) and GluR1-3 mRNA expression (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in amygdala. On day 21, the expression of GluR4 mRNA in CA1 region (P < 0.05) and GluR2 mRNA in dentate gyrus (P < 0.05) markedly lowered and expression of GluR1 mRNA in amygdala increased (P < 0.01); XYS significantly regulated the expression of GluR1 and GluR4 mRNA in CA1 region (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Repeated stress in a short time shows effect on expression of AMPA receptor subunit mRNA stronger than chronic stress. The regulation of XYS to AMPA receptor subunit mRNA expression were obvious in hippocampal CA1 region and amygdala.
