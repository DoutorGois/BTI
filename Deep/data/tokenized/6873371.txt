The possibility of production of the epileptiform discharges throughout the sleep--wakefulness cycle was studied by means of thresholds for isolated EEG epileptiform discharges in cats. The experiments with artificially induced EEG synchronization (nembutal) indicate that the EEG synchronization does not facilitate the epileptiform discharges. However, this fact does not include the well--known standpoint concerning the preferential role of the EEG synchronization in provoking generalized seizures.
