The proteasome is the core of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and is involved in synaptic protein metabolism. The incorporation of three inducible immuno-subunits into the proteasome results in the generation of the so-called immunoproteasome, which is endowed of pathophysiological functions related to immunity and inflammation. In healthy human brain, the expression of the key catalytic beta5i subunit of the immunoproteasome is almost absent, while it is induced in the epileptogenic foci surgically resected from patients with pharmaco-resistant seizures, including temporal lobe epilepsy. We show here that the beta5i immuno-subunit is induced in experimental epilepsy, and its selective pharmacological inhibition significantly prevents, or delays, 4-aminopyridine-induced seizure-like events in acute rat hippocampal/entorhinal cortex slices. These effects are stronger in slices from epileptic vs normal rats, likely due to the more prominent beta5i subunit expression in neurons and glia cells of diseased tissue. beta5i subunit is transcriptionally induced in epileptogenic tissue likely by Toll-like receptor 4 signaling activation, and independently on promoter methylation. The recent availability of selective beta5i subunit inhibitors opens up novel therapeutic opportunities for seizure inhibition in drug-resistant epilepsies.
