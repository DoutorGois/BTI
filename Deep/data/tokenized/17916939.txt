To explore the relationship between the zinc distribution and zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3) mRNA expression in the mouse brain, zinc contents and its distribution were determined by synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence (SRXRF), and ZnT3 mRNA expression was examined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. The results showed that the zinc contents were not distributed evenly in various brain tissues. The zinc contents in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were nearly 5-10 times higher than that in other neural locations. Correspondingly, ZnT3 mRNA expression was observed in high abundance in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and testis, but was not detected in other organs and tissues. In the nervous system, ZnT3 mRNA was detected mainly in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and spinal ganglion. The present results show the coincident distribution of zinc and ZnT3 mRNA in mouse brain. The high zinc contents might be determined by the high expression of ZnT3. More meaningfully, the results showed the feasibility of applying of SRXRF in examining the distribution of minerals in different organs and tissues. In addition, it was observed for the first time that ZnT3 mRNA was expressed in the facial nucleus. The function of ZnT3 in facial nucleus awaits further study.
