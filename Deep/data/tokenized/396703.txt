The cooling of rats to the body temperature of 30 and 25 degrees C does not change acidic peptide-hydrolase activity in tissue homogenates of cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum and medulla oblongata. In deep hypothermia (to 20 degrees C) there occurs a significant increase in the peptide-hydrolase activity in tissue of the studied brain areas both in an incubation sample at 37 degrees C, and at temperature corresponding to the body temperature of cooled animals (20 degrees C). But the enzyme activity remains unchanged in homogenates of medulla oblongata incubation at 37 degrees C.
