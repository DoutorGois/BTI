6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 200 micrograms, 150 micrograms or 110 micrograms) or vehicle was infused stereotaxically into the lateral ventricles of rats, usually following pretreatment with desmethylimipramine (DMI). Various brain regions were then assayed for dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). As expected, 6-OHDA depleted DA in all brain regions examined. Unexpectedly, however, the two highest doses of 6-OHDA significantly decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and increased 5-HT levels in the striatum. In addition, despite pretreatment with doses of DMI commonly considered adequate to block 6-OHDA-induced depletion of NE, all doses of 6-OHDA tested significantly reduced NE levels in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and septum. We interpret our data as suggesting that some brain regions are susceptible to nonspecific toxic effects of 6-OHDA at doses commonly employed. Furthermore, these nonspecific effects may or may not occur, depending on seemingly minor variations in experimental technique.
