The effects of an anxiolytic honokiol derivative, dihydrohonokiol-B (DHH-B) [3'-(2-propenyl)-5-propyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-2,4'-diaol], on ammonia-induced increases in the intracellular Cl(-) concentration ([Cl(-)](i)) were examined using primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons. DHH-B (1-100 ng/ml), but not an inactive isomer of honokiol, magnolol (100 ng/ml), dose-dependently inhibited the ammonia-induced increases in [Cl(-)](i) without any changes in the control [Cl(-)](i). Such an effect of DHH-B was blocked by a gamma-aminobutylic acid A (GABA(A)) and GABA(C) Cl(-) channel blocker, 100 microM picrotoxin, and a GABA(C) receptor blocker, 10 microM (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid, but not by a GABA(A) receptor blocker, 10 microM bicuculline. Further, a GABA(C) receptor agonist, 200 microM cis-4-aminocrotonic acid, but not a GABA(A) receptor agonist, 10 microM muscimol, mimicked the effect of DHH-B. Thus, DHH-B appears to protect neurons from the ammonia-induced increases in [Cl(-)](i) through GABA(C) receptor stimulation.
