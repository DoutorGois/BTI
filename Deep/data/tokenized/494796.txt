EEG power spectra of the sensorimotor area of the neocortex, the dorsal hippocampus, midbrain reticular formation and anteroventral thalamic nucleus, as well as corresponding coherence functions and phase spectra, undergo changes during formation and performance of defensive conditioned reflex in rabbit. The conclusion is draen that in the process of conditioning a morphofunctional system of brain structures is established including the above mentioned formations. Their functional integration occurs on the basis of theta-rhythm. The execution of a conditioned act requires isorhythmicity of electrical processes within the theta-range in the studied structures and an adequate level of their excitability, which is manifested in the dominance of 6,0 c/s frequency.
