Glutamic acid diethylester (GDEE) reversibly antagonized excitations produced by glutamate and aspartate but not those produced by acetylcholine when applied iontophoretically to rat CA1 hippocampal neurons in penthrane (methoxyfluorane) anesthetized rats and to CA1 neurons in in vitro slice preparations. GDEE did not appear to differentiate between the excitations produced by glutamate aspartate and appeared to be a more potent antagonist than has previously been reported. CA1 cells were remarkably sensitive to acetylcholine; 5-50 nA being sufficient to produce marked amino acid-like excitations, which were unrelated to the pH of the acetylcholine. The nature of the responses to applied substances was virtually identical between the intact animal and the in vitro slice preparation. A description of the in vitro technique is given as an Appendix.
