Accumulating studies have shown that a traditional Chinese decoction Chaihu-Shugan-San produced the antidepressant-like effects in rodents including in perimenopausal. Previous studies and our preliminary study indicated that saikosaponin A, one of the main constituents of Chaihu-Shugan-San, enhanced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in rats. Herein, this study aimed to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of saikosaponin A in perimenopausal rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The sucrose preference test, novelty-suppressed feeding test and forced swimming test were performed after administration of saikosaponin A for 4 weeks. Serum corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels, as well as hypothalamus CRH and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor were measured. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the hippocampus were detected for evaluation of the neuroinflammation. Further, BDNF levels and its receptor TrkB were also determined. Our results indicated that four-week treatment with saikosaponin A increased sucrose preference, decreased latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding test and reduced the immobility time in the forced swimming test. In addition, saikosaponin A restored the dsyregulation of HPA axis and neuroinflammation in rats exposed to CUMS. Moreover, saikosaponin A promoted BDNF-TrkB signaling in the hippocampus. This study demonstrates that saikosaponin A produced the antidepressant-like effects in rats, which may be mediated by restoration of neuroendocrine, neuroinflammation and neurotrophic systems in the hippocampus during perimenopausal.
