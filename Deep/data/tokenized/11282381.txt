It has been suggested that hippocampal theta rhythm codes some aspects of motor behavior, but previous studies of the correlation between theta frequency and steady whole body locomotion speed using both linear tracks and wheels have provided inconsistent if not contradictory results. Because the relationship between temporal dynamics of theta frequency and non-steady (or dynamic) whole body locomotion speed can help clarify this issue, single trials of hippocampal EEG were analyzed together with nonsteady wheel running speed recorded during rats perform spontaneous normal locomotion in a wheel. Changes in theta frequency within single trials show positive or negative correlation with nonsteady wheel running speed. As the mean running speed increases and the standard deviation of running speed decreases in a single trial, the correlation between temporal dynamics of theta frequency and nonsteady wheel running speed within the single trial tends to be positive. In addition, we found that the amount of deceleration is also related to the polarity of the correlation coefficients.
