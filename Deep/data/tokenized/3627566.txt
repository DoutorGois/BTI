Calcium was localized in neurons and glial cells of the CA1 region of hippocampus and in neurons of parietal cortex with the oxalate-pyroantimonate electron cytochemical method following recovery from 5-min ischemia of gerbil brain. During the early postischemic recirculation phase a maximum amount of calcium deposits was detected in mitochondria of all investigated cells. A second rise in mitochondrial calcium deposits was observed in parallel with the onset of ultrastructural degeneration of mitochondria and the loss of cellular integrity beginning 6 h postischemia.
