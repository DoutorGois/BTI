We report a 69-year-old woman with an amnestic syndrome who showed small infarcts in bilateral hippocampi by MRI. She had a sudden onset of recent memory impairment and was admitted to our hospital. On admission, she showed marked impairment in recent memory tests. Other neurological findings including the mental status were essentially normal. Four weeks after the onset, the memory test using simple figures was normalized, however, that using a simple sentence by the auditory route was still abnormal. Cranial CT scans and MRI revealed small lesions consistent with infarcts in the CA-1 field of both hippocampi. Her memory disturbance lasted longer than that of TGA. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the amnestic syndrome with proved discrete lesions in the CA-1 field of the hippocampi in human. Our case suggests the importance of the CA-1 field for recent memory.
