Excitotoxins L-beta-oxalyl-amino-alanine (L-BOAA) and 3,4,6-trihydroxyphenylalanine (6-OH-DOPA) have been investigated with regard to their potency to inhibit [3H] alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) binding in human hippocampus in a quantitative autoradiographic study. With dissociation constants (KD) of [3H]AMPA binding and inhibition concentrations (IC50) of L-BOAA, 6-OH-DOPA and L-glutamate obtained from saturation and displacement experiments inhibition constants (Ki) for the inhibition of [3H]AMPA binding in individual hippocampal subregions could be calculated. They were between 5.2 +/- 2.9 and 35.1 +/- 39.9 microM for L-BOAA and 39.1 +/- 26.8 and 59.4 +/- 44.1 microM for 6-OH-DOPA. L-BOAA was equally potent as the endogenous agonist L-glutamate with Ki's between 13.1 +/- 3.9 and 21.4 +/- 12.1 microM (n = 4, mean +/- S.D.). Limbic system symptoms like cognitive deficits, mood disturbances and vivid dreams observed in patients with the motor neuron disease neurolathyrism may thus well be mediated by agonistic action of L-BOAA at AMPA glutamate receptors in hippocampus.
