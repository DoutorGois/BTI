PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of fast spin-echo (FSE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in detecting mesial temporal sclerosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with a diagnosis of complex partial seizures were studied. Criteria for abnormality included visual detection of hippocampal MR signal abnormality and atrophy or significantly decreased hippocampal volume determined by using MR morphometric techniques. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging in demonstrating correct lateralization of seizure focus were both 100%. The positive predictive value of FSE MR imaging was 100%. The negative predictive value was 50%. CONCLUSION: The authors recommend FSE MR imaging of the hippocampus as the imaging technique of choice in the evaluation of patients with complex partial seizures for mesial temporal sclerosis.
