The effects of ketamine and (+)cyclazocine on three in vitro models of epilepsy: the "Mg2+ free", the 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and, for comparison, the penicillin model were studied. These data indicate that the two compounds had an inhibitory effect in hippocampal slices of rats, bathed in "Mg2+ free" solution at a concentration that did not influence the basal field potential. They also had an inhibitory effect on the penicillin model, but at concentrations ten times greater than those effective against "Mg2+ free" model. On the other hand, (+)cyclazocine was equally active against epileptogenic activity produced by 4-AP and "Mg2+ free" solution, while ketamine failed to produce an effect on epileptiform activity induced by 4-AP.
