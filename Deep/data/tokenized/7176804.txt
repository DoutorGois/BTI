The action of vincamine on the physiology of the CA1 region of the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation was investigated. At concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 microM, a five-minute perfusion with vincamine did not affect the synaptically-mediated activation of pyramidal neurons evoked by stimulation of the Schaffer-commissural fiber system. The effect of vincamine on the excitability of the pyramidal neurons was investigated by studying its effect on the antidromically-elicited field potential and the input-output relation of Schaffer-commissural fiber input. No effect on either of the two parameters was seen at a concentration of 100 microM of vincamine. Vincamine did, however, attenuate both the post-tetanic (PTP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) evoked by repetitive stimulation of the Schaffer-commissural fiber system. At a concentration of 100 microM of vincamine, PTP was significantly reduced and LTP was almost completely suppressed.
