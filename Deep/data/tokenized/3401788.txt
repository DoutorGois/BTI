In the present study, zinc content was determined in discrete hippocampal and amygdaloid areas of 3 strains of mice (El, ddY and CBA) using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Zinc content was significantly lower in the dentate area of El strain compared to ddY and CBA strains. The El mouse is considered an animal model for epilepsy and the seizures in this mouse appear to originate in the hippocampus. The results suggest the possible involvement of hippocampal zinc in the pathophysiology of convulsive seizures in the epileptic mouse.
