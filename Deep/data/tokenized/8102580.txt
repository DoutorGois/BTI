The present study investigated the delayed and persistent effects of 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) on the K(+)-evoked release of endogenous glutamate and dynorphin B-like immunoreactivity from a subcellular fraction (P3) that is enriched in hippocampal mossy fiber synaptosomes. It is demonstrated that the alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon, and zeta isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) are present in the P3 fraction obtained using the guinea pig hippocampus as starting tissue. The K(+)-evoked release of glutamate was found to be selectively enhanced when mossy fiber-enriched synaptosomes were preincubated with PDBu for 15 minutes and extensively washed with a PDBu-free medium. The persistent enhancement of glutamate release observed under this condition was not reversed by the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and was desensitized to the potentiating effects of an acute reexposure to PDBu. The overall content and activity of PKC was not substantially altered during the initial 15 minutes of treatment with PDBu (10 microM). More prolonged pretreatments with PDBu altered the substrate specificity of PKC and decreased the content of all PKC isoforms, but did not reverse the facilitation of glutamate release that followed preincubation in the presence of PDBu. It is concluded that the persistent activation of PKC enhances K(+)-evoked glutamate release from hippocampal mossy fiber-enriched synaptosomes and that, once established, this presynaptic facilitation is sustained by a process that is no longer directly dependent on continued PKC phosphotransferase activity.
