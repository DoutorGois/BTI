Ischemia results in increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in the brain. To prove a connection between IL-6 upregulation and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) expression following ischemia, we analyzed cell-type specific expression changes of IL-6R using transient global ischemia in the gerbil as a model. In sham operated animals, IL-6R mRNA and protein were mainly detected in hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons. After ischemia, IL-6R was expressed in neurons but there was no increase during the peak IL-6 expression. Neuronal IL-6R mRNA and protein decreased in parallel with pyramidal cell death, starting 2 days after ischemia. Double-labeling experiments revealed that in postischemic hippocampus IL-6R was not present in GFAP-reactive astrocytes but that the surviving parvalbumin containing interneurons expressed IL-6R mRNA.
