Several studies have implicated oxidative stress as one of the important mechanisms of toxic effects of lead (Pb). In the present study we tested the beneficial effects of calcium (Ca2+) and zinc (Zn2+) in protecting the Pb-induced oxidative stress in the brains of developing and adult mice. Mice were lactationally exposed to 0.2% Pb and supplemented with either calcium (Ca2+) or zinc (Zn2+) and the mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), xanthine oxidase (XO) and catalase (CAT)] and lipid peroxidation (LP) were analyzed in cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla of brains excised on postnatal day (PND) 14, 21, 28 and 3 months. The levels of free radicals were measured using direct Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Exposure to Pb resulted a significant decrease in the activities of SOD, XO and CAT while the LP levels were significantly increased in different brain regions. Evaluation of EPR signals and g-values showed abundant accumulation of free radicals in different regions of the brain following Pb exposure. Interestingly the supplementation with Ca2+ or Zn2+ reversed the Pb-induced effects on antioxidant enzymes, LP and free radical formation; however Zn2+ supplementation appeared to be more protective. These findings strongly support that zinc and calcium supplementation significantly protect the Pb-induced oxidative stress, a major contributing factor to neurotoxicity.
