We used in vivo microdialysis to define the chronological relationship between release of thromboxane and platelet activating factor (PAF) into the extracellular space of ischemic hippocampus. The thromboxane level peaked after 20 min of postischemic reperfusion, followed by a delayed PAF response 120 min later. We conclude that cerebral ischemia causes delayed elevation of PAF in the extracellular space, long after the immediate synthesis and release of thromboxane metabolites.
