p60 transcription regulator protein (p60TRP) facilitates the processing of the amyloid precursor protein towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway by inhibiting the beta-secretase action. This protein was initially identified to be downregulated in the temporal lobe of brains from Alzheimer's disease patients. p60TRP is one of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-associated proteins which directly influences the signalling capacity of GPCRs. In the present study, we investigated the brain-region-specific proteome profile of transgenic p60TRP mice to gain an insight into the molecular events mediated by the long-term effect of neuronal p60TRP overexpression on brain proteome changes and its potential implication for neuronal functions in the central nervous system. Using a proteomics research approach based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation, we identified 2,025 proteins, whereby 1,735 proteins were quantified, out of which 56 were found to be significantly altered in the cortex and/or hippocampus of neuronal transgenic neuronal p60TRP mice. Our data suggests that in vivo overexpression of neuronal p60TRP significantly affects cognitive and neuroprotective capacities.
