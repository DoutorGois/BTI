Investigations were carried out with a dopamine agonist compound GYKI-32 887 to compare its binding capacity towards D2, 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors. Synaptosomal membranes were prepared from corpus striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats. The tritiated ligands used were: 3H-spiperone for D2 and 5-HT2 receptors and 3H-5-HT for 5-HT1 receptors. Comparing the results obtained, IC50 and Ki values, one can conclude that GYKI-32 887 has higher affinity towards D2 receptors than serotonin ones and shows better selectivity than bromocriptine, the reference substance.
