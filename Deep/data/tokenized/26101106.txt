OBJECTIVE: Drosophila Pumilio (Pum), a homolog of mammalian Pum2, plays an important role in translational regulation in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly for dendrite outgrowth and neuronal excitability. We investigated the expression pattern and cellular distribution of Pum2 in patients with drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and rats with lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and double-labeled immunofluorescence were utilized to determine the expression level and distribution of Pum2 in temporal neocortex tissues from patients with intractable TLE (n=20) and patients with severe head trauma (n=20) in addition to the hippocampus and adjacent cortex of rats with lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced TLE and controls. RESULTS: Pum2 was expressed in the cell bodies and dendrites of neurons but did not colocalize with glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes or propidium iodide (PI) in nuclei. The expression of Pum2 was significantly reduced in patients and rats with TLE in comparison to controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Pum2 expression was less in patients with TLE and a rodent model of epilepsy, suggesting that decreased expression of Pum2 may be involved in the pathogenesis of TLE.
