c-Fos protein immunocytochemistry was used to map the brain structures recruited during the evolution of seizures that follows repeated administration of a subconvulsive dose (35mg/kg, ip) of pentylenetetrazol in rats. c-Fos appeared earliest in nucleus accumbens shell, piriform cortex, prefrontal cortex, and striatum (stages 1 and 2 of kindling in comparison to control, saline-treated animals). At the third stage of kindling, central amygdala nuclei, entorhinal cortex, and lateral septal nuclei had enhanced concentrations of c-Fos. At the fourth stage of kindling, c-Fos expression was increased in basolateral amygdala and CA1 area of the hippocampus. Finally, c-Fos labeling was enhanced in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus only when tonic-clonic convulsions were fully developed. The most potent changes in c-Fos were observed in dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, CA1, lateral septal nuclei, basolateral amygdala, central amygdala nuclei, and prefrontal cortex. Piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, lateral septal nuclei, and CA3 area of the hippocampus appeared to be the brain structures selectively involved in the process of chemically induced kindling of seizures.
