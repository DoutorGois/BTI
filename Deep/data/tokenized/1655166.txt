Nerve growth factor (NGF) was injected intraventricularly into aged (24 months) rats with unilateral lesions of the lateral fimbria. The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was determined in the septum and hippocampus from the normal unlesioned rats, lesioned and cytochrome c-treated rats (controls), and lesioned and NGF-treated rats at different times after the lesion. NGF-injection for 15 days after the lesion resulted in an increase of the ChAT activity in both the contralateral hippocampus and the entire septum, to about 130% of that in the normal animals, but resulted in a slight increase in the ipsilateral lesioned hippocampus, when compared to the activity in the ipsilateral side of the cytochrome c-treated controls. NGF-injection for 30 days after the lesion resulted in a 48% increase of the ChAT activity in the ipsilateral hippocampus as compared to cytochrome c-treated controls, but failed to result in a significant increase in the contralateral hippocampus. These findings indicate that atrophic cholinergic neurons in aged animals are similarly responsive to NGF treatment, like these in the young animals. Moreover, these findings suggest that the responses of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons to NGF treatment varies with time after the lesion and imply that the NGF administration can promote the collateral sprouting from spared cholinergic fibers after the lesion in the aged forebrain.
