The effect of ethanol on GABA receptors was studied in hippocampal slices and membrane preparations of the rat brain. In slice preparation, ethanol enhanced the GABA inhibition of the population spikes evoked in CA 1 pyramidal cells by Schaffer collateral stimulation. The effect of ethanol was dose-dependent being observed with minimal concentration of 70 mM. In 3H-GABA binding experiments, ethanol enhanced the binding to fresh membranes with no change in the affinity. Maximal stimulation was observed at ethanol concentration of 70 mM. In hippocampal slices or membrane preparations obtained from ethanol- or barbital-administered rats chronically, ethanol failed to enhance GABA function. Thus, the present study demonstrated the involvement of GABA in central effect of ethanol. Also suggested in GABA was the involvement in the development of cross-tolerance between ethanol and barbiturates.
