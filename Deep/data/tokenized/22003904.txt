Accurate localization of epileptogenic brain is critical for successful epilepsy surgery. Recent research using wide bandwidth intracranial EEG has demonstrated that interictal high-frequency oscillations are preferentially localized to the brain region generating spontaneous seizures, and are a potential biomarker of epileptogenic brain. The existence of an interictal, electrophysiological biomarker of epileptogenic brain has the potential to significantly advance epilepsy surgery by improving outcomes through improved localization and potentially eliminating the reliance on chronic intracranial EEG monitoring.
