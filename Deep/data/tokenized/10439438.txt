The aim of this study was to determine the regional distribution in situ of the mRNA for the alpha 7 subunit of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in human fetal brain. We found high levels of alpha 7 gene expression in nuclei that receive sensory information, such as those of the neocortex and hippocampus, the thalamic nuclei, the reticular thalamic nucleus, the pontine nuclei and the superior olive complex. These data support a possible regulatory function for alpha 7-containing receptors in sensory processing, which may be involved in the pathological physiology of schizophrenia and autism. Early alpha 7 gene expression is also consistent with a morphogenetic role for alpha 7 receptors in central nervous system development.
