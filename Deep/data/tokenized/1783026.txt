Paired-pulses of 20-100 ms interpulse interval (IPI) were delivered to the Schaffer collaterals/commissural fibers in order to excite the apical dendrites of the hippocampal CA1 region in freely behaving rats. Significant differences were observed for the paired-pulse responses during different behavioral states. The responses recorded during awake immobility (IMM), and slow-wave sleep (SWS) were similar, but as a group, were different from those during walking (WLK) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM). During WLK and REM, the population spike evoked by the second pulse (P2) at IPI of 30 and 50 ms, was greatly facilitated as compared to the population spike evoked by the first pulse (P1), i.e. P2 greater than P1. During IMM and SWS and using moderate stimulus intensities, P2 was generally smaller than P1 (paired-pulse suppression) at IPI of 30 and 50 ms. The P2/P1 relation with behavior was not caused by the slight variations of P1 with behavior. In addition, paired-pulse facilitation of the population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) was relatively small and not significantly dependent on behavior. Behavioral dependence of the paired-pulse responses was not generally found for IPI of 20 or 100 ms. It is concluded that paired-pulse facilitation at 30-50 ms IPI can best be explained by EPSP facilitation combined with a behaviorally dependent disinhibition.
