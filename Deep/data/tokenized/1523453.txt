In the 1980s, numerous studies demonstrated neuropathologic changes in schizophrenia. Increased ventricle-brain ratios in schizophrenics have been reported. Birth-related trauma coupled with a genetic predisposition may be involved in the increased ventricle-brain ratios and in the development of some forms of the illness. Probable embryogenic anomalies in the hippocampus and other informational processing centers seem involved.
