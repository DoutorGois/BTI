Our learning and memory system has the challenge to work in a world where items to learn are dispersed in space and time. From the information extracted by the perceptual systems, the learning system must select and combine information. Both these operations may require a temporary storage where significance and correlations could be assessed. This work builds on the common hypothesis that hippocampus and subicular, entorhinal and parahippocampal/postrhinal areas are essential for the above-mentioned functions. We bring up two examples of models; the first one is modeling of in vivo and in vitro data from entorhinal cortex layer II of delayed match-to-sample working memory experiments, the second one studying mechanisms in theta rhythmicity in EC. In both cases, we discuss how cationic currents might be involved and relate their kinetics and pharmacology to behavioral and cellular experimental results.
