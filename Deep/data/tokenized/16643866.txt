Chronic restraint stress in mice affects hippocampal structure and function. Mice were subjected to daily restraint for 3 weeks, and gene expression in hippocampus was compared to controls using large-scale cDNA microarrays. We found that 444 genes were differentially expressed, and further analysis of 6 genes by real-time reverse transcription PCR confirmed that 3 of them were downregulated by stress. These 3 genes, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type 1 beta (Pip5k1b), and glutathione S-transferase, pi2 (Gstp2), were also analyzed by in situ hybridization. The downregulation of Gstp2 may induce an increase of oxidative damage in the pyramidal cells of the CA1 and CA3 regions and granular layer of the dentate gyrus, leading to structural and functional damage. Those regions are affected by stress, and our results could help understand further the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of stress-related disorders.
