The effects of infusion of low concentrations of the synthetic opioid peptide D-Pro4-beta-casomorphin-5(deprolorphin) on electrical field responses in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation of mice were investigated. Deprolorphin (0.01-10 microM) causes a large enhancement of the population spike (PS) and appearance of additional spikes of CA1 pyramidal cells to Schaffer-commissural stimulation, which were partially antagonized by the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone. It is likely that this analgesic peptide in the hippocampus acts through mu-receptors and neuronal mechanisms already described for morphine and enkephalin analogs.
