Epilepsy is a collection of diverse disorders that together affect approximately 1% of the general population. Current therapies are largely symptomatic and are aimed at controlling seizures in affected individuals. This review focuses on emerging insights into mechanisms underlying the most common form of epilepsy--complex partial epilepsy--and also addresses progress in molecular genetic approaches. Such developments will hopefully lead to more effective therapies.
