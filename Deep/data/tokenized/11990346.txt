Fluid percussion (FP) brain injury leads to immediate indiscriminate depolarization and massive potassium efflux from neurons. Using Northern blotting, we examined the post-FP expression of primary response/immediate early genes previously described as induced by depolarization in brain. RNA from ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus was harvested from immature and adult rats 1 h following mild, moderate, or severe lateral fluid percussion injury and compared against age-matched sham animals. C-fos gene expression was used as a positive control and showed marked induction in both pups (6-25-fold with increasing severity) and adults (9.7-17.1-fold). Kinase-induced-by-depolarization-1 (KID-1) and salt-inducible kinase (SIK) gene expression was increased in adult (KID-1 1.5-1.6-fold; SIK 1.3-3.9-fold) but not developing rats. NGFI-b RNA was elevated after injury in both ages (pups 1.8-6.1-fold; adults 3.5-5-fold), in a pattern similar to that seen for c-fos. Secretogranin I (sec I) demonstrated no significant changes. Synaptotagmin IV (syt IV) was induced only following severe injury in the immature rats (1.4-fold). Our results reveal specific severity- and age-dependent patterns of hippocampal immediate early gene expression for these depolarization-induced genes following traumatic brain injury. Differential expression of these genes may be an important determinant of the distinct molecular responses of the brain to varying severities of trauma experienced at different ages.
