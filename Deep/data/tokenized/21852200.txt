Aiming at a better understanding of the role of A(2A) in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), we characterized the effects of the A(2A) antagonist SCH58261 (7-(2-phenylethyl)-5-amino-2(2-furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrim idine) on seizures and neuroprotection in the pilocarpine model. The effects of SCH58261 were further analyzed in combination with the A(1) agonist R-Pia (R(-)-N(6)-(2)-phenylisopropyl adenosine). Eight groups were studied: pilocarpine (Pilo), SCH+Pilo, R-Pia+Pilo, R-Pia+SCH+Pilo, Saline, SCH+Saline, R-Pia+Saline, and R-Pia+SCH+Saline. The administration of SCH58261, R-Pia, and R-Pia+SCH58261 prior to pilocarpine increased the latency to SE, and decreased either the incidence of or rate of mortality from SE compared with controls. Administration of R-Pia and R-Pia+SCH58261 prior to pilocarpine reduced the number of Fluoro-Jade B-stained cells in the hippocampus and piriform cortex when compared with control. This study showed that pretreatment with R-Pia and SCH58261 reduces seizure occurrence, although only R-Pia has neuroprotective properties. Further studies are needed to clarify the neuroprotective role of A(2A) in TLE.
