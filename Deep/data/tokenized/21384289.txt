BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated brain abnormalities associated with myelomeningocele in infants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between June 1995 and June 2008, 42 patients with myelomeningocele were treated in our hospital. Only 24 patients (13 males, 11 females, mean age 1.5 months, range 1 day - 11 months) were evaluated by both spinal and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Brain MRI revealed: hydrocephalus in 21 (87.5%) patients, all of whom required immediate shunting. Total agenesis of the corpus callosum was observed in 2 (8.3%) patients, partial agenesis was seen in 4 (17%) patients and 8 (34%) patients had dysplasia of the corpus callosum. Absence of the septum pellucidum was observed in 2 (8%) patients. Widening of the interhemispheric fissure and colpocephaly were noted in 10 (41%) and in 3 (12%) patients, respectively. Abnormal white matter maturation was observed in 2 (8%) patients. Small posterior fossa was observed in 18 (74%) patients, Chiari malformation in 16 (67%) patients, cerebellar and brain stem hypoplasia in 3 (12%) and 7 (30%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MRI examination of the myelomeningocele site is not sufficient. Clinicians should consider obtaining imaging studies of the entire neuraxis in patients with myelomeningocele.
