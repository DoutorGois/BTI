The adenylyl cyclase (AC) system is affected by several types of antidepressant treatments, and increased activity in this system is linked to the therapeutic action of antidepressants. The present study was undertaken to compare the effects of single-dose and long-term treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (10 mg/kg, i.p.), on the AC system in the male rat brain of Wistar rats. Furthermore, we compared the effects of long-term citalopram and lithium treatments on the AC system. Long-term citalopram, but not single-dose administration, increased the AC type 1 mRNA in the hippocampus, whereas type 2 mRNA was unaffected. Long-term lithium treatment also increased AC1 in the hippocampus. However, long-term citalopram treatment did not increase AC type 1 protein, basal or forskolin-stimulated AC activity, but GTP increased AC activity in the hippocampus. This may indicate enhanced AC/G protein coupling. Thus, citalopram may increase cAMP signalling by acting on components of the AC system without affecting the protein level of the AC type 1.
