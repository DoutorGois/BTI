Depression has been linked to a selective increase in the high affinity conformation of the alpha2-adrenergic autoreceptors (alpha2-ARs) in the human brain as well as to an overexpression of alpha2-ARs in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Thus, the development of novel alpha2-AR antagonists represents an attractive source of new antidepressants. This paper describes the design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 30 new guanidinium and 2-iminoimidazolidinium as potential alpha2-AR antagonists. In order to design this new series of alpha2-AR antagonists, a pharmacophore model was developed using the GALAHAD software. This study suggested that increased substitution in the space surrounding the cationic guanidine moiety might lead selectively to antagonist activity. Following the preparation of compounds incorporating this feature and competitive radioligand binding, [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assays revealed that this structural modification affords exclusively alpha2-AR antagonists, in contrast with the analogous unsubstituted compounds in which a mixture of antagonist/agonist activities was previously observed.
