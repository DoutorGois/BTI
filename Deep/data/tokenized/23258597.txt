Detailed in this unit are protocols for studying the effects of externally and internally applied agents on the behavior of ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs), specifically the GABA(A) receptor. These assays include a number of electrophysiological techniques applied to whole-cell and excised patch recordings of recombinant and native GABA(A) receptor subtypes used in the generation and analysis of a pharmacological data. Although applied to GABA(A) receptors, these techniques are equally applicable to other LGICs. The analysis is extended to incorporate consideration of post-synaptic inhibitory events. In addition, complementary descriptions of how tissues for such studies are prepared for studying recombinant and native receptors are included.
