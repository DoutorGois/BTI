In model membranes, arachidonic acid and diacylglycerol have been proposed to synergistically induce a membrane-inserted, constitutively active form of protein kinase C. We have investigated the effects of these lipid protein kinase C activators on synaptic efficacy in the Schaffer collateral input to CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. Arachidonic acid (5 microM) perfusion combined with repetitive afferent stimulation had no consistent effect on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials recorded in stratum radiatum, while treatment with a cell-permeable diglyceride, oleoyl-acetylglycerol (5 micrograms/ml), followed by stimulation, led to a short-term potentiation. By contrast, the combination of oleoyl-acetylglycerol and arachidonic acid gave rise to a long-lasting non-decremental potentiation of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. The induction of potentiation was "activity dependent", as there was either no significant effect or there was a measurable depression when repetitive synaptic stimulation was omitted. Furthermore, consistent with a protein kinase C-dependent process, the potentiation was blocked by the kinase inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine. The results suggest that relatively low concentrations of arachidonic acid and diacylglycerol work synergistically through protein kinase C to persistently enhance synaptic transmission. This synergy has the makings of an associative (Hebbian) device for long-term potentiation induction operating at the second messenger level.
