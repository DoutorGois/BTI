Rare earth element (REE) exposure has been shown to induce central nerve system intoxication, but the molecular mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. In this study, cerium (Ce), in the form of CeCl3, was administered by way of gavage to mice for 90 consecutive days, and cytokine expression, associated with neuroinflammation of hippocampus, as well as spatial memory were increased in mice. Significant Ce accumulation in hippocampus, which led to neuroinflammation and decreased spatial memory of mice, was observed. Furthermore, CeCl3 remarkably increased levels of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nucleic IkappaB kinase, factor-kappaB-inducible kinase, nucleic factor-kappaB, and p52 and p65 expression as well as significantly decreased levels of IkappaB and interleukin-2 expression. These results showed that neuroinflammation and damaged hippocampal function may be associated with CeCl3-induced neuerotoxicity. Our findings suggest the need for workers and consumers to exercise caution when handling REEs.
