Trimethyltin (TMT) produces selective neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system (CNS), in which the hippocampus is the most sensitive area. Since previous studies have been conducted in either non-neural cells or mixed primary cultures, an immortalized hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT-22 cell) was used to assess the mechanism and mode of death produced by TMT. The compound produced a time- and concentration-dependent apoptotic death that was caspase-mediated. Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) were involved in the cytotoxicity. Scavenging of ROS by a free radical trapping agent or inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore significantly reduced cell death. Additionally, TMT increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor NFkappaB. Pharmacologic inhibition studies showed that the iNOS-mediated NO generation increased expression of Bax and then mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. It was concluded that excessive ROS generation initiated the apoptotic cell death by upregulating iNOS followed by increased Bax expression which then led to loss of DeltaPsim and caspase-executed cell death. This study is the first to report in a neuronal cell model that TMT stimulates induction of iNOS, which then increases cellular levels of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) to initiate apoptotic death.
