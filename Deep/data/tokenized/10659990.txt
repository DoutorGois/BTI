1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) is a drug that induces a Parkinson's-like syndrome in several species. Oxidative stress resulting from either excess generation or reduced scavenging of free radicals has been proposed to play a role in its neurotoxicity. It has been suggested that metallothionein (MT) protects against oxidative damage of the central nervous system produced by overproduction of free radicals. This study examined the effect of MPP+ on metallothionein I+II protein content in different brain regions. NIH mice were injected with MPP+ (4.5, 9.0 or 18 microg/3 microl) into their right lateral ventricle. Corpus striatum, cerebellum, midbrain, frontal cortex and hippocampus were dissected out and their metallothionein concentrations were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. MPP+ reduced the concentration of MT I+II proteins (38%) only in the striatum. The results suggest that changes in MT I+II content may be associated with MPP+ neurotoxicity.
