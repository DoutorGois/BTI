AIM: To investigate the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the hippocampus after cerebral hypoxic-ischemia (HI) in newborn rats and the effect of progesterone (PROG) on them. METHODS: Forty newborn SD rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal group, sham-operated group, hypoxic-ischemic group and progesterone group. Model of hypoxic-ischemia encephalopathy (HIE) was established in the 7-day-old newborn SD rats. Immunohistochemical method was applied to detect the expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in hippocampus. RESULTS: GLUT1 and GLUT3 were slightly seen in normal and sham operation group, there was no obviously difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). The expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in hypoxic-ischemia group were all higher than that in sham operated group (P < 0.05). Not only the expression of GLUT in progesterone group were significantly higher than that in sham operated group (P < 0.01), but also than that in hypoxic-ischemia group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PROG could increase the tolerance of neuron to hypoxic-ischemia with maintaining the energy supply in the brain by up-regulating GLUT expression.
