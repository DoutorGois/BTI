MR spectroscopy (MRS) is a widely used and useful additional tool in the diagnostic process of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite several MRS studies in bipolar spectrum research, establishing a clean image about special metabolite alterations in the disorder still needs further investigation. The first part of this case study presents a bipolar II patient and her first 3T MR spectroscopy in drug-naive conditions, comparing to a healthy subject. Having finished the first MRS investigation, we applied lamotrigine medication. The ongoing second part of the study will show the data of the second MRS scan, after 5 month of lamotrigine therapy.
