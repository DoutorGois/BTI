The seizure latency changed during daily pentylentetrazol (PTZ) induced convulsions showing an increase between days 2 and 4, a rapid decrease between days 5 and 10 and a slight increase again between days 11 and 14. At the respective timepoints, [3H]CHA binding, in cortex and cerebellum of PTZ treated animals followed exactly the same pattern, suggesting that the alterations in A1 receptors in these areas may partly determine the PTZ seizure latency curve. On the contrary, the changes of [3H]CHA binding in hippocampus (sustained increase) and striatum (sustained decrease) didn't follow the latency curve pattern. These results suggest that changes in A1 receptor density in specific brain areas may be involved in the modulation of seizure susceptibility.
