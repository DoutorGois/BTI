We demonstrate the applicability of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) for receptor binding studies using low molecular weight ligands on the membranes of living nerve cells. The binding of the benzodiazepine Ro 7-1986/602 (N-des-diethyl-fluorazepam), labeled with the fluorophore Alexa 532, to the benzodiazepine receptor was analyzed quantitatively at the membrane of single rat hippocampal neurons. The values obtained for the dissociation constant Kd = (9.9 +/- 1.9) nm and the rate constant for ligand-receptor dissociation kdisS = (1.28 +/- 0.08) x 10(-3) s(-1) show that there is a specific and high affinity interaction between the dye-labeled ligand (Ro-Alexa) and the receptor site. The binding was saturated at approx. 100 nM and displacement of 10 nM Ro-Alexa, with a 1,000-fold excess of midazolam, showed a non-specific binding of 7-10%. Additionally, two populations of the benzodiazepine receptor that differed in their lateral mobility were detected in the membrane of rat neurons. The diffusion coefficients for these two populations [D(bound1) = (1.32 +/- 0.26) microm2/s; D(bound2) = (2.63 +/- 0.63) x 10(-2) microm2/s] are related to binding sites, which shows a mono-exponential decay in a time-dependent dissociation of the ligand-receptor complex.
