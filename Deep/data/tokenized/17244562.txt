With the hope of replacing neurons lost in traumatic brain injury (TBI), experimental models are being used to investigate TBI-induced neurogenesis. Although selectively vulnerable to TBI, the neurogenic hippocampus may have the unique ability to replace damaged neurons locally. Injury may also activate signaling pathways that induce neuroblasts from the subventricular zone to migrate to areas of focal cortical damage. Additionally, there is some evidence for local activation of latent neural progenitor cells in the injured neocortex itself. Each of these themes is discussed, with emphasis on the possibility of future therapeutic intervention.
