Reports from multiple laboratories have now been published analyzing the critical nature of the caspase cleavage site of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) for cell death induction, synaptic loss, hippocampal atrophy, long-term potentiation, memory loss, neophobia, and other aspects of the Alzheimer's phenotype. Here we review the results and implications of these studies for the understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and the potential development of therapeutics that target this site in AbetaPP.
