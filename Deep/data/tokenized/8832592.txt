The effect of aconitine, an alkaloid neurotoxin known to bind at site 2 of the sodium channel, was investigated on epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices by use of extracellular recordings in CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Epileptiform activity was induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin, penicillin, pentylenetetrazol or by omission of magnesium from the bathing medium, respectively. In every case aconitine (0.1 and 1 microM) blocked the multiple population spikes representing the epileptiform activity. The onset of inhibition was shorter by use of an increased concentration of the epileptogenic drug. Epileptiform activity evoked by pentylenetetrazol and low magnesium was first increased by aconitine followed by a rapid inhibition, while the bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and penicillin-induced epileptiform discharges were immediately abolished.
