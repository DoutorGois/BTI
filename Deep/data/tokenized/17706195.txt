In 30- and 90-day-old rats, using immunohistochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD-67), we have tested whether malnutrition during different periods of hippocampal development produces deleterious effects on the population of GABA neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) and cornu Ammonis (CA1-3) of the dorsal hippocampus. Animals were under one of four nutritional conditions: well-nourished controls (Con), prenatal protein malnourished (PreM), postnatal protein malnourished (PostM), and chronic protein malnourished (ChroM). We found that the number of GAD-67-positive (GAD-67+) interneurons was higher in the DG than in the CA1-3 areas of both Con and malnourished groups. Regarding the DG, the number of GAD-67+ interneurons was increased in PreM and PostM and decreased in ChroM at 30 days. At 90 days of age the number of GAD-67+ interneurons was increased in PostM and ChroM and remained unchanged in PreM. With respect to CA1-3, the number of labeled interneurons was decreased in PostM and ChroM at 30 days of age, but no change was found in PreM. At 90 days no changes in the number of these interneurons were found in any of the groups. These observations suggest that 1) the cell death program starting point is delayed in DG GAD-67+ interneurons, and 2) protein malnutrition differentially affects GAD-67+ interneuron development throughout the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, these changes in the number of GAD-67+ interneurons may partly explain the alterations in modulation of dentate granule cell excitability, as well as in the emotional, motivational, and memory disturbances commonly observed in malnourished rats.
