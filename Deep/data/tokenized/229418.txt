Current evidence suggests that glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS); particularly, glutamate excites most neurones in the CNS. Until recently this effect was widely used to study glutamate receptors and to distinguish them from those of other excitatory amino acids. The development of ligand binding studies for many neurotransmitters has facilitated the study of receptors at the molecular level and using these methods we recently reported the existence in hippocampal membranes of pharmacologically distinct sodium-dependent and sodium-independent glutamate binding sites, the former related to high-affinity uptake and the latter exhibiting several characteristics of postsynaptic receptor sites. We now report that, as with other neurotransmitters, several ions regulate the Na-independent binding of glutamate; the monovalent cations induce a decreased binding while certain divalent cations enhance this Na-independent binding. Additionally, since some of these effects appear to be irreversible, we propose that the regulation of glutamate binding by cations might account for the extremely long-lasting potentiation of synaptic responses found in the hippocampus following bursts of repetitive electrical stimulation (see ref. 9 for a review).
