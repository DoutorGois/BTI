Bipolar Disorder (BD) is one of the most severe psychiatric disorders. Despite adequate treatment, patients continue to have recurrent mood episodes, residual symptoms, and functional impairment. Some preclinical studies have shown that histone deacetylase inhibitors may act on manic-like behaviors. Neurotrophins have been considered important mediators in the pathophysiology of BD. The present study aims to investigate the effects of lithium (Li), valproate (VPA), and sodium butyrate (SB), an HDAC inhibitor, on BDNF, NGF and GDNF in the brain of rats subjected to an animal model of mania induced by ouabain. Wistar rats received a single ICV injection of ouabain or artificial cerebrospinal fluid. From the day following ICV injection, the rats were treated for 6 days with intraperitoneal injections of saline, Li, VPA or SB twice a day. In the 7th day after ouabain injection, locomotor activity was measured using the open-field test. The BDNF, NGF and GDNF levels were measured in the hippocampus and frontal cortex by sandwich-ELISA. Li, VPA or SB treatments reversed ouabain-related manic-like behavior. Ouabain decreased BDNF, NGF and GDNF levels in hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats. The treatment with Li, VPA or SB reversed these impairment induced by ouabain. In addition, Li, VPA and SB per se increased NGF and GDNF levels in hippocampus of rats. Our data support the notion that neurotrophic factors play a role in BD and in the mechanisms of the action of Li, VPA and SB.
