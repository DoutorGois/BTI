The effects of lithium on serotonin receptors in rat brain were investigated. Chronic administration of lithium resulted in reduced density of serotonin receptors in the hippocampus but no apparent effects in the cortex. Lithium in vitro had no effect on serotonin receptors in the cortex or hippocampus.
