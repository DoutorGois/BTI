A new dipole tracing method, based on a realistic head model, was used to determine dipole locations and vector moments of interictal convexity sharp waves recorded (with conventional EEG technique) from the right fronto-temporal region in a patient with partial complex seizures. When the dipole locations in the head model were compared to MRI scans, the majority of the sharp wave dipoles were found to be located in the right hippocampal area. For individual sharp waves, the hippocampal dipoles moved along tracks corresponding to the vector moment directions, suggesting that the electrical sources of the convexity sharp waves were somato-dendritic currents which spread rapidly from one neuron group to the next in the hippocampal area. Previous long-term subdural recording had shown seizure onset in this area. After right-sided anterior temporal lobectomy including the hippocampus the patient has been seizure-free for three months.
