The involvement of central serotonin systems in behavioural disinhibition in the rat was assessed using a symmetrically reinforced go/no-go conditional visual discrimination task. Selective central 5-HT depletion (generally averaging more than 90% in neocortex, hippocampus and striatum) was induced by intracerebroventricular administration of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) following pretreatment with both a noradrenergic and dopaminergic re-uptake inhibitor. The lesioned animals failed to acquire the conditional visual discrimination. This deficit was due to an inability to withhold responding and thus correctly complete the no-go trials. The lesioned animals responded faster both correctly, during go trials, and incorrectly during no-go trials. Impulsive early responding during the initial 1.2 s of the stimulus presentation was also increased by 5-HT depletion. Subjects that were lesioned after stable performance of the task had been acquired showed a similar, but smaller effect. These animals displayed more accurate performance of the go trials, but poorer performance of the no-go trials. Once again, go trial response latencies were faster and early responses during the no-go trials were increased by the lesion. The results suggest that previous accounts of impulsive responding induced by 5-HT depletion fail to recognise the pervasive nature of this effect, which affects multiple behavioural indices of response disinhibition and can impede the acquisition and performance of discrimination tasks depending on their precise response requirements.
