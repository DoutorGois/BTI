An intrahippocampal injection of N-methyl-D-aspartate induced the appearance of degradation products of both the 68 kiloDalton neurofilament protein and the glial fibrillary acidic protein, as revealed by immunoblot techniques. The degradation of these two filament proteins was maximal at 10 days after the lesion. The degradation patterns were similar to those induced with calpains or calcium in vitro. There were no degradation effects on the 200 kD neurofilament protein as tested with both mono- and polyclonal antibodies. Consequently, the neuronal degeneration after excessive activation of NMDA receptors appears to involve calcium activation of proteolytic enzymes. The effects on the glial proteins are probably secondary to neuronal damage but could be related to calcium dependent processes.
