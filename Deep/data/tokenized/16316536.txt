OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of immunoglobulin on the neuronal expression of IL-1beta and IL-1ra and the neuronal death at hippocampus in rats with convulsion induced by pentylenetetrazol. METHODS: The epilepsy model was established by injecting intraperitoneally pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) into Wistar rats. Forty-five rats were randomly divided into three groups, normal control group, PTZ plus intravenous immunoglobulin (PTZ-IVIG); PTZ plus normal saline (PTZ-NS). Neuronal death was assessed by light microscopy with the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and with in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). IL-1beta and IL-1ra expressions were examined by histochemistry. RESULTS: The ratio of IL-1beta/IL-1ra at hippocampal CA(1) region in PTZ-IVIG group (0.5 +/- 0.1) was significantly lower than that in PTZ-NS group (1.9 +/- 0.5, t = 12.9, P < 0.05). Apoptotic cell numbers at the hippocampal CA(1) region were significantly decreased in the PTZ-IVIG group, compared to PTZ-NS group (t = 27.1, P < 0.05). The numbers of positive cells were 16.4 +/- 3.3/1000 microm(2) in the former and 41.7 +/- 3.5/1000 microm(2) in the latter. Necrotic cell numbers at the hippocampal CA(1) region were significantly decreased in the PTZ-IVIG group (19.0 +/- 2.6/1000 microm(2)), compared to PTZ-NS group (42.3 +/- 4.9/1000 microm(2), t = 20.9, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Immunoglobulin could inhibit neuronal death induced by convulsion and its possible mechanism might be the regulation of IL-1 system in neurons.
