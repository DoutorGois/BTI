Glutamate receptor-mediated responses were investigated by using a whole-cell recording and an intracellular calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) imaging in gerbil postischemic hippocampal slices prepared at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours after 5-minute ischemia. Bath application of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA), and kainate showed that NMDA-, AMPA- and kainate-induced currents were enhanced in postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons at 1 to 12 hours after 5-minute ischemia. NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) were examined in postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons at 3 hours after 5-minute ischemia to confirm whether synaptic responses are enhanced in the postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons. The amplitudes of NMDA- and non-NMDA-receptor-mediated EPSC were enhanced in the postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons. NMDA-, AMPA-, and kainate-induced [Ca2+]i elevations were also examined to determine whether the enhancement of currents is accompanied by the enhancement of [Ca2+]i elevation. The enhancements of NMDA-, AMPA-, and kainate-induced [Ca2+]i elevations were shown in the postischemic CA1. These results indicate that NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated responses are persistently enhanced in the CA1 pyramidal neurons 1 to 12 hours after transient ischemia, and suggest that the enhancement of glutamate receptor-mediated responses may act as one of crucial factors in the pathologic mechanism responsible for leading postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons to irreversible neuronal injury.
