The effects of intrahippocampal or intrahypothalamic injections of anticholinergic compounds on operant responding were observed in a multiple schedule paradigm consisting of reinforced, punished, and nonreinforced components and on a punished ingestive passive avoidance task. The pattern of results suggests that cholinergic components of the hippocampus and hypothalamus mediate responding suppressed by nonreinforcement but not by punishment. The data are discussed with reference to Carlton's proposed central cholinergic inhibitory mechanisms.
