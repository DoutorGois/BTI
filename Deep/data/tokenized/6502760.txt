Recent findings suggest that exogenous gangliosides improve recovery of a learned behavior (alternation in a T-maze) which is thought to be related to sprouting after lesions of the entorhinal cortex. In the present investigation, we studied an unlearned behavior (the open-field hyperactivity resulting from bilateral entorhinal lesions) to evaluate whether ganglioside treatments reduce the severity of initial postlesion impairments or improve recovery. We also examined whether the treatments enhance the sprouting of septodenate fibers which parallels the recovery of open-field activity. The typical behavioral changes induced by bilateral entorhinal lesions include hyperactivity, reduced habituation of activity, and a gradual time-dependent return toward control levels. We found that rats treated with total brain gangliosides (30 mg/kg) showed a smaller lesion-induced increase, consistently lower levels, and greater within-session habituation of activity than did saline-treated counterparts. Control rats treated with gangliosides did not exhibit a reduction in activity, suggesting that the effect was on lesion-induced hyperactivity rather than on activity, per se. Ganglioside-treated rats showed a slight, but consistently smaller lesion-induced sprouting response by the septodentate pathway than did untreated counterparts at all postlesion intervals examined (3, 5, 7, and 10 days). The present findings indicate that ganglioside treatments reduce the severity of the initial behavioral effects after entorhinal lesions without enhancing the sprouting by septodentate fibers.
