Although a large body of evidence shows that pretreatment of brain tissue with creatine protects against anoxic injury in vitro, only a couple of papers have investigated creatine protection in vivo, and they yielded conflicting results. We attempted to clarify how creatine may be protective in an in vivo model of global cerebral ischemia (GCI). We administered creatine either before of after GCI. We decided to administer it by intracerebroventricular infusion, to maximize its bioavailability to the brain. Our findings show that creatine is clearly protective in vivo when administered before ischemia. In that case, histological evaluation of damage was consistently improved in all regions examined, and neurological score was better in creatine-treated rats than in controls. When administered after ischemia, histology was improved in the hippocampus, while only a not significant trend toward improvement was observed in the cerebral cortex and in the caudo-putamen. Neurological score was not improved by creatine administration after GCI. Our findings show that creatine administration is protective in vivo. Such protection was clear in the case of pretreatment, and was present, to a lesser degree, when treatment was started after ischemia. Our results should encourage further research in the possible role of creatine therapy in neuroprotection.
