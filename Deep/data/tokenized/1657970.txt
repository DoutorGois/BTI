The venom of the North American funnel-web spider Agelenopsis aperta contains a variety of arylamine toxins (the alpha-agatoxins) that paralyze insects by blocking glutamatergic neuromuscular transmission. We have tested six synthetic alpha-agatoxins for their ability to antagonize glutamate receptor function in mammalian brain. These compounds produce, at submicromolar concentrations, noncompetitive inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated elevations in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium in cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons. In contrast, the alpha-agatoxins are relatively weak antagonists of elevations in the cytosolic free calcium concentration induced by non-NMDA receptor agonists. The alpha-agatoxins also produce reversible suppression of the NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential in rat hippocampal slices at concentrations that have little effect on the non-NMDA receptor-mediated population spike. We conclude that the alpha-agatoxins are selective and reversible noncompetitive antagonists at NMDA receptors in mammalian brain.
