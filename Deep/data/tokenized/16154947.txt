The in vitro effect of estradiol on flux of Ca(2+) in the synaptosomal mitochondria from nucleus caudatus and hippocampus of chronically ovariectomized female rats was examined. No effect of estradiol on Ca(2+) influx through ruthenium red-sensitive channels was found. Estradiol, at a concentration of 0.05-5 nmol/L for nucleus caudatus and 0.5-5 nmol/L for the hippocampus, decreased Na-dependent Ca(2+) efflux about 25%.
