The potential of repeated exposure to Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) to produce long-lasting changes in synaptic connections in a manner similar to other drugs of abuse was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. For 12 days, rats received two i.p. injections per day (8 h apart) of vehicle, a low dose of Delta(9)-THC (0.5 mg/kg), or escalating doses of Delta(9)-THC (0.5-4.0 mg/kg). Thirty days later, they were evaluated for sensitized locomotor activity (during the night cycle) for 60 min on each of three trials. Using a within-groups design, rats were tested following an injection of vehicle, 0.5 mg/kg Delta(9)-THC or 2.0 mg/kg Delta(9)-THC. The rats showed no evidence of sensitized locomotor activity in any group. Twenty-four hours after the final sensitization test, their brains were removed and then processed for Golgi-Cox staining. Prior exposure to Delta(9)-THC (both the low dose and the escalating doses) increased the length of the dendrites as well as the number of dendritic branches in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and in the medial prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus, striatum, orbital frontal cortex, parietal cortex, or occipital cortex. These results are similar to those evident in brains of rats sensitized to amphetamine, and support previous findings that cannabinoids promote DA activity in the mesolimbic DA system.
