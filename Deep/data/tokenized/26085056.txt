The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of maternal lead exposure on expression of GSK-3beta and IGF1R in the hippocampus of mice offspring. Lead exposure initiated from beginning of gestation to weaning. Lead acetate administered in drinking solutions was dissolved in distilled deionized water at the concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1%, respectively. On the 21st postnatal day, the Pb levels were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The expression of GSK-3beta and IGF1R in hippocampus was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The lead levels in blood and hippocampus of all lead exposure groups were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression of GSK-3beta was increased in lead-exposed groups (P < 0.05), but the expression of IGF1R was decreased (P < 0.05). The high expression of GSK-3beta and low expression of IGF1R in the hippocampus of pups may contribute to the neurotoxicity associated with maternal Pb exposure.
