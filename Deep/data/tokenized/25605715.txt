Recent studies have reported conflicting results regarding the role of ARF6 in dendritic spine development, but no clear answer for the controversy has been suggested. We found that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) either positively or negatively regulates dendritic spine formation depending on neuronal maturation and activity. ARF6 activation increased the spine formation in developing neurons, whereas it decreased spine density in mature neurons. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that ARF6 activation in each stage leads to opposite patterns of expression of a subset of genes that are involved in neuronal morphology. ARF6-mediated Rac1 activation via the phospholipase D pathway is the coincident factor in both stages, but the antagonistic RhoA pathway becomes involved in the mature stage. Furthermore, blocking neuronal activity in developing neurons using tetrodotoxin or enhancing the activity in mature neurons using picrotoxin or chemical long term potentiation reversed the effect of ARF6 on each stage. Thus, activity-dependent dynamic changes in ARF6-mediated spine structures may play a role in structural plasticity of mature neurons.
