The paper presents an attempt to define the structures of the cerebral functional pathologic system in the Korsakov's syndrome (KS) that develops after a severe craniocerebral trauma. 32 patients with reversible (21) and irreversible (11) KS variations were examined. Visual and coherent EEG-analysis was performed as well as determination of the three-dimensional location of the equivalent dipole sources of the separate pathologic components of the bioelectric activity. The data obtained were compared with the clinical ones. The role of both diencephalic and subcortical (including hippocampus) structures in KS development as well as the role of the right hemisphere were confirmed. Significance of the anterior (temporal-frontal-central) regions of the right hemisphere in KS regression was found. The degree of the injury of nonspecific frontal and brain stem structures and involvement of the left hemisphere into the pathological process together with the right one is essential for KS reversibility.
