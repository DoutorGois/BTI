Dendritic arbor formation and the underlying mechanisms are crucial for the functional connectivity and plasticity of neurons. We used a focal electric field to locally raise calcium levels in individual dendritic shafts of isolated hippocampal pyramidal neurons, in order to develop an accessible system for studying dendritic branch formation, and to test the role of calcium as an intrinsic signal that may participate in arborization. Filopodia were induced in a manner temporally and spatially related to induced calcium rises. Certain filopodia also thickened and were transformed into dendritic branches. These results suggest that calcium-mediated signaling can induce branching in dendrites, and describe an accessible system for studying the intracellular machinery that drives dendritic arborization.
