Oxidative stress has been considered as a central mechanism of toxicity induced by xenobiotics. Previously, it was demonstrated that mice exposed to tannery effluent showed an anxiety-like behavior, without any comparable behavioral effects in rats. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of tannery wastewater on oxidative status in in vitro and in vivo assays with two mammal species, mice and rats. Specifically, homogenates of two brain areas and the liver were incubated with tannery wastewater; reactive species and lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant enzyme activities were detected. In addition, the effects of in vivo exposure of mice to tannery effluents on and lipid peroxidation levels and the total reactive antioxidant capacity in brain areas and liver. Brain areas, the hippocampus and frontal cortex, and the liver of mice exposed to tannery wastewater showed oxidative stress. Our data suggest that divergent species-dependent hepatic enzymes adaptations, such as glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase activities, induced by tannery effluent could explain previous behavioral findings.
