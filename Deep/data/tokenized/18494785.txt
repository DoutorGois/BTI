While acute hippocampal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes have been demonstrated, the long-term structural consequence of status epilepticus remains unclear. Also the timing of previously reported fornix abnormalities in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is unknown. We report longitudinal volumetic MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) findings of the hippocampus and fornix in a patient following status epilepticus. Left hippocampal atrophy demonstrated progression beyond 6 months poststatus epilepticus while the right hippocampus and bilateral fornices demonstrated stable volumetric and diffusion abnormalities throughout the study. Our findings provide evidence that status epilepticus can induce permanent hippocampal damage with the delayed timing of the structural changes being consistent with programmed cell death.
