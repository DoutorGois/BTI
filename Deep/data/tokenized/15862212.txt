The impact of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) on anxiety-related behavior and related cerebral activation has facilitated the understanding of neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety. However, the influence of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on hippocampal neuronal development and neurochemistry, which is relevant to anxiety behavior, has not been investigated. In 38 healthy subjects, absolute concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) were measured as a main surrogate parameter for hippocampal neurochemistry on a 3-T scanner. A significantly lower hippocampal NAA concentration in s allele carriers was observed as compared to l/l genotype. Other metabolites (choline, creatine + phosphocreatine, glutamate) were unaffected by genotype. The hippocampal NAA concentration was negatively correlated with trait anxiety scores (STAI). Metabolites measured in the anterior cingulate cortex (reference region) were not associated with genotype. The results are in accordance with the recently reported relationship between hippocampal neuronal development and anxiety behavior in adult animals and show an association between human limbic neurochemistry and genetically driven serotonergic neurotransmission relevant to anxiety.
