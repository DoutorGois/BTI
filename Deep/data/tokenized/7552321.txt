In order to characterize the regional and cellular distribution patterns of individual ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptor subunits in the human hippocampus we performed an immunohistochemical analysis using the monoclonal antibody 3A11 to the AMPA GluR2(4) subunit. The study was based on paraffin embedded hippocampal specimens of five human brains obtained at autopsy. GluR2(4) immunoreactivity was consistently higher in hippocampus as compared to the adjacent areas of the mesial temporal lobe. Virtually all neurons showed intracytoplasmic staining of the perikarya and dendritic profiles with well defined laminar patterns. The most intense GluR2(4) immunoreactivity was observed in the target structures of mossy fibers, thus indicating that GluR2(4) AMPA subunits may be involved in NMDA-independent synaptic transmission pathways and long-term potentiation. Glial cells were not immunoreactive. These findings may provide basic information for studies of the GluR2(4) subunit in human hippocampus during various neuropathological conditions, such as temporal lobe epilepsy, ischemia and Alzheimer's disease.
