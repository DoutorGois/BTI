It is generally accepted that myelomeningocele frequently associates with Arnold-Chiari malformation and other anomalies of the intracranial structures. The ventriculographic and CT findings of the patients with myelomeningocele has been reported. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is useful to observe the coronal and sagittal images of the brain in order to speculate the etiological mechanism of myelomeningocele and its associated anomalies. We experienced three cases of myelomeningocele and reviewed their MR images using coronal and sagittal tomography in spin echo and inversion recovery technique. The morphological detail of MR images as to the intracranial structures was presented. Possible mechanism of the anomalous structures of the brain in myelomeningocele was also described.
