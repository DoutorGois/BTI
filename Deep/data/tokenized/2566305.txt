Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is accompanied by a number of changes on both sides of the synapse. It is now generally considered that the trigger for initiating LTP is the entry of calcium into the postsynaptic area through the NMDA-associated channel while the mechanism(s) underlying the maintenance of LTP are less well understood and probably involve contributions from both sides of the synapse.
