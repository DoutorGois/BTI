Exposure to stress during critical periods of an organism's maturation can result in permanent behavioral changes and induced hyper-responsive to aversive stimuli as adult. Hippocampus is a plastic and vulnerable brain structure that is susceptible to damage during aging and repeated stress. The present study examines the effect of maternal restraint stress on the level of GAP-43, pGAP-43 and synaptophysin in the hippocampus of rat pups. Prenatal stress (PS) causes a significant increase of GAP-43 and pGAP-43 (p<or=0.001) in the pup's hippocampus during postnatal days 7 and 14, but not at later ages. Up-regulation of GAP-43 and pGAP-43 may alter the pattern of axonal growth and synapses' formation in the pup's brain since the first two postnatal weeks are correlated with peak period of synaptogenesis in the rat brain. We also examined the level of synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle membrane protein, in the pup's brain. Our finding revealed that, PS causes a significant decrease of synaptophysin in the pup's hippocampus as compared to control (p<or=0.001). These changes are due to the direct effects of maternal stress hormone since repeated injection with corticosterone (CORT, 40 mg/kg) to pregnant rat during gestation days (GDs) 14-21 also gave the same results. Abnormal axonal sprouting and reorganization together with the alterations in synaptic vesicle membrane protein during the critical period of synaptogenesis may lead to a defect in synapse formation and axonal pruning in the hippocampus. These changes may be associated with stress-induced impairment of hippocampal function that occurs in later life of the offspring.
