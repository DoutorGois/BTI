MR structural T1-weighted imaging using high field systems (>3T) is severely hampered by the existing large transmit field inhomogeneities. New sequences have been developed to better cope with such nuisances. In this work we show the potential of a recently proposed sequence, the MP2RAGE, to obtain improved grey white matter contrast with respect to conventional T1-w protocols, allowing for a better visualization of thalamic nuclei and different white matter bundles in the brain stem. Furthermore, the possibility to obtain high spatial resolution (0.65 mm isotropic) R1 maps fully independent of the transmit field inhomogeneities in clinical acceptable time is demonstrated. In this high resolution R1 maps it was possible to clearly observe varying properties of cortical grey matter throughout the cortex and observe different hippocampus fields with variations of intensity that correlate with known myelin concentration variations.
