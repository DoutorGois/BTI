Anders Retzius (1796-1860), a renowned Swedish scientist, left important contributions to human and animal anatomy. He was the first to discover, in 1856, two small bulges as part of the medial segment of the hippocampal tail. These convolutions were named "gyri Andreae Retzii" by his son, Gustaf Retzius (1842-1919), in honor of their discoverer, his father. The gyri of Anders Retzius consist of a CA1 subfield and the subiculum. These areas feature marked connections with the entorhinal cortex and other hippocampal subfields. Only assumptions can be made at present regarding the physiological role of the gyri of Anders Retzius, in conjunction with the involvement of the CA1 hippocampal field in neuropathological conditions.
