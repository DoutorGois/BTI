MRT is of considerable significance in the investigation of epilepsy because of its ability to render soft tissue contrast for the demonstration of structural lesions. The present retrospective study consists of an analysis of MRT findings in operatively confirmed, circumscribed temporal tumours and in hippocampal sclerosis. The examinations were performed under standard conditions using T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo sequences of the head and coronal T2-weighted gradient-echo sequences of the brain stem. The diagnosis of tumours was extremely accurate (22/23) and specific (18/23) whereas hippocampal sclerosis could not be satisfactorily demonstrated (5/18). The use of intravenous contrast medium did not provide any advantages.
