In rabbits tested on behavioural reactions by electrical stimulation of certain limbic-midbrain structures, intravenous injection of substance P (30 mcg/kg) led after 10 min of silent period to a decrease of spontaneous neuronal activity in the frontal cortex. Convergence of excitations arising from the lateral hypothalamus, the dorsal hippocampus and the midbrain reticular formation was also found to decrease after the substance P injection. Analysis of neuronal responses allowed to establish that substance P markedly changed the ascending excitations of the lateral hypothalamus and was less effective for the influences from the midbrain reticular formation.
