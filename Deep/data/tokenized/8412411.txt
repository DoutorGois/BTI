The effect of neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment on learning and memory and on the levels of biogenic monoamines in some brain structures, as well as the influence of the nootropic drug adafenoxate on 6-OHDA effect was studied in shuttle box and step down trained rats. In mature rats injected with 6-OHDA postnatal, learning and retention were impaired and the noradrenaline (NA) level in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was decreased. Adafenoxate abolished the amnestic effect of 6-OHDA and restored the NA level to normal in the above-mentioned brain structures. This finding suggests the important role of the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system in 6-OHDA-induced amnesia and the favorable effect of adafenoxate on learning and memory impaired by 6-OHDA.
