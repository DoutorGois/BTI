The response of neurons in the preoptic and adjacent regions of the brain to intracarotid injection of hyperosmotic solutions was studied in 22 anesthetized cats. NaCl (0.5 M) caused a brisk acceleration of frequency lasting over 100 s in 120 of 207 units (58%). Glucose (2 M) and sucrose (2 M) had similar but smaller effects, and urea (2 M) was ineffective. Responding units were found in all parts of the preoptic region, the diagonal band of Broca (vertical limb), the lateral septal nucleus, nucleus accumbens and anterior hypothalamus.
