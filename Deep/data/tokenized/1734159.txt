Androgen receptor antibodies have recently been developed using fusion proteins containing fragments of human prostatic androgen receptor. We have used a polyclonal antibody raised in rabbits to label androgen receptors in brain sections from male and female rats and monkeys. Free-floating frozen sections were incubated in primary antibody, and processed by the peroxidase-avidin-biotin complex method using biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG. Nickel intensified diaminobenzidine was used as the chromagen, and neurons were labeled in the amygdala, hippocampus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, septum, preoptic area, in several hypothalamic nuclei including the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, in several brain stem motor nuclei and in cerebral cortex. Staining was most intense in cell nuclei but also occurred in cytoplasm and in some neuronal processes. Labeling was more restricted in monkey than in rat brain. Omitting the primary antibody or pre-incubating the primary antibody with rat prostatic cytosol for control purposes demonstrated the specificity of staining.
