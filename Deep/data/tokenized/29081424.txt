BACKGROUND: Due to spatial disorientation reported in space, spatial memory and navigation performances could be more largely impaired by gravity changes. Hippocampus, a key structure for spatial memory, receives inputs from gravity-sensing otolith organs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the key molecules in the rat hippocampus that contribute to an adaptation to altered gravity in terms of spatial memory performance. METHODS: Gene expression of hippocampus and spatial memory after continuous two-weeks exposure to 2 G hypergravity (HG) were examined using a microarray analysis followed by real-time PCR methods and radial arm maze testing, respectively. Serum cortisol levels during HG load were measured as a stress marker. RESULTS: Accuracy to enter the correct arms in HG rats was significantly lower than that of controls, indicating an impaired spatial memory due to gravity changes. Microarray analysis followed by real-time PCR confirmed an upregulation of insulin like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) gene. Serum cortisol level was the same level as controls at the last day of hypergravity, suggesting the adaptation to HG-induced stress. CONCLUSIONS: Given that the IGF systems are involved in neurotrophic and synaptic plasticity mechanisms, IGF system might contribute to the adaptation to altered gravity in terms of spatial memory.
