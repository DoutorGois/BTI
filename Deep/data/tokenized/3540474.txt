A simple, inexpensive and reliable microcomputer-assisted method to detect and quantify abnormal EEG spiking is described. High frequency wave forms (20-40 Hz) with high amplitude are discriminated using a beta-2 bandpass filter and a threshold comparater. The spikes are then compiled and reported by an Apple II+ microcomputer. The method was validated by measuring seizures generated by intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), by microinjection of excitatory amino acids into the dorsal hippocampus, and by the antagonism of these seizures by diazepam and 2-amino-7-phosphono heptanoic acid, respectively.
