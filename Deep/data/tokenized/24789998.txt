Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) self-assembles into insoluble fibrils, and forms the senile plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease. 3,3',4',5'-Tetrahydroxyflavone, a synthetic analogue of the natural flavonoid fisetin, has been found to potently inhibit Abeta fibril formation. In the present study, we investigated how inhibition of Abeta fibril formation by this flavonoid affects Abeta conformation and neurotoxicity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of Abeta1-42 (20 microM) incubated with or without 3,3',4',5'-tetrahydroxyflavone demonstrated that 3,3',4',5'-tetrahydroxyflavone (100 microM) rapidly caused formation of atypical Abeta conformers, which appeared as a very broad, smear-like band in the high molecular weight region and were distinguishable from soluble Abeta oligomers or mature Abeta fibrils. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that large spherical Abeta aggregates were preferentially formed in the presence of 3,3',4',5'-tetrahydroxyflavone. The SDS-resistant, smear-like band on SDS-PAGE and the large spherical aggregates in TEM both disappeared after heat treatment (100 degrees C, 10 min). Furthermore, a neurotoxicity assay with cultured rat hippocampal neurons demonstrated that Abeta incubated with 3,3',4',5'-tetrahydroxyflavone was significantly less toxic than Abeta incubated without the flavonoid. These results suggest that the newly synthesized fisetin analogue 3,3',4',5'-tetrahydroxyflavone directly produces atypical, large Abeta aggregates and reduces Abeta toxicity.
