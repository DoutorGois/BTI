Febrile seizures are the most common type of childhood seizures, affecting 2% to 5% of children. A complex febrile seizure is one with focal onset, one that occurs more than once during a febrile illness, or one that lasts more than 10 to 15 minutes. Confusion still exists on the proper evaluation of a child presenting with a complex febrile seizure. There are ongoing research attempts to determine the link between complex febrile seizures and epilepsy. Further clarification and understanding of this disorder would be of great benefit to primary care providers and child neurologists.
