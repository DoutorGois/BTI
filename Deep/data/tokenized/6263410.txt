Experimental and genetic hypertension in male rate is accompanied by a lower specific [3H]naloxone binding in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and in the hippocampus as compared to controls. Rats which are genetically resistant to hypertensive stimuli have a higher specific [3H]naloxone binding in the nucleus tractus solitarius and lower opiate receptor binding in the dorsal horn. Together with previous studies which demonstrated a correlation between blood pressure and pain sensitivity, these results support the notion that specific brain loci participate in co-regulation of pain perception and blood pressure.
