Aluminum (Al), oxidative stress and impaired cholinergic functions have all been related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study evaluates the effect of aluminum on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and lipid peroxidation in the mouse brain. Mice were loaded by gavage with Al 0.1 mmol/kg/day 5 days per week during 12 weeks. The mice were divided into four groups: (1) control; (2) 10 mg/mL of citrate solution; (3) 0.1 mmol/kg of Al solution; (4) 0.1 mmol/kg of Al plus 10 mg/mL of citrate solution. AChE activity was determined in the hippocampus, striatum, cortex, hypothalamus and cerebellum and lipid peroxidation was determined in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex. An increase of AChE activity was observed in the fourth group (Al + Ci) in the hippocampus (36%), striatum (54%), cortex (44%) and hypothalamus (22%) (p<0.01). The third group (Al) presented a decrease of AChE activity in the hypothalamus (20%) and an enhancement in the striatum (27%). Lipid peroxidation, measured by TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), was elevated in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex when compared with the control (p < 0.01). The effect of aluminum on AChE activity may be due to a direct neurotoxic effect of the metal or perhaps a disarrangement of the plasmatic membrane caused by increased lipid peroxidation.
