Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene that codes for fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). To determine if FMRP expression in the central nervous system could reverse phenotypic deficits in the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model of FXS, we used a single-stranded adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector with viral capsids from serotype 9 that contained a major isoform of FMRP. FMRP transgene expression was driven by the neuron-selective synapsin-1 promoter. The vector was delivered to the brain via a single bilateral intracerebroventricular injection into neonatal Fmr1 KO mice and transgene expression and behavioral assessments were conducted 22-26 or 50-56 days post injection. Western blotting and immunocytochemical analyses of AAV-FMRP-injected mice revealed FMRP expression in the striatum, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and cingulate cortex. Cellular expression was selective for neurons and reached approximately 50% of wild-type levels in the hippocampus and cortex at 56 days post injection. The pathologically elevated repetitive behavior and the deficit in social dominance behavior seen in phosphate-buffered saline-injected Fmr1 KO mice were reversed in AAV-FMRP-injected mice. These results provide the first proof of principle that gene therapy can correct specific behavioral abnormalities in the mouse model of FXS.
