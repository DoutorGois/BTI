Embryonic dentate fascia was transplanted into the somatosensory area of the neocortex of adult rats. Ultrastructural and morphometric analyses of giant synapses formed by the granule neurons of transplants with inappropriate neuronal targets in the recipient brains were performed after nine months. As compared with intact synaptic terminals in the control hippocampus, there were differences in the quantity and distribution of large synaptic vesicles with electron-dense centers storing neuropeptide cotransmitters. The proportion of peptidergic vesicles (of the total number of vesicles) in ectopic giant synapses was 5.8 +/- 0.6%, compared with 3.3 +/- 0.6% in controls. Accumulations of large, dense vesicles close to the active zones of aberrant connections were seen almost 7.9 times more often than in controls. These results show that neuropeptide transmitters are critical for maintaining synaptic connections between heterotopic dentate fascia transplants and recipient brains.
