Neurotrophic factors, including BDNF and NT-3, have been implicated in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity. Previous attempts to analyze synaptic transmission and plasticity in mice lacking the NT-3 gene have been hampered by the early death of the NT-3 homozygous knockout animals. We have bypassed this problem by examining synaptic transmission in mice in which the NT-3 gene is deleted in neurons later in development, by crossing animals expressing the CRE recombinase driven by the synapsin I promoter to animals in which the NT-3 gene is floxed. We conducted blind field potential recordings at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices from homozygous knockout and wild-type mice. We examined the following indices of synaptic transmission: (1) input-output relationship; (2) paired-pulse facilitation; (3) post-tetanic potentiation; and (4) long-term potentiation: induced by two different protocols: (a) two trains of 100-Hz stimulation and (b) theta burst stimulation. We found no difference between the knockout and wild-type mice in any of the above measurements. These results suggest that neuronal NT-3 does not play an essential role in normal synaptic transmission and some forms of plasticity in the mouse hippocampus.
