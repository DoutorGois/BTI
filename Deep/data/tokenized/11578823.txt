We examined the effect of propofol and thiopental, intravenous anesthetics, on the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I(H)), whose functional role on the neuronal activity has been evaluated. Whole-cell recordings of I(H) evoked by hyperpolarizing step pulses were taken from hippocampal CA1 neurons in rat brain slices. Propofol reduced I(H) current in a dose-dependent manner. However, thiopental had no significant effect on the activation of I(H). According to the functional role of I(H), the suppression of I(H) should result in a reduction of neuronal activity. We suggest that the effectiveness of propofol as an anticonvulsant or an antiemetic is associated with the blockade of the I(H) channel.
