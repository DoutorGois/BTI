Selenium (Se) is an essential mineral for mammals. It is a nutrient related to the complex metabolic and enzymatic functions. Although Se has important physiological functions in the cells, organic compounds of Se can be extremely toxic, and may affect the central nervous system. This study aims to investigate the effect of the chronic treatment with the vinyl chalcogenide 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(phenylseleno)oct-2-en-1-one on some parameters of oxidative stress in the brain of rats. Animals received the vinyl chalcogenide (125, 250 or 500 mug/kg body weight) intraperitoneally once a day during 30 days. The cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum were dissected and homogenized in KCl. Afterward, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), carbonyl, sulfhydryl, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were measured in the brain. Results showed that the organoselenium enhanced TBARS in the cerebral cortex of rats but the compound was not able to change carbonyl levels. Furthermore, the organoselenium reduced thiol groups measured by the sulfhydryl assay in all tissues studied. The activity of the antioxidant enzyme CAT was increased by the organochalcogen in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum, and the activity of SOD was increased in the hippocampus. On the other hand, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme GPx was reduced in all brain structures. Our findings indicate that this organoselenium compound induces oxidative stress in different brain regions of rats, corroborating to the fact that this tissue is a potential target for organochalcogen action.
