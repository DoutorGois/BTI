Heterosynaptic short-term depression (STD) of the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens inputs to the CA1 region was studied in rat hippocampal slices. STD was evoked by trains of 1050 impulses with interstimulus interval (ISI) variable from 10 to 700 ms. The STD was found to be very pronounced for tetanizations with ISI around 200 ms, and almost absent for ISI less than 50 ms or more than 500 ms. These data show that theta-like tetanization is an effective pattern not only for induction of the long-term potentiation (LTP), as has been shown previously, but for production of the heterosynaptic STD as well. This implies that heterosynaptic STD can effectively modulate induction of LTP by theta-like tetanization, and plays an important role in differentiation of potentiated pathways. It is discussed that the theta-like tetanization-induced release of ACh is a possible mechanism of the STD.
