Recent studies clearly indicate that long-term synaptic plasticity in hippocampal networks not only takes place at excitatory synapses of hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells, but also at excitatory synapses onto inhibitory interneurons. Various forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) have now been reported at glutamatergic synapses of interneurons in dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Importantly, the presence and type of these changes in synaptic efficacy appear to depend on the interneuron subtype, including its specific role within the hippocampal network. The data reviewed here suggest the existence of cell-type specific rules for synaptic plasticity in hippocampal feed-forward and feedback inhibitory networks. This specialized tuning of inhibition is likely important for global hippocampal function.
