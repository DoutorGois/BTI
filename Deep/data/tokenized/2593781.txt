The effects of deep prepyriform cortex (DPC) kindling on the amount of proenkephalin and prodynorphin mRNAs, Met5-enkephalin (ME) and dynorphin (DYN) in rat brain were examined. Animals received electrical stimulation of the DPC until two consecutive stage 2 seizures (S2) or stage 5 seizures (S5) were attained. The proenkephalin mRNA and ME contents in the entorhinal cortex were increased 24 h after S2 and also 5 min and 24 h post S5. In the hippocampus, the proenkephalin mRNA level was reduced 24 h after S2 but increased 5 min and 24 h after S5. Elevated hippocampal ME concentration was observed 24 h after S2 and S5. Similarly, the ME level in the frontal cortex was increased 24 h after S2 and S5 but the proenkephalin mRNA content was only elevated at S5. In the striatum, the proenkephalin mRNA level was slightly increased 24 h after S2 and S5, but no change in ME content was found. The amount of prodynorphin mRNA in the hippocampus was attenuated only at 24 h after S5, whereas DYN concentration was reduced 5 min after S5. No change in striatal DYN concentration was observed despite a slight elevation of prodynorphin mRNA 24 h post S2 and S5. Six weeks after the last seizure, no difference in ME and DYN was found between kindled and control animals. These findings indicate that the enkephalin-containing perforant pathway in the entorhinal cortex-hippocampal region is particularly sensitive to electrical stimulations applied to the DPC. Its role and importance in the development of kindling are discussed.
