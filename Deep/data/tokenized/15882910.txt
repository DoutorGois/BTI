Cholinergic axons originating from the septum form a characteristic layer of preterminal axons and apparent termination in the molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The present study explored the specificity of this characteristic axonal pattern, through the use of organotypic slice co-cultures. Slices of hippocampus were co-cultured with a slice from one of a variety of other potential sources of afferents, and the afferent axons were labeled histochemically or immunocytochemically to determine which afferents distribute within the dentate molecular layer in a pattern similar to that formed by septal cholinergic projections. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry demonstrated that cholinergic axons from septum, substantia innominata, and striatum all consistently targeted the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. AChE-labeled cholinergic axons from dorsal lateral pontine tegmentum and from spinal cord sometimes formed this pattern, while axons from the habenula failed to extend into the dentate gyrus. Immunocytochemically identified monoaminergic axons from the substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, and raphe extended into co-cultured hippocampus; each of these afferent systems displayed a prominent axonal plexus within the hilus of the dentate, but only the raphe axons projected prominently to the molecular layer. These data demonstrate that the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus provides an attractive target zone for some cholinergic and monoaminergic afferents, but not all. Commonalities between neuronal populations that preferentially project to the molecular layer in vitro may offer clues regarding the axon guidance mechanisms that normally direct cholinergic axons to target sites in the dentate gyrus molecular layer.
