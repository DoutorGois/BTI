BACKGROUND: Previous studies demonstrated the cytoprotective effect of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), a heat shock protein inducer, against ischemic insult or kainic acid (KA)-induced neuronal cell death. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt is thought to be an important factor that mediates neuroprotection. However, the signaling pathways in the brain in vivo after oral GGA administration remain unclear. METHODS: We measured and compared hippocampal neuron density to investigate the effect of GGA on KA-induced cell death in rats. We evaluated the effects of pretreatment with wortmannin (Wort), a specific PI3K inhibitor, on GGA-induced neuroprotection against KA-induced cell death. To clarify the relationship between PI3K/Akt activation and neuroprotection, we used immunoblot analysis to determine the amounts of p-Akt and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) proteins present after GGA administration with or without Wort treatment. RESULTS: Neuroprotective effects of GGA (pretreatment with a single oral dose of GGA, 800 mg/kg, 48 h before KA injection) were prevented by Wort pretreatment, which indicates that the selective PI3K/Akt pathway may mediate the GGA-dependent protection. Oral GGA-induced p-Akt and VEGF, and GGA pretreatment enhanced KA-induced VEGF, both of which were prevented by Wort pretreatment. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a single oral dose of GGA induces p-Akt and that GGA plays an important role in neuroprotection against KA-induced neuronal cell death through VEGF induction.
