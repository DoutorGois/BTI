Formation of encephalogenic shortened reflex in rabbits induced specific local changes of amplitudes of the 1-min waves. Etimizol rapidly stabilized the level of the 1-min waves and fixed the reflex, keeping the local character of the response. Propylnorantiphein enhanced corticofugal projections to the thalamus. The shifts in the brain energy exchange (the creatin--phosphate, glycogen contents) coincided in time with the amplitude shifts of the 1-min waves and occurred within 20--30 min after administration of neurotropic drugs lasting 2--3 hrs. The etimizol recruited both alpha-and beta-adrenoreceptors whereas the propylnorantiphein involved mainly the alpha-adrenoreceptors. Etimizol, being an unspecific connector, enhanced consolidation of the shortened reflex increasing the local response to electric stimulation, whereas propylnorantiphein aided to spreading of the responses over to the thalamic nuclei.
