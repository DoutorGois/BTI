The main objective of this study was to determine whether uncontrolled hyperglycemia, as a consequence of diabetes, altered the metabolism of acetylcholine (ACh) in rat brain. To accomplish this, rats received injections of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle, and were maintained for up to 7 weeks after the injections. Various indices of ACh metabolism were determined in striatum and hippocampus, two brain regions densely innervated by cholinergic neurons. STZ induced diabetes in 96% of the rats injected, as evidenced by glucose spillage into the urine within 48 hours. Serum glucose levels increased to 326% of control values by 1 week and remained at this level for the duration of the study. The steady-state concentrations of ACh and choline, determined in brain tissue from animals killed by head-focused microwave irradiation, did not differ between the control and STZ-injected groups. However, the synthesis and release of neurotransmitter by striatal slices, measured in vitro, decreased in a time-dependent manner. Although the basal release of ACh was unaltered at 1 week, neurotransmitter release decreased significantly by 21% at 5 weeks and by 26% at 7 weeks. The release of ACh evoked by incubation with 35 mM KCl was inhibited significantly by 20% at all time points studied. ACh synthesis by slices incubated under basal conditions decreased by 13% and 27% at 5- and 7-weeks, respectively, the latter significantly less than controls. Synthesis by striatal slices incubated with 35 mM KCl was inhibited by 17% at 7 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
