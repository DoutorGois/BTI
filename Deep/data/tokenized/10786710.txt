Changes in serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA), its major metabolite, in cerebral cortex, corpus striatum and hippocampus were investigated at 10th and 21st days of chronic ethanol ingestion in Wistar rats. Ethanol (7.2% v/v) was given to rats in a modified liquid diet. Biochemical analysis was performed in two groups of ethanol-treated and control rats (n = 6 for each group). Rats in each group were decapitated at the 10th and 21st days of ethanol consumption. Brains were removed and cerebral cortex, corpus striatum and hippocampus were dissected. 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were measured in respective brain regions by using high performance liquid chromatography. In cerebral cortex and corpus striatum, 5-HT levels were significantly lower than control at the 10th day of ethanol consumption. At the 21st day, the levels tended to remain low, but not significantly different statistically. In hippocampus, 5-HIAA levels were significantly higher than control at 10th day of ethanol consumption. Increased 5-HIAA level returned to control values at the 21 st day of ethanol consumption. Our results suggest that, 5-HT clearly seems to play a critical role in the brain at the 10th day of chronic ethanol consumption.
