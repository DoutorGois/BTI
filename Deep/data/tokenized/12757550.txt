The present study was conducted in order to reveal the effects of prenatal stress on the central stress regulation in domestic pigs by measuring changes in corticosteroid receptor binding and monoamine concentrations in different limbic brain regions. Pregnant sows were subjected to a restraint stress for 5 min daily during the last 5 weeks of gestation. Maternal stress resulted in a significantly higher number of glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus, but decreased glucocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamus of the offspring at the first postnatal day. No alterations of hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptors were found. There was also no significant effect of prenatal stress on the brain monoamine concentrations. Prenatally stressed piglets showed lower basal plasma cortisol and increased corticosteroid binding globulin concentrations at the third postnatal day indicating decreased free cortisol concentrations after birth. Morbidity and mortality during the suckling period were significantly increased in prenatally stressed litters, as shown by a higher frequency of diseased and died piglets per litter. In conclusion, the results indicate that in pigs restraint stress during late gestation affects the ontogeny of the foetal neuroendocrine feedback system with consequences for the regulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function and the vitality of the offspring.
