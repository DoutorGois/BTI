FPF1070 is an aqueous protein-free solution, which consists of 85% free amino acids and 15% small peptides. Our previous study showed a potent neurotrophic factor-like activity in cultured embryonic cells of dorsal root ganglia. The present study investigated whether FPF1070 regenerated the cholinergic cells in the medial septal nucleus after axonal transections by cutting the fimbria-fornix. Fimbrial transection reduced the number of septal cholinergic cells by 30 +/- 3.6%, compared with the number on contralateral sides at 4 weeks. Intraperitoneal injections of FPF1070 caused 49.9 +/- 6.3% of the cholinergic neurons to survive. Furthermore, the cell sizes of the cholinergic neurons were significantly different: 16.4 +/- 4.2 microns, 14.3 +/- 3.8 microns in FPF1070 treatment and vehicle treatment, respectively. These results indicated that FPF1070 prevents the degeneration and atrophy of impaired cholinergic neurons by systemic administration.
