Newborn rats were treated daily with thyroid hormone (TH) until postnatal day 12. In the adult animals we measured the densities of glutamatergic (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), kainic acid (KA)), cholinergic (muscarinic subtype 1 and 2 (M1, M2)), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic (GABA(A)) and serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(1A))) binding sites using quantitative receptor-autoradiography with tritiated ligands. In the TH-treated rats the KA binding site density was increased in the stratum oriens of cornu ammonis (CA)3, the terminal field of the infrapyramidal mossy fibers (IPMF). Densities of M2 and 5-HT(1A) were increased in the CA1 region. In contrast, binding site densities for NMDA in the entire hippocampus and for AMPA in the dentate gyrus were reduced, whereas binding site densities for M2 and GABA(A) remained unchanged. From this study we conclude that concomitant with the increase of the IPMF zone the density of the KA binding sites is specifically enhanced. In addition, we found a general shift from binding sites receiving cortical to those receiving subcortical input in the hippocampus.
