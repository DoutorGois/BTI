To determine the time course of nuclear DNA damage in the gerbil hippocampus following transient ischemia, brain sections 48, 72, 96 h and 7 days following 5 min ischemia were evaluated by a specific in situ labeling method of DNA breaks. After 72 h, only the neurons located in the medial part of the CA1 sector were labeled. And then, DNA damage extended to the lateral part of the sector with time.
