The review describes properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system of mammalians. Two pharmacologically different receptors--GABAA and GABAB--are involved into GABA-ergic inhibition. GABA receptors (bicuculline-sensitive) regulate chloride permeability of membranes and can be functionally enhanced by benzodiazepine and barbiturate. GABA receptors (bicuculline-insensitive) are suggested to regulate calcium permeability.
