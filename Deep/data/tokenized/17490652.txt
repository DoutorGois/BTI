Caloric restriction (CR) extends life span and ameliorates the aging-related decline in hippocampal-dependent cognitive function. In the present study, we compared subunit levels of NMDA and AMPA types of the glutamate receptor and quantified total synapses and multiple spine bouton (MSB) synapses in hippocampal CA1 from young (10 months), middle-aged (18 months), and old (29 months) Fischer 344xBrown Norway rats that were ad libitum (AL) fed or caloric restricted (CR) from 4 months of age. Each of these parameters has been reported to be a potential contributor to hippocampal function. Western blot analysis revealed that NMDA and AMPA receptor subunits in AL animals decrease between young and middle age to levels that are present at old age. Interestingly, young CR animals have significantly lower levels of glutamate receptor subunits than young AL animals and those lower levels are maintained across life span. In contrast, stereological quantification indicated that total synapses and MSB synapses are stable across life span in both AL and CR rats. These results indicate significant aging-related losses of hippocampal glutamate receptor subunits in AL rats that are consistent with altered synaptic function. CR eliminates that aging-related decline by inducing stable NMDA and AMPA receptor subunit levels.
