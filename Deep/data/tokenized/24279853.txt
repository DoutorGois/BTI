AIM: This study aims to identify novel genes associated with major depressive disorder and pharmacological treatment response using animal and human mRNA studies. MATERIALS & METHODS: Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to uncover genes associated with stress factors in mice and to inform mRNA probe set selection in a post-mortem study of depression. RESULTS: A total of 171 genes were found to be differentially regulated in response to both early and late stress protocols in a mouse study. Ten human genes, orthologous to mouse genes differentially expressed by stress, were also found to be dysregulated in depressed cases in a human post-mortem brain study from the Stanley Foundation Brain Collection. CONCLUSION: Several novel genes associated with depression were uncovered, including NOVA1 and USP9X. Moreover, we found further evidence in support of hippocampal neurogenesis and peripheral inflammation in major depressive disorder.
