Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on an infant with typical complex partial seizures. Visual analysis revealed MRI signs of left hippocampal sclerosis (HS) at an age of 9 months. Morphometric data including volumetry and relaxometry confirming the diagnosis are shown. This is the first report of an infant younger than 2 years with typical MRI findings including morphometric data on HS.
