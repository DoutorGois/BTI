Two recent studies provided new evidence on the latency of HSV-1 DNA in 15.5% of olfactory bulbs and in 72.5% of trigeminal nerves from human corpses at forensic postmortems (1) and in 35% of 40 autopsied human brains (2). In the latter brains, latent HSV-1 DNA was found in the olfactory bulbs, amygdala, hippocampus, brain stem, and trigeminal ganglia. Although in these studies it is not known by which route HSV-1 entered the olfactory bulbs and brain, experimental studies in mice (3) revealed that injection of HSV-1 into the olfactory bulbs leads to virus migration into the brain amygdala and hippocampus via the olfactory nerve and locus coeruleus. If the olfactory ciliary nerve epithelium is the port of entry of HSV-1 into the olfactory bulbs and brain in humans as well, protection of the nose against HSV-1 infection may be needed to prevent virus latency in neurons in the amygdala and hippocampus (3). Infection of humans by HSV-1 was estimated to increase from 18.2% in the 0-20 year population group to 100% in persons older than 60 years (1), indicating that worldwide human populations at all ages are at risk of brain infection by the olfactory nerve route. In addition, both primary infection and reactivation of latent DNA in the brain may lead to damage of neurons in the brain involved in memory, learning, and behavior, as observed in infected, acyclovir-treated mice (3). The current introduction of a live apathogenic varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine to immunize children against chickenpox (4) may suggest that the time is ripe for immunization of children and adults against HSV-1 infections, especially infections by the olfactory nerve route, to prevent potential brain damage.
