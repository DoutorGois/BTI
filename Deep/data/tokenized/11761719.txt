The vacuolation (spongiform change) and prion protein (PrP) deposition were quantified in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of 11 patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). The density of the vacuolation, averaged over patients, was greatest in the occipital cortex and cerebellum and least in the dentate gyrus. The degree of PrP deposition was similar in the different cortical areas and in the cerebellum but significantly lower in the hippocampus and absent in the dentate gyrus. There were no significant differences in the extent of the vacuolation and PrP deposition in the upper and lower cortical laminae. Vacuolation and PrP deposition in the upper cortex were both positively correlated with corresponding levels in the lower cortex. In addition, in the parietal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, the density of the vacuolation was positively correlated with the level of PrP deposition but no such correlations were observed in the remaining areas studied. This quantitative study suggested that: (1) the pathological changes were most severe in the occipital cortex and cerebellum, while the hippocampus was least affected, (2) the pathological changes affect the upper and lower cortical laminae, and (3) the degree of correlation between the density of the vacuolation and PrP deposition may be dependent on brain region.
