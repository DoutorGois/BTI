TTC-909 is a newly developed isocarbacyclin methyl ester (TEI-9090) incorporated in lipid microspheres. The neuroprotective effect of TTC-909 was histologically examined in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus CA1 subfield 7 days after transient forebrain ischemia using stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. TTC-909, given intravenously 10 min after the transient forebrain ischemia, dose-dependently protected against ischemia-related delayed neuronal death. The blood pressure remained unchanged following TTC-909 administration. This finding suggests that TTC-909 has a neuroprotective action on ischemic delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus.
