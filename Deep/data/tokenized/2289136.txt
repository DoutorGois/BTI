Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized, among other pathological alterations, by an extensive synapse loss. Brain spectrin is a membrane skeleton protein found in synapses, and its immunoreactivity has been shown to increase in the rat model of denervation. In order to test the hypothesis that there is an increase in brain spectrin immunoreactivity in relation to the synapse pathology in AD, we studied brain sections and homogenates from AD and control cases and found increased anti-brain spectrin immunostaining of neurons, fibers, and plaques, with a relative decrease in the granular pattern of neuropil immunoreactivity. Western blot analysis showed a 25% increase in the 150 kDa bands (degradation products) in the cytosolic fraction and a decrease in the 240 kDa band (intact brain spectrin) in the particulate fraction. Altered immunostaining of brain sections and Western blot was not observed with an antibody against red blood cell spectrin demonstrating the specific change of brain spectrin. These results support the contention that increased brain spectrin immunoreactivity is a marker of synapse or neuronal loss and further supports the concept of synapse pathology in AD.
