The pattern of neuronal injury following lateral fluid-percussion (FP) brain injury in the rat was systematically characterized at sequential time points to identify selectively vulnerable regions and to determine the temporal contribution of primary and delayed neuropathological events. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 28) were killed 10 min, 2 h, 12 h, 24 h, 4 days, and 7 days following a lateral FP brain injury of moderate severity (2.2 atm), or 24 h after a sham injury. Brain sections were stained and analyzed using Nissl, acid fuchsin, and silver staining methods to identify regions with injured neurons or with visible lesions. Extensive numbers of acid fuchsin or silver-stained neurons were observed as early as 10 min after the FP brain injury in regions extending from the caudate/putamen to the pons. The frequency of injured neurons was greatest in the ipsilateral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, and a visible loss of Nissl-stained neurons was observed in these regions beginning at 12 h after the FP brain injury. Acid fuchsin-stained neurons were restricted to the same brain regions for all of the survival periods and gradually decreased in numbers between 24 h and 7 days after injury. These findings suggest that lateral FP brain injury in the rat produces a combination of focal cortical contusion and diffuse subcortical neuronal injury, which is present within minutes of the impact, progresses to a loss of neurons by 12 h, and does not markedly expand into other brain regions with survival periods up to 7 days. Furthermore, the acute onset and rapid evolution of the neuronal injury process may have important implications when considering a window of opportunity for pharmacological intervention.
