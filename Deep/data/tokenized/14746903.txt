We developed a screening methodology to test the ability of putative antiepileptic drugs delivered directly to a seizure focus to prevent epileptiform activity. The left hippocampi of 15 rats were implanted with an injection cannula and bipolar recording electrodes. Bone screws were used to record neocortical EEG activity. Diazepam (DZP) at one of four possible concentrations or control solution was injected into the hippocampus, followed 5 min later by bicuculline methiodide. DZP suppressed spikes and ictal events in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.0001). At 100 mM, DZP reduced spikes from 678+/-128 to 87+/-35 for a 15 min segment. Numbers of ictal events (seizure) and latency to the first event were reduced by prophylactic DZP. The study establishes a protocol for testing of intracranially-injected drugs to prevent focal seizures.
