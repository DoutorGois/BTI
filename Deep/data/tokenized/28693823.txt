With improvements in survival for good performance status patients and in specific molecular subtypes of glioblastoma, some patients will survive to develop significant neurocognitive dysfunction. This retrospective planning study quantified hippocampal radiation doses in patients with glioblastoma receiving radical chemo-radiotherapy and compared this with the radiation doses that showed clinical correlation with neurocognitive dysfunction, and evaluated the potential for clinically meaningful hippocampal dose reduction using helical TomoTherapy((R)).
