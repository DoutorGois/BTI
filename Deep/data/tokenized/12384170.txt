The objective of this study was to compare nAChR-mediated neurotransmitter release from slices of rat striatum, frontal cortex and hippocampus following chronic (-)-nicotine (Nic) administration (tartrate salt, 2 mg/kg twice daily for 10 days). Binding studies were also conducted to measure changes in receptor density. Relative to saline-treated animals, the number of nAChRs measured by [(3)H]-cytisine (CYT) binding was significantly increased in all brain regions examined by 15% to 25% following chronic Nic administration. Using a relatively high throughput method to measure neurotransmitter release, we found that Nic, CYT, and (+/-)-epibatidine (EB) evoked similar concentration-dependent striatal [(3)H]-dopamine (DA) and hippocampal [(3)H]-norepinephrine (NE) release from both saline (rank order of potency for [(3)H]-DA: EB>CYT>Nic; pEC(50) values, EB (9 +/- 0.1), CYT (8 +/- 0.13), Nic (7.3 +/- 0.19); rank order potency for [(3)H]-NE: EB>Nic=CYT; pEC(50) values, EB (8 +/- 0.18), Nic (5.5 +/- 0.09), CYT (5.12 +/- 0.1)) -and Nic-treated animals (pEC(50) values [(3)H]-DA, EB (9.5 +/- 0.15), Nic (8 +/- 0.16, CYT (6.6 +/- 0.52); [(3)H]-NE, EB (8.4 +/- 0.23), Nic (5.19 +/- 0.1), CYT (5.18 +/- 0.29)). Although no change in potency was detected between the two treatment groups, the agonist efficacies in both tissues were significantly reduced by approximately 17-54% following chronic Nic administration. In contrast to striatum, treatment with Nic did not affect the maximal [(3)H]-DA response (efficacy) in the frontal cortex. However, as observed in the striatum, no change in agonist potency was observed in the frontal cortex following chronic Nic administration (pEC(50) values, saline; EB (9.2 +/- 0.2), >CYT (6.95 +/- 0.75) = Nic (6.9 +/- 0.16); Nic-treated, EB (9 +/- 0.42)>CYT (6.88 +/- 0.27) = Nic (7.1 +/- 0.17)). Chronic Nic treatment did not significantly affect KCl-evoked [(3)H]-NE release from hippocampus or [(3)H]-DA release from frontal cortex or striatum. Since previous work has demonstrated that different nAChR subtypes display various sensitivities to chronic Nic exposure, we suggest that the subtypes of nAChRs involved in regulating [(3)H]-DA release may be different in the striatum and frontal cortex. These results support findings from earlier studies comparing the pharmacology of nAChR-evoked striatal versus cortical [(3)H]-DA release.
