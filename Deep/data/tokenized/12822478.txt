We attempted to investigate whether morphological features as shown on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predict response to donepezil treatment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sixty-three patients with AD were divided into responders (n = 16) and non-responders (n = 47) based on the changes in the MMSE score between baseline and endpoint. Atrophy of the substantia innominata was more pronounced in responders than non-responders. Although no significant difference in the medial temporal lobe atrophy between responders and non-responders was found, magnetization transfer ratios (MTRs) of the hippocampus and parahippocampus, indicators of structural damage, in the non-responder group were significantly reduced compared to those in the responder group. There were no significant differences in the severity of white matter lesions between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the overall discrimination rate was 81%, with 85% of non-responders and 69% of responders, through measurement of the thickness of the substantia innominata and MTR of the hippocampus and parahippocampus. These results suggest that AD patients who show more severe cholinergic dysfunction and less severe structural damage of the hippocampus and parahippocampus as shown on MRI are likely to respond to donepezil treatment.
