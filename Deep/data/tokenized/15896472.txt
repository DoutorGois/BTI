We have previously shown that prenatal morphine exposure inhibited the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and altered the hypothalamic metabolism of serotonin during the early postnatal period in the rat and induced a chronic sympathoadrenal hyperactivity under resting conditions in adult male rats. In this study, we examined the effects of prenatal morphine exposure on the responsiveness to an acute ether inhalation stress of the sympathoadrenal and HPA axis and the hippocampal and hypothalamic concentrations of serotonin (5HT) and 5-hydroxylindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) in 3-month-old male rats. The plasma levels of adrenocorticopic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (B) did not differ between the two groups both under resting conditions and after ether exposure. Ether inhalation increased adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) mRNA expression as well as adrenal epinephrine (E) concentration in control rats but not in prenatally morphine-exposed (PM) animals. Under basal conditions, hypothalamic concentrations of 5HT and 5HIAA increased in PM animals. In contrast to control animals, PM rats showed, in response to stress, an increased level of 5HT and 5HIAA in both the hypothalamus and in the hippocampus. In conclusion, prenatal morphine exposure produces long-lasting alterations in brain serotonin transmission and in the sympathoadrenal responsiveness to an acute systemic stress.
