Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons are important for the study of trace elements in epileptogenesis. We developed a model system for culturing hippocampal neurons on poly-L-lysine in Iscove's modification of Dulbecco's MEM (IMDM) supplemented with K+, D-glucose, glutamine, insulin, p-amino benzoic acid, transferrin, BSA, beta-estradiol, gentamycin, and fungizone. Neurons were identified by histochemical staining for cholinesterase. Zinc at concentrations of 10(-9) to 10(-6) M induced metallothionein in hippocampal neuronal cultures. Maximum metallothionein induction occurred after 48 hrs incubation with zinc.
