The effect of opioids on delayed neuronal death was evaluated in the gerbil hippocampus. Male Mongolian gerbils were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia and neuronal density was evaluated in the hippocampus 7 days following ischemia. When hypothermia during and after ischemia was prevented, treatment with morphine, U-50488H, or naloxone provided no significant protection. In contrast, a spontaneous drop in rectal temperature to 32 degrees C at the end of ischemia produced near-complete protection of CA1 pyramidal neurons. No opioids modulate the protective effect of hypothermia.
