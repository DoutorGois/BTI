BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Butein, 3,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone, has various pharmacological effects. However, no study has demonstrated the specific neurobiological mechanisms of the effects of butein in neuronal cells. The present study examined the role of butein as an antioxidative and anti-inflammatory inducer of haem oxygenase 1 (HO1) in mouse hippocampal HT22, BV2 microglial and primary mouse hippocampus neurons. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the neuroprotective effects of butein on glutamate-induced HT22 cell and primary mouse hippocampal neuron death and its anti-neuroinflammatory effects on LPS-induced activation of BV2 cells. We elucidated the underlying mechanisms by assessing the involvement of NF-kappaB, HO1, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Akt signalling. KEY RESULTS: Butein decreased cellular oxidative injury and the production of ROS in glutamate-treated HT22 cells and primary mouse hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, butein suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory enzymes and mediators in BV2 microglia. Butein inhibited IL-6, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha production and mRNA expression. In addition, butein decreased NO and PGE2 production and inducible NOS and COX-2 expression through the NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Butein up-regulated Nrf2/ARE-mediated HO1 expression through the PI3K/Akt pathway and this was positively associated with its cytoprotective effects and anti-neuroinflammatory actions. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that butein effectively prevents glutamate-induced oxidative damage and LPS-induced activation and that the induction of HO1 by butein through the PI3K/Akt pathway and Nrf2 activation appears to play a pivotal role in its effects on neuronal cells. Our results provide evidence for the neuroprotective properties of butein.
