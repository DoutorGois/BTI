In neurons from rat hippocampus, VIP induces the elongation of dendrites. In the present study, we have investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons whether VIP changed the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton in dendrites. VIP caused the elongation of dendrites and induced the outgrowth of microtubules, so that they extended up to the tips. In contrast, VIP reduced the F-actin content measured as total pixel after phalloidin staining in dendritic tips. These results suggest that VIP causes dendrite elongation by facilitating the outgrowth of microtubules into the newly formed extensions.
