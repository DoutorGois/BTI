NMDA receptor dysfunctions are hypothesized to underlie the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and treatment with D-serine (D-Ser), an NMDA receptor coagonist, may improve the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, upregulating the synaptic D-Ser level is a novel strategy for schizophrenia treatment. Na(+) -independent alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 1 (asc-1) is a transporter responsible for regulating the extracellular D-Ser levels in the brain. In this study, we discovered a novel asc-1 inhibitor, (+)-amino(1-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)acetic acid (ACPP), and assessed its pharmacological profile. ACPP inhibited the D-[(3) H]Ser uptake in human asc-1-expressing CHO cells and rat primary neurons with IC50 values of 0.72 +/- 0.13 and 0.89 +/- 0.30 muM, respectively. In accordance with the lower asc-1 expression levels in astrocytes, ACPP did not inhibit D-Ser uptake in rat primary astrocytes. In a microdialysis study, ACPP dose dependently decreased the extracellular D-Ser levels in the rat hippocampus under the same conditions in which the asc-1 inhibitor S-methyl-L-cysteine (SMLC) increased it. To obtain insights into this difference, we conducted a D-[(3) H]Ser efflux assay using asc-1-expressing CHO cells. ACPP inhibited D-[(3) H]Ser efflux, whereas SMLC increased it. These results suggest that ACPP is a novel inhibitor of asc-1. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
