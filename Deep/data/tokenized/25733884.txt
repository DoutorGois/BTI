Both hippocampal place fields and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) grid fields increase in scale along the dorsoventral axis. Because the connections from MEC to hippocampus are topographically organized and divergent, it has been hypothesized that place fields are generated by a Fourier-like summation of inputs over a range of spatial scales. This hypothesis predicts that inactivation of dorsal MEC should cause place field expansion, whereas inactivation of ventral MEC should cause field contraction. Inactivation of dorsal MEC caused substantial expansion of place fields; however, as inactivations were made more ventrally, the effect diminished but never switched to contraction. Expansion was accompanied by proportional decreases in theta power, intrinsic oscillation frequencies, phase precession slopes, and firing rates. Our results are most consistent with the predicted loss of specific Fourier components coupled with a path integration gain reduction, which raises the overall place field scale and masks the contraction expected from ventral inactivations.
