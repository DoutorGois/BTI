Earlier reports from our laboratory have indicated that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) affect signal transduction mechanisms in brain, including Ca2+ homeostasis, phosphoinositol hydrolysis, and protein kinase C (PKC) translocation in mature neurons and adult brain homogenate preparations. Present studies were designed to investigate whether there were any brain region-, gender-, or age-dependent effects of PCBs on 45Ca2+-uptake by two subcellular organelles, microsomes and mitochondria. We have studied in vitro effects of a widely studied commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1254R, on 45Ca2+-uptake by microsomes and mitochondria in cerebellum, frontal cortex and hippocampus of postnatal day (PND) 7, 21, and 90-120 (adult) male and female Long-Evans (LE)-rats. In general, microsomal and mitochondrial 45Ca2+-uptake in selected brain regions increased with age; PND 7<PND 21< or =adults. Among three brain regions, hippocampus had relatively lower microsomal 45Ca2+-uptake than cerebellum and frontal cortex throughout the development. Mitochondrial 45Ca2+-uptake was comparable in three brain regions of PND 7 and adult animals, but in PND 21 rats, the cerebellum had much higher activity than frontal cortex and hippocampus. No gender-related differences were seen in 45Ca2+-uptake by either microsomes or mitochondria in selected brain regions throughout development. Inhibition of 45Ca2+-uptake by Aroclor 1254 in a concentration-dependent manner was observed throughout the study. However, the degree of inhibition of microsomal 45Ca2+-uptake in these brain regions by Aroclor 1254 increased with age, PND 7<PND 21< or =adults (IC50s=21-34, 8-20 and 10-14 microM, respectively). Brain region-specific differential sensitivity to Aroclor 1254 on the inhibition of microsomal 45Ca2+-uptake was not seen in PND 7 and adult animals but in PND 21 rats, hippocampus was more sensitive than the other selected brain regions. There were no age-, gender- or brain region-specific differential effects of Aroclor 1254 on mitochondrial 45Ca2+-uptake. These results indicate that a commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1254, inhibited 45Ca2+-uptake by both microsomes and mitochondria uniformly in selected brain regions of males and females during development. However, the inhibition of microsomal 45Ca2+-uptake by Aroclor 1254 increased with age. The age- and gender-related differential sensitivity to Aroclor 1254 may be attributed to the changes in calcium homeostasis in various brain regions during development.
