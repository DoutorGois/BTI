Processing the evoked potentials of neurons with a computer can greatly increase the efficiency of data processing and obtain much more information from the data. Besides, it renders possibility of large quantities and prolonged observation. In this system, DMA mode is used for data transfer from A/D card to the computer, so total processing program including sampling subroutine was made in BASIC language. This article introduces the functions of this program in processing data and the technique in making this program.
