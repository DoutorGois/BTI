OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of low-frequency electric stimulus (LFS) on hippocampal of alpha5 subunit of extrasynaptic GABAA receptor in kainic acid-induced epilepsy rats and explore the possible mechanism of LFS on hippocampus to treat epilepsy. METHODS: A total of 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into 4 groups:epileptic, pseudo-surgery, LFS treatment and control. The expression of alpha5 subunit of extrasynaptic GABAA receptor and the association with the curative effects of LFS were evaluated by behavioristics, real-time fluorogenic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot. RESULT: After treatment, the number of seizures in LFS group were significantly lower than that in the epileptic and pseudo-surgery groups (2.88 +/- 0.83 vs 8.50 +/- 0.93 and 8.88 +/- 0.83) (P < 0.01). The results of real-time PCR demonstrated that the expression of mRNA of alpha5 subunits in LFS treatment group was obviously higher than that in epileptic and pseudo-surgery groups (0.74 +/- 0.20 vs 0.30 +/- 0.16 and 0.31 +/- 0.16) (P < 0.01), but was lower than 1.10 +/- 0.23 in control group. Western blot demonstrated that the protein expression of alpha5 subunits in LFS (0.75 +/- 0.09) and control (0.88 +/- 0.09) groups were dramatically higher than that in epileptic (0.22 +/- 0.08) and pseudo-surgery (0.26 +/- 0.08) groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Low-frequency electric stimulus on hippocampus is effective in controlling epileptic seizures. And the mechanism may be related with the expression level of alpha5 subunits of extrasynaptic GABAA receptor.
