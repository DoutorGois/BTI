The mechanisms underlying brain seizure tolerance, a phenomenon in which brief periods of seizures protect brain against the lethal effects of subsequent sustained seizures, are poorly understood. Because brain seizure tolerance and brain ischemia tolerance likely share certain common mechanisms, the recent evidence that activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 kinase pathways plays a critical role in ischemic preconditioning suggests that a similar mechanism may underlie brain seizure tolerance. We investigated the hypothesis in a rat kainic acid preparation of seizure preconditioning and tolerance, which was established by induction of one episode of priming epileptic status lasting for 20 min on the first day and another episode of sustained epileptic status lasting for 2 hr on the second day. We observed that acute seizures lead to a rapid activation of ERK and p38 in the hippocampal CA3 area, the brain region most susceptible to the lethal effects of epileptic status. Pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 and the p38 inhibitor SB203580 selectively reduces seizure-elicited activation of ERK and p38, respectively, and significantly reduces priming seizure-induced protection of CA3 neurons. These findings indicate that, similar to brain ischemia tolerance, brain seizure tolerance also involves the ERK and p38 signaling pathways.
