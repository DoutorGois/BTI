Sex differences, laterality, and hormonal regulation of androgen receptor (AR) immunoreactivity in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were examined using the PG21 antibody. Adult male rats were either castrated or sham-operated at least 2 weeks prior to sacrifice. Gonadally intact females were sacrificed on the day of proestrus. Animals received an injection of either testosterone propionate (TP) or vehicle 2 h prior to sacrifice. Within CA1, both the intensity of staining and the number of AR+ cells were assessed. AR immunostaining was detected in all the groups with marked variation among them. The overall ranking of staining intensity was: gonadally intact males > females given TP > castrated males given TP > females > castrated males given vehicle. The number of AR+cells within subregions of CA1 showed the same basic pattern: among control-treated animals, gonadally intact males have more than females, but castrated males have the least, and acute TP treatment increases the number in both sexes. The increased level of AR immunoreactivity in CA1 of castrated males following acute TP treatment suggests that testicular androgens in adulthood normally increase AR immunoreactivity there, producing a sex difference favoring males in gonadally intact animals. We also found a higher number of AR+ CA1 cells on the left than on the right, but only in gonadally intact males and in females given TP. These results suggest that a laterality of AR distribution in the rat hippocampus may lead to lateralities in hippocampal structure and function.
