Extracellular field potential recordings from the CA3 region in guinea pig hippocampal slices were used to study the release and action of dynorphin at the mossy fiber synapse. Dynorphin A(1-17) or U69593 inhibited mossy fiber synaptic responses in preparations in which the CA3 region was surgically isolated from the rest of the hippocampus. This inhibition was completely reversed by the kappa 1 selective antagonist nor-BNI, thus establishing the presence of functional kappa 1 receptors in CA3. Inhibitory effects of dynorphin on mossy fiber responses were unaltered in the presence of the N- or P-type Ca2+ channel blockers, omega-CgTx or omega-Aga IVA, respectively. This indicates that the action of dynorphin is independent of the particular type of Ca2+ channel that mediates transmitter release at the mossy fiber terminal. Heterosynaptic inhibition of mossy fiber responses was observed in the presence of nifedipine, omega-CgTx, or omega-Aga IVA, indicating that dynorphin release does not depend specifically on L-, N-, or P-type Ca2+ channels. The blockade of heterosynaptic inhibition by the membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator EGTA-AM suggests the involvement of a slow Ca(2+)-dependent process in dynorphin release. On the basis of a variety of experimental evidence, we propose that the time course of heterosynaptic inhibition is determined primarily by the time course of clearance of dynorphin in the extracellular space.
