The membrane currents responsible for the sustained potential shifts associated with electrographic seizures and with spreading depression in hippocampus were studied in the anesthetized rat. Probes incorporating 16 sensors in a straight line, spaced at 150-microns distances, were recording the potential changes with DC-coupled amplifiers in CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) of one hemisphere. Seizures and spreading depression were provoked by repetitive stimulation of different afferent pathways. Seizures always began in DG before CA1, regardless of the pathway stimulated. Tonic seizures were associated with a sustained negative potential shift that was largest in the cell body layers. Current source density was computed from these recordings and confirmed the presence of a current sink limited to the cell body layer throughout the duration of electrographic seizures. Spreading depression was associated with a very large sink located in the layer of apical dendrites, maximal among the proximal segment of dendrites, to which the cell body layer served as a source. We conclude that seizures are associated with an inward current in neuron cell bodies, probably flowing through membrane channels of as yet no know physiological function.
