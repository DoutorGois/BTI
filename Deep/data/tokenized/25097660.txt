Xiao Yao San (XYS) is a classical Chinese medicine formula that has been widely used to treat mood disorders for hundreds of years. To confirm the effect of XYS and better understand its underlying mechanism, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis-based quality control of XYS extracts and proteomics-based identification of differential proteins in the hippocampus were adopted in social isolation and chronic unpredictable mild stress- (CUMS-) treated rats. The depressive-like behavior of rats induced by CUMS resembled the manifestation of human depression. The upregulated corticosterone (CORT) and urocortin 2 (UCN2) levels demonstrated the existence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity. XYS was effective in ameliorating the depressive-like behavior and downregulating UCN2 and CORT. XYS decreased the expression of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A subunit B and increased the expression of beta-arrestin 2. The expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were also elevated by XYS. In conclusion, XYS improves social isolation and CUMS-induced depressive-like behavior and ameliorates HPA hyperactivation through the downregulation of corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) receptor 2. The upregulation of BDNF/TrkB and the phosphorylation of mTOR require beta-arrestin 2 as a scaffold to regulate stress signaling.
