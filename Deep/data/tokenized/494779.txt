The spectral-correlation analysis of biopotentials in the cortex and some other brain structures (the anteroventral thalamic nucleus, dorsal hippocampus, lateral geniculate body, mid-brain reticular formation), in chronic experiments on alert rabbits, revealed that during electrical stimulation of thalamic mid-line nuclei within the ranges of 1-3, 4-7 and 8-10 c/s, there occured a rearrangement of the EEG frequencies; a dominant, narrow-band peak at the stimulation frequency, appeared. The coherence of the biopotentials of different cortical areas, of the cortex and subcortical formations increased during the stimulation at the frequency of the stimulation, reaching maximum values between the potentials of the visual and sensorimotor cortical areas.
