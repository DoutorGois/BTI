In the brain of the hagfish Myxine glutinosa the distribution of acetylcholinesterase has been studied in serial cryostat sections. High activity was found in the motor column of the brain stem, in the pars ventralis thalami and in the primordium hippocampi. In the hemispheres and the olfactory bulb the ACHE-content is low.
