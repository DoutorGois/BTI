Previously, we have demonstrated that hippocampal mossy fibers, containing the opioid peptide dynorphin B, are functionally connected with the gene-dependent exploratory behavior of mice. In order to seek further evidence of causal relationships between dynorphin B action and exploration, a quantitative-genetic method was chosen. For this purpose, mice from the inbred strains C57BL/6, DBA/2, BLN, and CPB-K were used. By means of radioimmunoassay, the hippocampal level of dynorphin B was monitored in mice that had been exposed to environmental novelty, as compared to naive animals. Clear evidence was obtained that novelty induces the release of hippocampal dynorphin B. Furthermore, low tissue content was found to be causally connected with high exploratory scores.
