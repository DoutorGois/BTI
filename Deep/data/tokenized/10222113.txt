In a strain of Wistar rats selected in our laboratory, audiogenic seizures (AS), characterized by a wild running phase followed by a tonic seizure, can be elicited by exposure to sound. In these animals repeated daily stimulations induce permanent changes which reflect the extension of seizure activity from the brainstem to the forebrain. C-Fos immunoreactivity was used to further characterize the sound-susceptibility of the strain and to specify the spatiotemporal relationships between c-Fos expression and development of AS kindling. AS susceptible rats appeared to be more sensitive to a subthreshold sound as compared to controls. Sound-evoked wild running induced a similar pattern of c-Fos as a full AS in naive rats, confirming the epileptic nature of this early component. AS-induced c-Fos labeling in the auditory pathways of the brainstem extended to the forebrain with repetition of AS and marked increases in c-Fos expression sequentially occurred in the amygdala and perirhinal cortex, followed by the frontoparietal cortex, the piriform cortex, and finally the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. These results show that the kindled AS preferentially propagate from the brainstem, through the amygdala and the perirhinal cortex, to the motor cortex, with the piriform cortex and hippocampus as secondary targets. No more c-Fos expression was detected 24 h after an AS. A down-regulation of cortical c-Fos induction was observed 1 and 2 days after daily exposure to kindled AS, with full recovery of c-Fos expression after a 5-day seizure-free period. This suggests a regulatory function of c-Fos expression in development of kindling.
