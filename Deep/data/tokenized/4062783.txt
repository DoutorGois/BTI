The present experiment used hippocampal stimulation to determine the temporal gradient of consolidation of spatial working memory. Rats were trained to perform a spatial working memory task on a radial maze with 12 arms. Each rat went to the ends of 6 arms to obtain a food reward. After 8 h, the rat chose among all the arms to find the ones not previously chosen (and consequently still having food). During some test sessions, the hippocampus was stimulated electrically either at a current level just high enough to produce an electrophysiological seizure, or at a current level below this seizure threshold. Stimulation occurred at one of five intervals (0 to 8 h) following the completion of the first six choices. During other test sessions, the hippocampus was not stimulated. After seizure stimulation, the number of retroactive errors (returning to arms chosen prior to stimulation) increased at all delay intervals; the number of proactive errors (returning to arms chosen after stimulation) increased only with the delay of 8 h. Subthreshold stimulation had no influence on either type of error. These results indicate that normal hippocampal function is required for the maintenance of spatial information in working memory, and that the time course of consolidation of this information is significantly greater than that seen in other types of memory, or consolidation may not take place at all.
