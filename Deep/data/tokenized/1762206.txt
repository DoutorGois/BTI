We studied the propagation of acute focal seizure activities in animals by means of the [14C]deoxyglucose method. Seizures were induced unilaterally by injecting penicillin in the neocortical area 4 and area 9 in the monkey, and by injecting kainic acid in the hippocampus of the rat and in the ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus of the cat. The earliest and the most consistent propagation was the one to the target structures of the primary focus, mediated through the "preferential" projection pathways. At a more advanced stage, the propagation to the immediately adjoining brain regions occurred, followed by the secondary propagation to the target structures of the adjoining regions. Propagation to the contralateral homologous structure was not a major one at the early stage unless the structure of the primary focus had its own commissural connections.
