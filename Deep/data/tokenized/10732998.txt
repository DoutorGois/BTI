Cell specific markers were quantified in the hippocampus, the amygdala/pyriform cortex, the frontal cerebral cortex and the striatum of the rat brain after systemic administration of kainic acid. Neuron specific enolase (NSE) reflects loss of neurons, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) reflects reactive gliosis, and brain levels of serum proteins measures blood-brain-barrier permeability. While the concentration of NSE remained unaffected in the frontal cerebral cortex and the striatum, their GFAP content increased during the first three days. In the hippocampus and amygdala, NSE levels decreased significantly. GFAP levels in the hippocampus were unaffected after one day and decreased in the amygdala/pyriform cortex. After that, GFAP increased strikingly until day 9 or, in the case of amygdala/pyriform cortex, even longer. This biphasic time course for GFAP was accompanied by a decrease of S-100 during days 1-9 followed by a significant increase at day 27 above the initial level. The regional differences in GFAP and S-100 could result from the degree of neuronal degeneration, the astrocytic receptor set-up and/or effects on the blood-brain barrier.
