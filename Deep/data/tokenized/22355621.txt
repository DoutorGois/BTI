It is currently unknown why glutamatergic presynaptic terminals express multiple types of glutamate receptors. We have addressed this question by studying both acute and long-term regulation of mossy fibre function in the hippocampus. We find that inhibition of both mGlu(1) and mGlu(5) receptors together can block the induction of mossy fibre LTP. Furthermore, mossy fibre LTP can be induced by the pharmacological activation of either mGlu(1) or mGlu(5) receptors, provided that kainate receptors are also stimulated. Like conventional mossy fibre LTP, chemically-induced mossy fibre LTP (chem-LTPm) depends on Ca(2)(+) release from intracellular stores and the activation of PKA. Similar synergistic interactions between mGlu receptors and kainate receptors were observed at the level of Ca(2)(+) signalling in individual giant mossy fibre boutons. Thus three distinct glutamate receptors interact, in both an AND and OR gate fashion, to regulate both immediate and long-term presynaptic function in the brain.
