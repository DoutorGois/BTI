One hundred human brains, obtained from the routine autopsy service of the Dartmouth Medical School (Hanover, NH) and Rutland Hospital (Rutland, VT), were studied to establish a better understanding of the anatomy of the arterial supply to the uncus. Drawings of each dissection were made and the findings summarized. The variability in the number and size of the vessels to this region may be striking.
