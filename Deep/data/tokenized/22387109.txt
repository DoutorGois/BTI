L-arginine, one of the most metabolically versatile amino acids, can be metabolized to form a number of bioactive molecules. The present study systematically investigated age-related changes in L-arginine and its metabolites in the hippocampus, parahippocampal region, and prefrontal cortex at the tissue (crude homogenates) and synaptoneurosome (a subcellular preparation enriched for synaptic material) levels. As aging leads to reduced water content in the brain, age-related changes in neurochemical levels in tissue homogenates normalized by wet tissue weight and protein level were compared. There were significant differences in L-arginine, L-citrulline, L-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, and glutamate, but not GABA, in the CA1, CA2/3, and dentate gyrus sub-regions of the hippocampus and the prefrontal, entorhinal, perirhinal, and postrhinal cortices in 24 (aged) and 4 (young) months old rats in a region-specific manner. The overall pattern of age-related changes in amino acids (L-arginine, L-citrulline, L-ornithine, glutamate, and GABA) was largely similar between homogenates and synaptoneurosomes, whereas the pattern for the amines (agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) was quite different. Furthermore, the pattern of age-related changes in neurochemical levels in tissue homogenates normalized by wet tissue weight and protein level was very similar for all 9 neurochemicals measured. These findings suggest that there are differential effects of aging on L-arginine metabolism at the tissue and synaptoneurosome levels and that the way of data normalization (tissue weight vs. protein level) has no or very minor effects on 9 neurochemicals measured.
