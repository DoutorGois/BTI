Melatonin reduces pyramidal neuronal death in the hippocampus and prevents the impairment of place learning and memory in the Morris water maze, otherwise occurring following global cerebral ischemia. The cytoarchitectonic characteristics of the hippocampal CA1 remaining pyramidal neurons in brains of rats submitted 120 days earlier to acute global cerebral ischemia (15-min four vessel occlusion, and melatonin 10mg/(kg h 6h), i.v. or vehicle administration) were compared to those of intact control rats in order to gain information concerning the neural substrate underlying preservation of hippocampal functioning. Hippocampi were processed according to a modification of the Golgi method. Dendritic bifurcations from pyramidal neurons in both the oriens-alveus and the striatum radiatum; as well as spine density and proportions of thin, stubby, mushroom-shaped, wide, ramified, and double spines in a 50 microm length segment of an oblique dendrite branching from the apical dendrite of the hippocampal CA1 remaining pyramidal neurons were evaluated. No impregnated CA1 pyramidal neurons were found in the ischemic-vehicle-treated rats. CA1 pyramidal neurons from ischemic-melatonin-treated rats showed stick-like and less ramified dendrites than those seen in intact control neurons. In addition, lesser density of spines, lower proportional density of thin spines, and higher proportional density of mushroom spines were counted in ischemic-melatonin-treated animals than those in the sinuously branched dendrites of the intact control group. These cytoarchitectural arrangements seem to be compatible with place learning and memory functions long after ischemia and melatonin neuroprotection.
