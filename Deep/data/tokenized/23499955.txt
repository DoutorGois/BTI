Glycometabolism disorder induced by triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) is closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Senescence accelerated mouse (SAM) is often employed as an AD model characteristic of early cognitive impairment. In order to investigate the variation of TPI with aging, SAM prone 8 (SAMP8) and SAM resistant 1 (SAMR1) were divided into 2-month, 6-month, 8-month and 12-month group. For the analysis of acupuncture intervention, SAMP8 were divided into SAMP8 control group (Pc), SAMP8 acupoint group (Pa), SAMP8 non-acupoint group (Pn) and SAMR1 control group (Rc). Grading score of senescence and Morris water maze results showed that SAMP8 presented aging-related deterioration of learning and memory, and that acupuncture could improve the learning and memory ability of SAMP8. TPI activity and expression were detected by colorimetric method and Western blot analysis, respectively. When compared to SAMR1, TPI activity in 6-, 8- and 12-month SAMP8 decreased significantly. However, acupuncture intervention markedly up-regulated TPI activity in hippocampus of Pa. These findings suggested that the learning and memory deterioration of SAMP8 with aging might be associated with the lower TPI activity and that acupuncture could improve the cognitive impairment by increasing TPI activity, thus correcting the abnormal glycolysis metabolism and maintaining the brain homeostasis and internal environment.
