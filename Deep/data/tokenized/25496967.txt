Musicogenic seizure is classified as a rare form of complex reflex seizures. We present a patient with musicogenic seizures from whom invasive recordings were obtained using subdural arrays, as well as hippocampal depth electrodes. Interestingly, this patient had both spontaneous seizures and musicogenic seizures, and they originated from different hippocampi. Due to bilateral independent musicogenic seizures and spontaneous seizures, our patient was not eligible for surgery, but vagal nerve stimulation treatment was almost successful.
