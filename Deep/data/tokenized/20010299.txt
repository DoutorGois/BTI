Aging is the most important single risk factor for developing Alzheimer disease. We measured amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) levels in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus during normal aging of Brown-Norway/Fischer rats. Amyloid-beta accumulation was associated with expression of the Abeta influx transporter, the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGEs) at the blood-brain barrier. Rats at selected ages from 3 to 36 months were analyzed by 1) immunohistochemistry for amyloid deposition and quantitative microvessel surface area RAGE expression, 2) ELISA for cortical Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations, and 3) Western blotting of microvessel proteins for RAGE expression. Immunohistochemistry showed increasing accumulation of brain Abeta with aging. By ELISA analysis, both Abeta40 and Abeta42 concentrations in cortical homogenates rose sharply from 9 to 12 months. The Abeta42 continued to rise up to age 30 months, whereas Abeta40 stabilized after 12 months. The expression of RAGE initially decreased between 3 and 12 months but then increased between 12 and 34 months by immunohistochemistry. On immunoblotting, RAGE decreased up to 9 months and then progressively increased up to 36 months. These data indicate an association between amyloid and microvessel RAGE during aging. An increase in capillary RAGE expression seems to play a role in the later Abeta accumulation but not in the initial increase.
