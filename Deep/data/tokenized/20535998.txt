Effects of the inhibitor of the expression of Heat shock proteins 70 kDa (Hsp70), quercetin on seizures and movement disorders induced by N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) or pentylenetetrazole in adult rats Wistar were investigated using behavioral methods. It was found that intraperitoneal injection of quercetin 4 hours before intraventricular microinjection of NMDA resulted in increased duration of tonic component of seizures, seizure and ataxia symptoms severity. Blockade of the expression of Hsp70 by quercetin increased the duration of clonic and tonic seizures and did not affect severity of seizures and ataxia symptoms, induced by intraperitoneal injection of pentylenetetrazole. Immunoblotting showed that injection of quercetin resulted in reduced content of the inducible form of Hsp70 in the hippocampus, thalamus and corpus callosum. The obtained results indicate proconvulsant effect of quercetin associated with the inhibition of Hsp70 expression. These data suggest involvement of Hp70 in regulation of central mechanisms of behavioral seizures and motor disorders induced by NMDA and pentylenetetrazole in rats.
