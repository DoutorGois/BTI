A series of 1,6-dihydro-5-(4H)-pyrimidinone oxime derivatives I was synthesized (Scheme 1, Tables 1 and 2) and tested for muscarinic activity (Table 3) in receptor binding assays using [3H]-oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) and [3H]-pirenzepine (Pz) as ligands. Potential muscarinic agonistic or antagonistic properties of the compounds were determined using binding studies that measured their potencies to inhibit the binding of Oxo-M and Pz. Preferential inhibition of Oxo-M binding was used as an indicator for potential muscarinic agonistic properties; this potential was confirmed in functional studies on isolated organs. The series produced a wide range of active compounds with differing degrees of selectivity in M1, M2, and M3 functional models. Several compounds that have mixed agonist/antagonist profiles were able to reduce cholinergic-related cognitive impairments in models of mnemonic function. Substitutions (I, e.g. R2 or R3 = Me) at the 1,6-dihydro-5-(4H)pyrimidine ring disrupted binding and efficacy, whereas systematic variation of the oximes substituent R1 resulted in various degrees of potency and selectivity dependent on the nature of the substitution.
