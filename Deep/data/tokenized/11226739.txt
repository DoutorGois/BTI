An ultrastructural study of rat hippocampus was performed on young (group 1) and old (group 4) rats receiving daily subcutaneous injections of aluminum L-glutamate and on old untreated rats (group 5). Young controls were treated with sodium L-glutamate (group 2) and physiological saline (group 3). Group 1 showed vacuolated astrocytes with numerous lipofuscin deposits, mitochondrial swelling, a thinning of the myelin sheath, and many multivesicular bodies invading the cytoplasm. Cellular structure did not appear to be affected in groups 2 and 3. Group 4 showed swollen mitochondria, a demyelination process in axonal regions, sizable perivascular oedema with vessel retraction and gliofilament bundles. In this group, lipofuscin deposits in astrocytes were associated with multivesicular bodies that thinned the myelin sheath to the breaking point; however, no excitotoxic glutamate-induced effects were observed. In group 5, extreme cytoplasmic vacuolation was observed, with massive mitochondrial swelling, considerable thinning of the myelin sheath (at times to the breaking point), sizable vacuolar degeneration and gliofilament bundles. These results indicate that ultrastructural alterations in the hippocampus, such as cell vacuolization, massive mitochondrial swelling and the demyelination process, occur with aging and independently of aluminum intoxication. Similar alterations were observed in aluminum L-glutamate-intoxicated young rats, but not in controls. These results are consistent with aluminum-induced acceleration of the aging process.
