Recent studies suggest that sex differences in cognitive function may involve effects of circulating androgens on the developing cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The mechanism of these effects is not understood. In rhesus monkeys, aromatase activity is present in the hippocampus and several areas of the cerebral cortex during late fetal and early postnatal life. Similarly, work in rats and mice indicates that the hippocampus and cerebral cortex may be capable of estrogen biosynthesis during early development. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the actions of androgens on the developing cerebral cortex and hippocampus may involve local estrogen-mediated effects similar to those responsible for differentiation of the hypothalamic mechanisms controlling reproductive function.
