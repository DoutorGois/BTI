We describe the immunohistological detection of in vivo interferon-beta (IFN-beta)-induced H-2 antigens in mouse brain tissues. Two injections of recombinant mouse interferon-beta (rIFN-beta) were given into the lateral ventricles. Following perfusion with periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) solution, microsliced brain sections were incubated with anti H-2 monoclonal antibody and these subjected to a streptavidin biotin immunohistochemistry technique. Expression of H-2 antigens was demonstrated on neurons, neuroglias and vascular endothelial cells in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, corpus callosum and other regions of the brain as well as on ependymocytes in the choroid plexus. H-2 antigens were also diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and axons.
