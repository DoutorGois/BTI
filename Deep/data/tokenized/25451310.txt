Chronic high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method to increase the excitability of neurons, and it induces long-term effects that can improve symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, including cognitive ability. The present study was undertaken to identify the mechanism by which rTMS improves cognitive impairments in mice. The novel object recognition test in vivo was used to evaluate the cognitive function of the mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to evaluate the neuronal excitability, including the resting membrane potential, the number of action potentials induced by depolarized current, after-hyperpolarization, and the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) current in hippocampal slices. We found that the aged mice showed impairments in cognitive function, and high-frequency (25Hz) rTMS for 14 consecutive-days ameliorated the impairments. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings showed that, compared to matured mice, the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of aged mice showed significantly hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, significantly decreased numbers of action potentials after injection of depolarizing current, and significantly increased after-hyperpolarization after an action potential. The exposure to high-frequency rTMS significantly improved the above deficits in the neuronal excitability in the aged rTMS mice. Consistent with the above changes, the exposure to high-frequency rTMS also significantly decreased the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) current of the neurons compared with the aged sham mice. These data suggested that the rTMS could improve the age-related cognitive impairment in parallel with regulating the neuronal excitability and modifying the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels.
