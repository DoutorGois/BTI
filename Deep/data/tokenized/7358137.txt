Rats were undernourished postnatally from birth through 20 days of age. They were subsequently tested for susceptibility to motor seizures kindled in hippocampus in adulthood. Compared to littermate control animals the postnatally undernourished rats were more susceptible to the kindling treatment. We conclude that early postnatal undernourishment has a permanent effect on susceptibility of the hippocampus to electrically-induced seizures.
