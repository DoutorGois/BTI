The scope of this work is to make a brief presentation of the electrophysiological recordings employed in the studies on ionic channel properties in physiological and pathological conditions. A number of examples are made on how electrophysiological recording contributed to understand the pathogenesis of certain diseases such as myasthenia gravis, myothonia congenita, cystic fibrosis and degradation of neurons in CA1 hippocampal region following ischaemia.
