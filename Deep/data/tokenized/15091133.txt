Two children with mental retardation, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and muscle rigidity are reported. They had a history of severe hyperbilirubinemia after birth as a result of Rh isoimmunization. The history and clinical picture suggested the diagnosis of kernicterus. The magnetic resonance imaging examination showed a bilateral signal intensity increase in the globus pallidus on T2-weighted images. Additionally, our patients showed symmetric bilateral hyperintensity and volume loss in the hippocampus, which is known to be another characteristic area of bilirubin deposition in kernicterus.
