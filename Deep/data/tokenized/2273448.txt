Zn2+ at the concentration of 10 microM inhibited the depolarization-induced [3H]glutamate release from the preloaded rat hippocampal slices both in the presence and absence of Ca2+ without affecting [3H]GABA and [3H]ACh release. Of divalent cations tested, Zn2+ and Fe2+ had an inhibitory effect on the release of glutamate.
