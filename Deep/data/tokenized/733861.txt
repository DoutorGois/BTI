The effect of rhythmic slow wave activity (theta rhythm) on the incorporation of 3H-leucine and 3H-fucose into the total proteins of different hippocampus areas was studied. The theta rhythm was elicited by electrical stimulation of medial septum nuclei. An increase in 3H-leucine incorporation into the total proteins of CA 3 and CA 1 sectors of the hippocampus was observed, whereas the stimulation had no influence on precursor incorporation into the complex CA 4/area dentata. In contrast to these findings 3H-fucose incorporation into hippocampal proteins was not influenced by electrical stimulation of the medial septum. These findings are discussed in comparison to the results obtained in a learning experiment, which revealed an increased incorporation of both leucine and focuse into hippocampal proteins.
