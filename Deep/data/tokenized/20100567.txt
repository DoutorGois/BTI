Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. Sensitive to apoptosis gene (SAG) is a RING-finger protein that exhibits antioxidant activity against a variety of redox reagents. However, the protective effect of SAG in brain ischemic injury is unclear. Here, we investigated the protective effects of a Tat-SAG fusion protein against cell death and ischemic insult. When Tat-SAG fusion protein was added to the culture medium of astrocytes, it rapidly entered the cells and protected them against oxidative stress-induced cell death. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that, when Tat-SAG fusion protein was intraperitoneally injected into gerbils, wild-type Tat-SAG prevented neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in response to transient forebrain ischemia. In addition, wild-type Tat-SAG fusion protein decreased lipid peroxidation in the brain compared with mutant Tat-SAG- or vehicle-treated animals. Our results demonstrate that Tat-SAG fusion protein is a tool for the treatment of ischemic insult and it can be used in protein therapy for various disorders related to ROS, including stroke.
