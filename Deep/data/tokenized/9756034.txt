Recent research has focused on the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor system as a major site of ethanol action in the brain and specifically on compensatory changes in the expression of the polyamine-sensitive NR2B subunit. Therefore, we examined the effects of chronic ethanol treatment on polyamine homeostasis in the rat brain. Wistar rats were made dependent by ethanol vapor inhalation. This caused a rise in hippocampal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity that was correlated with the appearance of physiological dependence. ODC activity returned to control levels within 3 days of ethanol withdrawal. Enzyme activity also increased in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and cerebellum of the ethanol-dependent rats. The concentration of the polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) in the hippocampus was increased in ethanol-dependent rats. Injection of the ODC inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine (500 mg/kg) at the onset of withdrawal resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of withdrawal behaviors. The level of ODC activity and the severity of withdrawal behaviors were positively correlated. Perturbed polyamine homeostasis may represent an important molecular component in the initiation of ethanol withdrawal behaviors in the ethanol-dependent rat.
