Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent, chronic, and disabling anxiety disorder that may develop following exposure to a traumatic event. The majority of individuals with PTSD often have comorbid psychiatric conditions such as major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance use disorders, and are at increased risk for suicide. Despite the public health significance of PTSD, relatively little is known about the etiology or pathophysiology of this disorder, and pharmacotherapy development to date has been largely opportunistic instead of mechanism-based. One promising target for modulation is Tropomyosin Receptor Kinase B (TrkB), the receptor for Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a signaling pathway important for neuronal plasticity, survival, and growth. The following discusses how genetic and environmental alterations to this signaling pathway may contribute to anatomical and functional changes in the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the nucleus accumbens. Changes in these brain regions may in turn contribute to the predisposition to or maintenance of some of the clinical manifestations of PTSD, including intrusive memories, hyperarousal, increased fear, and emotional numbing.
