CNG channels are cyclic nucleotide-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channels that are suggested to be involved in the activity-dependent alterations of synaptic strength that are thought to underlie information storage in the CNS. In this study, we isolated an endogenous RNA transcript antisense to CNG(alpha)1 mRNA. This transcript was capable of down-regulating the expression of sense CNG(alpha)1 in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. RT-PCR, Northern blot, and in situ hybridization analyses showed that the transcript was coexpressed with CNG(alpha)1 mRNA in many regions of human brain, notably in those regions that were involved in long-term potentiation and long-term depression, such as hippocampal CA1 and CA3, dentate gyrus, and cerebellar Purkinje layer. Comparison of expression patterns between adult and fetal cerebral cortex revealed that there were concurrent developmental changes in the expression levels of anti-CNG1 and CNG(alpha)1. Treatment of human glioma cell T98 with thyroid hormone T(3) caused a significant increase in anti-CNG1 expression and a parallel decrease in sense CNG(alpha)1 expression. These data suggest that the suppression of CNG(alpha)1 expression by anti-CNG1 may play an important role in neuronal functions, especially in synaptic plasticity and cortical development. Endogenous antisense RNA-mediated regulation may represent a new mechanism through which the activity of ion channels can be regulated in the human CNS.
