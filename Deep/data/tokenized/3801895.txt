Systemic injection of pilocarpine (380 mg/kg) results in the development of motor limbic seizures in rats. Olfactory bulbectomy performed 7 days prior to pilocarpine administration has a strong protective effect against the seizures. Neuropathological changes which normally occur in this seizure model do not develop in the brains of bulbectomized animals.
