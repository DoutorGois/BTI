Protective effects of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) from rat's brain against delayed cell death induced by excitatory amino acids were examined in cultured neurons of the rat. CSPGs reduced delayed neuronal death induced by 10 min exposure to glutamate at a concentration between 100 microM and 1 mM when lactate dehydrogenase activity of culture medium was assayed 24 h after the exposure. CSPGs also protected neuronal death induced by 200 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate or 100 microM alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA). CSPGs reduced death of cortical and hippocampal neurons even when they were administered at 2 h, but not 6 and 12 h, after the exposure to glutamate. These results indicate that CSPGs may have a neuroprotective action against acute noxious conditions in the brain.
