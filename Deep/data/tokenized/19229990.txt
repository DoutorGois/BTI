The p75 neurotrophin receptor has been implicated in the regulation of multiple cellular functions that differ depending on the cell context. We have observed that p75(NTR) is strongly induced on astrocytes as well as neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region after seizures; however, the function of this receptor on these glial cells has not been defined. We have employed a primary culture system to investigate the effects of neurotrophins on astrocytes. Treatment of hippocampal astrocytes with nerve growth factor (NGF) caused a reduction in cell number, but did not elicit an apoptotic response, in contrast to hippocampal neurons. Instead, activation of p75(NTR) by NGF attenuated proliferation induced by mitogens such as EGF or serum. These studies demonstrate the cell type specificity of neurotrophin functions in the brain.
