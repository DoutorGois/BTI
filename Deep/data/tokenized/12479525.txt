We describe a patient who experienced recurrent episodes of abdominal pain as a prominent feature of his seizure disorder. Treatment with carbamazepine could not prevent these painful sensations, but a selective amygdalohippocampectomy completely controlled the episodic pain and the seizures associated with loss or alteration of consciousness. During the presurgical evaluation, the episodes of abdominal pain correlated with amygdalar seizure discharges.
