In Timm's sulfide silver preparations, intragranular and supragranular mossy fiber staining is found to be much more prevalent in the temporal dentate gyrus of the spontaneous epileptic mouse, tottering, than at matching levels in unaffected littermate controls. This aberrant distribution of mossy fibers may be due to the spontaneous seizures affecting this mutant.
