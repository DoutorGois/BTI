OBJECTIVE: To establish a rat model of diabetes-associated cerebral ischemia due to qi and yin deficiency and blood stasis, and to investigate the effects of Radix Ginseng, Rhizoma Chuanxiong, Rhizoma Polygonati Odorati and Rhizoma Polygonati Sibirici Granule (Shenxiong Yujing Granule), which has the function of strengthening qi, nourishing yin, and activating blood, on proliferation, differentiation and survival of neural cells in rats with diabetes-associated cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Rats were divided into sham-operation, diabetes plus ischemia reperfusion injury model, Shenxiong Yujing Granule and Radix Ginseng and Rhizoma Chuanxiong Granule (Shenxiong Granule) groups with 20 rats in each. The 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay and immunohistochemical method were used to investigate the proliferation, differentiation and survival of neural cells in dentate gyrus of rats with diabetes-associated cerebral ischemia. RESULTS: The number of newly proliferating cells in subgranular zone of dentate gyrus was increased in the model group, but there was no significant difference compared with 7 day treatment with Shenxiong Yujing Granule. Shenxiong Yujing Granule significantly increased the survival rate and promoted the differentiation of newly proliferating neurons after 21-day treatment (P<0.01). In addition, the beneficial effect of Shenxiong Yujing Granule was considerably greater than that of the Shenxiong Granule (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Shenxiong Yujing Granule can increase the survival rate and promote the differentiation of newly proliferating neurons in rats with diabetes-associated cerebral ischemia of dual deficiency of qi and yin and blood stasis obstructing the collaterals. The effect is greater than that of Shenxiong Granule.
