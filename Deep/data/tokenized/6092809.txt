Adenosine and adenosine analogues inhibited electrically evoked 3H-noradrenaline (3H-NA) release from slices of the rat hippocampus in vitro in a dose -dependent manner in the concentration range 0.01-100 M. L-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-PIA) was more potent than 5'-N-carboxamidoadenosine (NECA), which was more potent than adenosine. The adenosine uptake blocker dipyridamole (3 M) enhanced the effect of exogenous adenosine, and had a slight inhibitory effect per se. The effect of L-PIA on NA release was competitively antagonized by 8-phenyltheopylline; pA2 = 7.1. Enprophylline (300 M), theophylline (300 M) and 8-phenyltheophylline (1-10 M) enhanced the evoked 3H-NA release per se, while no such enhancement was seen with the non-xanthine phosphodiesterase inhibitor ZK 62.711 (Rolipram) (30 M). It is concluded that adenosine, at physiologically relevant concentrations, inhibits electrically evoked NA release from terminals in the central nervous system. Alkylxanthines increase evoked NA release from hippocampal terminals, which probably not related to cyclic AMP but may partly involve inhibition of endogenous adenosine acting as a modulator of transmitter release in the hippocampal slice preparation.
