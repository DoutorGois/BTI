The crossed temporodentate pathway from the entorhinal cortex of one hemisphere which proliferates in response to a contralateral entorhinal lesion in adult rats was analyzed for its ability to exhibit long term potentiation of synaptic efficacy similar to that which occurs in the normal ipsilateral temporodentate pathway. It was found that while the small synaptic response evoked by contralateral entorhinal cortical stimulation in normal rats does not undergo long term potentiation, after unilateral entorhinal lesions and proliferation of the crossed temporodentate pathway, the crossed pathway acquires a capacity for potentiation of synaptic action which qualitatively resembles that of the normal ipsilateral temporodentate circuit. However, despite the potentiation of synaptic drive, no long term enhancement of cell discharge was observed in the re-innervated dentate gyrus even through potentiation of this parameter was very prominent in the ipsilateral pathway. Mechanisms are discussed by which a previously non-potentiating pathway may acquire, as a consequence of lesion-induced sprouting, an ability to undergo long term potentiation of synaptic efficacy in a fasion similar to the ablated pathway. Reasons for the failure to observe potentiation of cell firing are also considered.
