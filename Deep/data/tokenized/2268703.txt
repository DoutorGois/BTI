The experiments were conducted on rabbits with chronical electrode implants 2 weeks after the implantation. Animals were divided into 4 groups. It was established that in animals with rapid kindling the duration of motor seizures was longer, the generalization of spiking in the brain structures was significantly lesser. Postictal refractory period for these animal groups was inhibited to a marked degree. Our data showed that the inhibition of postictal refractory period and facilitation of motor seizures in the case of rapid kindling cannot be explained only by weakening of antiepileptic mechanisms.
