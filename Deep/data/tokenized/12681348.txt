Two patients are described with grammatical class dissociation: CG, a semantic-dementia patient who presented a disproportionate impairment of nouns compared to verbs; SA, a patient with a left parietal lesion who presented impaired sentence production and a disproportionate deficit for verbs compared to nouns. The results are discussed within the current models on semantic memory and lexical access.
