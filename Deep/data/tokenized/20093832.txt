BACKGROUND/AIMS: To explore the potential value of myo-inositol (mIns), which is regarded as a biomarker for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, in APP/PS1 transgenic (tg) mice detected by (1)H-MRS. METHODS: (1)H-MRS was performed in 30 APP/PS1 tg mice and 20 wild-type (wt) littermates at 3, 5 and 8 months of age. Areas under the peak of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), mIns and creatine (Cr) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus were measured, and the NAA/Cr and mIns/Cr ratios were analyzed quantitatively. RESULTS: Compared with the wt mice, the mIns/Cr ratio of the 3-month-old tg mice was significantly higher (p < 0.05), and pathology showed activation and proliferation of astrocytes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. The concentration of NAA was significantly lower at 8 and 8 months of age (p < 0.05). According to the threshold of mIns/Cr that was adopted to separate the tg from the wt mice, the rate of correct predictions was 82, 94 and 95%, respectively, for 3, 5 and 8 months. CONCLUSION: Of the early AD metabolites as detected by (1)H-MRS, mIns is the most valuable marker for assessment of AD. Quantitative analysis of mIns may provide important clues for early diagnosis of AD.
