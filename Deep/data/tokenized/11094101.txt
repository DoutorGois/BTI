BACKGROUND: Repetitive seizures may be associated with progressive neuronal damage measurable by quantitative MRI. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether gender is a risk factor for this damage. METHODS: Sixty patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (28 men, 32 women) and 54 healthy controls (28 men, 26 women) were compared by quantitative MRI methods. RESULTS: Male patients had ipsilateral hemicranial volume loss of 12% (CI 8% to 16%) and contralateral volume loss of 7% (CI:3% to 11%) compared with male controls (p < or =0.004, analysis of variance). Female patients were 4% (CI:0.3% to 8%, p = 0.04) smaller than controls in the ipsilateral hemicranium, and not different contralaterally. The patient-to-control difference was greater in men than in women for the ipsilateral (p = 0.003) and contralateral hemicranial volume (p = 0.02). In men, 14% of the ipsilateral (F = 4.7, p = 0.004) and 16% of the contralateral (F = 5.1, p = 0.03) hemicranial volume loss could be attributed to generalized tonic clonic seizures. Compared with controls, patients averaged a 29% smaller ipsilateral and a 5% smaller contralateral hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Men with TLE have more brain atrophy than women with TLE. Seizure frequency is a factor contributing to reduced brain volumes in men but not in women. Men, therefore, may be more vulnerable to seizure-associated brain abnormalities.
