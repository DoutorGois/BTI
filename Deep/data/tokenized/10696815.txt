Mild hypothermia (38 degrees C) accelerated transport of fragmented DNA in apical dendrites of the gerbil CA1 pyramidal neurons and increased dendrite-terminal fragmented DNA pooling in the apoptotic process following transient forebrain ischemia. The specific DNA fragmentation after the ischemic insult in gerbil hippocampus was examined by in situ nick-end-labeling method, and fluorescence DNA detection technique by DAPI was also performed. There is a precise temperature dependence for the migration of fragmented DNA from nuclei into apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells during apoptosis following transient forebrain ischemia. Increase of fragmented DNA pooling is highly temperature sensitive, occurring at 38 degrees C, while at 39 degrees C there is a marked decrease in DNA pooling.
