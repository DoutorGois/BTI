The urea transporter UT-B is expressed in multiple tissues including erythrocytes, kidney, brain, heart, liver, colon, bone marrow, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, bladder, prostate, and testis in mammals. Phenotype analysis of UT-B-null mice has confirmed that UT-B deletion results in a urea-selective urine-concentrating defect (see Chap. 9 ). The functional significance of UT-B in extrarenal tissues studied in the UT-B-null mouse is discussed in this chapter. UT-B-null mice present depression-like behavior with urea accumulation and nitric oxide reduction in the hippocampus. UT-B deletion causes a cardiac conduction defect, and TNNT2 and ANP expression changes in the aged UT-B-null heart. UT-B also plays a very important role in protecting bladder urothelium from DNA damage and apoptosis by regulating the urea concentration in urothelial cells. UT-B functional deficiency results in urea accumulation in the testis and early maturation of the male reproductive system. These results show that UT-B is an indispensable transporter involved in maintaining physiological functions in different tissues.
