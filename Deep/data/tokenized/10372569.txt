Polyamine contents were determined in human temporal lobe epilepsy. In the seven patients studied, stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) located the epileptogenic focus in Ammon's horn and neuropathological findings were limited to hippocampal gliosis and sclerosis. Each polyamine exhibited a specific regional distribution. The most important variations were observed for spermidine and spermine while putrescine levels varied less. The regional variation was predominant in middle > posterior > anterior parts of the temporal lobe. Spermine contents and the spermidine/spermine (SPD/SPM) index varied especially in the middle and posterior parts of the hippocampus. Metabolic SPD/SPM index and spermidine levels were found to be drastically increased in almost all limbic parts when compared to neocortical regions. The opposite was observed for spermine. The heterogeneous distribution of polyamines was compared to abnormal electrical activities recorded by SEEG: SPD/SPM index and spermidine levels were sharply increased in seizure onset areas and high levels of spermine were detected in temporal cortex propagation areas. The presently reported heterogeneity of polyamine contents might contribute to modulate differentially the local control of excitability in human temporal epilepsy.
