Neural stem cells are capable of differentiating along multiple central nervous system cell-type lineages, and their use as graft material has provided new strategies for the treatment of neuronal damage. We transplanted adult rat hippocampus-derived neural stem cells into eyes of adult rats that underwent ischemia-reperfusion injury. As control, the cells were also injected into normal rats eyes without ischemic insult. The rats were sacrificed at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and the eyes were examined histochemically. In eyes with the insult, the transplanted cells were well integrated into the host retinas and expressed Map2ab. In the control, none of the cells migrated into the retina. These results suggest that neural stem cells may be used as donor cells for transplantation to repair ischemic-injured retina.
