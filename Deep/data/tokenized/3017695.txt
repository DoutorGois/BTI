The 3' exon of the chicken beta nerve growth factor (NGF) gene was isolated by the use of a murine cDNA probe. DNA sequence analysis of the clone suggests a mature chicken NGF protein of 118 amino acids, showing approximately 85% homology to mouse and human NGF. In addition to this conservation of the mature NGF, parts of the propeptide and the untranslated 3' end of the NGF gene are also highly homologous in chicken, human and mouse. Therefore, these sequences probably subserve important functions. Expression of NGF mRNA in various chicken tissues was examined by RNA blot analysis with a chicken NGF probe. A single mRNA of 1.3 kb was detected at high levels in heart and brain of 10-week-old roosters, and, at lower levels in spleen, liver and skeletal muscle. These data suggest a correlation between NGF expression and the density of sympathetic innervation in peripheral organs, in analogy with findings for mammalian tissues. In the adult avian brain, NGF mRNA is found at higher concentration in the optic tectum and cerebellum than in the cortex and hippocampus. This pattern of NGF expression differs from that previously described for the rat brain. During late stages of development (day 18), NGF mRNA was expressed both in heart and brain of embryos but at lower levels than in the adult.
