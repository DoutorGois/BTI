The transient appearance of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GCH)-immunoreactive (ir) cells in the ventral lateral geniculate nuclear region of mice was detected by use of an avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method with an antibody specific for an oligopeptide of rat GCH (residues from 12 to 23, GFPERELPRPGA). In this brain region, we found for the first time novel GCH-ir cells already at postnatal day 1 (P1). The numbers reached maximum at P14 and decreased until P29, and they had mostly disappeared by P56. These cells were tyrosine hydroxylase negative and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase negative, indicating a lack of dopamine or serotonin production, and thus do not belong to the monoaminergic neuron system.
