Decrease of the pO2 led to the same phasic changes in the unit activity of Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons in mice. Purkinje cells proved to be more resistant against oxygen deficiency in tissue culture than in surviving slices. Cells of the optic cortex preserved high level of functional activity at lowering the pO2 to 50%. Still, they were more sensitive to low pO2 as compared with other neurons. Cellular mechanisms responsible for maintenance of neuron functions in oxygen deficiency were found to depend on the energy exchange. Use of tissue culture and surviving brain slices as a mode for studying the cellular adaptive mechanisms, is discussed.
