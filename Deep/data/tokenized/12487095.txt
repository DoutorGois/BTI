The present article estimates depolarization-polarization processes in the nerve tissue of afferent systems, including visceral ones, according to the changes of the direct current (DC) potential level. Food motivation is formed and satisfied concurrently with changes in the neocortex direct current potential level and a number of cerebral brain limbic structures in rats. Lateral hypothalamic nucleus, basolateral amygdala area, and auditory cortex in hungry rats have a more negative DC potential shift than in satisfied animals, while a reverse relation is observed in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The results obtained are considered an indication of polarization shifts in the mechanism of motivated and emotional behavior. An idea of the determining role of polarization processes in the mechanism of motivated and emotional behavior is developed.
