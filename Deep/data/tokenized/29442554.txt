Research over the last 20 years has begun to elucidate the importance of adult neurogenesis in cognition. Three studies recently asked what might be happening to memories formed before neurogenesis in the hippocampus (Akers et al. 2014; Epp et al. 2016; Kodali et al. 2016). These studies found conflicting results: running (which increases neurogenesis) induced forgetting in two studies, but there was no difference in memory retrieval after exercise in another. To reconcile these studies, one must understand the processes behind memory maintenance and recall, and consider context, species and other factors.
