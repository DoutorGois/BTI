Measurements of enzymatic activity have demonstrated that lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the principal enzyme responsible for hydrolysis of circulating triglyceride, is present in a number of tissues including brain, kidney, and adrenal gland. To determine the sites of synthesis of LPL in these tissues, in situ hybridization studies were performed using a non-sense 35S-labeled RNA probe produced from a 624-bp mouse LPL cDNA fragment. Control studies were performed with a sense RNA strand. Using 5-10-micron sections of 5-day-old rat brain, strong hybridization was found in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. Positive hybridization, indicating the presence of LPL mRNA, was also found in brain cortex and in the intermediate lobe of adult rat pituitary gland. Specific areas of adrenal and kidney medulla showed hybridization with the probe. LPL mRNA is, therefore, present in a number of specific regions of the body. LPL in these areas may not be important in regulating circulating levels of lipoproteins, but may be essential for cellular uptake, binding, and transfer of free fatty acids or other lipophilic substances.
