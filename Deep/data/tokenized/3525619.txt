The ultrastructural features of cholinergic neurons transplanted to the rat hippocampal formation were studied by using a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Septal cell suspensions were prepared from E-18 rat embryos and injected into the hippocampus of host rats that had been previously subjected to a bilateral transection of the fimbria-fornix. Rats with fimbria-fornix lesions alone and unoperated rats served as controls and were examined to characterize the native hippocampal cholinergic system. Both unoperated controls and rats with fimbria-fornix lesions showed a sparse population of intrinsic ChAT-immunoreactive neurons that were most numerous in the subgranular zone, the hilus fascia dentata, and near the hippocampal fissure. ChAT-positive terminals from controls formed synapses on dendritic structures that were primarily symmetrical. ChAT-positive dendrites in controls received synaptic input from nonimmunoreactive axon terminals. In rats with septal transplants, ChAT-immunoreactive transplant neurons were found that were either bipolar or multipolar. Axons of transplanted neurons were unmyelinated and arose either from the cell body or a primary dendritic process where they gave off numerous collaterals. Terminals from transplant neurons formed synapses with many nonimmunoreactive neurons. In transplant animals, two main targets of ChAT-immunoreactive terminals were identified: The great majority of synapses were symmetrical junctions with dendritic spines and shafts. A number of terminals were found that appeared to be juxtaposed to nonimmunoreactive axon terminals, possibly forming symmetrical axo-axonic connections. In contrast, such axo-axonic contacts were not observed in the controls. It is concluded that transplanted cholinergic neurons may reinnervate the host hippocampus; however, this reinnervation is different from what is seen in the intact hippocampal formation.
