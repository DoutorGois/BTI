We have isolated, from a rat brain cDNA library, a clone corresponding to a 2779-bp cDNA encoding a novel splice form of the glutamate receptor interacting protein-1 (GRIP1). We call this 696-amino acid splice form GRIP1c 4-7 to differentiate it from longer splice forms of GRIP1a/b containing seven PDZ domains. The four PDZ domains of GRIP1c 4-7 are identical to PDZ domains 4-7 of GRIP1a/b. GRIP1c 4-7 also contains 35 amino acids at the N terminus and 12 amino acids at the C terminus that are different from GRIP1a/b. In transfected HEK293 cells, a majority of GRIP1c 4-7 was associated with the plasma membrane. GRIP1c 4-7 interacted with GluR2/3 subunits of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor. In low density hippocampal cultures, GRIP1c 4-7 clusters colocalized with GABAergic (where GABA is gamma-aminobutyric acid) and glutamatergic synapses, although a higher percentage of GRIP1c 4-7 clusters colocalized with gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A, receptor (GABA(A)R) clusters than with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid receptor clusters. Transfection of hippocampal neurons with hemagglutinin-tagged GRIP1c 4-7 showed that it could target to the postsynaptic complex of GABAergic synapses colocalizing with GABA(A)R clusters. GRIP1c 4-7-specific antibodies, which did not recognize previously described splice forms of GRIP1, recognized a 75-kDa protein that is enriched in a postsynaptic density fraction isolated from rat brain. EM immunocytochemistry experiments showed that in intact brain GRIP1c 4-7 concentrates at postsynaptic complexes of both type I glutamatergic and type II GABAergic synapses although it is also presynaptically localized. These results indicate that GRIP1c 4-7 plays a role not only in glutamatergic synapses but also in GABAergic synapses.
