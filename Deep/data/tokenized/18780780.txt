New neurons are continuously generated in restricted regions of the adult mammalian brain. Although these adult-born neurons have been shown to receive synaptic inputs, little is known about their synaptic outputs. Using retrovirus-mediated birth-dating and labeling in combination with serial section electron microscopic reconstruction, we report that mossy fiber en passant boutons of adult-born dentate granule cells form initial synaptic contacts with CA3 pyramidal cells within 2 weeks after their birth and reach morphologic maturity within 8 weeks in the adult hippocampus. Knockdown of Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) in newborn granule cells leads to defects in axonal targeting and development of synaptic outputs in the adult brain. Together with previous reports of synaptic inputs, these results demonstrate that adult-born neurons are fully integrated into the existing neuronal circuitry. Our results also indicate a role for DISC1 in presynaptic development and may have implications for the etiology of schizophrenia and related mental disorders.
