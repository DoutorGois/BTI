Oxidative stress is closely associated with various diseases and is considered to be a major factor in ischemia. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) protein is a known antioxidant protein that plays a protective role in various cells against oxidative stress. We therefore investigated the effects of cell permeable Tat-NQO1 protein on hippocampal HT-22 cells, and in an animal ischemia model. The Tat-NQO1 protein transduced into HT-22 cells, and significantly inhibited against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death and cellular toxicities. Tat-NQO1 protein inhibited the Akt and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) activation as well as caspase-3 expression levels, in H2O2 exposed HT-22 cells. Moreover, Tat-NQO1 protein transduced into the CA1 region of the hippocampus of the animal brain and drastically protected against ischemic injury. Our results indicate that Tat-NQO1 protein exerts protection against neuronal cell death induced by oxidative stress, suggesting that Tat-NQO1 protein may potentially provide a therapeutic agent for neuronal diseases.
