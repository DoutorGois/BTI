Behaviour and the EEG responses to electric intracranial stimulation of the frontal cortex, mesencephalic RF, dorsal hippocampus and caudate nucleus were studied in hyperbaric experiments in rabbits. Thresholds of the stimulation for all the areas were decreased at 41 ATA, the thresholds progressively decreasing at 71 and 101 ATA. Preliminary administration of various pharmacological agents activating and inhibiting different neurotransmitter systems, altered the regularity of the EEG changes and behaviour. Dopaminergic agents suppressed some signs of the nervous high-pressure syndrome.
