Studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia have smaller hippocampi than healthy comparison subjects. There are, however, inconsistencies regarding the relationship between clinical characteristics and topographical differences in hippocampal volumetry. The authors investigated hippocampal volumes in minimally treated patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders, relative to comparison subjects. Thirty-nine consecutive patients and 29 matched comparison subjects were scanned using 1.5 tesla MR system. Patients had significantly smaller right anterior, right, and anterior hippocampal volumes than comparison subjects. There was a gender by diagnosis effect: female patients showed significantly smaller anterior and right hippocampal volumes than female comparison subjects, an effect not seen in male patients. Our results suggest that smaller hippocampal volumes are present even in early stages of the illness.
