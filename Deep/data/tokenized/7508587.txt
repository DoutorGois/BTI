Monoclonal antibody G10 recognises an epitope on microtubule-associated protein 1x, a developmentally regulated cytoskeletal protein expressed in immature axons of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here we report that G10 can be used to identify the axonal projections of syngeneic embryonic (E14-E15) hippocampal cells microtransplanted by a minimally traumatic technique into intact adult host hippocampus.
