The action of pheprazet, a derivative of amphethamine, and of the pheprazet alkylated analogues on the excitability of the neuron populations in the dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus was studied in non-anesthetized rabbits with electrodes and chemotrodes indwelt in the hippocampus and other brain structures. Most active drugs are shown to be pheprazet and (formula: see text). The former affects the beta- and the latter the alpha-adrenoreceptors of the hippocampus. Pheprazet pre-eminently increases while the drug (see formula: see text) reduces the excitability of the neuron populations in the dorsal and ventral parts of the hippocampus. The opposite effects of these drugs are considered by authors from the standpoint of interaction between different mediator systems.
