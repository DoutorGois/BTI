Previous studies have found an association between prior ethanol consumption and aggravated stroke outcome. Gerbils were intermittently given ethanol injections (s.c.) for 21 days at doses of 1 and 4 g/kg. After cessation of injections and appropriate weight gain, subjects underwent bilateral carotid occlusion while amino acid neurotransmitter levels in the hippocampus were monitored. Both the low and high dose ethanol groups demonstrated significantly decreased glutamate release compared with saline-treated controls during ischemia (p < 0.05). These results are consistent with a long-lasting ethanol-induced decrease in synaptic density in the hippocampus. That no intergroup differences on histological or neurobehavioral measures was found may suggest a functional dissociation of glutaminergic involvement in the pathogenesis of aggravated stroke outcome with alcoholism.
