BACKGROUND: Two dimeric dipeptides, bis-(N-monosuccinyl-l-seryl-l-lysine)hexamethylenediamide (GSB-106) and bis-(N-monosuccinyl-l-methionyl-l-serine) heptamethylenediamide (GSB-214), were designed based on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) loop 4 and loop 1 beta-turn sequences, respectively. Earlier, both of these dipeptides were shown to exhibit neuroprotective activity in vitro (10(-5)-10(-8) M). The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of these peptides and their neuroprotective activity in an experimental stroke model. METHODS: We used western blot and HT-22 hippocampal neuronal cell line to investigate whether these peptides induced phosphorylation of the TrkB receptor and the AKT and ERK kinases. Rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used as a stroke model. GSB-106 and GSB-214 were administered intraperitoneally (0.1 mg (1.3x10(-7) mol)/kg) 4 hours after MCAO and daily for 7 days. The cerebral infarct volumes were measured with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining 21 days after MCAO. RESULTS: Both compounds were shown to elevate the TrkB phosphorylation level while having different post-receptor signaling patterns. GSB-106 activated the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways simultaneously, whereas GSB-214 activated the PI3K/AKT only. In experimental stroke, the reduction of cerebral infarct volume by GSB-106 ( approximately 66%) was significantly greater than that of GSB-214 ( approximately 28% reduction), which could be explained by the fundamental role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Notably, between these two dipeptides, only GSB-106 exhibited antidepressant activity, as was found previously. CONCLUSION: The results provided support for the beneficial pharmacological properties of BDNF loop 4 mimetic GSB-106, thereby suggesting a potential role for this dipeptide as a therapeutic agent.
