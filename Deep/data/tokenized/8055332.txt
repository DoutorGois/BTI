The sizes of the hippocampal intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber terminal fields (IIPMF) of mice from two lines bidirectionally selected for attack latency were measured. Aggressive males possess smaller IIPMF than do non-aggressive ones. We hypothesize that both differences in aggression and sizes of the IIPMF may be mediated by perinatal testosterone.
