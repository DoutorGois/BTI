BACKGROUND: Cognitive function deficits caused by impaired neurogenesis of the brain structures are considered an important pathogenic factor in many neurological and mental diseases such as schizophrenia and depression. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of the enriched environment on cognitive functions and antidepressant-like effect of prenatally stressed rats. It was important to determine the effect of aripiprazole ARI and olanzapine OLA and clarify whether the enriched environment induces increases in brain derived neurothropic factor BDNF in the hippocampus in the prenatally stressed group (PSG) and non-stressed control group (NSCG). METHODS: The effect of chronic stress applied to pregnant rats and the use of ARI (1.5mg/kg ip) and OLA (0.5mg/kg ip) were studied in the Morris water maze (MWM), Porsolt Forced swimming test (FST) and by determining BDNF levels. RESULTS: The results indicated that enriched environment improved spatial memory and also had an antidepressant-like effect on prenatally stressed rats. ARI improved spatial memory both in the NSCG and PSG, while OLA caused memory improvement only in the PSG. Moreover, both ARI and OLA reduced immobility time in the NSCG and PSG. In PSG rats, BDNF decrease was observed while chronic treatment with ARI and OLA increased BDNF levels in the hippocampi of NSCG and PSG rats. CONCLUSION: It has been confirmed that enriched environment improves spatial memory of animals, removes symptoms of stress, has an antidepressant-like effect, and that new neuroleptics, such as ARI or OLA, modulate these functions (increased BDNF).
