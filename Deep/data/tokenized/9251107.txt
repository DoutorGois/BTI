Leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproate (alpha-KIC) were perfused at increasing concentrations into rat brain hippocampus by microdialysis to mimic the conditions of maple syrup urine disease. The effects of elevated leucine or alpha-KIC on the oxidation of L-[U-14C]glutamate and L-[U-14C]glutamine in the brain were determined in the non-anesthetized rat. 14CO2 generated by the metabolic oxidation of [14C]glutamate and [14C]glutamine in brain was measured following its diffusion into the eluant during the microdialysis. Leucine and alpha-KIC exhibited differential effects on 14CO2 generation from radioactive glutamate on glutamine. Infusion of 0.5 mM alpha-KIC increased [14C]glutamate oxidation approximately 2-fold; higher concentrations of alpha-KIC did not further stimulate [14C]glutamate oxidation. The enhanced oxidation of [14C]glutamate may be attributed to the function of alpha-KIC as a nitrogen acceptor from [14C]glutamate yielding [14C]alpha-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. [14C]glutamine oxidation was not stimulated as much as [14C]glutamate oxidation and only increased at 10 mM alpha-KIC reflecting the extra metabolic step required for its oxidative metabolism. In contrast, leucine had no effect on the oxidation of either [14C]glutamate or [14C]glutamine. In maple syrup urine disease elevated alpha-KIC may play a significant role in altered energy metabolism in brain while leucine may contribute to clinical manifestations of this disease in other ways.
