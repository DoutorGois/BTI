OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to investigate the mechanism of resveratrol on amelioration of hypoxia/ischemia (H/I)-induced brain injury. METHODS: The RT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expressions, respectively. The PC12 cell induced by OGD/R was as in vitro H/I brain injury model. The luciferase reporter assay was used to prove the relationship between Bax and miR-96, and the cell apoptosis was detected by MTT assay. The loss of MBP+ area in neonatal rats analyzed by immunohistochemistry was to evaluate the extent of brain injury. RESULTS: The miR-96 expression was decreased in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of neonatal rats with H/I brain injury and the oxygenglucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-induced PC12 cell, while Bax expression was opposite. And then the H/I rats and OGD/R-induced PC12 cell were treated with resveratrol (RSV); the results showed that the RSV could reverse the miR-96 and Bax expressions. Next, the luciferase reporter assay proved that Bax was a target of miR-96. We used the miR-96 inhibitor to suppress miR-96 expression in OGD/R-induced PC12 cell, and found that RSV regulated Bax expression and prevented OGD/R-induced PC12 cell apoptosis via miR-96. In addition, the immunohistochemistry was used to analyze the loss of MBP+ area in neonatal rats, and the result showed that the RSV significantly reduced the brain damage, increased miR-96 expression, and decreased Bax expression, while inhibition of miR-96 aggravated the brain damage and reversed the effect of RSV. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol ameliorates hypoxia/ischemia-induced brain injury in neonatal rat via the miR-96/ Bax axis.
