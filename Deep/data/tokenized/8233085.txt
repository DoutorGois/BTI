Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase (InsP3 3-kinase) plays a crucial role in calcium homeostasis by regulating InsP3 levels. We have reported the highest concentrations of InsP3 3-kinase in the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells of the CA1 sector of the Ammon's horn. We here investigate its subcellular localization by pre- and post-embedding immunoelectron microscopic study. In both populations of neurons, the major structure expressing a high level of InsP3 3-kinase is the dendritic spines.
