Qualitative and quantitative image analysis of hippocampal vascular bed, after transcardial perfusion of India ink, reveals significant differences among hippocampal subfields and along the septotemporal axis of the rat hippocampus. Ventral hippocampus exhibits significantly higher levels of vascularization compared to dorsal hippocampus, which, however, is characterized by significantly higher capillary density. These results may explain the selective ischemia vulnerability of hippocampus along its septotemporal axis.
