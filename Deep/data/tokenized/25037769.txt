BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking in adults is associated with abnormalities in brain neurobiology. Smoking-induced central nervous system oxidative stress (OxS) is a potential mechanism associated with these abnormalities. The goal of this study was to compare cognitively-normal elders on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of F2-isoprostane biomarkers of OxS. METHODS: Elders with a lifetime history of smoking (smokers; n=50; 75+/-5 years of age; 34+/-28 pack-years; approximately 12% were actively smoking at the time of study) were compared to never-smokers (n=61; 76+/-6 years of age) on CSF iPF2alpha-III and 8,12, iso-iPF2alpha-VI F2-isoprostanes levels. F2-isoprostanes levels were quantitated with HPLC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Associations between F2-isoprostanes levels, hippocampal volumes, and cigarette exposure measures were also evaluated. RESULTS: Smokers showed higher iPF2alpha-III level than never-smokers. An agexsmoking status interaction was observed for 8,12, iso-iPF2alpha-VI, where smokers demonstrate a significantly greater concentration with increasing age than never-smokers. In smokers only, higher 8,12, iso-iPF2alpha-VI concentration was associated with smaller hippocampal volume, and greater iPF2alpha-III level was related to greater pack years. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that a history of cigarette smoking in cognitively-normal elders was associated with significantly elevated CSF F2-isoprostane levels and greater age-related increases in F2-isoprostanes, and that higher F2-isoprostane levels in smokers were related to smaller hippocampal volume. These findings provide additional novel evidence that a history of chronic smoking during adulthood is associated with adverse effects on the human brain that are potentially enduring even with extended smoking cessation.
