Incubation of hippocampal slices with antibodies to morphine did not change the total excitatory postsynaptic potential of mossy fibers, but markedly facilitated long-term posttetanic potentiation. Culturing of the organotypic hippocampal culture in the presence of 10 microM morphine increased the total excitatory postsynaptic potential of mossy fibers and reduced the probability of long-term posttetanic potentiation.
