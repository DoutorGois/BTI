Glycyrrhizin (GL), a triterpene present in the roots and rhizomes of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-viral effects. In our previous reports, we demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of GL in the postischemic brain and in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure animal model. In this KA-induced seizure model, the systemic administration of GL 30 min before KA administration significantly suppressed neuronal cell death and markedly suppressed gliosis and proinflammatory marker inductions. In the present study, we showed that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), an endogenous danger signal, was induced in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions of the same KA-induced model, and peaked at ~3 h and at 6 days post-KA. HMGB1 was transiently induced in neurons and astrocyte at 3 h post-KA, and it was released from dying neurons and accumulated in serum at 12 h post-KA. Furthermore, after ~4 days of almost undetectable levels in the hippocampus, delayed and marked HMGB1 induction was detected at 6 days post-KA, mainly in astrocytes and endothelial cells, in which HMGB1 was localized in nuclei, and not secreted into serum. Interestingly, GL suppressed HMGB1 inductions in hippocampus and also suppressed its release into serum in KA-treated mice. Since we established previously that GL has anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic effects in this KA-induced seizure model, these results indicate that the neuroprotective effect of GL in the KA-injected mouse brain might be attributable to the inhibitions of HMGB1 induction and release, which in turn, mitigates the inflammatory process.
