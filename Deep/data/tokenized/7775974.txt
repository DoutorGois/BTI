Seizures set in motion complex molecular and morphological changes in vulnerable structures, such as the hippocampal complex. A number of these changes are responsible for neuronal death of CA3 and hilar cells, which involves necrotic and apoptotic mechanisms. In surviving dentate granule cells seizures induce an increased expression of tubulin subunits and microtubule-associated proteins, suggesting that an overproduction of tubulin polymers would lead to a remodeling of mossy fibers (the axons of granule cells). In fact, these fibers sprout in the dentate gyrus to innervate granule cell dendrites, creating recurrent excitatory circuits. In contrast, terminal mossy fibers do not sprout in the CA3 field. Navigation of mossy fiber's growth cones may be facilitated by astrocytes, which would exert differential effects by producing and excreting cell adhesion and substrate molecules. In the light of the results discussed here, we suggest that in adult brain activated-resident astrocytes (nonproliferating, tenascin-negative, neuronal cell-adhesion molecule-positive astrocytes) could contribute to the process of axonal outgrowth and synaptogenesis in the dentate gyrus, while proliferating astrocytes, tenascin-positive, could impede any axonal rearrangement in CA3.
