The role of diversity of the AMPA receptor subtypes, their property and function in the principal cells and interneurones of hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum, are discussed. The data obtained suggest that drugs capable of blocking an open channel of the AMPA receptor may be used as a tool for identification of the AMPA receptor subtypes and for elucidating their function under both normal and pathological conditions.
