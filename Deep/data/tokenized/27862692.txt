Cocaine use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by compulsive drug seeking and taking even after prolonged abstinence periods. Subsequent exposure to drug-associated cues can promote intense craving and lead to relapse in abstinent humans and rodent models. The responsiveness to these cocaine-related cues, or 'cue reactivity', can trigger relapse and cocaine-seeking behaviors; cue reactivity is measurable in cocaine-dependent humans as well as rodent models. Cue reactivity is thought to be predictive of cocaine craving and relapse. Here we report that PPARgamma agonism during abstinence from cocaine self-administration reduced previously active lever pressing in Sprague Dawley rats during cue-reactivity tests, while administration of the PPARgamma antagonist, GW9662, reversed this effect. PPARgamma agonism also normalized nuclear ERK activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus which was reversed with GW9662. Our results support the utility of PPARgamma agonism as a relapse prevention strategy to maintain abstinence in the presence of cocaine-associated cues.
