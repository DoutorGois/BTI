Spatial navigation and memory is considered to be a part of the declarative memory system and it is widely used as an animal model of human declarative memory. However, spatial tests typically involve only static settings, despite the dynamic nature of the real world. Animals, as well as people constantly need to interact with moving objects, other subjects or even with entire moving environments (flowing water, running stairway). Therefore, we design novel spatial tests in dynamic environments to study brain mechanisms of spatial processing in more natural settings with an interdisciplinary approach including neuropharmacology. We also translate data from neuropharmacological studies and animal models into development of novel therapeutic approaches to neuropsychiatric disorders and more sensitive screening tests for impairments of memory, thought, and behavior.
