Small iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were placed in different subregions of the septum of domestic chicks. The main targets of septal projections comprised the ipsi- and contralateral septal nuclei, including the nucleus of the diagonal band, basal ganglia, including the ventral paleostriatum, lobus parolfactorius, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle, archistriatum, piriform cortex, and anterior neostriatum. Further diencephalic and mesencephalic septal projections were observed in the ipsilateral preoptic region, hypothalamus (the main regions of afferentation comprising the lateral hypothalamic nuclei, ventromedial, paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, and the mammillary region), dorsal thalamus, medial habenular and subhabenular nuclei, midbrain central gray, and ventral tegmental area. Contralateral projections were also encountered in the septal nuclei, ventral paleostriatum, periventricular and anteromedial hypothalamic nuclei, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and the lateral hypothalamic area. Avian septal efferents are largely similar to those of mammals, the main differences being a relatively modest hippocampal projection arising mainly from the nucleus of the diagonal band (as confirmed by a specific experiment with the retrograde pathway tracer True blue), the lack of interpeduncular projection, and a greater contingent of amygdalar efferents arising from the lateral septum rather than the nucleus of the diagonal band. This pattern of connectivity is likely to reflect an important role of the avian septal nuclei in the coordination of limbic circuits and the integration of a wide variety of information sources modulating the appropriate behavioral responses: attention and arousal level, memory formation, hormonally mediated behaviors, and their affective components (such as ingestive, reproductive, and parental behaviors), social interaction, locomotor modulation, and circadian rhythm.
