Excitotoxic glutamate CNS stimulation can result in neuronal cell death. Contributing mechanisms and markers of cell death are the activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. It remains to be resolved to which extent both cellular reactions overlap and/or indicate different processes of neurodegeneration. In this study, mixed neuronal cultures from newborn mice pubs (0-24 h) were stimulated with glutamate, and the co-localization of active caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation was investigated by immunocytochemistry and the TUNEL nick-end labelling. In untreated cultures, 8% scattered neurons (marked by MAP-2) displayed activated caspase-3 at different morphological stages of degeneration. TUNEL staining was detected in 5% of cell nuclei including GFAP-positive astrocytes. However, co-localization of active caspase-3 with TUNEL was less than 2%. After glutamate stimulation (125 microM), the majority of neurons was dying between 12 and 24 h. The absolute number of active caspase-3 neurons increased only moderately but in relation of surviving neurons after 24 h from 8 to 36% (125 microM), to 53% (250 microM) or to 32% (500 microM). TUNEL staining also increased after 24 h following glutamate treatment to 37% but the co-localization with active caspase-3 remained at the basal low level of 2%. In our system, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity effects the DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation. Co-localization of both parameters, however, is very poor. Active caspase-3 in the absence of TUNEL indicates a dynamic degenerative process, whereas TUNEL marks the end stage of severe irreversible cell damage regardless to the origin of the cell.
