The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2 possess extended intracellular C-terminal domains by which they can directly interact with a large number of postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins involved in synaptic clustering and signaling. We have previously shown that PSD-associated alpha-calmodulin kinase II (alphaCaMKII) binds with high affinity to the C-terminal domain of the NR2A subunit. Here, we show that residues 1412-1419 of the cytosolic tail of NR2A are critical for alphaCaMKII binding, and we identify, by site directed mutagenesis, PKC-dependent phosphorylation of NR2A(Ser(1416)) as a key mechanism in inhibiting alphaCaMKII-binding and promoting dissociation of alphaCaMKII.NR2A complex. In addition, we show that stimulation of PKC activity in hippocampal slices either with phorbol esters or with the mGluRs specific agonist trans-1-amino-1,3- cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (t-ACPD) decreases alphaCaMKII binding to NMDA receptor complex. Thus, our data provide clues on understanding the molecular basis of a direct cross-talk between alphaCaMKII and PKC pathways in the postsynaptic compartment.
