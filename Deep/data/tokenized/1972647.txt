Neuromodulation, the interaction between at least two chemical messengers in the nervous system, serves as a mechanism by which biochemical association can occur. A simple, yet compelling, hypothesis is that the criteria for expression of associative learning and memory are subserved by biochemical events which are also associative in nature. A neuromodulatory interaction that has been linked to memory function and which has been the subject of biochemical inquiry is the interaction between the catecholamine, norepinephrine (NE) and the neuropeptide, vasopressin (AVP). Studies described in this report show that vasopressin acts to potentiate norepinephrine (NE)-induced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in the hippocampus by a calcium-dependent mechanism. Results of these studies are considered in the context of the nonlinear properties of synergism and conditionality and in the context of the associative learning requirements of spatial and temporal coupling. Secondly, the calcium dependency of AVP-induced neuromodulation is considered in relation to the calcium dependency for induction of associative long-term potentiation. Lastly, the potential for changes in neuronal morphology in response to neuromodulatory events is considered. By using vasopressin potentiation of noradrenalin-induced cAMP formation as a model system, I have applied the theoretical framework of associative learning and memory to test the hypothesis that neuromodulation can serve as a biochemical analog of associative cognitive events.
