A mutant mouse (wriggle mouse sagami, WMS) with neurological disorders was found in a colony of the BALB/c strain. The clinical signs included tremor, dystonia and involuntary movements. The concentrations of the neurotransmitter substances, noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and acetylcholine (ACh), were measured simultaneously with their metabolites in dissected brain regions by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The turnover of 5-HT was significantly higher in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain and pons-medulla of WMS than of the genetic control, BALB/c. The intrastriatal DA and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid were increased. However, there was no evidence to suggest an increase in turnover rate of this neurotransmitter. An increase in concentration of and decrease in turnover rate of NA were observed in the cerebellum of this mutant. These findings suggest that multiple disturbance of the neurotransmitter system was largely responsible for the manifestation of the clinical signs of WMS.
