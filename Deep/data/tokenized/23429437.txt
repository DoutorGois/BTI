OBJECTIVE: Sinapic acid (SA, Sinapine), small naturally occurring hydroxycinnamic acid, has a GABA(A) receptor agonistic property and free radical scavenging activity. We examined potential neuroprotective effects of sinapic acid (SA) using global cerebral ischemia animal model. METHODS: MTT assay was performed to determine cytotoxic effects of SA. To examine the neuroprotective effects of SA, SA was administrated for 14 d before 4-vessel occlusion. Also, to determine whether SA prevents cognitive impairment, Morris water maze was performed. RESULTS: In this study, the efficacy of SA for the prevention of neuronal damage and for the reduction of memory impairment was investigated. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that SA confers significant neuroprotection especially for ischemic hippocampal neurons.
