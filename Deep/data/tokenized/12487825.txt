HIV-1 is associated with a neuroAIDS syndrome that includes cognitive impairment. Several components of HIV-1 are capable of affecting cognition, but which of these is the major mediator is unknown. We injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle of mice HIV-1 pseudoviruses expressing the full viral genome with or without the viral coat glycoproteins, gp120/gp41. Only virus possessing gp120/gp41 induced defects in memory as assessed in an active avoidance T-maze footshock paradigm. By itself, gp120 also induced impairments that were reversed by hippocampal cholinergic stimulation. Paradoxically, low doses of gp120 could improve memory. Such low-dose, paradoxic improvement is a characteristic of substances that impair memory by overstimulating pathways that normally sustain memory. Consistent with this, a low, but not a high, dose of gp120 reversed memory impairment induced by overstimulation of the VIPergic system, a memory-sustaining pathway. Further characterization showed that two strains of gp120 (SF and MN) were equally effective at improving memory and that, unlike other actions of gp120, glycation was not required. We conclude that (1) the predominant cognitive-impairing component of HIV-1 is its viral coat glycoproteins, (2) gp120 impairs memory by overstimulating pathways that normally sustain memory, (3) the cognitive effect of gp120 is mediated by its protein core, and (4) gp120 likely impairs memory by affecting the cholinergic/VIPergic system.
