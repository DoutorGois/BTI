Expression of 18 genes was examined at 8 different time points between 1 h and 28 days following cryogenic rat brain injury. The genes include thymidine kinase (TK), p53 tumor suppressor, c-fos, renin, myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), transferrin, transferrin receptor, platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF A), platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF B), platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGF alpha receptor), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGF beta receptor), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGF-R1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and somatostatin. Time courses of gene expression were determined for RNAs derived from hippocampus and cortex. Genes were divided into categories based upon those in which statistically significant changes in expression were first observed at or before 24 h (early genes) and those in which changes were first observed at or after 72 h (late genes). In the present model, many genes demonstrate elevated RNA levels in the cortex prior to hippocampus, following injury. RNAs transcribed from late genes tend to be elevated concurrently in cortex and hippocampus.
