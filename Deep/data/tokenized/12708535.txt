This study examined differential freezing behavior, mediated by cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2) receptors (J. M. Farook et al., 2001), in PVG hooded and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats exposed to a predator. The authors confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction that CCK2 receptor expression in the PVG rats was increased in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex compared with that of SD rats. In addition, 4 variations in the coding region of the CCK2 receptor gene were detected between the PVG hooded and SD rats: 1 in Exon 4, 1 in Intron 2, and 2 in Intron 3. Acute treatment with a CCK2 agonist (CCK-4) or antagonist (LY225910) did not alter the level of CCK2 receptor expression, indicating no difference between the 2 strains in sensitivity of the CCK2 receptor to drugs.
