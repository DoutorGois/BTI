Accurate knowledge of relaxation times is imperative for adjustment of MRI parameters to obtain optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast. As small animal MRI studies are extended to increasingly higher magnetic fields, these parameters must be assessed anew. The goal of this study was to obtain accurate spin-lattice (T(1)) relaxation times for the normal mouse brain at field strengths of 9.4 and 17.6 T. T(1) relaxation times were determined for cortex, corpus callosum, caudate putamen, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, lateral ventricle, and cerebellum and varied from 1651 +/- 28 to 2449 +/- 150 ms at 9.4 T and 1824 +/- 101 to 2772 +/- 235 ms at 17.6 T. A field strength-dependent increase of T(1) relaxation times is shown. The SNR increase at 17.6 T is in good agreement with the expected SNR increase for a sample-dominated noise regime.
