A model of stimulus generalization [Staddon, J.E.R., Reid, A.K., 1990. On the dynamics of generalization. Psychol. Rev. 97, 576-578] was extended by Reid and Staddon [Reid, A.K., Staddon, J.E.R., 1998. A dynamic route finder for the cognitive map. Psychol. Rev. 105, 585-601] to account for the route-finder issue in the Tolman-Guthrie discussion about cognitive maps. This deterministic model has been described as sensitive to initial conditions in terms of the parameters of a diffusion equation [Reid, A.K., Staddon, J.E.R., 1998. A dynamic route finder for the cognitive map. Psychol. Rev. 105, 585-601]. A simulation study was carried out to test this assertion, evaluating whether the pattern of variation in the model output resembled a chaotic pattern. Results indicate that the model is sensitive to initial conditions, suggesting that the spatial navigation task addressed by this model involves non-linear relationships and complexity beyond the apparent simplicity of the stimulus generalization process.
