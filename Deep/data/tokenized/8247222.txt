Phosphorylation of the presynaptic protein B-50/GAP-43, a substrate of protein kinase C (PKC), has been implicated in neuronal mechanisms related to learning and memory. We evaluated both basal (5 mM KCl) and stimulated (30 mM KCl) B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation in 32P-prelabeled hippocampal slices obtained from adult and senescent male Sprague-Dawley rats. The in situ B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation was assayed by quantitative immunoprecipitation. There was no age-related difference in B-50/GAP-43 basal phosphorylation. However, B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation in depolarized slices from aged rats was significantly decreased relative to that of adult animals. Aged rats were treated with either tris buffer or sonicated suspension of phosphatidylserine (PS) in tris buffer (15 mg/kg IP for 7 and 17 days). PS did not affect basal and high K(+)-induced B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation in the 7-day treatment. However, after 17 days, PS restored the K(+)-induced B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation. It is proposed that repeated PS administrations might be beneficial to the age-induced deterioration of endogenous B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation by acting on Ca++ homeostatic mechanisms and/or PKC.
