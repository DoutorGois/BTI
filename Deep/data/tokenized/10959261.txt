The neural stem cells are primary precursors that can self-renew and generate differentiated neurons and glia. Such cells were cultured from adult nervous system. They were identified in the subventricular zone, hippocampus, spinal cord, ependyma and even were cultured from astrocytes. These cells are key players in the formation of the nervous system during development and they hold important clues for brain repair.
