The free radical theory of cell aging may have significant relevance in the pathogenesis of a number of age-related neurological disorders. A large body of experimental evidence supports the existence of a relationship between genomic instability, DNA damage and aging. The age-associated accumulation of oxidative DNA damage is well documented in central nervous system. The decline of mitochondrial respiratory function and loss of normal cellular homeostasis as consequences of excessive accumulation of endogenous oxidative damages to DNA have long been indicated in the aging process. In the present study, age-associated alterations in the content of DNA and accumulation of oxidative DNA damage products such as 8-OHdG and DNA protein cross-links are mainly focused. In parallel, we have also investigated the salubrious effect of l-carnitine against oxidative DNA damage as it possesses energy and antioxidant improving properties. Our results thus reveal that L-carnitine has inhibiting effect on the accumulation of age-related oxidative DNA damage in various brain regions, viz. cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus.
