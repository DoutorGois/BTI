In situ hybridization techniques and quantitative western blotting were used to study the expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 and GLAST in the brains of normal (implanted, non-kindled) and fully kindled rats. Wistar rats were implanted with stimulating electrodes in the basolateral amygdala, and killed 28 days after the stimulated group had shown stage 5 seizures on five occasions. The brains were processed for in situ hybridization of messenger RNA for GLT-1 using 35S-labelled oligonucleotide probes or digoxigenin-labelled riboprobes. Paired (kindled and non-kindled) sections were used for qualitative and quantitative analyses. Image analysis of autoradiograms showed no change in expression of GLT-1 messenger RNA in any region of the hippocampus or in the cortex. An increase in expression of GLT-1 messenger RNA (expressed as percentage difference of control) was observed bilaterally in the striatum in kindled animals (16-21%, P<0.05). Nuclear emulsion-dipped sections showed predominant glial cell labelling in the hippocampus. Particle density analysis revealed reduced cell labelling in some kindled vs control pairs but overall there was no significant reduction in labelling in CA1. Equivalent results were found in CA1 using digoxigenin-labelled riboprobes. Quantitative immunoblotting also revealed no change in GLT-1 or GLAST transporter protein in the hippocampus of kindled animals. From these data we conclude that the enduring seizure susceptibility associated with the fully kindled state is unlikely to involve alterations in hippocampal GLT-1 messenger RNA or GLT-1 and GLAST transporter protein expression.
