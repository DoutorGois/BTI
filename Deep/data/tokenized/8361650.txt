The effect of bifemelane hydrochloride (BFH) on the induction of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and heat shock cognate protein (HSC) 70 mRNAs after transient global ischemia in gerbil brain was investigated by in situ hybridization using cloned cDNA probes selective for each mRNA species. Following 3.5 min of ischemia, HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs were induced in all hippocampal cells. The CA1 cells were almost lost by 7 days. Treatment with BFH twice before and after ischemia (total 60 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced the induction of HSP70 and HSC70 mRNAs both at 8 h and 1 day of the reperfusion, and about half of the CA1 cells survived at 7 days. Thus, the reduction of HSP70 and HSC70 mRNA inductions after ischemia may suggest that BFH reduced intra- and/or post-ischemic stress, and protected CA1 cells from ischemic damage.
