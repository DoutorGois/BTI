The consequences of neonatal cholinergic lesions were examined in male and female rats. Rats were injected intraventricularly with 600 ng of 192 IgG-saporin at 7 days of age and examined behaviorally and histologically at 21, 45 and 90 days of age. 192 IgG-saporin profoundly reduced low affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR)-immunoreactive (IR) and, to a lesser extent, choline acetyltransferase-IR cells in the basal forebrain. Presumptive sympathetic ingrowths (p75NTR- and dopamine beta-hydroxylase-IR) into the hippocampus were first apparent at 45 days of age and were not significantly greater at 90 days. Behaviorally, 192 IgG-saporin increased the time females, but not males, spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Lesioned rats had longer platform location latencies in the Morris water maze only at the first hidden platform training session and did not differ on the rate of learning the platform location or on the no-platform probe trial. Generally, the effects of neonatal cholinergic lesions were not sex dependent and are unlikely to model Rett syndrome, a disorder characterized by forebrain cholinergic deficit which is seen almost exclusively in females.
