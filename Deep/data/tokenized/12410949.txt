OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of selenium on cultured newborn rat's hippocampus neurons survival and outgrowth development. METHODS: Using the technique of primary culture of hippocampal neurons of newborn rat. The different dose of Se (62.5 microgram/L, 125.0 microgram/L, 182.5 microgram/L) were added into the medium at same time. We not only investigated the number of survival of neurons on 1 - 14 d and 1d to 10 d in with and without serum containing-Se medium, but also observed the length outgrowth of the neurite at 16 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h during culture. RESULTS: Selenium could obviously enhance the outgrowth of early processed in 10% fetal serum medium and average length of neurite outgrowth is 15 - 20 micrometer more longer than control groups (P < 0.01) and selenium could also increase the livability of neurons and prolong survival time of cultured neurons in serum-free medium. CONCLUSIONS: Selenium may play a very important role for early processed growth and development of hippocampal neurons.
