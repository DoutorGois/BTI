Memory deficit is a common manifestation of age-related cognitive impairment, of which depression is a frequently occurring comorbidity. Previously, we developed a submissive (Sub) mouse line, validated as a model of depressive-like behavior. Using learning paradigms testing hippocampus-dependent spatial and nonspatial memory, we demonstrate here that Sub mice developed cognitive impairments at earlier age (3 months), compared with wild-type mice. Furthermore, acute hippocampal slices from Sub animals failed to display paired-pulse facilitation, whereas primed burst stimulation elicited significantly enhanced long-term potentiation in region CA1, relative to control mice. Changes in synaptic plasticity were accompanied by markedly reduced hippocampal messenger RNA expression of insulin-like growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Finally, we identified markedly elevated protein levels of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA1 in the hippocampi of Sub mice, which was exacerbated with age. Taken together, the results point to a linkage between depressive-like behavior and the susceptibility to develop age-related cognitive impairment, potentially by hippocampal alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated glutamatergic signaling.
