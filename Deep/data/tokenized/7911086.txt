The mechanisms by which brain cells die after brief episodes of cerebral ischemia are not fully understood. In certain brain regions this damage may not be apparent for days. Hypothyroidism is known to decrease cerebral metabolism. We postulated that this slowing in cerebral metabolism may be neuroprotective after transient cerebral ischemia. To test this hypothesis, a total of 10 gerbils had thyroidectomies performed 2 weeks prior to ischemia. Six gerbils served as euthyroid controls. All animals were exposed to 5 min of transient ischemia and sacrificed 7 days after the insult. Silver degeneration staining was used for histological evaluation. Hippocampal damage [subiculum (P < 0.001), CA1 (P = 0. < .001), CA3 (P < 0.05), and CA4 (P < 0.001)] was significantly less in the hypothyroid animals. There was also significantly less damage in the cerebral cortex (P < 0.05) and thalamus (P < 0.05) in the hypothyroid animals. The exact mechanism of this protection is not fully understood but could be secondary to a decrease in the metabolic activity, or a reduced generation of free radicals (as is seen with protection from ischemia in kidney and liver under hypothyroid conditions). Further studies are required in order to gain a better understanding of the protective effects of hypothyroidism on cerebral ischemia.
