The effect of single dose of NMDA glutamate receptor blockage administration on the hippocampal LTP was evaluated in animal model of inborn cerebellar degeneration. We compared the level of possible LTP blockade in two groups of animals, Lurcher mutant mice and their healthy littermates which served as controls. In the second part of the study we tested group of mice which were influenced repeatedly by the same NMDA blocker (MK-801) during behavioral experiments. Our results suggest a similar effect of blockade either after single or chronic MK-801 administration; both of them practically disrupted LTP generation with differences between healthy and neurodegenerative animals.
