CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old man was diagnosed with band or "bow tie" optic atrophy with a right homonymous hemianopia. Computerized tomography (CT) revealed a calcified lesion in the left hippocampus. Craniotomy and tumor resection were performed. The biopsy revealed a subependymoma of the temporal horn of the left ventricular system. DISCUSSION: Optic tract lesions are uncommon clinical entities, in which homonymous hemianopia and contralateral band optic atrophy are characteristic. Subependymomas are infrequent and benign tumors that are typically associated with the ventricular system.
