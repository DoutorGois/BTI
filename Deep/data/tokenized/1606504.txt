GABA-containing axon terminals were observed in the distal two-thirds of the dentate molecular layer to contact spines and dendrites of the granule cells. These contacts have the morphological characteristics of inhibitory synapses: they contain pleomorphic vesicles and have symmetrical junctional specializations. Convergence of an asymmetrical, non-GABAergic and a symmetrical, GABAergic synapse on one spine was often observed.
