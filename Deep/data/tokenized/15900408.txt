Zinc is a modulator of glutamatergic inputs in the hippocampus. In the retina, however, we previously reported that endogenous zinc is present in the non-glutamatergic neural processes and earlier electrophysiological studies suggest that zinc is a modulator of inhibitory signaling pathways, which are mediated by glycine and GABA. AII amacrine cells, a subpopulation of glycinergic amacrine cells, are identified by selective immunoreactivity for parvalbumin in the rat retina. In the present study, therefore, we focused on whether zinc is present in AII amacrine cells using silver amplification combined with immunohistochemistry in the rat retina. We also examined whether zinc modulate glycine response in the rat retina by the patch clamp technique. Association of silver precipitates with the parvalbumin-immunoreactive neural processes was observed at the ultrastructural level. We also found that zinc existed in the neural processes which were not parvalbumin-immunoreactive. Glycine-induced responses were augmented when the concentration of Zn(2+) was below 10 microM, but inhibited at Zn(2+) concentrations of 50 microM or more. Our results suggest the notion that zinc in neural processes of retinal neurons modulates the inhibitory signaling pathway, particularly that mediated by glycine receptors in AII amacrine cells.
