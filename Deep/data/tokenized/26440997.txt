Postnatal exposure to cigarette smoke during infancy is associated with increased number of respiratory illnesses, impaired pulmonary function, and the occurrence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). It is also associated with reduced cognitive functioning and attention deficits in childhood. Nicotine, the major neurotoxic component of cigarette smoke, induces its actions by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Using a piglet model of postnatal nicotine exposure, we studied the immunohistochemical expression of nAChR subunits alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, alpha7, alpha9, beta1 and beta2 in the brainstem medulla and the hippocampus, given the role of these structures in cardiorespiratory control and cognition, respectively. We compared piglets exposed postnatally to 2mg/kg/day nicotine for 14 days (n=14: 7 males: 7 females) to controls (n=14: 7 males: 7 females). In the hippocampus, decreased expression was seen for alpha3 in CA1 (p=0.017), alpha9 in CA1 (p<0.001) and CA2 (p<0.001), beta1 in CA1 (p=0.001) and CA2 (p=0.001) and beta2 in CA3 (p=0.036). In the medulla, the nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract had increased alpha2 and alpha4; vestibular nucleus increased alpha2 and alpha3, and decreased alpha4; hypoglossal decreased alpha3 and beta1; dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus decreased alpha4 and beta1. This is the first demonstration that non-classical nAChR subunits are affected by postnatal nicotine in the developing brain, and the implications are discussed.
