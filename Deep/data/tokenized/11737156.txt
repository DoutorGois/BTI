PURPOSE: The specific mechanisms by which low concentrations of cyclosporine induce seizures and low concentrations of phencyclidine provoke behavioral excitation remain to be elucidated. Both compounds block N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The aim of this study was to determine if low concentrations of the NMDA-receptor blockers increase the seizure susceptibility. METHODS: Guinea pig hippocampal slices were exposed to artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing the NMDA blocker dl-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate (APV; 0.1-10 microM). Extracellular field potentials were recorded from CA1 and CA3 regions. RESULTS: Low concentrations of APV induced epileptiform burst discharges (0.1-0.25 microM), whereas higher doses failed to decrease the seizure threshold (1-10 microM). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the excitatory effect of low concentrations NMDA blockers may play a role in the neurotoxicity of aforementioned substances.
