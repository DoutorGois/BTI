A boy suffering from epileptic seizures experienced five episodes of a twilight state. His twilight states continued for at least two weeks, and were characterized by behavioral disorders and severe autonomic symptoms. Sometimes functional ileus was present. The electroencephalographic finding in the first episode was 6-per-second phantom spike and wave complex (PSW). For treatment, a combination of carbamazepine and sodium valproate was useful in preventing the reappearance of the episode of the twilight state and in suppressing PSW. From the clinical and electroencephalographic findings and therapeutic response to antiepileptics, the episodes were considered to have originated in localized epileptic discharges in the hippocampal, amygdaloidal and hypothalamic regions.
