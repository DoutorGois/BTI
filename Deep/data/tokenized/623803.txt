A mathematical model is presented of spatial configuration of the field generated by hippocampus surface. Calculations have shown that the potential induced on the cortex surface is almost 5-fold smaller than that under the hippocampus surface. Theoretical results well agree with the experimental data and allow a conclusion to be inferred that passive penetration of fields generated by subcortical structures does not exceed 20% of the total level of spontaneous EEG.
