Low-frequency stimulation is associated with long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy in various brain structures. Like long-term potentiation (LTP), homosynaptic LTD in area CA1 of the hippocampus appears to require NMDA receptor activation, changes in postsynaptic calcium concentration and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation. Arachidonic acid (AA) is released after the activation of calcium-dependent phospholipases and free AA is rapidly metabolized to a family of bioactive products (the eicosanoids) which are thought to be both intracellular and extracellular messengers. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways of AA metabolism in the formation of homosynaptic LTD in the rat hippocampus. Stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 min was used to produce homosynaptic depression in area CA1 of hippocampal slices. LTD induction was partially blocked by bromophenacyl bromide (50-100 microM), a selective PLA2 inhibitor, and by the a nonselective lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA; 100 microM). In contrast, the specific cyclooxygenase blocker indomethacin (100 microM) did not significantly reduce hippocampal LTD. Since NDGA interferes with LTD formation, we examined whether specific inhibitors of 5- and 12-lipoxygenases were capable of blocking LTD expression. The 12-lipoxygenase inhibitor baicalein at a concentration of 50 microM reduced LTP formation when given in the bath, an effect that was less pronounced with the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor AA-861. These data suggest that the activation of endogenous PLA2 and the formation of 12-lipoxygenase metabolites of AA may be important factors controlling the expression of hippocampal LTD.
