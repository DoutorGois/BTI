In recombinant cell lines, functional GABA(B) receptors are only formed by the heterodimerisation between two related G-protein coupled receptor proteins GABA(B)R1 (GBR1) and GABA(B)R2 (GBR2), whilst the individual GBR1 or GBR2 do not produce fully functional receptors. To determine whether the heterodimerisation occurs in vivo, novel polyclonal antibodies targeting the C termini of GBR1 and GBR2, were raised in different species, characterised, and used to determine the relative localisation of the reported heterodimer components in human brain tissue, using immunohistochemistry. The use of different species for the raising of the antisera allowed double immunofluorescent labelling of the receptors as an indication of GBR1/GBR2 receptor co-localisation in human brain. The presence of both proteins is reported in cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex, thalamus and basal ganglia. Regions of the brainstem including pons and medulla, also express GBR1 and GBR2 protein. The double immunofluorescence demonstrated that GBR1 and GBR2 are co-localised in the human cerebellar cortex. Together these results suggest the widespread distribution of GABA(B) receptors in human brain, and that GABA(B) receptors GBR1 and GBR2 can exist in the same cell, and therefore may function as a heterodimer in the human brain.
