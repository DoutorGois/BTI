N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) has been reported to interact with the GTP-binding Ni-protein; we have examined its effect on adenosine receptor binding in feline cortical membranes and on adenosine-receptor mediated effects on cyclic AMP accumulation in rat hippocampal slices. Treatment of cortical membranes with NEM (100 microM for 5 min) altered the binding of [3H]-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) from being almost exclusively to a single class of high affinity sites (KD = 1.65 nM) to binding at two classes of sites (KDH = 2.1 nM, KDL = 102 nM). The total number of binding sites was similar (825-845 fmol mg-1 in control membranes, 944-1428 fmol mg-1 in NEM-treated membranes). In rat hippocampal slices treated with forskolin (0.3 microM) L-PIA produced a biphasic effect on cyclic AMP accumulation: an inhibition at 0.03 to 1 microM and at higher concentrations, a stimulation. Treatment with 50 microM NEM selectively inhibited the inhibitory phase, causing stimulation at lower concentrations of L-PIA. At 50 microM, NEM did not alter basal or forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation but at higher concentrations inhibition was observed. It is concluded that NEM can, in certain doses, selectively block adenosine A1-receptor-mediated effects without affecting A2-receptor-mediated actions in the same tissue. It is suggested that this is due to NEM affecting the Ni guanine nucleotide binding protein.
