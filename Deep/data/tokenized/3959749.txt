In this account we report in vivo effects of a plant lipid preparation (MMPL) on brain cholesterol and the activity and learning performance of aging male rats. Three-month-old rats were fed for 3 months with a diet that was enriched with 3% MMPL. Another group of 18 month-old rats was fed for 6 months with a 3% MMPL-enriched diet. This food regime lowered markedly the cholesterol level in the hippocampal and cortical regions and increased their lipid membrane fluidity. The animals of both age groups also responded to MMPL with a higher activity and their learning performances, compared to normal diet-fed animals, improved notably. This improvement continued at least 4 months after terminating the supply of MMPL. Significant inverse correlationships were obtained between the length of the training period required to attain proper criteria and cholesterol levels of the hippocampal and cortical brain fractions.
