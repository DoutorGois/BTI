Coated vesicles within dentate gyrus granule cell dendrites were found free in the cytoplasm and also attached to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and plasmalemma. Coated vesicles began increasing in number 40-48 h following partial dendritic deafferentation. This increase continued up to 15-30 days postlesion, after which the population steadily declined to control values. These results combined with the findings of previous studies suggest an involvement of coated vesicles in synaptic reinnervation.
