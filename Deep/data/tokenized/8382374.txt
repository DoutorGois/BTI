The efficient introduction of genetic material into quiescent nerve cells is important in the study of brain function and for gene therapy of neurological disorders. A replication-deficient adenoviral vector that contained a reporter gene encoding beta-galactosidase infected rat nerve cells in vitro and in vivo. beta-Galactosidase was expressed in almost all sympathetic neurons and astrocytes in culture. After stereotactic inoculations into the rat hippocampus and the substantia nigra, beta-galactosidase activity was detected for 2 months. Infected cells were identified as microglial cells, astrocytes, or neurons with anatomical, morphological, and immunohistochemical criteria. No obvious cytopathic effect was observed.
