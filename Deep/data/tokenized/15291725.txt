Themes emerging from the collection of articles in the Special Section on Long-Term Spatial Memory include the notion of multiple spatial systems, the relation between spatial representations and episodic memory, the role of context, and the neural systems involved in space. The authors conclude that distinguishing between egocentric and allocentric spatial systems makes sense of both behavioral and neurobiological data. The special role of the hippocampal system in allocentric space, and as a consequence, in context, suggests how a spatial system might end up central to the ability to remember episodes.
