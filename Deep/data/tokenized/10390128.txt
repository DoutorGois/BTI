Emerging evidence suggests that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic functions. It is expressed constitutively in the developing kidney and brain, playing a role in their proper maturation and function. Further, COX-2 expression may be up-regulated at certain sites: in the kidney during sodium restriction; in the microglia of cognitive centers within the hippocampus and cortex in Alzheimer's disease; and in intestinal adenomas and colon tumors. On the basis of COX-2 expression in Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer, COX-2-specific inhibitors may find clinical utility in the prevention or treatment of these conditions. Despite this apparently optimistic outlook for future uses of COX-2 inhibitors, most of the findings supporting this perspective are based on in vitro and in vivo models and must be rigorously corroborated in human studies, some of which are already planned.
