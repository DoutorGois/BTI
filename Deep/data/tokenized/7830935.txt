The distribution of immediate early gene zif-268, c-fos, c-jun and jun-D mRNAs was investigated in the visual cortex, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and hippocampus of the adult cat brain with in situ hybridization. In area 17, zif-268, c-jun and jun-D were found predominantly in layers II-III and VI, while c-fos mRNA was abundant in layer VI. In area 18, the zif-268, c-fos and c-jun labelling pattern was identical to that of area 17, this was not true for jun-D. In area 19, only c-jun retained the lamination pattern of areas 17 and 18, while zif-268, c-fos and jun-D were homogeneously distributed. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, only c-fos and jun-D resulted in labelling. In the pyramidal layer of hippocampus, zif-268 was found in CA1-4, c-jun in CA1-3, and jun-D in CA2-4. In the dentate gyrus, c-jun was abundant, jun-D moderate and zif-268 faint. C-fos labelling was absent in the hippocampal formation.
