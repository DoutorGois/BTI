This study investigated the effect of green tea (GT) on short and long term declarative memory and oxidative damage induced by transient ischemia-reperfusion (IR) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into 8 groups of 10 according the stroke type induced: Sham IR, Sham IR+GT, IR, IR+GT, Sham ICH, Sham ICH+GT, ICH, ICH+GT. Supplementation with GT was initiated 10days before stroke surgery and continuous for 6days after (GT dose 400mg/kg). Short (STM) and long term memory (LTM) we evaluated with object recognition task (OR) and hippocampus were used to evaluate parameters related to oxidative stress (ROS, lipid peroxidation and total antioxidant capacity). The rats subjected to IR and ICH showed STM and LTM deficits and GT intervention prevented it in both stroke models. IR and ICH induced increase on ROS levels in hippocampus. ICH increased the lipid peroxidation in hippocampus and the GT supplementation avoided it. IR induced decrease on total antioxidant capacity and GT prevented it. These results reveal that GT supplementation presents a neuroprotective role, attenuates redox imbalance and might have a beneficial impact on cognitive function after stroke.
