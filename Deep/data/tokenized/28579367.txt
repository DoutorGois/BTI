In rodents, fragmented and low levels of maternal care have been implicated in age-related cognitive decline and the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's pathology. In contrast, enhancing early postnatal maternal care has been associated with improved cognitive function later in life. Here we examined whether early postnatal handling of mouse pups from postnatal days 2-9 enhanced maternal care and whether this affected cognition and Alzheimer pathology at 5 and 11months of age in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model for Alzheimer's disease. Brief, 15min daily episodes of separating offspring from their dams from postnatal days 2-9 (early handling, EH) increased maternal care of the dam towards her pups upon reunion. At 11 (but not 5) months of age, EH APPswe/PS1dE1 mice displayed significantly reduced amyloid plaque pathology in the hippocampus. At this age, EH also prevented short-term working memory deficits while restoring impairments in contextual fear memory formation in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. EH did not modulate amyloid pathology in the amygdala, nor did it affect auditory fear conditioning deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. We conclude that increased levels of maternal care during the early life period delays amyloid accumulation and cognitive decline in an Alzheimer's mouse model, involving the hippocampus, but not to the amygdala. These studies highlight the importance of the early postnatal period in modulating resilience to develop Alzheimer's pathology later in life.
