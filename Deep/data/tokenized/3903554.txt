The perfusion of slices of rat hippocampus with solutions containing N-methyl-DL-aspartic acid (NMA), kainic acid, ibotenic acid or quinolinic acid produced a reduction in the size of antidromically evoked population spikes in the CA1 pyramidal cells or dentate gyrus granule cells. The relative potencies of these compounds on CA1 cells compared with granule cells were kainate 3.65, quinolinate 3.46, NMA 2.19 and ibotenate 1.50. Since the former two compounds are known to show a degree of selective toxicity towards the CA1 cells, whereas NMA and ibotenate do not, these results are consistent with the excitotoxic hypothesis that excitation and neurotoxicity are related.
