Neurosteroids administered during the neonatal period affect the development of several brain systems. We examined the effects of neonatal treatment with pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on a marker of neuronal dendrites, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), in rat brain. Neonatal treatment with pregnenolone and DHEA increased the expression of MAP-2 in the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens but not in the prefrontal cortex, striatum or amygdala in adulthood.
