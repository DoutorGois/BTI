The role of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) was studied in CA1 neurons in guinea pig hippocampal slices. In standard solution, short tetanic stimulation consisting of 15 pulses at 100 Hz induced LTP, while three short trains of low-frequency stimulation (LFS; 200 pulses at 1 Hz) at 18-min intervals or one long train of LFS (1000 pulses at 1 Hz) induced stable LTD in both the slope of the field EPSP (S-EPSP) and the amplitude of the population spike (A-PS). Bath application of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an IP3R antagonist, or of alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), a wide-spectrum metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, during weak tetanic stimulation significantly increased the magnitude of the LTP in both the S-EPSP and A-PS. Three short trains of LFS or one long train of LFS delivered in the presence of 2-APB or MCPG did not induce LTD, but elicited LTP. Based on these results, we conclude that, in hippocampal CA1 neurons, IP3Rs play an important role in synaptic plasticity by attenuating LTP and facilitating LTD.
