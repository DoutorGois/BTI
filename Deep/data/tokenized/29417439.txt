Tyrosinemia type II is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a deficiency in the activity of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase, leading to tyrosine accumulation in the body. Although the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood, several studies have showed that higher levels of tyrosine are related to oxidative stress and therefore may affect the cholinergic system. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic administration of L-tyrosine on choline acetyltransferase activity (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the brain of rats. Moreover, we also examined the effects of one antioxidant treatment (N-acetylcysteine (NAC) + deferoxamine (DFX)) on cholinergic system. Our results showed that the chronic administration of L-tyrosine decreases the ChAT activity in the cerebral cortex, while the AChE activity was increased in the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex. Moreover, we found that the antioxidant treatment was able to prevent the decrease in the ChAT activity in the cerebral cortex. However, the increase in AChE activity induced by L-tyrosine was partially prevented the in the hippocampus and striatum, but not in the cerebral cortex. Our results also showed no differences in the aversive and spatial memory after chronic administration of L-tyrosine. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated an increase in AChE activity in the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebral cortex and an increase of ChAT in the cerebral cortex, without cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the alterations in the cholinergic system were partially prevented by the co-administration of NAC and DFX. Thus, the restored central cholinergic system by antioxidant treatment further supports the view that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of tyrosinemia type II.
