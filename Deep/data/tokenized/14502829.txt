The role of copper on the CA1 piramidal neurons and their sinaptic connections to the Schaffer's collateral was investigated using the field excitatory post-sinaptic potential (fEPSP). The same fEPSP was used to study copper effects on Long-term potentiation (LTP). We have found that copper 10 microM has an inhibitory action on the fEPSP. Similar effects were demonstrated with 10 microM of GABA. Moreover, copper showed a strong inhibitory action on the consolidated LTP. However, copper washout left a significant and persistent excitatory response. In our opinion, copper shows a dual sinaptic effect depending on the sinaptic experience.
