Previous studies from our laboratory showed that subchronic exposure to low levels of Pb resulted in significant decrease in dopamine (DA) content, attenuation of stimulus-induced release of DA in the dopaminergic projection area of nucleus accumbens (NA), and alterations in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity in rat whole brain homogenates. The present study reported here was conducted to assess the functional integrity of DA synthesis in different brain regions of rats subchronically (90-days) exposed to 50 ppm Pb by measuring the activity of the rate limiting enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase, in seven brain regions. In Pb-exposed rats, TH activity was reduced in two of the seven brain regions investigated, i.e., nucleus accumbens (42% reduction) and frontal cortex (61% reduction) when compared to controls. In contrast, Pb exposure did not affect the TH activity in cerebellum, brainstem, hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum. The changes in TH activity in nucleus accumbens (NA) and frontal cortex (FC) in Pb-exposed rats were further confirmed by Western blot analysis using TH polyclonal antibody. Collectively, these results indicate that low level subchronic Pb exposure may affect TH protein in these brain regions.
