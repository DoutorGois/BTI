Newborn piglets were submitted to normobaric hypoxia (5% O2, 95% N2) for either 1 or 4 h. The effects of hypoxia on the neonatal brain were characterized through a time-course analysis of levels of various proteins such as heat shock proteins (HSP27, 70, and 90), hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), hemeoxygenase-2 (HO-2), and caspase-3. The expression of these proteins was determined at different stages of recovery up to 72 h in cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus by Western blot analysis in hypoxic maintained animals that were made hypoxic at either 20 or 37 degrees C. In all regions of the brain, HIF-1alpha and HSP27 expression were strongly increased until 22 h of recovery. No significant changes were observed for HSP70, HSP90, and HO-2. A small elevation of expression of nNOS was observed at early stages in the cerebellum and the cortex with no change in the hippocampus. Expression of caspase 3 was strongly increased in the cortex 24 and 48 h after hypoxia but unchanged in the hippocampus. These results are presented in terms of the porcine model of nonischemic hypoxia and its delayed neuronal effects on the cerebral outcome. Because of their recently established biochemical and functional interactions, the expression of the main HSPs, HIF-1alpha, nNOS, and caspase-3 after hypoxia are delineated.
