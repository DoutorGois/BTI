A modified method for improved preservation and optical resolution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing structures in adult rat brain is described. Optimal tissue preparation included fixation in paraformaldehyde 4%, glutaraldehyde 0.1%, and sucrose 7% in 0.1M Sorensen's phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, rinsing in buffer 50 mM with respect to NH4Cl and 2% with respect to sucrose, acetone dehydration, vacuum infiltration with LKB Historesin, and polymerization at 4 C, overnight incubation of 10 microns sections at 37 C in the AChE histochemical reaction mixture and silver intensification according to Hedreen et al. Demonstration of AChE enzyme activity in the cholinergic projection from the rat basal forebrain to the ipsilateral hippocampus exemplifies the usefulness of the technique. The method provides an excellent demonstration of AChE-positive axonal processes and enables the pharmacohistochemical visualization of cholinergic neurons. This procedure offers a convenient method for analysis of cholinergic neurons that avoids potential artifacts inherent in other AChE histochemical procedures.
