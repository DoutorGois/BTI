We have examined the effectiveness of the in vitro rat hippocampal slice preparation as a means of rapidly and specifically detecting the marine algal toxins saxitoxin, brevetoxin, and domoic acid and have identified toxin-specific electrophysiological signatures for each. Brevetoxin (PbTX3, 50-200 nM) produced a significant reduction in orthodromic population spike amplitude which was quick to reverse during a 50 min wash-out, while antidromic population spikes and field EPSPs exhibited only slight reductions, and fibre spiof orthodrokes showed no change at all. Domoic acid (100 nM) produced a robust, reversible increase in amplitude mic spikes, and the appearance of multiple spikes (i.e., epileptiform activity) within minutes of toxin wash-in. Other notable features of the domoic acid signature included a significant decrease in amplitude of the field EPSPs, and a complete absence of effect on either antidromic or fibre spikes. Fifty nanomolar saxitoxin (PSP) abolished all responses in all slices. Only antidromic spikes showed any recovery during wash-out. Field EPSP and fiber spike analysis further demonstrated that the preparation is capable of reliably detecting saxitoxin in a linearly responsive fashion at toxin concentrations of 25-200 nM, and tests of naturally contaminated shellfish confirmed the utility of this assay as a screening method for PSP. Our findings suggest that the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation has potential in the detection and analysis of three marine algal toxins important to the shellfish industry.
