The present experiments were designed to investigate the effects of maternal stress on cognitive and endocrine parameters in the adult offspring. Pregnant rats were stressed daily during the last week of pregnancy (days 15-19) by restraint, and the performance of their offspring in the Morris water maze was recorded. Plasma corticosterone levels after swimming and the status of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) were determined. During acquisition of the task, prenatally stressed (PS) males - but not females - showed longer escape latencies than non-stressed controls when swimming in cold (10 degrees C) but not in warm (20 degrees C) water. This sex- and prenatal stress-specific difference was even more pronounced during reversal learning of the task. In contrast, PS females - but not males - had higher basal corticosterone levels and a lower density of hippocampal corticosteroid receptors than non-stressed controls. In all animals irrespective of treatment, swimming in the water maze causes an increase of corticosterone that was smaller on day 8 of swimming than on day 1. After swimming in cold water, the rise in corticosterone levels in females was steeper and returned faster to baseline values than after swimming in warm water. A similar pattern could be seen in PS females when compared to their non-stressed controls. The data suggest that prenatal stress impairs spatial learning in males but not in females. Basal and stress-induced increases in corticosterone levels, however, were altered in PS females and not in PS males; i.e., prenatal stress-induced changes in corticosterone secretion were not paralleled by prenatal stress-induced deficits in spatial learning.
