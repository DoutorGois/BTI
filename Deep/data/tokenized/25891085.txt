AIM: The proteolytic cleavage of Tau is involved in Abeta-induced neuronal dysfunction and cell death. In this study, we investigated whether atorvastatin could prevent Tau cleavage and hence prevent Abeta1-42 oligomer (AbetaO)-induced neurotoxicity in cultured cortical neurons. METHODS: Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were incubated in the presence of AbetaOs (1.25 mumol/L) with or without atorvastatin pretreatment. ATP content and LDH in the culture medium were measured to assess the neuronal viability. Caspase-3/7 and calpain protease activities were detected. The levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-GSK3beta, p35 and Tau proteins were measured using Western blotting. RESULTS: Treatment of the neurons with AbetaO significantly decreased the neuronal viability, induced rapid activation of calpain and caspase-3/7 proteases, accompanied by Tau degradation and relatively stable fragments generated in the neurons. AbetaO also suppressed Akt and Erk1/2 kinase activity, while increased GSK3beta and Cdk5 activity in the neurons. Pretreatment with atorvastatin (0.5, 1, 2.5 mumol/L) dose-dependently inhibited AbetaO-induced activation of calpain and caspase-3/7 proteases, and effectively diminished the generation of Tau fragments, attenuated synaptic damage and increased neuronal survival. Atorvastatin pretreatment also prevented AbetaO-induced decreases in Akt and Erk1/2 kinase activity and the increases in GSK3beta and Cdk5 kinase activity. CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin prevents AbetaO-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by inhibiting calpain- and caspase-mediated Tau cleavage.
