An intriguing feature of global ischaemic cell loss is the sensitivity of certain neuronal populations and the relative resistance of others. Silver impregnation was used to ascertain the pattern and extent of cell loss following 15 min 4 VO ischaemia in the rat. Cell loss was observed primarily in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, as assessed by both cresyl violet and silver stains. However, degenerating neurones were most readily identifiable when impregnated with silver, and additional regions of neuronal loss were selectively revealed by silver staining in the hippocampal hilar region, dorsolateral striatum, neocortex and cingulate cortex. Damage to cingulate is a hitherto unreported consequence of 4 VO global ischaemia. This novel finding may have implications for ischaemic brain-behaviour relationships.
