In this study, we investigated the involvement of the interaction between sigma receptors and the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP pathway in short term memory in mice, assessed through spontaneous alternation behavior in a Y-maze. N(G)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and 7-nitro indazole, both nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, impaired the spontaneous alternation behavior. These impairments were attenuated by (+) SKF 10,047 and (+) pentazocine, sigma(1) receptor agonists. Further, the sigma(1) receptor antagonist, NE-100, reversed the improvements made by sigma receptor agonists. Cyclic GMP levels and nitric oxide synthase activity in the hippocampus were reduced by treatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The suppressive effects of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester on the cyclic GMP levels were reversed by co-treatment with (+) SKF 10,047, but the decline in nitric oxide synthase activity was not. These results suggest that the nitric oxide/cyclic GMP pathway in the hippocampus is responsible for spontaneous alternation behavior in a Y-maze. Further, the ameliorating effects of (+) SKF 10,047 on the impairment of spontaneous alternation behavior may be mediated through activation of guanylate cyclase, but not nitric oxide synthase in the hippocampus of mice.
