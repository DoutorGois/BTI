Preferential swelling and vacuolation of dendrites were observed electron microscopically in different brain regions of rats treated with LiCl in a dose of 6-18 mmol/kg for 1-6 days. The most severe fine structural changes were revealed in the hippocampus. Low-dose (0.33 mmol/kg) lithium treatment lasting for a year did not cause any morphologically detectable alterations in the rat brain. In vitro studies showed a reduction of dendro-axonal process network of neurons measured by morphometric means after lithium exposure. Using different cultures of neuronal and glial cell populations, higher lithium uptake was observed for neuron-enriched cultures.
