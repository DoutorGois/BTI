1. The relationships between the in vivo and in vitro epileptogenic effects of opioids or enkephalins and the electrophysiological activity of inhibitors of endogenous enkephalinase were analyzed. 2. The functional effects of the inhibition of the endogenous enkephalinase has been compared with the role of the endogenous opioid peptidergic system in the control of neuronal excitability.
