OBJECTIVE: To further characterize the capacity of lovastatin to prevent hippocampal neuronal loss after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) METHOD: Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (A) control rats, received neither pilocarpine nor lovastatin (n=5); (B) control rats, received just lovastatin (n=5); (C) rats that received just pilocarpine (n=5); (D) rats that received pilocarpine and lovastatin (n=5). After pilocarpine injection (350 mg/kg, i.p.), only rats that displayed continuous, convulsive seizure activity were included in our study. Seizure activity was monitored behaviorally and terminated with an injection of diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) after 4 h of convulsive SE. The rats treated with lovastatin received two doses of 20 mg/kg via an oesophagic probe immediately and 24 hours after SE induction. Seven days after pilocarpine-induced SE, all the animals were perfused and their brains were processed for histological analysis through Nissl method. RESULTS: The cell counts in the Nissl-stained sections performed within the hippocampal formation showed a significant cell loss in rats that received pilocarpine and presented SE (CA1=26.8 +/- 13.67; CA3=38.1 +/- 7.2; hilus=43.8 +/- 3.95) when compared with control group animals (Group A: CA1=53.2 +/- 9.63; CA3=63.5 +/- 13.35; hilus=59.08 +/- 10.24; Group B: CA1=74.3 +/- 8.16; CA3=70.1 +/- 3.83; hilus=70.6 +/- 5.10). The average neuronal cell number of CA1 subfield of rats that present SE and received lovastatin (44.4 +/- 17.88) was statically significant increased when compared with animals that just presented SE. CONCLUSION: Lovastatin exert a neuroprotective role in the attenuation of brain damage after SE.
