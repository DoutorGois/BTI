The objective of the present study was to investigate whether neonatal exposure to single PCB congeners 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (IUPAC 126) (co-planar) and 2,3,3',4,4'-pentachlorobiphenyl (IUPAC 105) (mono-ortho `co-planar like') when given as one single dose (0.14-14 mumol/kg body weight per os) to 10 day old male NMRI mice could induce neurotoxic effects in the adult animal, as earlier seen for some ortho-substituted PCBs. Furthermore, to ascertain whether behavioural aberrations, both in spontaneous behaviour and in learning and memory function, were followed by changes in the cholinergic and/or the dopaminergic system, and whether behavioural changes could worsen with age. It was found that neonatal exposure to 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl can induce persistent aberrations in spontaneous behaviour and that this derangement can grow worse with age. Furthermore, this exposure affected also learning and memory functions in the adult animal and in the animals showing this deficit, the cholinergic nicotinic receptors in the hippocampus were affected. Exposure to 2,3,3',4,4'-pentachlorobiphenyl, at the same dose or higher, did not cause any significant change in the investigated behavioural variables, spontaneous and swim-maze behaviour.
