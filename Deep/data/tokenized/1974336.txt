The NMDA receptor antagonists APV (5 micrograms/10 microliters/rat i.c.v.) or ketamine (12.5 mg/kg i.p.), administered 5 min before training, decreased the retention of a passive avoidance conditioning. In hippocampal or cortical slices of APV- and ketamine-treated rats, 5-HT-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism was potentiated. It is suggested that excitatory amino acids could modulate the mechanism operative in signal transduction of serotonin; this interaction could play a role in memory retention.
