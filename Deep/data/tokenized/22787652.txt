Electrical stimulation of anterior nucleus of thalamus was effective for refractory focal epilepsy in a clinical trial. The basic mechanisms of brain stimulation are understudied; some results are contradictory. Outcome depends upon detailed parameters of stimulation and other factors. Recurrent electrical stimulation at certain parameters can produce kindling, whereas other parameters have an anti-seizure and possibly an anti-epileptogenic effect. Stimulation may inhibit inhibitory pathways, and synchronize or desynchronize networks participating in seizure generation. Acute inhibition of seizures by stimulation is different from inhibition of seizures in chronic animal models or prevention of epileptogenesis. Other factors may account for increasing efficacy of nerve stimulation against seizures over time. Multiple brain structures have been stimulated to influence laboratory models of seizures, including cerebellum, locus coeruleus, substantia nigra, caudate, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, subthalamus, centromedian thalamus, anterior nucleus of thalamus, neocortex and others. Results have been mixed and clinical studies have sometimes proceeded with only limited understanding of the basic mechanisms of brain stimulation. In contrast to deep brain stimulation (DBS) for movement disorders, neurostimulation for epilepsy often has moved retrograde, from pilot clinical studies back to the laboratory for validation and modification of stimulation methods.
