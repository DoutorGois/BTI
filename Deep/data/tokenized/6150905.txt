We determined the plasmatic corticosterone and 5-HT, NA and DA levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and septum at different hours. Significant fluctuations were found to occur in the biogenic amines and corticosterone plasmatic levels. Highest levels of this hormone were detected at the end of the light period. Plasma corticosterone was found to be inversely correlated with 5-HT and DA levels of amygdala and directly correlated with hypothalamus DA level.
