In this study we describe the preventive effect of interruption of the supramammillohippocampal afferents on the Fos expression in the forebrain and epileptic discharges in the hippocampal electroencephalogram in rat model of kainic acid-induced limbic seizure. Little was known about the contribution of different degrees of neural activity of hippocampal principal cells to the genesis and spread of limbic seizures in the forebrain structures. Following kainic acid injection to the amygdala with or without concurrent injection of muscimol to the supramammillary nucleus, behavioral changes and electroencephalograms were observed in freely moving rats. The animals were processed for Fos immunocytochemical analysis at several time points. The latest expression of Fos at 2h was seen in hippocampal CA1-CA3, ventrolateral thalamic nuclei and mediodorsal caudate putamen, while the early Fos expression at 0.5h was seen in the piriform, entorhinal and other cortices, the thalamic midline nuclei and hypothalamic nuclei. Muscimol injection to the supramammillary nucleus prevented Fos expression in the CA1-CA3 region and reduced that in the forebrain regions with the latest Fos expression, but did not affect Fos expression in other forebrain regions with early Fos expression. This treatment also eliminated epileptic discharges and attenuated all waves in hippocampus. These findings indicate that an acute interruption of the facilitatory hypothalamic afferents by intrasupramammillary injection of muscimol may cause the inactivation of the disinhibition mechanism for hippocampal throughput at the dentate gyrus, resulting in the blockade of the genesis and spread of limbic seizures in the hippocampus.
