As a result of repeated experience of victories and defeats in mice of C57BL/6 line, submissive and aggressive types of behaviour were elaborated, the stabilization of which was accompanied by a change in serotonin and noradrenaline content in various parts of the brain, at least of two kinds. Nonspecific unindirected changes in transmitter' levels found in both groups of animals in comparison with the control, are apparently due to the experience of zoosocial contracts. Changes were also noted connected with specificity of the observed behaviour.
