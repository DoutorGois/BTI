OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effects and mechanisms of astragaloside (AST) and astragalus saponin I (ASI) on the memory impairment in senescent rats treated by glucocorticoid (GC). METHOD: Y maze test was performed to determine the effects of AST and ASI on memory impairment of hydrocortisone(HC)-induced senescent rats. Using Ca2+ sensitive fluorescent indicator (Furo-2), free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured by double wavelength fluorescence sepectrophotometer in thymocytes and hippocampal neurons induced dexamethasone (DEX). And apoptosis was detected by DNA gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. RESULT: Compared with HC control, AST and ASI can improve the memory of the senescent rats treated by HC, lower [Ca2+]i and suppress apoptosis of thymocytes and hippocampal neurons induced by DEX. CONCLUSION: AST and ASI can delay the aging in rats treated by HC, and its mechanism may includ lowering[Ca2+]i and suppressing the apoptosis of thymocytes and hippocampal neurons.
