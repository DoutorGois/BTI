We investigated the effects of dynorphin A (Dyn A), a heptadecapeptide, on the population spikes of the guinea pig hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons, in vitro, using paired-pulse stimulation of the mossy fibers. Dyn A produced facilitatory and inhibitory effects on the population spikes in the preparations with lower and higher degrees of paired-pulse facilitation, respectively. Morphine and D-Ala2, D-Leu5-en-kephalin, mu- and delta-agonist, respectively, predominantly potentiated the population spikes, while kappa-agonists such as U-50, 488H and bremazocine mainly caused an inhibition. These results suggest that Dyn A has two separate (excitatory and inhibitory) effects on the guinea pig hippocampal CA3 neurons through mu-(delta) and kappa-opioid receptors, respectively.
