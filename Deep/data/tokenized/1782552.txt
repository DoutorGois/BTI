The effects of electric stimulation on the morphological differentiation of PC12 cells are described. PC12 cells were stimulated with the 'theta' (4-7 Hz electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm) pattern-electric stimulation, which was known to elicit stable long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The stimulation induced the neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, as well as nerve growth factor (NGF). This result suggests that the electric signal has a differentiating potential equivalent to the receptor-ligand interaction.
