The administration of glucose has been shown to improve memory for various learning tasks in rodents. In humans, glucose also increases declarative memory performance in elderly people and in some patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. One of the possible physiological bases for the effect of glucose on memory processes is a facilitation of cholinergic function through increased synthesis. In support of this hypothesis, glucose was shown to attenuate the amnesia induced by scopolamine and, in similar conditions, glucose increased extracellular levels of acetylcholine following a scopolamine injection. To further examine the interaction between glucose and cholinergic function, the present experiment measured the effects of combined injections of glucose and scopolamine on hippocampal sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake, an indirect index of cholinergic activity. Results showed that the injection of 3 g/kg glucose enhanced the increase in high affinity choline uptake in hippocampal synaptosomes produced by scopolamine. A regression analysis revealed the existence of a positive correlation between plasma blood glucose level and hippocampal choline uptake particularly in the animals receiving a combined injection of scopolamine and glucose. These data further support the hypothesis that glucose administration can facilitate acetylcholine synthesis under certain conditions and that this action could explain how glucose attenuates scopolamine-induced amnesia.
