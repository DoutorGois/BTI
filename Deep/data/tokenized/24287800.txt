Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, implicated in various neurodegenerative processes, increases the level of intracellular Ca(2+) and leads to activation of calpain, a Ca(2+)-dependent cysteine protease. We have shown previously that S-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) in aged garlic extracts significantly protects cultured rat hippocampal neurons (HPNs) against ER stress-induced neurotoxicity. The neuroprotective effect of SAC was compared with those of the related antioxidant compounds, L-cysteine (CYS) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), on calpain activity in HPNs and also in vitro. SAC, but not CYS or NAC, reversibly restored the survival of HPNs and increased the degradation of alpha-spectrin, a substrate for calpain, induced by tunicamycin, a typical ER stress inducer. Activities of mu- and m-calpains in vitro were also concentration dependently suppressed by SAC, but not by CYS or NAC. At submaximal concentration, although ALLN (5 pM), which blocks the active site of calpain, and calpastatin (100 pM), an endogenous calpain-inhibitor protein, additively inhibited mu-calpain activity in vitro in combination with SAC, the effect of PD150606 (25 muM), which prevents interaction of Ca(2+) with the Ca(2+)-binding site of calpain, was unaffected by SAC. In contrast, SAC (1 mM) significantly reversed the effect of PD150606 at a concentration that elicited supramaximal inhibition (100 muM), but did not affect ALLN (1 nM)- and calpastatin (100 nM)-induced inhibition of mu-calpain activity. These results suggest that the protective effects of SAC against ER stress-induced neuronal cell death are not attributable to antioxidant activity, but to suppression of calpain through interaction with its Ca(2+)-binding site.
