The effects of treatment with thiamine (Vitamin B1) alone or together with its antagonist oxythiamine on the survival of brain neurons in primary culture were investigated. Treatment with thiamine significantly promoted the survival of hippocampal neurons in high cell density culture, but had no effects on the neuronal survival in low cell density culture. In addition, the survival-promoting activity exerted by thiamine was remarkably decreased by the co-application of oxythiamine, although oxythiamine used alone revealed neither a trophic nor toxic effect on the neurons of examined brain regions. The neurotrophic function of thiamine may be due to its coenzymatic role in a biochemical reaction and/or its specific function on neurotransmission and nerve conduction.
