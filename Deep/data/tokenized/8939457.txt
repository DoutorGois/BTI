It has been reported that ingestion of an ammonium-containing diet produces hyperammonemia without encephalopathy, thus permitting the study of the specific effects of ammonia toxicity. The present study investigated the rat cerebral somatostatinergic system using this experimental model of hyperammonemia. Wistar rats were fed a high ammonia diet prepared by mixing a standard diet with ammonium acetate (20% w/w); in addition, 5 mM of ammonium acetate was added to their water supply. Control rats were fed with a standard diet. The animals were sacrificed at 3, 7 and 15 days of ammonia ingestion. Ammonia levels in blood had increased approximately 3-fold at 7 days of ammonia ingestion. These changes were associated with a significant decrease in the specific binding of somatostatin (SS) to putative receptors sites in the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus at 7 and 15 days after starting the high ammonia diet. Scatchard analysis shows that the decrease in SS binding resulted from a decrease in the number of available SS receptors rather than a change in receptor affinity. No changes in the somatostatin-like immunoreactivity content (SSLI) were detected in either brain area at the three study times. These results suggest that hyperammonemia alone can affect the rat brain somatostatinergic system. However, the animal model of hyperammonemia used here is insufficient to produce encephalopathy despite the significant increase in serum ammonia.
