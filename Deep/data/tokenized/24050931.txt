AIMS: Alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is a pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptide involved in different neurological functions that also exerts anti-inflammatory effects, including in the central nervous system (CNS). Although inflammation has been implicated in seizures and epilepsy, no study has systematically investigated whether alpha-MSH modifies seizures. Therefore, in the current study we determined whether alpha-MSH alters pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)- and pilocarpine-induced seizures. MAIN METHODS: Adult male Swiss mice were injected with alpha-MSH (1.66, 5 or 15 mug/3 muL, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)) or systemic (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). Five to sixty minutes after the injection of the peptide, animals were injected with PTZ (60 mg/kg, i.p.) or pilocarpine (370 mg/kg, i.p.). Latency to myoclonic jerks and tonic-clonic seizures, number of seizure episodes, total time spent seizing and seizure intensity, assessed by the Racine and Meurs scales were recorded. Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) levels in the hippocampus were measured by a commercial enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). KEY FINDINGS: Neither intracerebroventricular (1.66, 5 or 15 mug/3 muL, i.c.v.) nor systemic (0.1, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, i.p.) administration of alpha-MSH altered PTZ- and pilocarpine-induced seizures. IL-1beta levels in the hippocampi were not altered by alpha-MSH, PTZ or pilocarpine. SIGNIFICANCE: Although inflammation has been implicated in seizures and epilepsy and alpha-MSH is a potent anti-inflammatory peptide, our results do not support a role for alpha-MSH in seizure control.
