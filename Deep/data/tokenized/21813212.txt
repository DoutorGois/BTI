We analyzed T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging data of 100 cognitively normal elderly controls (NC), 127 cognitively normal Parkinson's disease (PD; PDCN) and 31 PD-associated mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI) subjects from the Norwegian ParkWest study. Using automated segmentation methods, followed by the radial distance technique and multiple linear regression we studied the effect of clinical diagnosis on hippocampal and ventricular radial distance while adjusting for age, education, and scanning site. PDCN subjects had significantly smaller bilateral hippocampal radial distance relative to NC. Nonamnestic PDMCI subjects showed smaller right hippocampal radial distance relative to NC. PDMCI subjects showed significant enlargement of all portions of the lateral ventricles relative to NC and significantly larger bilateral temporal and occipital and left frontal lateral ventricular expansion relative to PDCN subjects. Nonamnestic PDMCI subjects showed significant ventricular enlargement spanning all parts of the lateral ventricle while those with amnestic PDMCI showed changes localized to the left occipital horn. Hippocampal atrophy and lateral ventricular enlargement show promise as structural biomarkers for PD.
