Antibodies that recognize alpha subunits of G(o), Gi2 and Gi3 were used to evaluate their association with synaptic junctions. G(o), but not Gi, was concentrated within perikaryal and dendritic cytoplasm of a small population of bipolar neurons. All three G-proteins were associated with the intracellular surface of dendritic, axonal and astrocytic plasma membranes and postsynaptic densities (PSDs). However, association with PSDs was more prevalent for the two Gi's than for G(o) while the association with terminals forming putatively excitatory synapses was more prevalent for G(o) and Gi3 than for Gi2. Thus, neuromodulators may modulate the release of excitatory transmitters via activation of presynaptic Gi3 and G(o) and also regulate the opening of Ca2+ and/or K+ channels via activation of Gi's and G(o) at PSDs.
