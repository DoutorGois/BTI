GABA and benzodiazepine receptors were solubilized from bovine cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus and then partially purified by gel filtration and characterized. The apparent molecular weights of all these receptors were determined to be 600,000-650,000 by gel filtration, the sedimentation coefficients being 11.0-11.3 S by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. [3H]Muscimol was bound to two classes of sites in fractions from all three regions, and [3H]flunitrazepam bound to one class of sites. A comparison of the ratios of Bmax for flunitrazepam binding to Bmax for muscimol binding revealed that the fractions from the hippocampus exhibited a much higher ratio of benzodiazepine binding sites than were detected in fractions from the cortex and cerebellum. GABA agonist and antagonist inhibited [3H]muscimol binding to the fractions from these regions, at similar concentrations. Benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists also inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding in these three fractions, with similar potency. CL 218,872, however, inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the cerebellar fraction with the lowest IC50 value and that in th hippocampal fraction with the highest IC50 value. Hill coefficients for CL 218,872 inhibition were 0.98, 0.64, and 0.58 for cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus, respectively.
