Blood flow to the heart and brain of 31 control and 15 growth retarded (IUGR) guinea pig fetuses was measured between 60-64 days of pregnancy by the microsphere technique. The animals were anaesthetized with diazepam and pentobarbitone. Brain weight was reduced by 11% in IUGR fetuses from 2.61 +/- 0.03 to 2.33 +/- 0.05 g and heart weight by 39% from 0.42 +/- 0.01 to 0.25 +/- 0.01 g, compared to a decrease in body weight of 42% from 83.6 +/- 2.3 to 48.2 +/- 2.2 g. The myocardial blood flow of control animals was negatively correlated to arterial O2 content (r = 0.78, P less than 0.001) and arterial pH (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001). Brain blood flow was inversely correlated to arterial O2 content in control fetuses (r = 0.79, P less than 0.001). Eight regions of the brain were examined: cerebral hemispheres, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, thalamus + hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons, and medulla. Regional blood flows were significantly correlated to fetal oxygenation in the controls. Growth retarded fetuses were characterized by poor oxygenation (arterial O2 content less than or equal to 2.5 mM) and were frequently acidaemic (pH less than 7.20). No relation could be demonstrated between the myocardial or cerebral blood flows of IUGR fetuses and arterial O2 content or pH. It is concluded that growth retarded fetuses are unable to maintain O2 delivery to the brain and myocardium by increases in blood flow. Although O2 extraction could be increased to meet the O2 requirements of the heart, IUGR fetuses had a lower rate pressure product, suggesting a decline in myocardial O2 consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
