Phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) is a necessary intermediate in transducing apoptotic signals for tumor necrosis factor and Fas/Apo-1 ligands in nonneuronal cells. The data presented here show that PC-PLC also is required in oxidative glutamate-induced programmed cell death of both immature cortical neurons and a hippocampal nerve cell line, HT22. In oxidative glutamate toxicity, which is distinct from excitotoxicity, glutamate interferes with cystine uptake by blocking the cystine/glutamate antiporter, indirectly causing a depletion of intracellular glutathione. A PC-PLC inhibitor blocks oxidative glutamate toxicity, and exogenous PC-PLC potentiates glutamate toxicity. The inhibition of PC-PLC uncouples the cystine uptake from glutamate inhibition, allowing the maintenance of glutathione synthesis and cell viability. These data suggest that PC-PLC modulates neuronal cell death through a mechanism that is distinct from that involved in nonneuronal apoptosis.
