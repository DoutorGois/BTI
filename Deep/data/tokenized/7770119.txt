We have previously isolated from the hippocampus of young rats a novel peptide termed 'hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide' (HCNP) which specifically enhances the cholinergic activity of the septohippocampal system in vitro. Cloning and base sequence analysis of HCNP-specific cDNA from rat and human cDNA libraries revealed that the 1.1 kDa peptide aligns at the N-terminal region of its 21 kDa precursor protein. An affinity-purified rabbit antibody to rat HCNP prepared by us recognizes the C-terminal domain of the peptide, while an antibody against human HCNP binds to a large portion of the peptide. In this report we show that both antibodies react with HCNP-related components present in the soluble cytosol fraction of human brain tissue. Immunohistochemical examination of human nervous system tissues from elderly individuals revealed that Hirano bodies in Sommer's sector of the hippocampus were specifically stained by anti-HCNP antibodies. The number of HCNP-positive Hirano bodies was greater in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in normal, age-matched individuals. The immunohistochemical results were substantiated by immunoelectron microscopy. The present findings indicate that HCNP-related components accumulate in Hirano bodies, suggesting that patients who bear these inclusions may have a disturbance of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system, considered to be of importance for learning and memory formation.
