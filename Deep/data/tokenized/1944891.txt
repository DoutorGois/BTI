These experiments explore the possible value of the myenteric plexus as a source of donor cells for autografting into the central nervous system. Neurons and glia from 10-12-day postnatal rat myenteric plexus survive for at least one month after transplantation into cholinergically denervated syngeneic adult rat hippocampus. A population of donor cholinergic neurons has acetylcholinesterase-positive processes, but these appear not to innervate host tissue. Host gliosis in response to these implants seems to be less than that seen with other peripheral ganglia, and unlike Schwann cells, the enteric glia form end-feet on brain capillaries.
