Gastrodia elata (GE), a medicinal herb, has been used traditionally for the treatment of convulsive diseases such as epilepsy in oriental countries including South Korea and still occupies an important place in traditional medicine in Asia. We designed this study to examine whether the ether fraction of methanol extracts (EFME) of GE protects the hippocampal neuronal damage induced by transient global ischemia in a gerbil model. Gerbils were treated with the EFME of GE (200 or 500 mg/kg per day, p.o.) for 14 days before brain ischemia. The lower dose of EFME of GE failed to attenuate the hippocampal neuronal damage in the CA1 region. However, the higher dose of EFME of GE attenuated the hippocampal neuronal damage in the CA1 region. The present results show that the EFME of GE has a protective effect against neuronal damage following global ischemia in gerbils.
