We investigated the effect of (R)-(-)-5-methyl-1-nicotinoyl-2-pyrazoline (MS-153), a novel neuroprotective agent, on L-[3H]glutamate uptake through GLT-1, a Na(+)/K(+)-dependent glial glutamate transporter, expressed in COS-7 cells. MS-153 (1-100 microM) accelerated the L-[3H]glutamate uptake through GLT-1 in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Eadie-Hofstee analysis revealed that MS-153 significantly decreased the K(m) of the glutamate uptake by COS-7 cells expressing GLT-1. In contrast, [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake through a glial GABA transporter was not affected. In addition, MS-153 increased Na(+) currents through GLT-1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We also investigated the effect of MS-153 on amino acid efflux from rat hippocampal slices. The increase in glutamate efflux induced by 50 mM KCl was significantly attenuated by the treatment with MS-153 at 10 microM, while MS-153 had no significant effect on the K(+)-evoked efflux of GABA. Furthermore, the increase in glutamate efflux by ischemia (hypoxia/aglycemia) was partially, but significantly inhibited by MS-153. These results suggest that the cerebroprotective effect of MS-153 in this ischemic model in vivo is due to the specific reduction of the glutamate concentration in the extracellular space, which can probably be attributed to the acceleration of glutamate uptake by the indirect modulation of the glutamate transporter activity.
