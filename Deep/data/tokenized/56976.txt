[3H]Valine was injected into the medial and lateral CAI of the dorsal hippocampus and the radioactivity accumulated in areas of some of its efferent projections was measured by scintillation counting. The labeling of the septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, corpus mammillare, preoptic area and basal telencephalon significantly exceeded the corresponding background activities. Fimbria transection before [3H]valine injection reduced the labeling of these areas to background levels. Differences were observed between medial and more lateral CAI injection sites in the distribution of 3H label among projection areas. The dynamics of axonal transport were studied in 4 of these projection areas: septum, thalamus, hypothalamus and corpus mammillare. A rapidly moving wave of radioactivity began to arrive in all areas 1--3 h after injection. The rate was roughly estimated to be around 100 mm/day in the fibers projecting to the corpus mammillare after injections into the medial CAI. When the brain areas were fractionated into crude nuclear, mitochondrial-synaptosomal and microsomal fractions, projection areas were found to contain more label per milligram of protein in the mitochondrial-synaptosomal fraction than control areas.
