Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in hippocampal phenomena of synaptic plasticity. The present microdialysis study investigated a possible role of NO and of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity in the control of hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), an NO donor, stimulated ACh release by 50%-70% when infused into the hippocampus of wild type C57B16 mice. Infusion of L-nitroarginine (L-NA), a broad-spectrum inhibitor of NO synthases, decreased hippocampal ACh efflux by approximately 50%. Mice lacking eNOS (eNOS knockouts) had identical basal effluxes of hippocampal ACh as wild type mice, and the responses to SIN-1 and L-NA were unchanged in the absence of eNOS activity. We conclude that nitric oxide (NO) stimulates hippocampal ACh release in a tonic fashion, but independently of eNOS activity.
