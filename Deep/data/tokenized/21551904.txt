Degeneration within the hippocampus was examined at the light microscopic level using the Gallyas silver stain two, four or nine months after bilateral transection of the fimbria-fornix and commissural connections. At two or four months after the lesion the strata oriens and radiatum of the subicular end of the CA1 subfields were strongly argyrophilic as was the inner third of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. At nine months post-lesion argyrophilia diminished but clearly persisted in the same layers. Electron microscopic examination revealed a large number of electron-dense axon terminals in the argyrophilic areas, most of them making asymmetric synaptic contacts with dendritic spines. These findings suggest that at least a portion of the Schaffer collaterals of the CA3 pyramidal cells and associational collaterals of hilar neurons were in a process of acute degeneration at all time points after the initial surgical trauma. This persistent synaptic reorganization of intrahippocampal circuits may be related to abnormal electrical activity observed several months after fimbria-fornix transection.
