Age related changes in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability to macromolecules were investigated during seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol in rats aged from 6 to 120 days. Evans blue was used as a visual indicator of BBB integrity. BBB leakage due to seizures was present only in animals in which the mean arterial blood pressure (BP) rose with the seizure onset. Although considerable BBB damage was found partly in similar areas in young and adult rat brains, in adults the leakage of Evans blue was most intense in preoptic area, colliculus inferior, hypothalamus and cerebellum whereas the BBB opening was comparatively rare, in the same areas of young brains. In 6- and 15-day-old rats which did not differ in BP changes from the adults, the leakage was extremely intense in hypothalamus and hippocampus and in contrast to 30- or 120-day-old rats there was no leakage of Evans blue in preoptic area and cerebral cortex. From the results obtained, the conclusion may be drawn that the brain regions which are vulnerable to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol differ markedly in developing and adult rats. On the other hand, in adult animals, either certain brain areas are more vulnerable to pentylenetetrazol or the BBB has an increased fragility particular to seizure activity. These results indicate that the sensitivity of BBB mechanisms may depend on proliferation of capillaries and changes in their internal structure and may emphasize it.
