The effect of short- and long-term treatment with imipramine and lithium on shock stress-induced escape failures in a shuttlebox (the "learned helplessness" model of depression) was investigated in rats. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum after the shuttlebox test. Imipramine was found to normalize escape behavior, whereas lithium further aggravated escape behavior. No correlation was found between escape behavior and AChE activity in the three brain areas investigated. However, a significant decrease in AChE activity in striatum was found in rats exposed either to shock stress and no drug treatment or to drug treatment and no shock stress. In rats exposed to the combination of shock stress and drug (imipramine or lithium), a slight or no decrease of AChE activity occurred. Exposure to shock stress alone produced no changes in AChE activity in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. In conclusion, lithium did not have an antidepressant effect on "learned helplessness" and AChE activity was not correlated to escape behavior. However, both imipramine and lithium normalized the decreased level of AChE activity in striatum in rats exposed to shock stress.
