Interaction of acetyl-choline in 10(-4) . 10(-12) M concentration with a water-soluble fraction of homogenates of different brain areas (medulla oblongata, pons varolii, sensomotor cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocamp, hypothalamus, amygdaloid nuclei region and septal region) was studied by the spectrofluorimetric method. Fluorescence complexes spectra at excitation wavelength of 280, 296 nm were investigated. It is shown that the ACH addition to the water-soluble fractions results in reduction of the spectrum intensity and in insignificant shift of the fluorescence maxima to a short-wave region. This effect is supposed to be due to ACH interaction with the cholinoreceptor (CHR). The number of CHR in all the brain regions studied is calculated. Good correlation is observed between the regional distribution of CHR and the acetylcholinesterase activity.
