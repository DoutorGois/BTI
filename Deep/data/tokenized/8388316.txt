Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) are genetically predisposed to seizures, for which an involvement of hippocampal hyperexcitability and disinhibition has been suggested. The response in vitro of the hippocampal synaptic circuit upon exposure to an elevated extracellular calcium concentration is well known in the rat, and its dependence on inhibitory and excitatory transmission has been thoroughly studied. The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the influence of elevated extracellular calcium on inhibitory and excitatory transmission in the dentate area and the CA1 field of gerbil and rat hippocampal slices. Elevated calcium induced in the CA1 area of both animal species a long-term potentiation (LTP)-like response. Upon calcium exposure in the dentate area a decrease in population spike amplitude occurred in both gerbil and rat slices, indicating a similar degree of synaptic inhibition in the two species. However, in contrast to the effects known in the rat, elevated extracellular calcium failed to enhance the excitatory postsynaptic potential in the gerbil dentate area. This difference may depend on the species-specific, selective presence of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin in perforant path terminals of the gerbil, which may be relevant to the susceptibility to seizures of this animal species.
