Differential uptake of [(3)H]testosterone in male chick brain was found in periventricular areas of preoptic-hypothalamic continuum. Concentration of silver grains for all decapitation periods was especially high in the medial preoptic area, particularly the nucleus praeopticus paraventricularis magnocellularis. Distribution of testosterone-sensitive cells is in agreement with studies showing neuroanatomical control of reproductive behavior by the avian forebrain.
