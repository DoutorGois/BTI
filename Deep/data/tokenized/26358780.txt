Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by both amyloid and Tau pathologies. The amyloid component and altered cholesterol metabolism are closely linked, but the relationship between Tau pathology and cholesterol is currently unclear. Brain cholesterol is synthesized in situ and cannot cross the blood-brain barrier: to be exported from the central nervous system into the blood circuit, excess cholesterol must be converted to 24S-hydroxycholesterol by the cholesterol 24-hydroxylase encoded by the CYP46A1 gene. In AD patients, the concentration of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid are lower than in healthy controls. The THY-Tau22 mouse is a model of AD-like Tau pathology without amyloid pathology. We used this model to investigate the potential association between Tau pathology and CYP46A1 modulation. The amounts of CYP46A1 and 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the hippocampus were lower in THY-Tau22 than control mice. We used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer strategy to increase CYP46A1 expression in order to investigate the consequences on THY-Tau22 mouse phenotype. Injection of the AAV-CYP46A1 vector into the hippocampus of THY-Tau22 mice led to CYP46A1 and 24S-hydroxycholesterol content normalization. The cognitive deficits, impaired long-term depression and spine defects that characterize the THY-Tau22 model were completely rescued, whereas Tau hyperphosphorylation and associated gliosis were unaffected. These results argue for a causal link between CYP46A1 protein content and memory impairments that result from Tau pathology. Therefore, CYP46A1 may be a relevant therapeutic target for Tauopathies and especially for AD.
