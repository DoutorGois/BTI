Spatiotemporal activity patterns in local neural networks are fundamental to understanding how information is processed and stored in brain microcircuits. Currently, imaging techniques are able to map the directional activation of macronetworks across brain areas; however, these strategies still fail to resolve the activation direction for fine microcircuits with cellular spatial resolution. Here, we show the capability to identify the activation direction of a multicell network with a cellular resolution and millisecond precision by using fast two-photon microscopy and cross correlation procedures. As an example, we characterized a directional neuronal network in an epilepsy brain slice to provide different initiation delay among multiple neurons defined at a millisecond scale.
