Protein kinase C activity in rat hippocampal membranes and cytosol was determined 1 minute and 1 hour after induction of the synaptic plasticity of long-term potentiation. At 1 hour after long-term potentiation, but not at 1 minute, protein kinase C activity was increased twofold in membranes and decreased proportionately in cytosol, suggesting translocation of the activity. This time-dependent redistribution of enzyme activity was directly related to the persistence of synaptic plasticity, suggesting a novel mechanism regulating the strength of synaptic transmission.
