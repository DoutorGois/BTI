The anticonvulsant effect of cyano-carvone, a monoterpene monocyclic, was investigated in epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine. Cyano-carvone at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg promoted a reduction of 16.7, 33 and 66.7%, respectively, against pilocarpine-induced seizures, and it was efficacious in increasing both the latency to first seizures and the survival percentage, resulting in 33.3, 67 and 91.7% of protection against death induced by seizures, respectively (P < 0.05). The reference drug atropine (25 mg/kg) also produced a significant protection (100%). Its monoterpene, at 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg, was also capable to increase the latency for installation of status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine, and presented a significant protection against lipid peroxidation and nitrite formation in mice hippocampus (P < 0.05). In addition, it was observed that the cyano-carvone pretreatment increased the acetylcholinesterase activity in mice hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced seizures. The present results clearly indicate the anticonvulsant ability of cyano-carvone, which can be, at least in part, explained by the increased activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. Our data suggest that the action mechanism can also be due to a direct activation of the antioxidant enzymes that could be associated with a reduction observed in oxidative stress in mice hippocampus, probably involving an inhibition of free radical production.
