A method is proposed where static patterns or snapshots of cortical activity that could be stored as hyperassociative indices in hippocampus can subsequently be retrieved and reinjected into the neocortex in order to enable neocortex to then proceed to unfold the corresponding sequence, thus implementing an index-based sequence memory storage and retrieval capability.
