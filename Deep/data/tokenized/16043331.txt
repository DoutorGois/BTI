Abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) have been reported to characterize depressive episodes; they are at least partly reversed by antidepressant treatment. Treatment-specific as well as response-related changes in rCBF have been reported. We explored the changes in rCBF induced by vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), a recently proposed antidepressant strategy, by application of single photon emission-computed tomography with (99m)Tc-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime in otherwise treatment-refractory patients. Both region-of-interest (ROI) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analytic approaches were used. Decreases of rCBF in the amygdala, left hippocampus, left subgenual cingulate cortex, left and right ventral anterior cingulum, right thalamus and brain stem were observed; the only increase of rCBF was found by SPM analysis in the middle frontal gyrus. This pattern shares features with changes of rCBF previously associated with the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Similarities to other brain-stimulation strategies in antidepressant treatment were less pronounced.
