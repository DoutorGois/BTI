A new approach for the whole-cell recording in slices is suggested as simpler and less expensive one than those known before. Electrophysiological characteristics of excitatory postsynaptic currents are obtained. Two types of glutamate receptors are shown to be involved. The kynurenic acid is proved to exert more prominent effect on the NMDA-receptor mediated current. Biphasic action of adenosine, a wide spread neuromodulator, on synaptic transmission is shown.
