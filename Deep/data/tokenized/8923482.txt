(-)-Deprenyl, 0.05, 1.0, 2.0, and 10.0 mg/kg body weight, was administered intraperitonially to Wistar rats for 30 days. The activity of acetylcholinesterase, and monoamine oxidase A and B were assayed in different brain regions. After the experimental period acetyl cholinesterase activity was found to be significantly increased in frontal cortex [P < 0.001] and hippocampus [P < 0.001] but not in striatum and brainstem at 0.1, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg dose, the maximum increase being at 0.1 mg/kg dose. Monoamine oxidase B activity was inhibited by more than 90% at 1.0, 2.0, and 10.0 mg/kg dose while 0.05 and 0.1 dose inhibited only about 55% and 70% respectively. Monoamine oxidase A activity was inhibited to more than 70% at 1.0 mg dose and to more than 90% at 2.0 and 10.0 mg/kg dose. At 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg dose monoamine oxidase A activity was not significantly altered.
