In the present study, we examined patterns of A-myb expression in the kainic acid (KA)-treated mouse hippocampus. Western blot analysis revealed that A-myb expression was dramatically increased in brain 3 days after KA treatment, and was sustained for more than 7 days. A-myb immunoreactivity was restricted to hippocampal neurons in control mice. Three days after KA treatment, strong A-myb immunoreactivity was observed in reactive astrocytes throughout the CA3 region. Thereafter, A-myb immunoreactive astrocytes gradually concentrated around the CA3 region in parallel with selective neuronal loss, and only a few A-myb immunoreactive astrocytes persisted in the CA3 region 14 days after KA treatment. These findings suggest that the A-myb plays a role in the reactive gliosis signaling pathway in KA-induced excitotoxic lesions.
