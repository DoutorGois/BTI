In frogs, on the base of the axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase, the connections ascending to the primordial hippocamp were shown from the ipsi- and contralateral pyriform pallium, contralateral primordial hippocamp, ispilateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens, as well as from rostral parts of the postero-central thalamic nucleus (bilaterally). The ascending connections from the dorsal column nuclei were followed with reliability till the rostral parts of the contralateral mesencephalic tegmentum, but very likely they reach also the dorsal thalamus.
