AIM: To determine direct protective effect of monosialoganglioside (GM1) on hippocampal slices after oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/RP), and investigate the influence on the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1) in those hippocampal slices. METHODS: Injury of hippocampal slices and protective effects of GM1 were detected by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, toluidine blue staining, and transmission electron microscopy of rat hippocampal slices. Expression of NMDAR1 was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: (1) GM1 at 1.0 micromol/L was the most effective concentration to preserve the TTC staining of the hippocampal slices after OGD/RP (P<0.05), and the next was GM1 at 10.0 micromol/L (P<0.05). (2) Toluidine blue staining and transmission electron microscopy showed GM1 protected the injuried hippocamal slices after OGD/RP. (3) GM1 downregulated the temporally high expression of NMDAR1 in the hippocampal slices immediately after a 25-min OGD and prevented the over low expression of NMDAR1 after a 30-min reperfusion. CONCLUSION: GM1 could protect injuried rat hippocampal slices after OGD/RP through stabilizing the expression of NMDAR1.
