BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Schizandrin (SCH) has been reported to prevent or reduce learning and memory defects. However, it is not known whether SCH ameliorates cognitive impairments induced by oestrogen deficiency. In the present study, we investigated the effect of SCH on memory in ovariectomized (OVX) and non-OVX rats. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A passive avoidance test was used to evaluate the effect of SCH on memory. Field EPSPs were recorded in hippocampal slices using an electrophysiological method. In OVX rats, biochemical parameters in the bilateral hippocampus were measured; these included superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and AChE. Also, the number of NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) positive neurons was counted by NADPH-d histochemistry staining technique. KEY RESULTS: Oral SCH improved the memory and facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in non-OVX and OVX rats; this effect was more obvious in OVX rats. Similarly, SCH perfusion enhanced synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices from both non-OVX and OVX rats. However, SCH perfusion reduced the ratio of paired-pulse facilitation only in OVX but not in non-OVX rats. In addition, SCH decreased AChE activity and MDA level and increased SOD activity and the number of NADPH-d-positive neurons in OVX rats. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SCH improves memory in OVX rats and its potential mechanisms may include a reduction in the loss of hippocampal NADPH-d positive neurons, an increase of antioxidant properties and a potentiation of synaptic transmission that possibly involves to enhance cholinergic function. Overall, our findings indicate that SCH has potential as a therapeutic strategy for the cognitive dysfunctions associated with the menopause.
