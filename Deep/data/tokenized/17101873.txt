A common denominator for the induction of morphological and functional plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons involves the activation of excitatory synapses. We now demonstrate massive morphological plasticity in mature cultured hippocampal neurons caused by a brief exposure to glutamate. This plasticity involves a slow, 70%-80% increase in spine cross-section area associated with a significant reduction in the width of dendrites. These changes are age dependent and expressed only in cells >18 d in vitro (DIV). Activation of both NMDARs and AMPARs as well as a sustained rise of internal calcium levels are necessary for induction of this plasticity. On the other hand, blockade of network activity or mGluRs does not abolish the observed morphological plasticity. Electrophysiologically, a brief exposure to glutamate induces an increase in the magnitude of EPSCs evoked between pairs of neurons, as well as in mEPSC frequency and amplitude, in mature but not young cultures. These results demonstrate an age-dependent, rapid and robust morphological and functional change in cultured central neurons that may contribute to their ability to express long term synaptic plasticity.
