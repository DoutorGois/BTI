Obesity is currently a public health problem worldwide. Recently, non-reducing carbohydrates, that include beta(2-->1) and beta(2-->6) linkages in their structure, have been of particular interest in the field of obesity because they are involved in lipid metabolism. Some of these are agave fructans (AF) and oligofructose (OF). In this study, we evaluated both AF and OF on oxidative stress (OS) markers in the brain of overweight mice (OM). AF and OF decreased TBARS levels and carbonyls at different levels in hippocampus (HP), frontal cortex (FC) and cerebellum (CB) of OM. The results indicated that fructans may have anti-oxidative potential and can be used as an alternative treatment for the prevention of the consequences of this pathology.
