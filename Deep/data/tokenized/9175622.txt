ECS increased the Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB in rat hippocampus, but not in the cerebellum, even though the basal level of phosphorylated CREB was higher in cerebellum. These results indicate that c-fos induction after ECS may be mediated by Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB in rat hippocampus, but not in the cerebellum.
