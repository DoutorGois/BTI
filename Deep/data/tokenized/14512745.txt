Rhythmic, synchronous firing of groups of neurons is associated with behaviorally relevant states, and it is thus of interest to understand the mechanisms by which synchronization may be achieved. In hippocampal slice preparations, networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons have been seen to synchronize when strong stimulation is applied at separated sites between which any coupling must be subject to a significant axonal delay. We extend previous work on synchronization in a model system based on the network architecture of these hippocampal slices. Our new analysis addresses the effects of heterogeneous populations and noisy inputs on the stability of synchronous solutions in the system. We find that, with experimentally motivated constraints on the coupling strength, sufficiently large heterogeneity in the input currents renders synchrony unstable. The addition of noise, however, restores stable near-synchrony. We analytically reduce the high-dimensional biophysical equations for the full population to a simple three-dimensional map, and show that the map's stability properties correctly predict both the loss of stability and the restabilizing effect of the noise.
