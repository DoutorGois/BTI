Several recent studies have shown that hippocampal neurons fire during the delay period in between trials and that these firing patterns differ when different behaviors are required, suggesting that the neuronal responses may be involved in maintaining the memories needed for the upcoming trial. In particular, one study found that hippocampal neurons reliably fired at particular times, referred to as "episode fields" (EFs), during the delay period of a spatial alternation task (Pastalkova et al. (2008) Science 321:1322-1327). The firing of these neurons resulted in distinct sequential firing patterns on left and right turn trials, and these firing patterns could be used to predict the upcoming behavioral response. In this study, we examined neuronal firing during the delay period of a hippocampus-dependent plus maze task, which involved learning to approach two different reward locations (east and west), and we examined the development of these firing patterns with learning. As in the previous study, hippocampal neurons exhibited discrete periods of elevated firing during the delay (EFs) and the firing patterns were distinct on the east and west trials. Moreover, these firing patterns emerged and began to differentiate the east and west conditions during the first training session and continued to develop as the rats learned the task. The finding of similar firing patterns in different tasks suggests that the EFs are a robust phenomenon, which may occur whenever subjects must maintain distinct memory representations during a delay period. Additionally, in the previous study (Pastalkova et al. (2008) Science 321:1322-1327), the distinct firing patterns could have been due to the differing goal locations, behavioral responses (left or right turns), or trajectories. In this study, neuronal firing varied with the goal location regardless of the trajectories or responses, suggesting that the firing patterns encode the behavioral context rather than specific behaviors.
