In the rat hippocampus, during the first postnatal week, network activity is characterized by GABA-driven giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) associated with calcium signals that are readily blocked when the GABAA antagonist bicuculline is applied to the bath. Towards the end of the first postnatal week, in concomitance with the shift of GABA responses from the depolarizing to the hyperpolarizing direction, functional glutamatergic connections start appearing. At this developmental stage, application of bicuculline blocks GABAA-mediated inhibition and induces the appearance of interictal epileptiform discharges. In the present experiments, we have used a high spatio-temporal resolution imaging system to compare, on a time scale of tens of ms, the onset and propagation of fast calcium transients generated within a GABAergic or glutamatergic network. We found that, during the first postnatal week, calcium signals associated to evoked GDPs arise from the activation of a local circuitry of neurons spanning the stratum radiatum and the pyramidal layer. Similar activation patterns were elicited by focal application of GABA in the presence of kynurenic acid, a broad spectrum ionotropic glutamatergic antagonist, and were blocked by bicuculline. During the second postnatal week, in the presence of bicuculline, calcium signals associated with interictal discharges evoked by stimulation of glutamatergic fibres propagated along the well-defined three-synaptic pathway from the dentate gyrus to the CA1 hippocampal area.
