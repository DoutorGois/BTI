Possibly, at the onset of an emotional event the stress hormones permissively mediate plasticity. Specifically, CORT and NE stress hormones participate in modulation of memory consolidation processes in both the amygdala and the hippocampus. In addition, glucocorticoids and norepinephrin bound to adrenoceptors are also involved in modulating the regulation of NCAM polysialylation both in the amygdala and in the hippocampus. PSA-related synaptic remodeling is mobilized for memory formation in particularly challenging circumstances.
