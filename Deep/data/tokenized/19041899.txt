The excitatory amino acids (EAA) L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-aspartate (L-Asp) and D-aspartate (D-Asp) are thought to play a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator role in neuronal communications. Recently, a high level of EAA L-Glu, D- and L-Asp isomers has been found in the forebrain of Naples high-excitability (NHE) rat line that models the mesocortical variant of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to assess the functions of D-Asp using two forms, i.e. free D-Asp or D-Asp diethyl ester (DEE) as prodrug, on brain and behaviour. Thus, prepuberal rats were given, for two weeks daily, an i.p. injection of D-Asp or DEE or vehicle. Then rats were exposed to two spatial novelties i.e. Lat and radial Olton maze. Behaviour was monitored for indices of activity, non-selective attention (NSA), selective spatial attention (SSA) and emotional reactivity. L-Glu and D- and L-Asp were detected by HPLC in cognitive and non-cognitive brain areas such as prefrontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Results indicate that subchronic D-Asp or DEE (i) reduced EAA levels in the NHE and increased it in the random-bred controls (NRB) rats, (ii) in the Lat-maze D-Asp increased horizontal activity in NHE but DEE decreased it in NRB rats, (iii) in the Olton maze D-Asp and DEE decreased vertical activity in NHE and NRB rats respectively, (iv) D-Asp impaired attention only in NRB decreasing number of arms visited before first repetition. Therefore, data demonstrate differential effects of prepuberal subchronic D-Asp and DEE that may be related to different basal EAA levels in NHE and NRB rats.
