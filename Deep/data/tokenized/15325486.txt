This article focuses on possible psychopharmacological interventions in the immediate post disaster setting. As there is little evidence for the efficacy or effectiveness of such interventions-given the difficulty in performing randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled studies with these populations-the article will delineate the neurobiological basis for pathological sequelae and theoretical drug interventions targeting putative disease mechanisms.
