Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) have both been implicated in the induction of acute ischemic neurodegeneration. We recently examined changes in intracellular Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) in CA1 pyramidal neurons subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), and found that Zn(2+) rises precede and contribute to the onset of terminal Ca(2+) rises ("Ca(2+) deregulation"), which are causatively linked to a lethal loss of membrane integrity. The present study seeks to examine the specific role of intramitochondrial Zn(2+) accumulation in ischemic injury, using blockers of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU), through which both Zn(2+) and Ca(2+) appear able to enter the mitochondrial matrix. In physiological extracellular Ca(2+), treatment with the MCU blocker, Ruthenium Red (RR), accelerated the Ca(2+) deregulation, most likely by disrupting mitochondrial Ca(2+) buffering and thus accelerating the lethal cytosolic Ca(2+) overload. However, when intracellular Ca(2+) overload was slowed, either by adding blockers of major Ca(2+) entry channels or by lowering the concentration of Ca(2+) in the extracellular buffer, Ca(2+) deregulation was delayed, and under these conditions either Zn(2+) chelation or MCU blockade resulted in similar further delays of the Ca(2+) deregulation. In parallel studies using the reactive oxygen species (ROS) indicator, hydroethidine, lowering Ca(2+) surprisingly accelerated OGD induced ROS generation, and in these low Ca(2+) conditions, either Zn(2+) chelation or MCU block slowed the ROS generation. These studies suggest that, during acute ischemia, Zn(2+) entry into mitochondria via the MCU induces mitochondrial dysfunction (including ROS generation) that occurs upstream of, and contributes to the terminal Ca(2+) deregulation.
