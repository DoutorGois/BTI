In the present work, accumulation and distribution of aluminium in the rat brain following both intraperitoneal and oral administration were studied. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine aluminium concentration in different brain areas (cerebellum, ventral midbrain, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum). Most of the brain areas showed accumulation of aluminium, but a greater and more significant increase was noted in the group receiving aluminium via intraperitoneal administration. Aluminium distribution was also dependent on the administration route.
