Transient global amnesia (TGA) is characterized by a severe disturbance of memory, occurring rapidly, lasting less than a day and mainly affecting elderly subjects. During its acute phase, it is characterized by a severe anterograde amnesia, partial retrograde amnesia and anxiety with repetition of the same questions. The diagnosis is purely based on patient's clinical features. Complimentary examinations are only requested when atypical symptoms are present. The pathophysiology of TGA remains unknown, but it appears to be related to transient disturbances of the perfusion and oxygenation of the hippocampal structures, following a precipitating factor (stress, effort...). Spontaneous recovery is usual in less than 24 hours and without sequelae. Relapse is rare. Nevertheless, TGA represents a psychological traumatism pathology for the patients and their family.
