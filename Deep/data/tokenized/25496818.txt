Previously the expression of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Interacting Protein 51 (PTPIP51) in mouse brain was reported. Here, we investigated PTPIP51 mRNA and protein in two of the brain regions namely the hippocampus and the cerebellum of mouse brains. On a cellular level both the protein and the mRNA were related to the pyramidal cells of the hippocampal formation, the granular cells of the dentate gyrus and the cells of the adjacent strata. In the cerebellum PTPIP51 was traced in Purkinje cells, the cells of the molecular layer and the granular layer. On a subcellular level only partial co-localization was seen for the endoplasmic reticulum, but not with mitochondria. In addition the interactome of PTPIP51 was analysed. In hippocampal cells a strong interaction with PTP1B and vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB) was detected. A somewhat differing interaction profile was found in the cerebellum, where high interaction levels were found for 14-3-3, diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKalpha), NFkappaB and PTP1B. These interaction partners represent specific signalling pathways linked to building memory. PTPIP51 can be associated with nerve growth factor signalling, dendritic and axonal growth, synaptogenesis, and all processes needed for memory formation. Moreover, in HT-22 mouse hippocampal cells PTPIP51 expression was induced by administrating the fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1), which is known to take part in learning/memory processes. Knocking down p38-MAPK also led to an up-regulation of PTPIP51 probably resembling a compensative mechanism. Thus, a possible connection to the processing of memories can be anticipated. Differences in the interaction profile in both regions may be attributed to the actual/local differences in memory formation.
