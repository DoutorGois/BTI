mRNA, Western analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to study the expression of the small heat shock protein (HSP) 27 in the rat septum and hippocampus following fimbria-fornix lesions, a model of neurodegeneration and regeneration. (HSP) 27 mRNA level was increased 2.5-fold in the medial septum 3 days after lesion and this increase persisted for 10 days. In the hippocampus, after an initial 15-fold increase at 3 days post-injury, HSP27 mRNA returned to basal levels 10 days after the lesion. Three and 10 days after lesion, HSP27 protein levels were increased in the septum (4.5 and 5-fold, respectively) and hippocampus (65 and 10-fold, respectively). The morphology of the HSP27 positive cells was indistinguishable from that of GFAP-immunoreactive cells. In addition, in the septum of injured rats, occasional neurons were heavily labelled with anti-HSP27 antibodies. Thus, up-regulation of HSP27, particularly in glial cells, may be a component of glial input in the processes on degeneration/regeneration which occur in this model.
