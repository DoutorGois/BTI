Histological tissue preparation stages (e.g., cutting, sectioning, etc.) often introduce tissue distortions that prevent a smooth 3D reconstruction from being built. In this paper, we propose a method to correct histology distortions by running a piecewise registration scheme. It takes the information of several consecutive slices in a neighborhood into account. In order to achieve an accurate anatomic presentation, we run the method iteratively with the assistance from a pre-segmented brain atlas. The registration parameters are optimized to accommodate different brain sub-regions, e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus, etc. The results are evaluated by both visual and quantitative approaches. The proposed method has been proved to be robust enough for reconstructing an accurate and smooth mouse brain volume.
