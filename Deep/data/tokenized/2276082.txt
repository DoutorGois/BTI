A new potent, blood-brain barrier permeable gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake blocker, 1-[2-[bis[4-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]methoxy]ethyl]-1,2,5,6- tetrahydro-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid (CI-966) was administered systemically by i.p. injection (5 mg/kg) in Sprague-Dawley rats under urethane anaesthesia. Twenty to thirty minutes after injection there was a highly variable, but overall significant, enhancement of the inhibition of hippocampal population spikes by GABA applied by microiontophoresis in the CA1 region. Like the effect of nipecotic acid (applied locally by iontophoresis), the potentiation by CI-966 was clearest when GABA was applied in or near the stratum pyramidale where its action normally is weakest and shows the most pronounced fading. This change in GABA potency is most simply explained by a reduction in GABA uptake.
