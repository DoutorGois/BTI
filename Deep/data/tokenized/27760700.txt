The purpose of the present study was to investigate the patterns of interregional correlations of serotonin transporter (SERT) availability with glucose metabolism using 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET) with (11)C-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylthio)benzonitrile ([(11)C]DASB) and [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) in antipsychotic-free patients with schizophrenia in order to shed new light on the disrupted functional connectivity in schizophrenia. Nineteen patients with schizophrenia and 18 healthy controls underwent high-resolution PET and MRI. The binding potential (BPND) of [(11)C]DASB and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) of [(18)F]FDG were obtained. In SERT availability, the region of interest (ROI)-based analyses showed no significant group differences in any region, except for the anterior hippocampus where the SERT availability was lower in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. The ROI- and voxel-based analyses revealed that the [(18)F]FDG SUVR values were significantly lower in patients than in controls in the right superior frontal gyrus and medial part of the left superior frontal gyrus. Regarding the interregional correlations of [(11)C]DASB BPND with [(18)F]FDG SUVR, more widespread positive correlations across the brain regions were observed in control subjects than in patients with schizophrenia. Notably, the patients and control subjects showed statistically significant differences in correlations between the SERT availability in the parietal and temporal cortices and the glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex. These results suggest abnormal functional connectivity between the higher-order cortical regions in schizophrenia and a possible important role of the posterior cingulate gyrus and its related circuitry in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
