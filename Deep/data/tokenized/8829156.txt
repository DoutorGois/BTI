Kindling stimulation induces expansive growth of the axons of the dentate granule cells, the mossy fiber, into several areas of the hippocampus. An intraperitoneal injection of the immunosuppressant drug FK506, which is a specific inhibitor of Ca(2+)-calmodulin dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, prevented the full development of kindling as well as mossy fiber sprouting. The results show a correlation between mossy fiber sprouting and the development of kindling. The results suggest also that calcineurin may have a promoting role in mossy fiber sprouting and subsequent synaptogenesis.
