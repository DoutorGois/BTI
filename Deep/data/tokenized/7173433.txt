Changes of the diameter of microvessels of the rabbit cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, septum pellucidum, amygdala, hippocampus and globus pallidus were studied during electrical stimulation of these structures. The stimulation of amygdala elicited vasoconstrictive reactions, the stimulation of hypothalamus and septum--vasodilative reactions, the stimulation of thalamus, hippocampus and globus pallidus caused a vasoconstriction in the motor cortex and a vasodilatation in the subcortex. These results suggest participation of the deep brain structures in the regulation of brain microcirculation.
