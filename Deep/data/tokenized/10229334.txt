We investigated changes in numbers of nitric-oxide-producing cells in the hippocampal formation, striatum, and temporal cortex of mice 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of kainic acid (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg) or domoic acid (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg). Nitric-oxide-producing cells were demonstrated histochemically by staining for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons in the dentate gyrus and the subiculum did not change in number following administration of kainic acid or domoic acid at any dose. Positive neurons in the CA3 region of mice treated with kainic acid or domoic acid at any dose were significantly fewer than in controls. Although the numbers of positive neurons in the CA1/CA2 regions did not differ from those of controls at any of the four doses of kainic acid, positive cells in the CA1/CA2 were significantly more numerous than in controls at any dose of domoic acid. Although no significant differences in the numbers of positive neurons in the striatum were apparent between controls and any of the four doses of kainic acid, domoic acid significantly decreased the numbers of such cells. These results suggest that systemically administered kainic acid and domoic acid affect differentially nitric-oxide-producing cells in the hippocampal formation.
