We describe a new method for intense staining of myelin. The stain involves immersing frozen or vibratome sections of 4% normal horse serum. A DAB reaction is then carried out, which results in the deposition of reaction product in myelin sheaths. On intensification of this reaction product using the silver enhancement technique described by Gorcs, myelin stains an intense black color, making the preparations suitable for photography. The stain is especially useful for determining the distribution of myelinated fibers in gray matter.
