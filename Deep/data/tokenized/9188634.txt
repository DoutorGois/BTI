Cultured rat prostatic adenocarcinoma (AT3) cells infected with the challenge virus standard (CVS) strain of fixed rabies virus showed characteristic morphologic features of apoptosis, evidence of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and expression of the Bax protein. CVS-infected Bcl-2-transfected AT3 cells did not demonstrate these features. Adult ICR mice inoculated intracerebrally with CVS showed morphologic changes of apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and increased Bax expression in neurons, with changes most marked in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Ultrastructurally, some neurons demonstrated morphologic features more typical of necrosis. These studies provide evidence that apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of rabies virus infection.
