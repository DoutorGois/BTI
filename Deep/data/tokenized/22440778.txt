The aim of this review is to bring the phenomenological sense of place approach together with current results from neuroscience. We searched in neuroscientific literature for ten dimensions which were beforehand identified to be important in a phenomenological sense of place/place identity model: behaviour, body, emotion, attention, perception, memory, orientation, spirituality, meaning/value and culture/sociality. Neuroscience has identified many neurobiological correlates of phenomenological observations concerning sense of place. The human brain comprises specific and specialised structures and processes to perceive, memorise, link, assess and use spatial information. Specific parts (hippocampus, entorhinal, parahippocampal and parietal cortex), subregions (parahippocampal place area, lingual landmark area), and cells (place cells, grid cells, border cells, head direction cells) have been identified, their specific function could be understood and their interaction traced. Neuroscience has provided evidence that place constitutes a distinct dimension in neuronal processing. This reinforces the phenomenological argumentation of human geography and environmental psychology.
