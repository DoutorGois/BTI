Although the use, and misuse, of methylphenidate is increasing in childhood and adolescence, there is little information about the consequences of this psychostimulant chronic use on brain and behavior during development. The aim of the present study was to investigate hippocampus biochemical, histochemical, and behavioral effects of chronic methylphenidate treatment to juvenile rats. Wistar rats received intraperitoneal injections of methylphenidate (2.0 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of 0.9 % saline solution (controls), once a day, from the 15th to the 45th day of age. Results showed that chronic methylphenidate administration caused loss of astrocytes and neurons in the hippocampus of juvenile rats. BDNF and pTrkB immunocontents and NGF levels were decreased, while TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels, Iba-1 and caspase 3 cleaved immunocontents (microglia marker and active apoptosis marker, respectively) were increased. ERK and PKCaMII signaling pathways, but not Akt and GSK-3beta, were decreased. SNAP-25 was decreased after methylphenidate treatment, while GAP-43 and synaptophysin were not altered. Both exploratory activity and object recognition memory were impaired by methylphenidate. These findings provide additional evidence that early-life exposure to methylphenidate can have complex effects, as well as provide new basis for understanding of the biochemical and behavioral consequences associated with chronic use of methylphenidate during central nervous system development.
