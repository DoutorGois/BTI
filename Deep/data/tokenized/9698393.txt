We have identified and isolated a cDNA that codes for the novel protein NMP35 (neural membrane protein 35) using RNA arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR) for differential display in the developing rat sciatic nerve. NMP35 is predominantly found in the adult nervous system where both transcripts and protein are strongly upregulated during postnatal development. In situ hybridization studies show that NMP35 mRNA is widely distributed in the brain and spinal cord with a neuronal expression pattern. Database comparisons reveal that NMP35 shares significant homologies with the rat glutamate-binding protein (GBP), the Drosophila NMDARA1, and two orphan C. elegans genes. Comparative analysis of NMP35 and GBP expression indicates that they are similarly regulated during development and display regionally overlapping cellular patterns. We conclude that NMP35 and GBP are members of a gene family which is likely to play a role in the development and the maintenance of the nervous system.
