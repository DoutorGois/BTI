It is well known that cobalt chloride (CoCl2) can enhance the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha. The aim of this study is to detect the effect of CoCl2 on the hypoxia tolerance of mice which were repeatedly exposed to autoprogressive hypoxia. Balb/c mice were randomly divided into groups of chemical pretreatment and normal saline (NS), respectively injected with CoCl2 and NS 3 h before exposure to hypoxia for 0 run (H0), 1 run (H1), and 4 runs (H4). Western Blot, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), extracellular recordings population spikes in area cornus ammonis I (CA 1) of mouse hippocampal slices and real-time were used in this study. Our results demonstrated that the tolerance of mice to hypoxia, the changes of HIF-1alpha protein level and HIF-1 DNA binding activity in mice hippocampus, the mRNA level of erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the disappearance time of population spikes of hippocampal slices were substantially different between the control group and the CoCl2 group. Over-induction of HIF-1alpha by pretreatment with CoCl2 before hypoxia did not increase the hypoxia tolerance.
