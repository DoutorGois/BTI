Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that has been linked to changes in cholesterol metabolism. Neuronal cholesterol content significantly influences the pro-apoptotic effect of amyloid-beta peptide42 (Abeta42), which plays a key role in AD development. We previously reported that aged mice with reduced expression of the lipolysis stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR+/-), demonstrate membrane cholesterol accumulation and decreased intracellular lipid droplets in several brain regions, suggesting a potential role of LSR in brain cholesterol distribution. We questioned if these changes rendered the LSR+/- mouse more susceptible to Abeta42-induced cognitive and biochemical changes. Results revealed that intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Abeta42 in male 15-month old LSR+/+ and LSR+/- mice led to impairment in learning and long-term memory and decreased cortical cholesterol content of both groups; these effects were significantly amplified in the Abeta42-injected LSR+/- group. Total latency of the Morris test was significantly and negatively correlated with cortical cholesterol content of the LSR+/- mice, but not of controls. Significantly lower cortical PSD95 and SNAP-25 levels were detected in Abeta42-injected LSR+/- mice as compared to Abeta42-injected LSR+/+ mice. In addition, 24S-hydroxy cholesterol metabolite levels were significantly higher in the cortex of LSR+/- mice. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in cortex cholesterol regulation as a result of the LSR+/- genotype were linked to increased susceptibility to amyloid stress, and we would therefore propose the aged LSR+/- mouse as a new model for understanding the link between modified cholesterol regulation as a risk factor for AD.
