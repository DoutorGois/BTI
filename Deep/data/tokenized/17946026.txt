A total of 32 microwire electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats, which were then stimulated in the manner prescribed for the chronic limbic epilepsy model. After the initial seizure brought on by the stimulation, the animals were recorded at a high sampling rate (approximately 12 kHz) for the entire duration of the latent period. Coherence was calculated across channels in both stimulated (and later seizing) animals and non-stimulated (and thus non-seizing control) animals. Average coherence over time was greatest in intrahemispherical electrode pairs in both stimulated and non-stimulated animals. However, the 200-800 Hz band displays increased coherence interhemispherically and up to 200 Hz band displays decreased coherence interhemispherically: this occurs only in stimulated animals.
