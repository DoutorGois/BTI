We assessed relationships of evoked electrical and light scattering changes from cat dorsal hippocampus following Schaeffer collateral stimulation. Under anesthesia, eight stimulating electrodes were placed in the left hippocampal CA field and an optic probe, coupled to a photodiode or a charge-coupled device camera to detect scattered light changes, was lowered to the contralateral dorsal hippocampal surface. Light at 660 +/- 10 (SE) nm illuminated the tissue through optic fibers surrounding the optic probe. An attached bipolar electrode recorded evoked right hippocampal commissural potentials. Electrode recordings and photodiode output were simultaneously acquired at 2.4 kHz during single biphasic pulse stimuli 0.5 ms in duration with 0.1-Hz intervals. Camera images were digitized at 100 Hz. An average of 150 responses was calculated for each of six stimulating current levels. Stimuli elicited a complex population synaptic potential that lasted 100-200 ms depending on stimulus intensity and electrode position. Light scattering changes peaked 20 ms after stimuli and occurred simultaneously with population spikes. A long-lasting light scattering component peaked 100-500 ms after the stimulus, concurrently with larger population postsynaptic potentials. Optical signals occurred over a time course similar to that for electrical signals and increased with larger stimulation amplitude to a maximum, then decreased with further increases in stimulation current. Camera images revealed a topographic response pattern that paralleled the photodiode measurements and depended on stimulation electrode position. Light scattering changes accompanied fast electrical responses, occurred too rapidly for perfusion, and showed a stimulus intensity relationship not consistent with glial changes.
