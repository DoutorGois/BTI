Corticosteroid receptors were demonstrated in the medial hypothalamus, the hippocampus and the parietal cortex of the rat while no such receptors were found in the hypophysis, the amygdala and the anterior hypothalamus. The findings suggest the role of extrahypothalamic regions in the perception of corticosteroid feedback as well as in the regulation of the hypothalamo-hypophysial-adrenal function and do not support the assumption that corticosteroids would inhibit corticotrophin secretion by acting directly on the hypophysis.
