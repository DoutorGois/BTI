Most of the published light-microscopic methods for the localization of cholinergic nerve pathways present various difficulties of interpretation. The production and characterization of an antiserum that binds specifically to cholinergic terminals is described. The antiserum was raised to small synaptosomes prepared from the purely cholinergic electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. It was shown to lyse cholinergic synaptosomes in a mixed population derived from guinea-pig cortex. After partial purification by adsorption onto nonspecific antigens, It was used to label nerve endings in several tissues of Torpedo, rat and guinea pigs using indirect immunofluorescence histochemistry. The antiserum appears to provide a highly specific means of localizing cholinergic nerve endings in these tissues.
