To better understand the cellular pathogenetic mechanisms of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and the therapeutic benefit of stem cell treatment, we exposed pregnant rats to ethanol followed by intravenous administration of neural stem cells (NSCs) complexed with atelocollagen to the new born rats and studied recovery of GABAergic interneuron numbers and synaptic protein density in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Prenatal ethanol exposure reduced both parvalbumin-positive phenotype of GABAergic interneurons and postsynaptic density protein 95 levels in these areas. Intravenous NSC treatment reversed these reductions. Furthermore, treatment with NSCs reversed impaired memory/cognitive function and social interaction behavior. These experiments underscore an important role for synaptic remodeling and GABAergic interneuron genesis in the pathophysiology and treatment of FASD and highlight the therapeutic potential for intravenous NSC administration in FASD utilizing atelocollagen.
