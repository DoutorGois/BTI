The blind patch clamp whole-cell recording technique for CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices was carefully introduced, the key procedures and the points for attention were emphasized. Using the "blind" method, we analyzed the properties of synaptic activity, the current features of Ca2+ channels and glutamate, GABA receptors. Our results provide a scientific basis for study of dynamic properties of ion channels on hippocampal neurons and the effects of drugs on synaptic activity by using the blind whole-cell recording technique.
