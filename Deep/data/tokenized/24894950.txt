Hippocampal adult neurogenesis contributes to key functions of the dentate gyrus (DG), including contextual discrimination. This is due, at least in part, to the unique form of plasticity that new neurons display at a specific stage of their development when compared with the surrounding principal neurons. In addition, the contribution that newborn neurons make to dentate function can be enhanced by an increase in their numbers induced by a stimulating environment. However, signaling mechanisms that regulate these properties of newborn neurons are poorly understood. Here, we show that Ras-GRF2 (GRF2), a calcium-regulated exchange factor that can activate Ras and Rac GTPases, contributes to both of these properties of newborn neurons. Using Ras-GRF2 knockout mice and wild-type mice stereotactically injected with retrovirus containing shRNA against the exchange factor, we demonstrate that GRF2 promotes the survival of newborn neurons of the DG at approximately 1-2 weeks after their birth. GRF2 also controls the distinct form of long-term potentiation that is characteristic of new neurons of the hippocampus through its effector Erk MAP kinase. Moreover, the enhancement of neuron survival that occurs after mice are exposed to an enriched environment also involves GRF2 function. Consistent with these observations, GRF2 knockout mice display defective contextual discrimination. Overall, these findings indicate that GRF2 regulates both the basal level and environmentally induced increase of newborn neuron survival, as well as in the induction of a distinct form of synaptic plasticity of newborn neurons that contributes to distinct features of hippocampus-derived learning and memory.
