Activity of membrane-bound gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) was examined in various regions of mouse brain, in capillaries of the cerebral cortex and in telencephalic choroid plexuses. The level of activity in the capillaries was double and that of the choroid plexus nine times that of the gamma-GTP activity found in the brain, septum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, frontal cortex, pons, medulla oblongata, and amygdala. Histochemically the gamma-GTP activity was demonstrated in the surface membranes of choroidal cells and in the endothelium of small capillaries. The activities of gamma-GTP of cerebral cortex, choroid plexus, and capillaries from rabbit were 5--17 times greater than those from corresponding areas of mouse brain. While 30 mM methionine stimulated (in vitro) the enzyme from mouse brain, no such effect was observed with the enzyme activity from rabbit brain. The gamma-GTP activity from the capillaries of cerebral cortex of both mouse and rabbit was not affected by the presence of methionine. These findings suggest existence of differences in the specificity of gamma-GTP activity in these two species.
