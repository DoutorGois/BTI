Evoked synaptic potentials and purine efflux were measured simultaneously from rat hippocampal slices. Slices were exposed to hypoxia, to glucose-free medium, and to in vitro ischemia consisting of glucose-free, hypoxic medium. During exposure to hypoxia or the glucose-free condition, radiolabelled purine efflux increased and the evoked population spike declined. Synaptic potentials and purine efflux returned to baseline values after reintroduction of normoxic and normoglycemic medium. During exposure to in vitro ischemia, purine and adenosine efflux were greatly increased with the appearance of the anoxic depolarization.
