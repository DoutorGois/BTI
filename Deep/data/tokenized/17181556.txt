The present study showed CCR7, CCR8, CCR9 and CCR10 in the normal Swiss mouse hippocampus at both protein and mRNA levels. CCR7, CCR9 and CCR10 were mainly localized in hippocampal principal cells and some interneurons. CCR9 was also found in the mossy fibres and/or terminals, suggesting an axonal or presynaptic localization, and CCR10 in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area. CCR8 was observed in interneurons. Double-labelling immunocytochemistry revealed that most of calbindin (CB)-, calretinin (CR)- and parvalbumin (PV)-immunopositive neurons expressed CCR7-10, except CR-immunopositive cells in which only 10 to 12% expressed CCR8. During and after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, progressive changes of each of CCR7, CCR8, CCR9 and CCR10 proteins occurred in different patterns at various time points. Sensitive real-time PCR showed similar change patterns at mRNA level. At the chronic stage, i.e. at 2 months after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, significant reduction of CCR7-10 expression in CB-, CR- and PV-immunpositive interneurons may suggest the phenotype change of surviving interneurons. Double labelling of CCR7, CCR8 and CCR9 with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at the chronic stage may suggest an induced expression in reactive astrocytes. The present study may, therefore, for the first time, provide evidence that CCR7-10 may be involved in normal hippocampal activity. The demonstration of the progressive changes of CCR7-10 during and after status epilepticus may open a new area to reveal the mechanism of neuronal loss after status epilepticus and of epileptogenesis.
