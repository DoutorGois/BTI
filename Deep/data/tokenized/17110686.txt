BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We objectively assessed surface structural changes of the hippocampus in mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) and assessed the ability of large-deformation high-dimensional mapping (HDM-LD) to demonstrate hippocampal surface symmetry and predict group classification of MTS in right and left MTS groups compared with control subjects. METHODS: Using eigenvector field analysis of HDM-LD segmentations of the hippocampus, we compared the symmetry of changes in the right and left MTS groups with a group of 15 matched controls. To assess the ability of HDM-LD to predict group classification, eigenvectors were selected by a logistic regression procedure when comparing the MTS group with control subjects. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of variance on the coefficients from the first 9 eigenvectors accounted for 75% of the total variance between groups. The first 3 eigenvectors showed the largest differences between the control group and each of the MTS groups, but with eigenvector 2 showing the greatest difference in the MTS groups. Reconstruction of the hippocampal deformation vector fields due solely to eigenvector 2 shows symmetrical patterns in the right and left MTS groups. A "leave-one-out" (jackknife) procedure correctly predicted group classification in 14 of 15 (93.3%) left MTS subjects and all 15 right MTS subjects. CONCLUSION: Analysis of principal dimensions of hippocampal shape change suggests that MTS, after accounting for normal right-left asymmetries, affects the right and left hippocampal surface structure very symmetrically. Preliminary analysis using HDM-LD shows it can predict group classification of MTS and control hippocampi in this well-defined population of patients with MTS and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).
