In the present study, the influence of withdrawal from repeated administration of morphine on intra-ventral hippocampal microinjection of histamine-induced anxiety-like behavior was investigated in male Wistar rats. Three days subcutaneous administration of morphine (5-10 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug decreased the percentage open arm time and the percentage open arm entries. Intra-ventral hippocampal administration of histamine (2.5-7.5 microg/rat) decreased percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries. Intra-ventral hippocampal histamine-induced anxiogenic effect was reversed in animals that had previously received the three days morphine (7.5 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug. Intra-ventral hippocampal administration of pyrilamine (5-20 microg/rat) or ranitidine (10-40 microg/rat) decreased percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries. Pyrilamine- or ranitidine-induced anxiogenic effect was not changed in animals that had previously received the three days morphine (7.5 mg/kg) followed by five days free of the drug. Intra-ventral hippocampal injections of clobenpropit increased percentage open arm time. The percentage open arm time and percentage open arm entries were decreased in the morphine-treated animals compared with non-morphine-treated controls. Percentage open arm entries and locomotor activity was reduced with some doses of clobenpropit. It can be concluded that the histamine system is involved in anxiety-like behavior, and repeated injections of morphine followed by five days free of the drugs interact with histamine receptor mechanism.
