We observed the effect of scalp point cluster-needling treatment on learning and memory function and neurotransmitter levels in rats with vascular dementia (VD). Permanent ligation of the bilateral carotid arteries was used to create the VD rat model. A Morris water maze was used to measure the rats' learning and memory function, and the changes in neurotransmitter levels in the rats' hippocampus were analyzed. The results show that scalp point cluster-needling can increase the VD rat model's learning and memory score. The VD rat model's learning and memory score was significantly different when compared with that of the sham operation group (P < 0.05). Hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh), dopamine (DA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations significantly decreased in the rat model. Compared with the model group, the scalp point cluster-needling group's ACh concentration markedly increased and DA and 5-HT levels increased as well. In conclusion, scalp point cluster-needling can improve learning and memory function in VD rats, and its function may be related to an increase in neurotransmitter release.
