Regional brain GABA distribution studies show that after administration of sodium n dipropylacetate, a competitive inhibitor of GABA transaminase, the concentration of GABA increases in some regions i.e. Olfactory Bulbs, Hypothalamus, Cortex, Cerebellum. The GABA level remains unchanged in Caudate Nucleus, Pons Medulla, Hippocampus in our experimental conditions. These variations do not correlate with the initial GABA level.
