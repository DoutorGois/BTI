As dopamine (DA) causes neurochemical changes in the central serotonergic system after an acute injection of methamphetamine, the present study examined the possibility that this response is mediated through dopaminergic receptors. Pretreatment with the DA receptor antagonist, haloperidol, failed to prevent the decreases in the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase and the concentration of serotonin (5-HT) in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and neostriatum 1 hr after a single administration of methamphetamine. Because methamphetamine is also a potent releaser of 5-HT, the possibility that 5-HT receptors mediate the effects of methamphetamine was evaluated. Pretreatment with methiothepin an antagonist of both DA and 5-HT receptors, failed to prevent the decline in activity of tryptophan hydroxylase but did attenuate the decreases in concentrations of 5-HT measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. This attenuation is not mediated through 5-HT2 receptors, as ritanserin failed to interfere with the changes induced by methamphetamine. In addition, DA or 5-HT receptors were apparently not involved in the changes in activity of tryptophan hydroxylase and concentrations of 5-HT induced by another analogue of amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). This study suggests different mechanisms are responsible for the acute and long-term changes observed in the central serotonergic system following a single or multiple doses of methamphetamine.
