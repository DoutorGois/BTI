OBJECTIVE: To observe the change of the gene expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) subunits in rat hippocampus after scalding. METHODS: The backs of the rats were shaved and immersed in warm water for 10 sec. to make control group (C), and the backs shaved and immersed in hot water (90 degrees C) for 10 sec to make 30% full skin scalding model as the scalding group (S). The mRNA expression of the subunits of rat hippocampus NMDAR-NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, NMDAR2D was determined with RT-PCR technique in C group and at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 postburn hours (PBHs) in S group. RESULTS: (1) There exhibited no obvious change of the mRNA expression of all the subunits of NMDAR at 0.5 and 1 PBH in S group when compared with that in C group. But the mRNA expression of NMDAR1 increased for 24.3% and 20.9% and that of NMDAR2A increased for 27.8% and 27.6% at 2 and 4 PBHs respectively when compared with that in C group (P < 0.05). In addition, the mRNA expression of NMDAR2B and NMDAR2D revealed no change after scalding. CONCLUSION: The receptor channel constructed by NMDAR1/NMDAR2A demonstrated increased mRNA expression at 2 PBH, which might lead to the further opening of NMDAR after scalding which might participate in the maladjustment of HPA axis during scalding stress and the following pathophysiological changes.
