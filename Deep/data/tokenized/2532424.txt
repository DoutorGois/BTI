The densities of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors were measured by using [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]raclopride, respectively, in the rabbit cingulate, visual, sensorimotor, and entorhinal-piriform cortical areas; the dorsal and ventral hippocampus; and the putamen as well as the medial and lateral caudate. Endogenous dopamine (DA) and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (HVA), and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) were assayed by HPLC with electrochemical detection. The distributions of [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]raclopride binding were heterogenous with the greatest densities in the neostriatum. The concentrations of DA and its metabolites were also highest in this structure. Regions with low DA content, i.e., cortex and hippocampus, had lower densities of [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]raclopride binding. Furthermore, these sites were differentially localized within the various regions and there were substantially more D1 than D2 receptors. The functional significance and heterogeneities in the distribution of D1 and D2 receptors are discussed in relation to the dopaminergic innervation and the turnover estimated by the ratios between endogenous DA and its metabolites.
