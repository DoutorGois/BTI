The current study investigated the effects of disrupting the septohippocampal theta system on the developmental emergence of delay eyeblink conditioning. Theta oscillations are defined as electroencephalographic (EEG) waveforms with a frequency between 3-8 Hz. Hippocampal theta oscillations are generated by inputs from the entorhinal cortex and the medial septum. Theta activity has been shown to facilitate learning in a variety of paradigms, including delay eyeblink conditioning. Lesions of the medial septum disrupt theta activity and slow the rate at which delay eyeblink conditioning is learned (Berry & Thompson, [1979] Science 200:1298-1300). The role of the septohippocampal theta system in the ontogeny of eyeblink conditioning has not been examined. In the current study, infant rats received an electrolytic lesion of the medial septum on postnatal day (P) 12. Rats were later given eyeblink conditioning for 6 sessions with an auditory conditioned stimulus on P17-19, P21-23, or P24-26. Lesions impaired eyeblink conditioning on P21-23 and P24-26 but not on P17-19. The results suggest that the septohippocampal system comes online to facilitate acquisition of eyeblink conditioning between P19 and P21. Developmental changes in septohippocampal modulation of the cerebellum may play a significant role in the ontogeny of eyeblink conditioning.
