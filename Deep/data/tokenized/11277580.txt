Expression of monocarboxylate transporter MCT1 was studied in archival tissues from human CNS using antibodies to the carboxyl-terminal end of MCT1. Sections of neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of brains from 10 adult autopsy patients who died from other than CNS disease, and from archival surgical biopsy specimens of 83 primary CNS and eight non-CNS tumors were studied. MCT1 immunoreactivity was present in microvessels and, ependymocytes of normal CNS tissues similar to that reported for MCT1 expression in rat brains. MCT1 immunoreactivity was strongest in ependymomas, hemangioblastomas and high grade glial neoplasms, and weakest in low grade gliomas. Increased MCT1 expression in high grade glial neoplasms may provide a potential therapeutic target for treatment of some CNS neoplasms.
