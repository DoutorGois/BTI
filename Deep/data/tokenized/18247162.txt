The regimen of estrogen replacement can alter the consequences of estrogen therapy and stressors. To determine the long-term effects and interaction of these systems on the brain and periphery, adult female rats were infused with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the fourth ventricle of the brain for 4 weeks, and ovariectomized rats were administered either constant or pulsed regimens of estrogen replacement (17beta-estradiol) until sacrifice at 8 weeks. Constant, but not pulsed, estrogen replacement reduced ERalpha and increased HSP90, HSP70, and PR(B) uterine protein levels. Both estrogen regimens increased ERbeta, HSP27, and PR(A) uterine proteins. Both regimens reduced hypothalamic levels of ERalpha, but not ERbeta, HSP, or PR. No changes were observed in the hippocampus. Long-term brain infusion of LPS activated microglia and reduced body weight, but did not alter corticosterone or nitrotyrosine levels. LPS infusion into intact rats suppressed uterine weight, increased ERalpha and decreased HSP90 in the uterus. LPS did not alter uterine weight in ovariectomized rats treated with constant or pulsed estrogen. Together, these data suggest the timing of estrogen replacement and neuroinflammatory stressors can profoundly affect uterine and hypothalamic steroid receptor expression and may be important parameters to consider in the post-menopausal intervention with estrogen.
