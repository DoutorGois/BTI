Relaxation times (T1 and T2) and water content are measured in frontal cortex, amygdaloid cortex, hippocampus, mid-brain and cerebellum of rat brain. Differences are found in relaxation times, between areas containing a mixture of grey and white matter, and grey matter only. Differences were also found between certain grey matter areas. Relaxation times correlated with water content.
