Rat experiments were performed to study variations in serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-hydroxy indole acetic acid) in different CNS compartments. Control animals were exposed to an acute vibration stress (10 Hz, 1 mm, 2 m/sec2, 15 min) and experimental animals to a prolonged (52-54 days) vibration test. Acute vibration led to 5-HT activation which was most significant in the hippocampus, diencephalon, cerebellum and in the sacrolumbar cord. Prolonged vibration caused an increase of 5-HT in the parietal cortex and its enhanced utilization in the striatum, diencephalon, pons and in the sacrolumbar cord. As compared to the controls, vibration produced a smaller accumulation of 5-HT in the hippocampus and a larger accumulation in the cerebellum, diencephalon, medulla oblongata and spinal cord. The paper discusses the role of regional changes in 5-HT metabolism and reactivity of serotoninergic structures in the mechanism of vibration-related somatosensory disorders.
