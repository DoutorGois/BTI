Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in many neuronal functions such as neuromodulation and intracellular signaling. Recent studies have demonstrated that nitric oxide is involved in regulation of proteasomal protein degradation. However, its role in neuronal protein degradation still remains unclear. In our study, we investigated the influence of endogenous nitric oxide production in this process. We have shown that nitric oxide synthase blockade prevents decline of the Ub(G76V)-GFP fluorescence (GFP-based proteasomal protein degradation reporter) in neuronal processes of the cultured hippocampal neurons. It suggests that nitric oxide may regulate ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal protein degradation in neurons. Also, we have confirmed that the NO synthesis blockade alone significantly impairs long-term potentiation, and demonstrated for the first time that simultaneous blockade of the NO and proteins synthesis leads to the long-term potentiation amplitude rescue to the control values. Obtained results suggest that nitric oxide is involved in the protein degradation in proteasomes in physiological conditions.
