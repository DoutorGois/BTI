Depressive disorder is still a rising and important problem in the modern world, it affects about 15% of the population. Present forms of treatment are effective in about 70% and require monthly therapy which sometimes causes side effects. Last decade studies paid attention to theories different to monoaminergic and to neurodegenerative changes mainly in the limbic system of hippocampus. In this article authors show a relationship between calcium ions, glutaminergic transduction and disfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. They also take into account the activity of calcium dependent ATPase and its influence on overproduction of reactive oxygen species in the central neuron system (CNS). In the second part authors conclude that deregulation of calcium ions concentration in and out of cells and decreased activity of calcium dependent ATPase stimulate tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorilation. Mitochondria work faster and consume more oxygen. It correlates well with overproduction of reactive oxygen species (RFT). Above process results in neurons apoptosis and necrosis.
