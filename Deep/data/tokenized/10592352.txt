The measurement of the total level of nitric oxide (NO) metabolite (NO(x)(-)) by microdialysis has recently been used to assess the production of NO in the in vivo brain [D. Luo, S. Knezevich, S.R. Vincent, N-Methyl-D-aspartate-induced nitric oxide release: an in vivo microdialysis study, Neuroscience, 57 (1993), 897-900; K. Ohta, N. Arai, M. Shibata, J. Hamada, S. Komatsumoto, K. Shimazu, Y. Fukuuchi, A novel in vivo system for consecutive measurement of brain nitric oxide production combined with the microdialysis technique, Neurosci. Lett., 176 (1994), 165-168; K. Shintani, S. Kanba, T. Nakai, K. Sato, G. Yagi, R. Kato, M. Arai, Measurement by in vivo microdialysis of nitric oxide release in the rat cerebellum, J. Psychiatr. Neurosci., 3 (1994), 217-221; H. Togashi, K. Mori, K. Ueno, M. Matsumoto, N. Suda, H. Saito, M. Yoshika, Consecutive evaluation of nitric oxide production after transient cerebral ischemia in the rat hippocampus using in vivo brain microdialysis, Neurosci. Lett., 240 (1998), 53-57]. Although several methods are available for detecting NO(x)(-) levels in dialysates, these methods are either not sensitive enough or require expensive experimental equipment. The method described herein provides a convenient and sensitive procedure for determining NO(x)(-) levels in dialysates. This method is useful for the in vivo study of NO production from various brain regions in various pathological conditions, and can be applied to other tissues.
