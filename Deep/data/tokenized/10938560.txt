Unilateral temporal lobectomy to treat seizure disorders in humans often results in cognitive impairment after the surgery. To determine the potential utility of a rodent model of unilaterally induced cognitive deficits, the present experiment evaluated spatial cognition in adult rats after either left or right hemisphere lesioning of temporal neocortex and underlying hippocampal regions. Evaluation of performance in the eight arm radial maze revealed that both lesioned groups committed more reference memory errors than did nonoperated controls. Working memory errors did not differ statistically between groups. The production of a spatial learning deficit by unilateral damage suggests that this rodent model could serve to test potential improvements in interventional strategies aimed at attenuating cognitive effects of the surgical treatment.
