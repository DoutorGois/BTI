Rats were subjected to hypoxia for 30 min in a chamber containing 5% O2 and 95% N2. The distribution of damaged neurons in the hippocampus was then examined at various predetermined times, ranging from 3 hours to 21 days after hypoxia. Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections showed shrunken and eosinophilic neurons in the CA3 and CA4 regions. Similar, but less severe, changes were also observed in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. In contrast, neurons in the CA1 region were relatively resistant to hypoxia. These results showed the susceptibility of the hippocampus to hypoxia, although the affected neurons are not the same as those vulnerable to ischemia.
