Bcl-2 family gene products are critical to the integration of cell death stimuli that target the mitochondrion. Proapoptotic BAD (Bcl-2-associated death protein) has been shown to dissociate from its sequestered site with the molecular chaperone protein 14-3-3 and displace proapoptotic BAX (Bcl-2-associated X protein) from antiapoptotic BCL-Xl. BAX subsequently translocates to the mitochondrion and induces cytochrome c release and caspase activation. Herein we report the response of the key members of this proposed pathway after seizures. Seizures evoked by microinjection of kainic acid into the amygdala of the rat induced unilateral CA3 pyramidal neuron death with features of apoptosis. In control hippocampus and cortex, BAD was found constitutively bound to 14-3-3, whereas BCL-Xl bound BAX. Within damaged hippocampus, seizures induced the dissociation of BAD from 14-3-3 and the subsequent dimerization of BAD with BCL-Xl as determined by immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical colocalization. 14-3-3 was found to translocate to the nucleus of degenerating neurons, whereas BAX accumulated at mitochondrial membranes. In contrast, the primarily uninjured cortex exhibited increased phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B), which may phosphorylate and inhibit BAD, and no altered binding of BAD to BCL-Xl. Finally, administration of an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002), thought to be an upstream activator of Akt, exacerbated cortical apoptosis after seizures. These data suggest that seizures elicit divergent cell death and survival responses within neuronal populations and that the BAD cell death pathway may perform an instigator or reinforcement role in seizure-induced neuronal death.
