Conventional intravital microscopy has generally been limited to superficial brain areas such as the olfactory bulb, the neocortex, or the cerebellar cortex. In vivo optical microendoscopy uses gradient refractive index (GRIN) microlenses that can be inserted into tissue to image cells in deeper areas. This protocol describes in vivo microendoscopy of the mouse hippocampus. The general methodology can be applied to many deep brain regions and other areas of the body.
