There are several adaptor proteins associated with clathrin coated vesicles. Among them are AP180 and AP-2. We and others have previously described synaptic localization of AP180. AP180 immunoreactivity is altered in both the superior frontal gyrus and hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We here investigate the location and alteration of another adaptor protein, AP-2. In contrast to AP180, we have found that AP-2 is expressed by both neurons and glia. Furthermore, the only noticeable change of AP-2 in AD is a loss of its immunoreactivity in layer II of the superior frontal gyrus.
