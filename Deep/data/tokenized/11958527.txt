Changes in tissue and extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in raphe dorsalis, raphe medialis and in their main projections areas (hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex) were investigated at short and long-term times after single injection (5 mg/kg ip) of a novel tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, p-ethynylphenylalanine (p-EPA). The 5-HT tissue concentration decreased significantly in raphe nuclei, 30 min post-injection and for 4 days, whereas it decreased from 24 hours post-injection in the 5-HT projections. Normal 5-HT levels reappeared after 12 days post-injection in all areas. Moreover, in the projection areas, the extracellular 5-HT levels decreased rapidly, 90, 40 and 30 min after p-EPA injection, in hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex, respectively. Decreased accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) under NSD-101 perfusion in the serotoninergic projections after p-EPA injection, confirmed the direct inhibitory effect of the drug on the tryptophan hydroxylase activity. These results demonstrated that p-EPA is a useful pharmacological tool which powerfully, acutely and irreversibly reduces the 5-HT levels.
