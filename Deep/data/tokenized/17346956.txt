Glutamate-induced cell death of hippocampal HT22 cells is a model system for neuronal disorders due to depletion of glutathione levels and increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Standardized extracts of Hypericum perforatum (HPE) contain flavonoids known for antioxidative properties. In the above model, cytoprotective effects at a concentration of 0.05% HPE by attenuation of calcium fluxes and cellular energy statuses are reported.
