Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons respond in vitro and in vivo to nerve growth factor (NGF) and to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). It is not clear to what extent the neurons that respond to these two factors, or to neurotrophin-3 or -4/5 (NT-3; NT-4/5) are identical or only partially overlapping populations. We have addressed this issue in cultures of basal forebrain neurons derived from 2-week-old postnatal rats, using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as cholinergic markers. Cholinergic neuron survival was enhanced in the presence of NGF, BDNF and NT-4/5. NT-4/5 was as effective as BDNF. NT-3 was without effect at this age, although in cultures derived from embryonic forebrain, cholinergic differentiation was induced by NT-3. Cotreatment with NGF and BDNF resulted in small, but consistent increases in the number of ChAT-positive neurons, compared with either factor alone. NT-4/5 was also found to be additive with NGF, whereas cotreatment with BDNF and NT-4/5 showed no additivity. NT-3 had no additive effects with any other neurotrophin on any cholinergic parameters in postnatal cultures. Taken together, the results indicate the existence in postnatal rat brain of a large overlapping population of cholinergic neurons that are responsive to ligands for the neurotrophin receptors TrkA (NGF) and TrkB (BDNF and NT-4/5), but not TrkC (NT-3), and small distinct populations that show specificity for NGF or BDNF but not both. We hypothesize that cholinergic neurons projecting into different regions of the hippocampus may derive trophic support from distinct neurotrophins.
