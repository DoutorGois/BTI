The spatio-temporal organization of the cortical potentials in rabbits was investigated by means of comparison of successive electroencephalotopograms. This systemic organization was characterized by the potentials' sagittal gradient and its inversion within the 4-6/sec range due to higher amplitudes in the frontal cortical areas, - during natural transition from the active to passive behavior as well as after low-frequency stimulation of the thalamic midline nuclei and of the hypothalamic supraoptic area. Single stimuli applied to the structures under study ordinarily prevented any obvious active behavioral periods, although entailed no long-lasting changes in the rest-activity dynamics.
