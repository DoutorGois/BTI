Our previous studies showed that the concentration of the beta subunit of nerve growth factor (beta-NGF) in nervous tissues is higher in male than in female mice. To identify the brain regions that are affected by androgens, the amounts of beta-NGF protein and its mRNAs were measured in male, female, and castrated male CD-1 mice and testicular feminization mice at 3-4 months of age. Among tissues examined, the hypophysis of males contained the highest average concentration of beta-NGF protein. In most regions of the brain, individual levels were more variable in males than in females. However, after the castration, such variations in beta-NGF levels disappeared. Average levels of beta-NGF protein in males were higher in the cerebellum (eightfold higher), olfactory bulb (12-fold higher), hypothalamus (sixfold higher), and hypophysis (72-fold higher) than those in corresponding regions of females. No significant differences were observed in levels of beta-NGF protein in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum, septum, and brainstem. The castration of male mice caused a reduction in levels of beta-NGF protein in the hypothalamus and hypophysis, but not in the cerebellum and olfactory bulb, to the female levels. The concentrations of beta-NGF protein in testicular feminization mice were similar to those in female CD-1 mice in all regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
