Rats were submitted to single or repeated (7 days, one session for each day) sessions of electroconvulsive shock. A computer-assisted morphometric and microdensitometric analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein-, ornithine decarboxylase-, somatostatin- and cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivities was performed in the hippocampal formation and other brain areas. The results of the study showed a significant increase of the intensity of the immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein, ornithine decarboxylase, somatostatin and cholecystokinin in the hippocampal formation and distinctively in the dentate gyrus following repeated, but not single, electroconvulsive shock. No significant change was found in the number of somatostatin- and cholecystokinin-like immunoreactive cell bodies in any hippocampal subregion and in the number of glial cells in the hilus of dentate gyrus in rats treated with single or repeated electroconvulsive shock. It is a distinct possibility that the observed increase in the content of the neuropeptides in the hippocampal formation reflects a compensatory response of the brain to seizure-inducing stimuli and that such an increase may play a role in the therapeutic effect of electroconvulsive shock.
