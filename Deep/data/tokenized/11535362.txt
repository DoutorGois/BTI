Based on the use of Scutellaria baicalensis for the treatment of stroke in traditional Oriental medicine, the current study was carried out to evaluate neuroprotective effects of S. baicalensis after transient global ischemia using rat 4-vessel occlusion model. Methanol extracts from the dried roots of S. baicalensis (0.1-10 mg/kg) administered intra-peritoneally significantly protected CA1 neurons against 10 min transient forebrain ischemia as demonstrated by measuring the density of neuronal cells stained with Cresyl violet. Methanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibited microglial tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and nitric oxide production, and protected PC12 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity in vitro.
