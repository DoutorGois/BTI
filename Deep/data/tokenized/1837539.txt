Neocortex and hippocampus play important role in motor activity, neuronal plasticity and learning and memory mechanisms. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of neocortex and hippocampus of rat following NMDA-receptor agonist, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), 0.25-2 nmol in 10 microliters, ICV and noncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonists, MK 801 (0.025-0.1 mg/kg, ip) and ketamine (10-50 mg/kg, ip) at OH, 1/2H, 4H, 8H and 24H was recorded. The electrodes were implanted stereotaxically in hippocampus and neocortex respectively. NMDA (0.25 and 1 nmol) showed longer lasting decrease in amplitude in hippocampus and in frequency in cortical neurons while 2 nmol produced epileptogenic neurotoxicity. Opposite effect i.e. increase in amplitude in both, hippocampus and neocortex was observed with MK 801 and ketamine and these agents also showed longer lasting influence. Administration of MK 801 (0.05 mg/kg) and ketamine (50 mg/kg) prior to NMDA 2 nmol protected 40% animals from NMDA-induced neurotoxicity and blockade of NMDA-induced long term influence. The EEG effect of NMDA agonist and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity at higher dose and its modification by NMDA-antagonist, MK 801 and ketamine suggest that beside NMDA agonists (NMDA), its antagonists may, also affect long lasting changes in hippocampus and cortex. These antagonists reverse NMDA-mediated long term influence in these brain areas.
