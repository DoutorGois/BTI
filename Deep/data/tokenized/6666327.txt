The difference index of functional states of brain structures (the hippocampus, amygdala, frontal cortex) was estimated in dogs under the action of anticipating and triggering signals of a complex conditioned stimulus consisting of two similar tones, divided by a pause. It was found that during both signals the functional states of the brain structures were equivalent, though food-procuring behaviour of the animals under the action of the anticipating stimulus was inhibited. This fact corroborates the assumption that reactions of inhibitory type are determined by a high level of the brain structures functional state.
