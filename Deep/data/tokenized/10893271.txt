Intercellular adhesion molecule-5 (ICAM-5) is a dendritically polarized membrane glycoprotein in telencephalic neurons, which shows heterophilic binding to leukocyte beta(2)-integrins. Here, we show that the human ICAM-5 protein interacts in a homophilic manner through the binding of the immunoglobulin domain 1 to domains 4-5. Surface coated ICAM-5-Fc promoted dendritic outgrowth and arborization of ICAM- 5-expressing hippocampal neurons. During dendritogenesis in developing rat brain, ICAM-5 was in monomer form, whereas in mature neurons it migrated as a high molecular weight complex. The findings indicate that its homophilic binding activity was regulated by nonmonomer/monomer transition. Thus, ICAM-5 displays two types of adhesion activity, homophilic binding between neurons and heterophilic binding between neurons and leukocytes.
