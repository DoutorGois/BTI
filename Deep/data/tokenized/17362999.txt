The role of tau phosphorylation and tau aggregation in the pathology of a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses GSK-3beta and FTDP-17 tau has been analyzed. In that model we have suggested a possible role for tau phosphorylation, but not for tau aggregation, in the cognitive impairment found in the transgenic mouse.
