In the brain, the action of glucocorticoid steroids is mediated via two intracellular receptors, the mineralocorticoid (MR), or type I receptor, and the glucocorticoid (GR), or type II receptor. These receptors are expressed in many types of neurons and are co-expressed in some neurons such as the hippocampal pyramidal cells. Although glucocorticoids are known to affect gliogenesis and glial cell differentiation, the expression of the GR in different types of glial cells throughout the brain has not been thoroughly studied and the expression of the MR in glia not previously reported. Here we review studies suggesting that both receptors are expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.
