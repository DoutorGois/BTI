Hippocampal ablated homing pigeons have been shown to suffer a retrograde spatial reference memory deficit involving a preoperatively acquired homeward orientation response based on local cues around a previously visited release site. Here we report that the postoperative acquisition of such a response is unimpaired. Initially, 25 hippocampal ablated and 11 sham-operated controls were given 5 training releases from each of two sites. In the subsequent experimental releases from the two training sites, the controls and half the hippocampal-ablated pigeons had their navigational maps rendered dysfunctional via an anosmic procedure. Nonetheless, both groups successfully oriented homeward, indicating that the hippocampal-ablated pigeons were unimpaired in the acquisition and implementation of directionally useful information around the training sites to direct a homeward orientation response. The remaining half of the hippocampal-ablated pigeons who were not rendered anosmic, and thus served as controls, also oriented homeward. The data indicate that, for hippocampal-ablated homing pigeons, postoperative acquisition is unimpaired in the same spatial reference memory task where a robust retrograde impairment was observed. However, the hippocampal-ablated pigeons were impaired in the time required to return home, indicating a deficit in homing performance beyond the initial orientation stage.
