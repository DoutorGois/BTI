BACKGROUND The endogenous protein annexin A1 (ANXA1) is an anti-inflammatory mediator in the brain that is thought to contribute to the progression of many neurological conditions. However, its exact role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) remains unclear. We hypothesized that ANXA1 exerts negative actions on TLE by alleviating inflammatory damage in neurons. To identify the potential mechanism of TLE by assessing ANXA1 expression in TLE rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS TLE was induced in rats (n=70) via an intraperitoneal injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) and pilocarpine (PILO). The control group (n=10) received an injection of the equivalent amount of saline. ANXA1 expression was detected via immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS Successful establishment of the TLE model in rats resulted in epileptic seizures. ANXA1 was immunohistochemically detected as brownish yellow particles in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 region of the door zone; this expression was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm of glia rather than neurons. ANXA1 expression was stronger in TLE rats compared with the control group. ANXA1 expression in TLE was also assessed via Western blotting, and compared between groups at various time points. ANXA1 expression was significantly increased in the acute (the first 24 h) and chronic (after 1 month) phases (P<0.001) but significantly decreased during the recovery phase (72 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks) (P<0.001). These findings suggest that ANXA1 expression is correlated with TLE activity. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that ANXA1 plays an important role in TLE by alleviating inflammatory damage and protecting neurons.
