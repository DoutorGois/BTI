BACKGROUND: Status epilepticus (SE), is characterized by high mortality and morbidity, which can cause neuronal injury, neuronal death and alteration of neuronal networks, Recently, inflammation was shown to play a significant role in SE pathogenesis. And miRNA-146a has been shown to be involved in inflammation and to inhibit inflammatory cytokines through NF-kappaB pathway. In our study, we investigated the relationship between inflammation and miR-146a expression. METHOD: The SE rat model was induced by lithium-pilocarpine. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) was performed to observe the histopathology of the rat hippocampus. The expression of COX-2, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta were respectively measured by Western blot and Bio-Plex ProTM Assays. The miR-146a expression in hippocampus tissue was measured by Quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: microRNA-146a was highly expressed in the hippocampus of SE rats coupled with increased level of inflammatory cytokines than the normal group. And TQ can attune the expression of inflammatory cytokines, meanwhile, miR-146a was lower in TQ group. The expression of miRNA-146a were positively correlated with the level of inflammatory reaction. CONCLUSION: TQ may alleviate the inflammatory reaction by inhibiting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Our study shows that miRNA-146a was involved in the inflammatory response and indicated inflammation severity in SE rats. Therefore, miRNA-146a may serve as a potential biomarker or a therapeutic target in SE.
