The effect of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, on hippocampal selective neuronal death was morphologically studied in rats subjected to 10 min forebrain ischemia using a 4-vessel occlusion model. Neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 subfield 72 h after ischemic insult was dramatically decreased by the lasting inhibition of protein synthesis through consecutive administration of cycloheximide. Cycloheximide, which was administered once within the first 24 h of recirculation, showed protective action on ischemic cell necrosis and its most potent effect was observed when injected at 12 h of post-ischemia. After 36 h of recirculation, however, treatment with cycloheximide could no longer prevent cell death. The possibility is considered that hippocampal delayed neuronal death following transient ischemia is caused by abnormal protein(s).
