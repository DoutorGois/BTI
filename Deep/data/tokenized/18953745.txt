OBJECTIVE: To determine differential gene expression of hippocampus in rats following complete cerebral ischemia with treatment of profound hypothermia compared to normothermia. METHODS: Six rats got 5 minutes of complete cerebral ischemia with circulatory arrest and randomly divided into two groups: normothermia ischemia group (37 +/- 0.3 degrees C, n = 3) and profound hypothermia ischemia group (18 +/- 0.5 degrees C, n = 3). Affymetrix U34A rat arrays were applied to detect the difference of gene expression profile in hippocampus between the two groups. RESULTS: Expression profiles of a total of 75 transcripts in the profound hypothermia ischemia group were statistically different from those of the normothermia ischemia group, and 33 of them were significantly up-regulated and other 42 were significantly down-regulated (p < 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with normothermia, profound hypothermia had a significant effect on the gene expression profiles following complete cerebral ischemia, which may be involved in the mechanisms of cerebral protection by profound hypothermia.
