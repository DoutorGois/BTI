The effects of the isoquinolinesulfonamide protein kinase inhibitors 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) and N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA1004) on CA1 responses in hippocampal slices of the rat were examined to clarify their mode of action, and also to further define the role of Ca(2+) -dependent kinases in long-term potentiation. Initially, the inhibitory potencies of H-7 and HA1004 against both protein kinase C and type II Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase were examined in standard in vitro phosphorylation assays. The apparent Ki values of H-7 and HA1004 for protein kinase C were 9 and 57 microM, respectively. In contrast, the Ki values of H-7 and HA1004 for type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase were 156 and 13 microM, respectively. These results indicate that H-7 is a more effective inhibitor of protein kinase C, whereas HA1004 is a more effective inhibitor of type II calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Following the induction of long-term potentiation, addition of 50 microM H-7 or HA1004 substantially increased the amplitude of the population spike in a control pathway, while producing no change or a slight increase in the spike amplitude in a previously potentiated long-term potentiation pathway. Moreover, H-7 (50 microM), but not HA1004, produced multiple population spikes in both pathways. Addition of a higher concentration of H-7 (300 microM) reduced the amplitude of the initial population spike but still produced multiple spikes. HA1004 (300 microM) typically produced effects similar to those observed with 50 microM H-7, increasing the amplitude of the control population spike and producing multiple spike activity in both pathways. In contrast to the differential concentration-dependent effects of H-7 on the population spike responses, qualitatively similar effects were observed at both low (50 microM) and high (300 microM) concentrations with regard to synaptic field responses. The initial slope of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential was significantly reduced by H-7, to a similar degree in both pathways. HA1004 produced a modest, but insignificant reduction in both pathways. These results, in conjunction with other reports, suggest that H-7 and HA1004 exert complex concentration-dependent effects with synchronously affect both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. We hypothesize that reduction of the population excitatory postsynaptic potential and spike (300 microM H-7) is due to reduction of excitatory inputs, whereas enhancement of the population spike amplitude (50 microM H-7) and the production of multiple spikes are due to the reduction of GABA-mediated inhibitory inputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
