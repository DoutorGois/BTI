A series of proflavine derivatives for use to further image Abeta amyloid deposits were synthesized and characterized. Aged 3xTg-AD (23 months old) mice hippocampus sections incubated with these derivatives revealed preferential labeling of amyloid plaques. Furthermore an in vitro binding study showed an inhibitory effect, although moderate, of these compounds on Abeta(40) fibril formation. This study highlights the potential of proflavine as a molecular scaffold for designing new Abeta imaging agents, its native fluorescence allowing in vitro neuropathological staining in AD damaged brain sections.
