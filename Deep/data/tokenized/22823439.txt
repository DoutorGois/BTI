Neuroinflammation essentially involves an activation of glial cells as the cause/effect of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasmalogens (Pls) are glycerophospholipids constituting cellular membranes and play significant roles in membrane fluidity and cellular processes like vesicular fusion and signal transduction. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 250 mug/kg) for 7 days resulted in the morphological changes and increase in number of Iba-1(+) microglia showing neuroinflammation in the adult mouse hippocampus. The LPS-induced activation of glial cells was significantly attenuated by i.p. pretreatment with Pls dissolved in corn oil. In addition, systemic injection of LPS induced Abeta(1-16) (+) neurons in the hippocampus were also abolished by application of Pls. Finally, contents of Pls in the hippocampus decreased after LPS injection, and the reduction was suppressed by administration of Pls. These findings suggest an antiamyloidogenic effect of Pls, implicating a possible therapeutic application of Pls against AD.
