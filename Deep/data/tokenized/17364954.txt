The objective of this study is to determine the effect of lead (pb) on antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation products in different regions of rat brain. Wistar male rats were treated with lead acetate (500 ppm) through drinking water for a period of 8 weeks. Control animals were maintained on sodium acetate. Treated and control rats were sacrificed at intervals of 1st, 4th and 8th week and the whole brains were dissected on ice into four regions namely the cerebellum, the hippocampus, the frontal cortex and the brain stem. Antioxidant enzymes namely catalase and superoxide dismutase in all the four regions of brain were determined. In addition, lipid peroxidation products were also estimated. The results indicated a gradual increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes in different regions of the brain and this response was time-dependent. However, the increase was more in the cerebellum and the hippocampus compared to other regions of the brain. The lipid peroxidation products also showed a similar trend suggesting increased effect of lead in these two regions of the brain. The data indicated a region-specific oxidative stress in the brain exposed to lead.
