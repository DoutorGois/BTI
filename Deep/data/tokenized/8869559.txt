Galanin-like immunoreactive terminals hyperinnervate the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the hypothesis that galanin acts directly on basal forebrain cell bodies, in vivo microdialysis studies were conducted in awake rats which analyzed the actions of galanin on acetylcholine release. Microinjection of galanin into the cholinergic cell body region of the medial septum-diagonal band (MS-DBB) inhibited acetylcholine release in the ventral hippocampus. These results are consistent with an interpretation that galanin terminals synapsing on cholinergic cell bodies of the basal forebrain may serve to inhibit the release of acetylcholine in the terminal fields of the cholinergic neurons.
