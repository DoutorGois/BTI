Lesions to the entorhinal afferent of the hippocampus in rats caused marked changes in calcium transport into mitochondria. Pyruvate-supported calcium transport into mitochondria from the denervated hippocampus was decreased to a larger extent than succinate-supported transport, and adenosine triphosphate-supported transport was not significantly modified. Although cytochrome oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase activities were not significantly changed by entorhinal lesions, pyruvate flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase was significantly decreased, and this effect was correlated with changes in pyruvate-supported calcium transport. The active portion of pyruvate dehydrogenase decreased, whereas total pyruvate dehydrogenase was not modified. These data suggest that denervation might initiate dendritic atrophy and subsequent growth responses by modifying calcium regulation through a change in the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase.
