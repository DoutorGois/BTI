In the current study, the partial NMDA receptor agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) rescued memory consolidation following systemic bacterial endotoxin exposure. DCS failed, however, to restore hippocampal BDNF mRNA levels that were diminished following a systemic administration of LPS, and did not alter NR1 or NR2C NMDA receptor subunit expression. These results extend prior research into the role of DCS in neural-immune interactions, and indicate that the detrimental effects of peripheral LPS administration on consolidation of contextual fear memory may be ameliorated with DCS treatment, though the mechanisms underlying these effects are currently unclear.
