Impaired folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (OCM) has emerged as a risk factor for several diseases associated with age-related cognitive decline, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown and thus hinder the identification of subpopulations most vulnerable to OCM disruption. Here we investigated the role of serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1), a folate-dependent enzyme regulating de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, in influencing neuronal and cognitive function in the adult mouse. We observed Shmt1 expression in the hippocampus, including the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG), and examined hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent fear conditioning in mice deficient for Shmt1. We used a 3 x 3 design in which adult male Shmt1(+/+), Shmt1(+/-), and Shmt1(-/-) mice were fed folic acid control (2 mg/kg), folic acid-deficient (0 mg/kg), or folic acid-supplemented (8 mg/kg) diets from weaning through the duration of the study. Proliferation within the DG was elevated by 70% in Shmt1(+/-) mice, yet the number of newborn mature neurons was reduced by 98% compared with that in Shmt1(+/+) mice. Concomitant with these alterations, Shmt1(+/-) mice showed a 45% reduction in mnemonic recall during trace fear conditioning. Dietary folate manipulations alone did not influence neural outcomes. Together, these data identify SHMT1 as one of the first enzymes within the OCM pathway to regulate neuronal and cognitive profiles and implicate impaired thymidylate biosynthesis in the etiology of folate-related neuropathogenesis.
