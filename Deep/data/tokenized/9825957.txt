Mice harboring random gene-trap insertions of a lacZ (beta-galactosidase)-neomycin resistance fusion cassette (beta-geo) were analyzed for expression in the hippocampus. In 4 of 15 lines reporter gene activity was observed in the hippocampal formation. In the obn line, enzyme activity was detected in the CA1-3 hippocampal subfields, in hpk expression was restricted to CA1, but in both lines reporter activity was also present in other brain regions. In the third line, kin, reporter activity was robustly expressed throughout the stratum pyrimidale of CA1-3, with only low-level expression elsewhere. The final line (glnC) displayed ubiquitous expression of the reporter and was not analyzed further. Fusion transcripts for the first three lines were characterized; all encode polypeptides with features of membrane-associated signalling proteins. The obn fusion identified a human cDNA (B2-1) encoding a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, while hpk sequences matched the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) inducible G-protein coupled receptor, EBI-1. kin identified an alternative form of the abl-related nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-arg. Electrophysiological studies on mice homozygous for the insertions revealed normal synaptic transmission, paired pulse facilitation and paired-pulse depression at Schaffer collateral-commissural CA1 synapses, and normal long-term potentiation (LTP) in obn and kin. hpk mice displayed an increase in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP), suggesting a role for this receptor in synaptic plasticity.
