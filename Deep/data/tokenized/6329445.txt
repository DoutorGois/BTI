We studied the responses of rat cingulate cortex neurons to electrical stimulation of the subicular complex. Intracellular and 'quasi-intracellular' recordings from layer V posterior cingulate neurons showed that stimulation of the presubiculum or postsubiculum evoked EPSPs and action potentials. These were usually followed by shallow IPSPs averaging 122 ms in duration. Frequency potentiation of an EPSP was demonstrated in one case. Laminar analysis of field potentials provided evidence for a source of excitatory synaptic drive in layer II-III of the posterior cingulate cortex, where the subicular projections terminate, presumably on apical dendrites of layer V pyramids. Intracellular HRP injection of neurons showing EPSPs after subicular complex stimulation established that these responsive neurons were layer V pyramids. One cell with physiological properties characteristic of inhibitory interneurons was recorded in layer V. Stimulation of the thalamic nuclei lateralis and anterior ventralis also evoked EPSPs and action potentials in layer V cingulate neurons. In one cell it was possible to show that EPSPs evoked by presubicular stimulation and by nucleus anterior ventralis summed. These results indicate that subicular and thalamic afferents make excitatory synaptic contact onto dendrites of the same layer V cingulate neurons; that spatial summation can integrate the input from these two sources; and that inhibition from local interneurons limits the duration of this excitatory influence.
