Rats were rapidly kindled with electrical stimuli to the hippocampus, and the concentrations of GABA and related amino acids were measured in several brain regions, both in the baseline kindled state and during active seizures. In the baseline kindled state, a consistent pattern was found throughout the hippocampus where GABA levels were depressed and glutamate and glutamine levels were elevated. During seizures GABA rose slightly while glutamate and glutamine increased to twice control values. These changes were seen to various degrees in other brain areas. Turnover in the GABA-glutamate-glutamine cycle was measured in kindled rats experiencing seizures and compared to control animals. During seizures there was an increased turnover of the excitatory compounds glutamate and aspartate relative to GABA. The data indicate that kindling produces a change of presynaptic GABA metabolism which results in diminished inhibition.
