Application of 1 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) either immediately before or following tetanic stimulation inhibits the induction of CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). We have examined the effect of trans-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD), norepinephrine and acetylcholine on this NMDA-mediated LTP inhibition using extracellular recordings from in vitro rat hippocampal slices. When NMDA is accompanied by 100 microM ACPD or 10 microM norepinephrine, the block of LTP is overcome. The norepinephrine effect is mimicked by phenylephrine and methoxamine and is blocked by phentolamine and prazosin suggesting the involvement of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.
