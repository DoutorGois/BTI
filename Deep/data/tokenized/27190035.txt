In March 2016, meeting organizers Sebastian Jessberger and Hongjun Song brought together over 100 scientists from around the world to Cancun, Mexico to present the latest research on neurogenesis. The meeting covered diverse aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis with a focus on novel technologies, including chemogenetics and optogenetics, live cell two-photon imaging, cell fate reprogramming and human pluripotent stem cell models. This Meeting Review describes the exciting work that was presented and some of the emerging themes from the meeting.
