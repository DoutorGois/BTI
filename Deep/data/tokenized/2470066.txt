The septo-hippocampal neurons (SHNs), located in the medial septum, project to the hippocampal formation. The population of SHNs, as shown by single unit recordings in urethane-anesthetized rats, is heterogeneous, both in terms of patterns of spontaneous activity (a significant proportion of the SHNs display a characteristic rhythmically bursting activity at about 4 Hz) and of conduction velocity. Their average rate of spontaneous discharge is quite high (20 impulses per second). They are excited by the iontophoretic application of acetylcholine and various cholinergic agonists. They are also excited by some peptides such as substance P and TRH. Parallel studies in aged animals show that the physiological properties of the SHNs are altered, while their pharmacological properties seem to be unchanged. Immunohistochemical investigations using antibodies against various peptides and a monoclonal antibody against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) show that SHNs retrogradely-labeled from the hippocampus often contain ChAT, less frequently galanin-like immunoreactivity and in a few cases enkephalin, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, or calcitonin gene-related peptide. In contrast, cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P, somatostatin, dynorphin-B and neurotensin, although present in some medial septal neurons, were never observed in neurons projecting to the hippocampus.
