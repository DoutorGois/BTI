Extract made from hippocampus of rat pups exposed prenatally to an ethanol-supplemented diet was found to contain more neurotrophic activity at postnatal day 21 than that from animals exposed to control diets, when quantified in a dorsal root ganglion bioassay. This apparent upregulation was specific to hippocampal extract (cerebellar and forebrain/midbrain extracts were also assessed), and to this age (P1, P7, P14 and P60 extracts were also tested). It was suggested that this upregulation may be indicative of, or secondary to, trauma resulting from fetal ethanol exposure. It is speculated that such departures from the normal developmental timetable could contribute to anomalies seen in the fetal alcohol syndrome.
