The hippocampal afterdischarge (AD) has been suggested as an index of toxicant-induced CNS change [1]. The present experiments report raised AD thresholds, decreased AD durations, shorter post-stimulation latencies to AD onset, decreased numbers of AD spike complexes and increased numbers of spikes/complex following alcohol administration. Results are discussed in light of single-unit data concerning alcohol effects upon hippocampal cells, and the biphasic effects of alcohol upon behavior.
