The mechanisms by which the direct actions of neuroleptics are translated into therapeutic effects are unknown. We immunocytochemically investigated the expression of Fos- and Jun-related proteins and examined activator protein-1 DNA-binding activity in ddY mouse brain 120 min after the administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg), (-)-sulpiride (20 mg/kg) and a selective dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 (1 mg/kg). The densities of Fos-, FosB-, Fra-1-, Jun- and JunD-immunoreactive nuclei induced by haloperidol and sulpiride in the hippocampus, piriform cortex and accumbens nucleus were higher than those in the control groups. The same regions showed higher densities of FosB-, Fra-1- and JunD-immunoreactive nuclei induced by SCH23390 compared with the control groups. We investigated further the activator protein-1 composite factors using super gel shift assays. These results suggested that induced Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Jun and JunD proteins constitute the activator protein-1 complex after the administration of haloperidol and sulpiride. In contrast, FosB, Fra-1 and JunD appear to constitute the activator protein-1 complex after the administration of SCH23390. Therefore, the diversity of activator protein-1 composite factors suggests that various kinds of gene are induced to act by some neuroleptics.
