This paper introduces a new method for estimating the excitability of brain networks. The motivation for this research was to develop a system that can track pathological changes in excitability, in diseases such as epilepsy. The ability to track excitability may provide a method for anticipating seizures and intervening therapeutically. Four normally healthy canines were implanted with the Medtronic Activia PC+S deep brain stimulation and sensing system. The devices were used to probe the circuit of Papez, with electrical stimulation in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus to measure evoked potentials in the hippocampus. The canines were given three different dosage levels of anti-convulsant medication in an attempt to manipulate the excitability of the network. The results showed changes in the morphology of the evoked potentials, following a circadian profile and reflecting times of drug delivery.
