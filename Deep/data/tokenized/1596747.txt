To study the effects of exogenously applied nerve growth factor (NGF) on colchicine-induced neurodegeneration in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampal formation, colchicine (COLCH) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was infused into the dorsal hippocampus (HPC) followed by unilateral infusion of either purified beta-NGF (in ACSF) or cytochrome C. One week later, animals were tested in activity chambers when NGF treatment was found to reduce the COLCH-induced hyperactivity. Animals were sacrificed 3 or 12 weeks postlesion for neurochemical or morphological analysis. Carbachol-stimulated phosphatidyl inositol (PI) turnover performed in hippocampal slices was not affected by any treatment at 3 weeks. However, 12 weeks after the lesion, CARB stimulation of PI hydrolysis was increased in the COLCH/ACSF group. NGF treatment significantly reduced the hyperstimulation in COLCH-treated rats. Morphological analysis showed that COLCH treatment increased AChE staining in the hippocampus, whereas NGF treatment had no effect on AChE staining. There was no difference in the number of septal ChAT immunoreactive cell bodies of controls or colchicine-treated rats at either time point examined. However, NGF treatment resulted in a significant increase in the number of ChAT immunoreactive cell bodies 3 weeks postlesion. Results from this study indicate that NGF can modify colchicine-induced compensatory changes in hippocampal signal transduction and has transitory influences on cholinergic cells in the medial septum.
