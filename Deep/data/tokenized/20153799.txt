OBJECTIVE: Identification of key molecular changes occurring during epileptogenesis provides better understanding of epilepsy and helps to develop strategies to modify those changes and thus, block the epileptogenic process. Gap junctional communication is thought to be involved in epileptogenesis. This communication can be affected by changes in expression of gap junctional protein subunits called connexins (Cxs). One of the main brain regions involved in epileptogenesis is the hippocampus in which there is a network of gap junctional communication between different cell types. METHOD: Cx36 and Cx43 expressions at both mRNA and protein level were measured in rat hippocampus during epileptogenesis in the kindling model of epilepsy. RESULTS: Cx36 expression at both mRNA and protein level was upregulated during acquisition of focal seizures but returned to basal level after acquisition of secondarily-generalized seizures. No change in Cx43 gene and protein expression was found during kindling epileptogenesis. CONCLUSION: These results further point out the significance of Cx36 as a target to modify epileptogenic process and to develop antiepileptogenic treatments.
