The possibility that astrocytes participate in the pathophysiology of thermal brain injury caused by systemic heat exposure was examined in conscious young rats. The temporal and regional pattern of the astrocytic response to thermal injury was characterized by demonstrating the immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using monoclonal antibody and avidin-biotin complex technique. Exposure of conscious young animals to heat at 38 degrees C for 4 h in a biological oxygen demand incubator resulted in a marked increase of the GFAP immunoreactivity in specific brain regions as compared with the intact controls. The intensity of the increased GFAP immunoreactivity was mainly noted in pons, medulla and cerebellum, followed by thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus and caudate nucleus. The cerebral cortex of heat-exposed animals showed only a mild increase in GFAP immunoreactivity which was predominantly concentrated in cingulate, parietal and pyriform cortices. The immunostaining in general was seen in the perivascular glia, within the neuropil and the glia limitans. This increase in GFAP immunoreactivity was absent in animals exposed to the same ambient temperature (38 degrees C) for 1 h and 2 h, or at a lower temperature (36 degrees C) for 4 h. These results show that (i) astrocytes actively participate in the pathophysiology of heat stress, (ii) endogenous thermal brain injury elicits activation and hypertrophy of astrocytes ("reactive gliosis") depending on the magnitude and duration of the ambient heat stimulus, and (iii) the astrocytic reaction (observed as increased GFAP immunostaining) could be induced much more rapidly within a very short survival period of 4 h, not reported earlier.
