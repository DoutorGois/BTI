The GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI, 10 microM) transformed the evoked synaptic responses, recorded intracellularly from the CA3 area of neonatal (postnatal days 3-7, P3-P7), juvenile (P8-P20) and adult hippocampal slices, into long-lasting paroxysmal depolarizations (PDs), with repetitive action potentials (APs). In the same preparation, GABA(A)-mediated fast-IPSPs were depolarizing at resting membrane potential (RMP), with a reversal potential shifting to a hyperpolarizing direction with age (n=15, P6-P17). BMI provoked also spontaneous PDs in juvenile (20/30) and adult (7/10) but not in neonatal (0/12) neurons. PDs were depressed by either the NMDA receptor antagonist CPP (10 microM) or the non-NMDA antagonist CNQX (10 microM), but were blocked only by the combination of the two (n=6), indicating that activation of either NMDA or non-NMDA receptors can independently sustain PDs in immature hippocampus. In conclusion, these findings show that endogenous GABA tonically inhibits CA3 synaptic responses in neonatal life despite the depolarizing nature of GABA(A)-mediated potentials. Moreover, they suggest that during the 1st postnatal week, disinhibition alone is not sufficient to provoke spontaneous epileptiform discharges in CA3 hippocampal area.
