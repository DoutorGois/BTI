We evaluated long term surgical outcomes in 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and presurgical generalized interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). Following amygdalohippocampectomy, 12 patients (57.1%) were noted to have favorable outcomes (Engel classification of I-II). Favorable outcomes were significantly associated with a history of auras prior to seizure onset (p=0.021), the absence of generalized IEDs on postoperative EEG (p=0.024), and the presence of focal slowing on postoperative EEG (p=0.045).
