Brief periods of high-frequency stimulation of hippocampal afferents produce long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission, but the minimum frequency capable of inducing this alteration in synaptic efficacy has not been specified. The present study used the repeated measurement of input-output curves in the perforant path - dentate gyrus system of freely moving rats to monitor synaptic efficacy and found that stimulation at 0.2 Hz, but not 0.04 Hz produced LTP. These results suggest that the minimum stimulation frequency capable of producing LTP is lower than previously described. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between the present and previous findings are discussed, along with the implications of low-frequency potentiation.
