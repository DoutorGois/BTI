The effect of serum of patients with myocardial ischemia after low-level laser therapy on parameters of synaptic conductance of rat hippocampal neurons was investigated. The serum from patients with an initially low level of neuronal activity obtained after determination of laser irradiation increased the amplitude and that from patients with high activity. Thus the process of normalization of these parameters was observed. Our results may help to optimize the course of medical treatment, and subsequently give an insight to understanding of the mechanism of therapeutic effect of laser irradiation.
