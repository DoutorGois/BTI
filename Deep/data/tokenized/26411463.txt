BACKGROUND: The mesial temporal region (MTR) comprises important components of the limbic system, as well as vital neurovascular structures. Because of its important functional role, as much healthy brain tissue as possible must be preserved while targeting resection of MTR lesions. METHODS: A frontal minicraniotomy is used to access the MTR through a subfrontal approach. By opening the most medial part of the Sylvian fissure, the uncus-amygdala complex is exposed, and through this, the head of the hippocampus can be reached and removed as well. CONCLUSIONS: This approach is extremely suitable for MTR lesions, as it provides the advantage of sparing the most important functional structures of the temporal lobe, the temporal stem, and the limen insulae, as well as the optic radiations and the fronto-occipital connections.
