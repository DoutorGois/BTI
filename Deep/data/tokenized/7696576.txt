This study was undertaken to evaluate the short-term effects of glucocorticoid on the morphological characteristics of cultured rat dentate gyrus (DG) cells using immunocytochemistry for a cytoskeletal protein, micro-tubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2). A selective cell culture system of DG neurons was successfully established. Synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX) increased the total length of immunoreactive (IR) processes of the DG neurones in a dose-dependent manner. DEX also increased the ratio of multipolar neurones with more than three processes. The area of cell body of immunoreactive processes increased with 5 microM DEX treatment. Our results suggest that cytological features of DG cells are strongly influenced by the action of glucocorticoid.
