Chronic treatment with opiates may inhibit cell growth and trigger apoptosis. On the contrary, growth hormone (GH) has been demonstrated to stimulate neurogenesis and counteract apoptosis. We recently demonstrated that recombinant human GH (rhGH) may reverse opiate-induced apoptosis in cells derived from prenatal mouse hippocampus. Thus, GH might be able to prevent the impaired cognitive capabilities that may occur in both humans and other mammals in connection to chronic opiate treatment. In order to explore the mechanism by which GH exerts its beneficial effects we here examined the impact of GH treatment on the levels of delta and mu opioid peptide (DOP and MOP, respectively) receptors in the male rat brain. The rats were treated with rhGH (Genotropin(R)) at two different doses (0.07 and 0.7 IU/kg), twice daily, during 7 days. Following decapitation, the levels of DOP and MOP receptor functionality were determined using [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS autoradiography. The results demonstrate that rhGH affects the levels of the MOP receptor functionality in certain areas of the brain. These alterations were seen in e.g. amygdala and thalamus, i.e. regions that recently have been implicated in learning and memory. The activity level of DOP receptors was not affected. Thus, the data support that the beneficial effect of GH on counteracting apoptosis might involve a direct or indirect effect on the MOP but not the DOP receptor.
