Diabetes has adverse effects on the brain, especially the hippocampus, which is particularly susceptible to synaptic injury and cognitive dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms and strategies to rescue such injury and dysfunction are not well understood. Using a mouse model of type 2 diabetes (db/db mice) and a human neuronal cell line treated with high concentration of glucose, we demonstrate aberrant mitochondrial morphology, reduced ATP production, and impaired activity of complex I. These mitochondrial abnormalities are induced by imbalanced mitochondrial fusion and fission via a glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta)/dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1)-dependent mechanism. Modulation of the Drp1 pathway or inhibition of GSK3beta activity restores hippocampal long-term potentiation that is impaired in db/db mice. Our results point to a novel role for mitochondria in diabetes-induced synaptic impairment. Exploration of the mechanisms behind diabetes-induced synaptic deficit may provide a novel treatment for mitochondrial and synaptic injury in patients with diabetes.
