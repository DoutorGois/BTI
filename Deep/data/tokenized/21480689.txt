The onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often accompanied by changes in emotion, motivation, and goal-directed behavior. The production of beta-amyloid is thought to be a major and early contributor to the pathogenesis of AD. The present study tested the hypothesis that amyloid pathology present in the amygdala, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of Tg2576 mice would disrupt the development of instrumental- and/or Pavlovian-outcome associations. The results showed that both instrumental- and Pavlovian-conditioned behaviors were sensitive to outcome devaluation (Experiments 1 & 2) and that Pavlovian cues influenced goal-directed actions associated with the same outcome (Experiment 2) in Tg2576 mice. In contrast, context mediated Pavlovian-conditioned behaviors in aged (Experiment 3a) but not young (Experiment 3b) Tg2576 mice were insensitive to outcome devaluation. Aged Tg2576, nevertheless, successfully acquired a simple context discrimination at the same rate as control mice. We conclude that amyloid pathology in aged Tg2576 mice may specifically disrupt context-outcome associations supported by the hippocampus and/or its interaction with the amygdala.
