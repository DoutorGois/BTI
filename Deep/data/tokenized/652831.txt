The posttraining intrahippocampal injection of oxotremorine revealed an improvement of the retention performance in a brightness discrimination task. The oxotremorine effect seemed to be dependent on distinct variables of training and was restricted to rats exhibiting a good acquisition performance. Scopolamine impaired the retention performance of animals with few training errors. The role of hippocampal cholinergic synapses for consolidation was discussed.
