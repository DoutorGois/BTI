We describe a highly sensitive assay method for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) using high-performance liquid chromatography with amperometric determination. This assay method could be applicable to any tissues with low enzyme activity, such as rat cerebellum. We also describe the kinetic properties of TH in rat cerebral cortex.
