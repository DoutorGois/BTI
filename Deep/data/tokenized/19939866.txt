Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis sativa constituent, may present a pharmacological profile similar to mood stabilizing drugs, in addition to anti-oxidative and neuroprotective properties. The present study aims to directly investigate the effects of CBD in an animal model of mania induced by D-amphetamine (D-AMPH). In the first model (reversal treatment), rats received saline or D-AMPH (2 mg/kg) once daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) for 14 days, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they were treated with saline or CBD (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg) i.p. twice a day. In the second model (prevention treatment), rats were pretreated with saline or CBD (15, 30, or 60 mg/kg) regime i.p. twice a day, and from the 8th to the 14th day, they also received saline or D-AMPH i.p. once daily. In the hippocampus CBD (15 mg/kg) reversed the d-AMPH-induced damage and increased (30 mg/kg) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. In the second experiment, CBD (30 or 60 mg/kg) prevented the D-AMPH-induced formation of carbonyl group in the prefrontal cortex. In the hippocampus and striatum the D-AMPH-induced damage was prevented by CBD (15, 30 or 60 mg/kg). At both treatments CBD did not present any effect against d-AMPH-induced hyperactivity. In conclusion, we could not observe effects on locomotion, but CBD protect against d-AMPH-induced oxidative protein damage and increased BDNF levels in the reversal model and these effects vary depending on the brain regions evaluated and doses of CBD administered.
