Limbic evoked potentials were recorded from intracerebral electrodes bilaterally implanted in the hippocampi of 16 epileptic patients undergoing evaluation for surgical resection of a seizure focus. Spectral analysis of the limbic evoked potentials revealed consistently lower spectral power of both low-band (1-12.6 Hz) and high-band (13-20 Hz) components recorded form the hippocampus that was associated with the electrographically confirmed seizure focus as compared to the contralateral side. Limbic evoked potential recordings appear to be useful in the determination of a focal functional deficit and thus in identifying the site of epileptogenic pathology. Further, the results support the hypothesis of a local generator for limbic evoked potentials and demonstrate that limbic evoked potentials in humans include not only low-frequency, high-amplitude electric field changes, but also a high-frequency component.
