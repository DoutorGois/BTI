Viability of astrocyte grafts introduced into CA1 pyramidal layer of the left dorsal hippocampus after injection of kainic acid into this brain region and the effects of these grafts on the hippocampus and amygdala were studied on Wistar rats. In rats with astrocyte grafts the degree of destruction in fields CA1-CA2 of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, fields CA3-CA4 of the ventral hippocampus, and central and basolateral amygdala was lower compared to animals with kainic acid-induced hippocampal damage and control rats; destructions in the dentate fascia were absent. Our results suggest that astrocyte grafts stimulate neurogenesis in the mature brain of recipient rats with kainic acid-induced brain damage.
