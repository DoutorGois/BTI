The involvement of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors in hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) depends on the applied tetanic stimulation protocol. Activation of these receptors may cause an elevation of intracellular calcium via the formation of the second messenger inositol triphosphate (IP3) and subsequent intracellular calcium release. It has been shown that the type I metabotropic receptors antagonist L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (L-AP3) blocks CA1 LTP. Combining dendritic calcium and field potential measurements in CA1 hippocampal area, we found that L-AP3 did not affect single calcium transients but reduced the calcium changes evoked by a single tetanus, preventing the long-lasting calcium enhancements associated with CA1 LTP. These findings suggest that the formation of this type of LTP requires calcium release from IP3-sensitive stores.
