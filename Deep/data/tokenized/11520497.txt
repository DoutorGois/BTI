Maternally-deprived male Brown Norway rats were classified as non-impaired or impaired according to their performance in the water maze when 3 and 30-32 months old. Age and spatial learning ability did not affect the pattern and density of hippocampal 5-HT(1A)-receptor mRNA in mother-reared control rats. However, senescent maternally-deprived rats with impaired spatial learning ability showed increased expression of 5-HT(1A)-receptor mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 (14%) and CA3 (13%) areas but not in the dentate gyrus.
