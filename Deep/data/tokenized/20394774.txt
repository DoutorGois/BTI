We present a modification of the widely used delayed non-match to sample (DNMS) paradigm for assessment of object recognition memory that can be combined with simultaneous in vivo microdialysis. The present study provides evidence that hippocampal ACh release increases from baseline during active exploration of the test environment and an empty test board, but a specific further increase is seen during the recognition memory task performance. This novel experimental model offers a good tool to study the impact of selective lesions or pharmacological manipulation simultaneously on neurotransmitter levels and memory task performance.
