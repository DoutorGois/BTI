Several studies indicate that 17beta-estradiol (E2) protects against amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta)-induced cell death and activates factors associated with learning and memory, a function involving the hippocampal somatostatinergic system. As alterations in somatostatin have been demonstrated in Alzheimer's disease, we examined whether E2 prevents changes in the hippocampal somatostatinergic system induced by Abeta25-35 and cell death, as well as the possible involvement of leptin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I signaling. We also measured the levels of Abeta proteases neprilysin and insulin-degrading-enzyme. Co-administration of E2 with Abeta25-35 reduced both its levels and cell death, in addition to preventing the Abeta-induced depletion of some somatostatinergic parameters. Activation of leptin and IGF-I pathways increased after E2 co-administration, and this correlated with changes in the somatostatinergic system. Changes in some components of this system were inversely related with Abeta levels and cell death. Moreover, neprilysin levels were increased only in Abeta plus E2-treated rats and E2 prevented the Abeta-induced insulin-degrading-enzyme reduction. Our results suggest that the E2-induced reduction in cell death is related to lower Abeta levels, probably because of IGF-I and somatostatin modulation of Abeta proteases. We asked how 17beta-estradiol (E2) protects against beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced cell death. E2 co-administration prevents Abeta-produced depletion of hippocampal somatostatin (SRIF) by an IGF-I-mediated mechanism, being related this protective effect with an increase in Abeta proteases. Our results suggest that the E2-induced reduction in cell death is related to lower Abeta levels, probably because of SRIF modulation of Abeta proteases.
