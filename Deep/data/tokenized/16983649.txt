There is considerable evidence for lateralization of hippocampal function and hemispheric asymmetry in humans. In the rat, studies have reported asymmetries in the thicknesses of layers, the volumes of hippocampal subfields, and the density of cells at specific points along the septotemporal axis. To determine if there is an asymmetry of neuron numbers and whether prenatal malnutrition affects any asymmetries, 90-day old male Sprague-Dawley rats that were either normally nourished or malnourished prenatally were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and the brains cut into 30-micro m sections. One interrupted series of sections through the entire hippocampus was analyzed stereologically to estimate the total number of neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, the CA3/CA2 stratum pyramidale (SP), the CA1 SP, and the SP of the prosubiculum/subiculum of both hemispheres. Significant asymmetries (P < 0.05) were found in the CA1 and CA3/CA2 subfields, with the right hemisphere containing 21 and 6% fewer neurons, respectively. Malnutrition reduced neuron numbers in the CA1 subfield by 12%, but did not alter the hemispheric asymmetry. Our findings agree with previous reports of left dominant asymmetries in the rat brain and suggest that this may result from differences in total numbers of neurons.
