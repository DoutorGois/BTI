The P300 waveform has been associated with cognitive activity during information processing, and the hippocampus has been discussed as a possible generator of this waveform. This being the case some would argue that it should be possible to record the P300 with a shorter latency and greater amplitude from an electrode placed as near the hippocampus as possible. Under local anaesthesia we inserted a specially constructed needle electrode through the left nostril in the recessus pharyngeus close to the hippocampus. The results did not support the hippocampal hypothesis. Nasopharyngeally recorded P300's were found to have significantly decreased amplitudes and extended latencies when compared to vertex recordings.
