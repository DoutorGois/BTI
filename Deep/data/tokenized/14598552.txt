Extracellular ATP was used to test the involvement of purinergic P2 receptors in the modulation of GAB Aergic giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) in rat neonatal hippocampus. Bath application of ATP reduced the GDP frequency in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of ATP persisted in the presence of adenosine P1 receptor antagonist DPCPX indicating the action of ATP on GDPs. It was suggested that, during development, ATP can modulate network-driven activity in the neonatal hippocampus through the activation of purinergic P2 receptors.
