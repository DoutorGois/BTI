Dendrites and spines undergo dynamic changes in physiological conditions, such as learning and memory, and in pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Long-term dendritic plasticity has also been reported after ischemia/hypoxia, which might be compensatory effects of surviving neurons for the functional recovery after the insults. However, the dendritic changes shortly after ischemia, which might be associated with the pathogenesis of ischemic cell death, remain largely unknown. To reveal the morphological changes of ischemia-vulnerable neurons after ischemia, the present study investigated the alteration of dendritic arborization of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rats after transient cerebral ischemia using intracellular staining technique in vivo. The general appearance of dendritic arborization of CA1 neurons within 48 h after ischemia was similar to that of control neurons. However, a dramatic increase of dendritic disorientation was observed after ischemia with many basal dendrites coursed into the territory of apical dendrites and apical dendrites branched into the region of basal dendrites. In addition, a significant increase of apical dendritic length was found 24 h after ischemia. The increase of dendritic length after ischemia was mainly due to the dendritic sprouting rather than the extension of individual dendrites, which mainly occurred in the middle segment of the apical dendrites. These results reveal a plasticity change in dendritic arborization of CA1 neurons shortly after cerebral ischemia.
