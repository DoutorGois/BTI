It is well described that impairment of energy production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. Although several advances have occurred over the past 20 years concerning the use and administration of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to minimize its side effects, little progress has been made in understanding its mechanism of action. In this work, our aim was to measure the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes II and IV and succinate dehydrogenase from rat brain after acute and chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS). Our results showed that mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes activities were increased after acute ECS in hippocampus, striatum and cortex of rats. Besides, we also demonstrated that complex II activity was increased after chronic ECS in cortex, while hippocampus and striatum were not affected. Succinate dehydrogenase, however, was inhibited after chronic ECS in striatum, activated in cortex and not affected in hippocampus. Finally, complex IV was not affected by chronic ECS in hippocampus, striatum and cortex. Our findings demonstrated that brain metabolism is altered by ECS.
