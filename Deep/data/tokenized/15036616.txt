We previously reported that ammonia induced apoptosis in cultured rat hippocampal neurons with moderate increases in the intracellular calcium concentration and decreases in phospho-BAD levels. Since this suggested the involvement of calcineurin in the apoptosis, the effects of calcineurin inhibitors, 1 microM cyclosporin A and 1 microM FK506, on the ammonia-induced neuronal apoptosis were tested. Both of the inhibitors abolished the neuronal apoptosis assessed by double staining with Hoechst 33258 and anti-neurofilament antibody, and the ammonia-induced decrease in phospho-BAD Ser(155) level. Thus, calcineurin appeared to be involved in the dephosphorylation of BAD at the sites including Ser(155) in ammonia-induced apoptosis.
