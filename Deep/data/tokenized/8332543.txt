Angiotensin II (AII) inhibits the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a frequency-dependent model of learning and memory. These results demonstrate that the dose-dependent inhibition of LTP due to ethanol (EtOH) and diazepam (DZ) involves AII. Inhibition of LTP induction by AII, EtOH, and DZ can be blocked by AII receptor antagonists saralasin and lorsartan (DuP 753). Lorsartan is a competitive antagonist of the AT1 subtype AII receptor. Therefore, the EtOH and DZ inhibition of LTP induction is mediated by AT1 receptors. These results indicate a new role for AII in the brain in the possible mediation of memory deficits associated with alcohol and the benzodiazepines.
