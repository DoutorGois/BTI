The enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, activity of the brain was measured in control and clomipramine-induced behaviorally depressed rats. Compared with control rats, the soluble form of acetylcholinesterase activity of the depressed rats was 31.8% higher in the hippocampus and 26.0% lower in the frontal cortex. However, the activity of soluble form of this enzyme was not significantly different in the hypothalamus, septum, and brainstem. These results suggest for the first time that the altered cholinergic activity in the specific areas of the brain may be involved in the behavioral depression observed in the rat model of human endogenous depression.
