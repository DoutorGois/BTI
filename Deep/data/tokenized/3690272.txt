Prompted by reports of immunohistochemical localization of a prolactin-like immunoreactivity (PLI) within the rat brain, a study was undertaken to define the immunologic and biologic characteristics of this material in extrahypothalamic regions of the rat brain. Ninety-seven percent recovery of rat prolactin standard, added to homogenates of brain parts, insured that neuronal tissue did not interfere with the radioimmunoassay for rat prolactin. PLI was consistently found in the cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem (pons-medulla), hippocampus, cerebral cortex and caudate. Examination of the elution profile of each of the extrahypothalamic brain parts from Sephadex G-75 columns showed that, although a small amount of brain PLI elutes in the vicinity of the anterior pituitary prolactin marker, the bulk of brain-based PLI migrates with the void volume and as late eluting, low molecular weight material. While increasing amounts of brain extracts progressively displaced more 125I-prolactin from antibody binding, the displacement curve was not parallel to that produced by the addition of increasing amounts of anterior pituitary prolactin standards of rat origin. Extracts of various brain parts from hypophysectomized animals, analyzed for biologic activity in the Nb2 lymphoma cell assay, revealed prolactin-like bioactivity, but the bioactivity/immunoreactivity ratio for some of the brain parts was significantly lower than that for pituitary prolactin. Hypophysectomy, which led to the expected fall in serum prolactin to undetectable levels, and restraint stress, which resulted in a statistically significant 4-fold rise in serum prolactin, caused no change in prolactin concentrations in extrahypothalamic brain parts, indicating that brain PLI is regulated independently of pituitary prolactin and of circulating serum prolactin levels.
