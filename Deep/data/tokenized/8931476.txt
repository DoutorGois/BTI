The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that there should be a difference between the effects of an acute and an 8-day (chronic) administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) on the rate of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] synthesis. The 5-HT synthesis rate was measured in discrete regions of the rat brain using the alpha-[14C]methyl-L-tryptophan autoradiographic method. The results show that the acute and chronic fluoxetine treatments influence the 5-HT synthesis rate in different ways. A single dose of fluoxetine induced a significant increase in 5-HT synthesis in the visual, auditory, and parietal cortices, substantia nigra, hypothalamus, ventral thalamus, and dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, after a chronic treatment a decrease was observed in the substantia nigra, caudate, and nucleus accumbens, the auditory, parietal, sensorimotor, and frontal cortices, and ventral tegmental area. A significant decrease in the rate of 5-HT synthesis was observed in the dorsal raphe after both the single and chronic treatments. The results suggest that extracellular 5-HT has a delayed influence on the brain 5-HT synthesis rate in structures with serotonergic terminals. The findings from the acute study could be important for patients who have just started receiving fluoxetine treatment, as an increase in the 5-HT synthesis rate might occur in the acute phase of their treatment. In addition, the findings, from the chronic treatment study might give us a better understanding of how the brain serotonergic system adapts during a prolonged exposure to extracellular 5-HT.
