Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy is a common condition that is frequently drug resistant. Anterior temporal lobectomy has been shown to be effective in controlling seizures but entails resecting anterior and lateral temporal lobe regions that are not necessarily included in the epileptogenic zone.

This article describes the 3 most common surgical approaches for performing selective amygdalohippocampectomy and discusses their relative merits and risks.
