Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy and inflammatory responses contributes to secondary brain injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is considered to involvement of this cascade and plays an important role. The present study was designed to determine the hypothesis that administration of resatorvid (TAK-242), a TLR4 antagonist, might provide a neuroprotective effect by inhibit TLR4-mediated pathway in a TBI rat model. Rat subjected to controlled cortical impact injury were injected with TAK-242 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v. injected) 10 min prior to injury. The results demonstrated that TAK-242 treatment significantly attenuated TBI-induced neurons loss, brain edema, and neurobehavioral impairment in rats. Immunoblotting analysis showed that TAK-242 treatment reduced TBI-induced TLR4, Beclin 1, and LC3-II levels, and maintained p62 levels at 24 h. Double immunolabeling demonstrated that LC3 dots co-localized with the hippocampus pyramidal neurons, and TLR4 was localized with the hippocampus neurons and astrocytes. In addition, the expression of TLR4 downstream signaling molecules, including MyD88, TRIF, NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta, was significantly downregulated in hippocampus tissue by Western blot analysis. In conclusion, our findings indicate that pre-injury treatment with TAK-242 could inhibit neuronal autophagy and neuroinflammation responses in the hippocampus in a rat model of TBI. The neuroprotective effects of TAK-242 may be related to modulation of the TLR4-MyD88/TRIF-NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Furthermore, the study also suggests that TAK-242, an attractive potential drug, may be a promising drug candidate for TBI.
