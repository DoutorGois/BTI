The authors performed hippocampal volumetry and T2 relaxometry in 84 consecutive patients with partial epilepsy from a protocol for antiepileptic drug (AED) withdrawal after at least 2 years of seizure control. Seizure recurrence after AED withdrawal was more frequent among patients with hippocampal atrophy and abnormal hippocampal T2 signal.
