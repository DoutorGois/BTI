Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence supports the role of the hippocampus in the processing of spatial information. In the present study, neuronal activity recorded from chronically implanted hippocampal microelectrodes was correlated with a rat's spatial orientation while traversing a radial maze for food reward. Place units were found in all fields of the dorsal hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Rotation of the maze relative to extramaze cues failed to disrupt the intact animal's spatial task performance of the spatial correlates of the unit activity. Lesions of the fornix or entorhinal cortex disrupted performance of the task. Unit activity correlated to the animal's spatial orientation was also disrupted by either lesion. There was no correlation between the disruption of the unit activity and location of the unit within hippocampal fields. Unit activity from lesioned animals showed correlation to the physical properties of the maze rather than to the orientation of the maze in space. These results further support the role of the hippocampus in the processing of spatial information.
