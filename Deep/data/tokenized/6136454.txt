Centrally active amino acids (GABA, glutamate, aspartate) were assayed enzyme-fluorometrically in five brain regions of the rat after a 16-day administration of methamphetamine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.), or both agents together. Methamphetamine caused no statistically-significant changes in the GABA contents in any brain areas, a significant decrease in the glutamate content of the striatum, hippocampus and midbrain and an increase in the aspartate content of the hypothalamus. Haloperidol treatment resulted in no changes in the GABA content, a significant decrease in the glutamate content of the striatum and a significant increase in the aspartate content in the frontal cortex. The treatment with both agents caused a significant decrease in the GABA content of the hypothalamus. The combined administration normalized a lowering of the glutamate levels in the striatum caused by methamphetamine and haloperidol, respectively, and increased the level of aspartate in the hypothalamus caused by methamphetamine and in the frontal cortex caused by haloperidol.
