Air righting results in an animal turning over when it is dropped from a height in an inverted position. In the rat, air righting is a complex set of movements that depends only on an intact labyrinth and the normal vestibular input. Visual modulation of air righting does not develop until adulthood; and the ability to estimate the time to impact requires bilateral visual cues and indicates that air righting is a complex set of perceptually controlled movements and learning. The general purpose of this study was to determine the role of the NMDA receptor-ion channel on air righting and hippocampal LTP. Specifically: to measure the effects of various doses of CPP, an NMDA receptor antagonist, and MK-801, an ion channel blocker, on (a) air righting and (b) hippocampal LTP induction in medial perforant path-granule cell synapses. The following doses were used: CPP-0, 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg i.p.; MK-801-0. 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mg/kg i.p. Data were analyzed by appropriate ANOVAs and post hoc tests. Results were significant and demonstrate dose-dependent impairment of air righting and inhibition of LTP for both CPP and MK-801, implicating the role of the NMDA receptor and Na(+)/K(+)/Ca(2)+ channel in these effects. Air righting is a complex behavior and appears to be dependent upon NMDA mediated hippocampal LTP.
