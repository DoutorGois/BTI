We assessed the post-seizure effects on the seizure threshold and the seizure duration using low-frequency kindling technique. The number of stimulating pulses required for a triggering of epileptic afterdischarge (pulse-number threshold; PNT) was used for the indicator of seizure threshold. PNT increased significantly at 2 and 4 h inter-stimulation intervals, whereas it decreased significantly with an increase of seizure duration at 16 and 24 h intervals. It appears from these data that a post-seizure excitation occurs after a post-seizure inhibition.
