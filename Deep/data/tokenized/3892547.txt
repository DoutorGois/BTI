Several single unit electrophysiological studies that have investigated central adrenoceptors are reviewed. The techniques and paradigms employed to electrophysiologically assay such adrenoceptors are discussed. Several regions of the brain, e.g., the nucleus locus coeruleus, the dorsal raphe nucleus, the lateral geniculate nucleus, and the cerebellar Purkinje neurons, are examined in detail, with reference to the nature of the adrenoceptor(s) located on these neurons. From the studies reviewed, it can be concluded that single unit electrophysiological recordings provide a valuable and powerful assay for adrenoceptors. Modification of this technique to study adrenoceptors from awake (behaving) or chronically treated animals is likely to result in significant advances in our understanding of mechanisms contributing to neuroreceptor plasticity.
