In this paper, we have investigated the regulation of CCK mRNA expression in the brain after restraint stress with and without long-term treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. Stress alone increases CCK mRNA levels in the hippocampus, whereas no changes were found in the cerebral cortex, amygdaloid complex and thalamus. CCK mRNA expression decreases in the hippocampus, increases in the thalamus and was not modified in the cerebral cortex and amygdaloid complex after sertraline alone. CCK mRNA content was unchanged in all investigated areas after stress plus sertraline compared to control rats.
