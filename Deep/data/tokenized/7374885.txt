The distributions of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), and gamma-aminobutyrate transaminase (GABA-T) have been studied in various brain areas of mice. These neurochemical markers, which are related to inhibitory neurotransmission, were investigated in different inbred strains of mice (C3H/He, C57/BR, and their F1 hybrids). The regional distributions of GABA, GAD activity, and GABA-T activity in adult mice of these three strains were quite similar. No significant differences were found in any brain area for GAD or GABA-T activity. However, significant differences in GABA level were found in several brain areas among these strains of mice, especially in hypothalamus, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and occipital cortex. These results provide further information to the possible influence of the GABAergic system in these brain areas.
