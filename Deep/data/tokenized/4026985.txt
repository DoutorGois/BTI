The anterograde horseradish peroxidase method was used to determine if prenatal exposure to ethanol affected the development of the characteristic afferent lamination pattern of the commissural projection to the dentate gyrus. Mean ethanol consumption for the ethanol-consuming dams was 12.7 g/kg +/- 0.3 g per day. Adult offspring of rats that consumed a liquid diet containing 35% ethanol-derived calories during days 1-21 of gestation, and both pair-fed and normal controls were examined. Brain weights and volumes of the ethanol and pair-fed control rats did not differ significantly from normal controls. However, body weights of ethanol-exposed rats were significantly reduced compared to normal controls. Computer-assisted image analysis of the HRP-labeling revealed that in spite of the heavy ethanol exposure there was no evidence of alterations in the spatial distribution of the commissural terminal field.
