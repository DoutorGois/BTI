The effects of chronic oral administration of nicergoline (5.0 mg/kg; bid) on locomotor activity, eight-arm radial maze performance plus striatal, cortical, and hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) levels were examined in young and aged Wistar rats. Chronic nicergoline administration did not modify either the locomotor activity or radial maze learning in young rats. Young rats learned the radial maze procedure rapidly and improved their performance throughout the successive training sessions. Radial maze performance in young rats was characterised by very few arm reentries. Aged rats were hypoactive and did not explore or enter the radial maze arms, and consequently performed poorly in the radial maze throughout the training sessions. Nicergoline treatment did not significantly modify locomotor activity in aged rats. Aged rats treated with nicergoline also performed poorly initially but improved with repeated training in the radial maze. This improvement was associated with an increasing number of arms being entered and very few arm reentries. Reduced acetylcholine (ACh) levels were also associated with age. Aged rats had significantly reduced levels of ACh in the straitum and cortex, but not the hippocampus as compared to young rats. Nicergoline treatment did not change ACh levels in young rats, but substantially restored the reduced ACh levels in aged rats. These results indicate that nicergoline is an effective cognitive enhancer in a learning model of age-related deficits and that these results may be related to changes in the cholinergic system.
