The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is considered important for cell survival and has been shown to mediate various anti-apoptotic biological effects. This study explored the role of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated PI3K/AKT-glycogen syn-thase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) signaling pathways in lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis in a primary culture of hippocampal neurons. Results demonstrated that the apoptotic ratio of hippocampal neurons stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was significantly higher compared with the control group. Both the expression of P-AKT(Ser473) and P-GSK-3beta(Ser9) in hippocampal neurons stimulated by lipopo-polysaccharide decreased compared with the control, while the level of active Caspase-3 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were significantly increased. The level of active Caspase-3 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 in hippocampal neurons treated with TLR4 antibody or the GSK-3beta inhibitor, LiCl, creased before intervention with lipopolysaccharide, but increased after treatment with the AKT hibitor, LY294002. These findings suggest that the TLR4-PI3K/AKT-GSK3beta signaling pathway may be involved in lipopolysaccharide-induced apoptosis of hippocampal neurons.
