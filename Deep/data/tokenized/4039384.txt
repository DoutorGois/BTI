Met-Enkephalin injected i.c.v. attenuated stress-induced increases in levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate, the major metabolite of brain noradrenaline, in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, midbrain and LC region in rats. The data suggest that Met-enkephalin acts to attenuate stress-induced increases in noradrenaline turnover in these brain regions in rats.
