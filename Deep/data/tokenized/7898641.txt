An in situ hybridization method was used to estimate the proenkephalin (PENK) and prodynorphin (PDYN) mRNA levels in the brain of epileptic 6-month-old WAG/Rij rats in comparison with non-epileptic: 3-month-old WAG/Rij rats, 3-month-old ACI rats and 6-month-old ACI rats. The epileptic rats had a significantly higher level of PENK mRNA in the striatum as compared to non-epileptic controls. The PDYN mRNA level was significantly elevated only in the hippocampus of epileptic rats, whereas age- or strain-related changes in the striatal and cortical PDYN mRNA levels were found in both epileptic and non-epileptic rats. The changes in the biosynthetic activity of endogenous opioid peptide systems may be important for the occurrence of epileptic discharges in these animals.
