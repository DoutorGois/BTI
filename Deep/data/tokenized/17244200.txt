The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the hypothalamus receives inputs from the hippocampus The present study explored the influence of the hippocampus on genes mediating glucocorticoid feedback in the PVN. Accordingly, the expression of mRNAs for corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in the PVN was examined by in situ hybridisation in rats subjected to transection of the fornix. Significant increases in CRH, MR and GR mRNAs were observed in the parvocellular PVN after fornix transection (FT). FT-animals subjected to adrenalectomy also showed an increase in the number of cells positive for CRH and GR mRNAs. CRH, MR and GR mRNA expression was also increased by bilateral adrenalectomy, and GR mRNA expression was further enhanced in the parvocellular PVN of the FT transected animals. However, no such changes were evident in the magnocellular PVN. These results suggest that the input from the hippocampus to the PVN, particularly to its parvocellular region, has distinct and differential inhibitory effects on the expression of MR,GR and CRH mRNAs that may operate independently from the feedback actions of corticosterone.
