OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of gastrodin (GAS) on the induced neurons of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The cellular model of AD was established with primary cultured cerebral cortical and hippocampal cells induced by Abeta325-35. The total saponin ginseng was taken as positive control. The effects of gastrodin on the cellular model of AD were studied by morphological observation and biochemical methods. RESULTS: Compared with the control, the cellular model induced by Abeta25-35 showed remarkable morphological changes, significant increase in LDH release, and significant decrease in cell survival. When different doses of gastrodin, total saponin of ginseng were added beforehand, significant decrease in LDH release and significant increase in cell survival were noted by comparison with the experimental control, which indicated that the two medicines could protect the cells from the damage induced by Abeta25-35 to some extent. CONCLUSION: The results suggested that gastrodin has potential effects on the prevention and therapy of AD.
