The influence of unilateral section of the septo-hippocampal pathway on the electrical activity of the dorsal hippocampus of both hemispheres was studied in conditions of elaborated behaviour. The analysis of EEG data of the fields CA1 and CA3 before the section revealed an interconnection of the theta-rhythm and behaviour. Ablation of the septal input caused in the ipsilateral hippocampus a sharp decrease in the activity amplitude and in the number of theta-waves as well as an increase in beta-frequencies and an impairment of interconnection between the frequency bands of the theta-rhythm and the forms of behavioural act. Meanwhile, in the contralateral hippocampus, despite a certain decrease in the activity amplitude and an increase in the number of rapid oscillations, no sharp decrease in theta-waves was visible and the correlation of the theta-rhythm with the behaviour forms was clearly pronounced.
