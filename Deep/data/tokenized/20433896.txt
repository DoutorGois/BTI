Systemic injection of pilocarpine has been shown to induce recurrent seizures and epileptic discharges demonstrated by EEG monitoring. It also has been reported that antioxidants are able to diminish or prevent the occurrence of epileptic discharges induced by pilocarpine through the inhibition of free radical formation and neurotransmitter metabolic alterations. The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of lipoic acid (LA) on the levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and subsequent metabolites in the hippocampus of rats after seizure induction by pilocarpine. Seizures dramatically decreased the levels of DA, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and NE, whereas significantly increased the levels of neurotransmitter metabolites. The administration of lipoic acid before seizure induction resulted in normalized levels of DA and 5-HA. However, the lipoic acid administration in similar conditions produced a reduction of the metabolites levels when compared with the pilocarpine group. These results suggest that the establishment of acute phase of seizures induced by pilocarpine might be produced by consequent the activation of serotonergic neurons. In addition, the lipoic acid inhibits hyperactivity of this system during the installation of pilocarpine-induced seizures.
