Recent research suggests that mouse Dasm1, a protein likely to function as a neuronal cell-surface receptor, plays an important role in both shaping the dendritic tree and affecting the fraction of electrically active glutamatergic synapses. This Perspective considers the question of whether Dasm1 is indeed a receptor and the in vivo implications of the reported in vitro effects of Dasm1 on dendrite growth, AMPA receptor distribution, and synapse unsilencing.
