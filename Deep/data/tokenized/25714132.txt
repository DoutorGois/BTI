BACKGROUND: Both high and low blood pressure (BP) have been positively as well as negatively associated with brain volumes in a variety of populations. The objective of this study was to investigate whether BP is associated with cortical and subcortical brain volumes in older old persons with mild cognitive deficits. METHODS: Within the Discontinuation of Antihypertensive Treatment in the Elderly trial, the cross-sectional relation of BP parameters with both cortical and subcortical brain volumes was investigated in 220 older old persons with mild cognitive deficits (43% men, mean age = 80.7 (SD = 4.1), median Mini-Mental State Examination score = 26 (interquartile range: 25-27)), using linear regression analysis. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, volume of white matter hyperintensities, and duration of antihypertensive treatment. Brain volumes were determined on 3DT1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. RESULTS: Lower systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were significantly associated with lower volumes of thalamus and putamen (all P </= 0.01). In addition, lower MAP was also associated with reduced hippocampal volume (P = 0.035). There were no associations between any of the BP parameters with cortical gray matter or white matter volume. CONCLUSION: In an older population using antihypertensive medication with mild cognitive deficits, a lower BP, rather than a high BP is associated with reduced volumes of thalamus, putamen, and hippocampus.
