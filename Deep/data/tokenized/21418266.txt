AIMS: The class B scavenger receptor CD36, the receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein, mediates free radical production and brain injury in cerebral ischaemia. Free radical production is known to be involved in the remodelling of the cerebral vasculature of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Accordingly, we examined whether the expression of CD36 is increased in the vasculature with blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment and collagen deposition of SHRSP. METHODS: The gene and protein expression of CD36 was examined in the vessels of the hippocampus of SHRSP with BBB impairment and those of Wistar Kyoto rats without the impairment, by real-time RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemical techniques. RESULTS: The gene and protein expression of CD36 was increased in the hippocampus of SHRSP compared with that of Wistar Kyoto rats. Confocal microscopic examination revealed CD36 immunoreactivity in perivascular microglial cells immunopositive for ED1. Immunoelectron microscopic examination revealed that the immunosignals for CD36 were located mainly in the cytoplasm of perivascular cells in vessels showing increased vascular permeability and a few in the cytoplasmic membranes of endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the expression of CD36 was increased in vessels with BBB impairment in the hippocampus of SHRSP and was mainly seen in the cytoplasm of perivascular microglial cells, suggesting a role of CD36 in cerebrovascular injury.
