Zinc exhibits antidepressant-like activity in preclinical tests/models. Moreover, zinc homeostasis is implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic zinc, citalopram and imipramine intraperitoneal administration on the presynaptic and extracellular zinc concentration in the rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. We used two methods: zinc-selenium histochemistry (which images the pool of presynaptic-vesicle zinc) and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) for zinc determination in microdialysate (which assays the extracellular zinc concentration). We report that chronic (14 x) zinc (hydroaspartate, 10 and 65 mg/kg) and citalopram (20 mg/kg) administration increased the pool of presynaptic zinc (by 34, 50 and 37%, respectively) in the rat prefrontal cortex. The 21% increase induced by imipramine (20 mg/kg) was marginally significant. Likewise, zinc (hydroaspartate, 65 mg/kg), citalopram and imipramine increased the extracellular zinc (although with a different pattern: time point, area under the curve and/or basal level) in this brain region. Furthermore, zinc induced an increase in presynaptic (by 65%) and extracellular zinc (by 90%) in the hippocampus, while both citalopram and imipramine did not. These results indicate that all of the treatments increase presynaptic/extracellular zinc concentrations in the rat prefrontal cortex, which may then contribute to their antidepressant mechanisms. Alterations induced by zinc (but not antidepressants) administration in the hippocampus may be related to specific zinc mechanisms. All the data (previous and present) on the effect of antidepressant treatments on the presynaptic/extracellular zinc concentrations suggest the involvement of this biometal presynaptic/synaptic homeostasis in the antidepressant mechanism(s).
