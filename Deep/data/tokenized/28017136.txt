CREB is an ubiquitous transcription factor regulating diverse cellular responses. Its phosphorylation at S133 is an essential event for its activation in both nervous and visual systems. The activated CREB is implicated in the regulation of development, protection, learning, memory and plasticity in the nerve system. Moreover, sumoylation, an important post-translational modification of protein, plays a key role in sustaining CREB activation in the rat hippocampus in order to enhance the long-term memory and other aspects. In the visual system, although the CREB activation by phosphorylation at S133 is similar to that as observed in the nervous system, the role of CREB sumoylation remains to be explored. This review will discuss the aspects of CREB functions and their regulation by phosphorylation and sumoylation in both systems.
