The synthesis and turnover of alpha-erythroid, beta-erythroid, alpha-nonerythroid and beta-nonerythroid spectrins was investigated in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. [35S]methionine and subunit specific antibodies were used to label and immunoprecipitate newly synthesized spectrins in 12- to 14-day-old cultures. Synthesis experiments, performed under normal resting conditions, showed that the ratio of newly synthesized alpha-erythroid/beta-erythroid and alpha-nonerythroid/beta-nonerythroid spectrins is 1/1 (mol/mol) both in the soluble and insoluble fractions. Soluble and insoluble alpha and beta erythroid spectrin turn over rapidly (half-life=16-24 min). Soluble nonerythroid alpha-spectrin (half-life=80 min) and beta spectrin (half-life=53 min) turn over more slowly than their insoluble counterparts (30-34 min). The nonerythroid alpha spectrin turnover was significantly different (p<0.05) from the other measurements except for nonerythroid beta spectrin, indicating that these subunits are protected from rapid proteolytic degradation until they are assembled in the membrane skeleton.
