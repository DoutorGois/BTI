The data presented deal with the role of four main brain structures in the development of emotional states and the organization of purposeful behavior. According to these data, the frontal neocortex orients behavior towards signals of highly probable events (reinforcement), whereas the hypothalamus is the basis for satisfaction of the dominant need. Unlike the neocortex, the hippocampus react to events of low probability, which is typical of emotionally stressed brain activity. Unlike the hypothalamus, the amygdala creates the balance, the dynamic coexistence, of competing needs (motivations) and emotions generated by such needs, which makes behavior more adequate. Individual characteristics of the interaction among the four brain structures is the basis for the individual types of higher nervous activity.
