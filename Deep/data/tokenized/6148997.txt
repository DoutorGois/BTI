Using an antiserum which reacts with the carboxyl terminus of GRF(1-44)NH2, the distribution of immunoreactive growth hormone releasing factor (GRF) in the rhesus monkey hypothalamus was delineated by peroxidase immunocytochemistry. Immunoreactive material was present in dense terminal fields in the median eminence closely associated with portal capillaries but in a location distinct from that noted for immunoreactive thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) or somatostatin. GRF-immunoreactive cell bodies were identified in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial nucleus. These studies provide evidence for the presence of GRF(1-44)NH2 in the primate brain and demonstrate that in the hypothalamus it is localized exclusively in cells and fibers corresponding to the tuberoinfundibular system.
