In the course of our search for neuroprotective agents, dysideamine (1), a new sesquiterpene aminoquinone, was isolated along with bolinaquinone (2) from Indonesian marine sponge of Dysidea sp. Compounds 1 and 2 showed neuroprotective effect against iodoacetic acid (IAA)-induced cell death at 10 microM concentration in mouse HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells. Dysideamine (1) inhibited production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by IAA treatment, whereas it exhibited no effect on depletion of intracellular ATP of the IAA-treated HT22 cells. Moreover, 1 induced neurite outgrowth against mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells with increase of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which is a marker of neuronal differentiation.
