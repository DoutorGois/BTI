Long-term maintenance of ovariectomized rats (9 weeks) on chow containing high phytoestrogen levels (Purina LabDiet 5001) as compared to chow with minimal phytoestrogens (Harlan 2016 Teklad) was associated with better performance of the spatial memory task, object placement, increased dendritic spine density in CA1 and prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, and higher uterine weights. Object recognition memory, anxiety on an elevated plus maze and body weight were unaffected by phytoestrogen levels in the diet.
