In two experiments with rats, we examined the developmental emergence of conditioned freezing following trace and short-delay conditioning and also included a long-delay comparison group. In the short-delay and trace groups, a 10-sec conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with shock; for the trace rats, a 10-sec trace interval followed CS termination. The long-delay groups received a 20-sec CS paired with shock, to equate for the longer interstimulus interval (ISI) in the trace group. Trace conditioning emerged later in development than did short-delay conditioning (see Moye & Rudy, 1987). Importantly, long-delay conditioning emerged in parallel with trace conditioning, at a similar time, and with similar strength. These findings suggest a role for the longer ISI, as opposed to the unfilled gap per se, in the late emergence of trace conditioning. The role of the hippocampus in trace conditioning and the possibility that young rats encode the temporal relationship between CSs and unconditioned stimuli are also considered.
