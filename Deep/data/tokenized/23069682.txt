The coumarins 5-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxycoumarin 1 5-(3-methyl-2-butenyloxy)-6,7-methylenedioxycoumarin 2 and 5-(2,3-dihydroxy-3-methylbutyloxy)-6,7-methylenedioxycoumarin 3 isolated from Pterocaulon species showed significant cytotoxicity against two glioma cells lines. Compound 1 presented IC(50) values of 34.6 muM and 31.6 muM against human (U138-MG) and rat (C6) glioma cells, respectively, and this compound was at least two times more potent than compounds 2 and 3. This result could be explained by the planar conformation adopted by 1 through a non-classical hydrogen bond between a hydrogen of the methoxy and the oxygen of the methylenedioxy groups. Another important finding was that the cytotoxic effect induced by 1 in glioma cells was not observed in organotypic cultures, indicating a selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells.
