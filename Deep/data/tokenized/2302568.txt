The effect of perfusion with gangliosides (1 x 10(-6) M) on the response evoked in the granule cell layer of dentate gyrus by stimulation of perforant path in hippocampal rat slices was studied. Gangliosides induced both a decrease in the frequency threshold of stimulation necessary to generate long-term potentiation (LTP) and greater potentiation than under control conditions. It is proposed that gangliosides improve the mechanisms responsible for synaptic plasticity which generate LTP.
