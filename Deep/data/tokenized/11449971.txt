Long-term depression (LTD) was studied in hippocampal slices obtained from neonatal rats at the synapses between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal neurons. The induction of the LTD required pairing of Ca2+ influx into the postsynaptic CA1 neuron through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. The expression of this form of LTD is at least partly presynaptic, suggesting the need for a retrograde messenger. We present evidence that arachidonic acid might serve such a function. Thus applications of arachidonic acid simulate LTD whereas blockade of arachiidonic acid release inhibits LTD.
