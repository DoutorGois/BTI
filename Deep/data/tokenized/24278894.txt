Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition which occurs after a person has experienced unusual stress. The neurons in the hippocampus are especially vulnerable to the PTSD. In the present study, the effect of treadmill exercise on spatial learning memory and cell proliferation in the hippocampus of rats with PTSD. Radial 8-arm maze test and immunohistochemistr for 5-bromo-2'-deoxyridine (BrdU) and double-cortin (DCX) were conducted for this experiment. For the inducing PTSD, the rats were exposure to 0.2 mA electric foot shock for 7 consecutive days. Electric foot shock continued 6 seconds, repeated 10 times with a 30 sec interval per one trial, and repeated 3 trials per day. The rats in the exercise groups were forced to run on a motorized treadmill for 30 min once a day for 4 weeks, stating one day after finishing last electric food shock. Presently, the PTSD rats showed longer time of successful performance, higher error number, and lower correct number in the radial-8-arm maze test. Cell proliferation and DCX expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus were suppressed in the PTSD rats. In contrast, treadmill exercise alleviated PTSD-induced impairment of spatial learning memory. The rats performed treadmill exercise showed longer time of successful performance, higher error number, and lower correct number in the radial-8-arm maze test. Treadmill exercise also enhanced cell proliferation and DCX expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of PTSD rats. The present study demonstrated that treadmill exercise ameliorated PTSD-induced memory impairment through enhancing cell proliferation in the hippocampus.
