Activation of complement by beta-amyloid (A beta) contributes to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that C1-Inhibitor (C1-Inh) protects cultured rat hippocampal cells against beta-amyloid induced complement lysis indicating a classical pathway-mediated activation mechanism. We report on screening of compound libraries to identify compounds that inhibit C1q binding to beta-amyloid. Characterization of these compounds revealed that C1q possessed distinct binding sites for beta-amyloid and antibodies. One selected compound protected cultured hippocampal cells against complement-dependent beta-amyloid toxicity. These results provide evidence that complement has the potential to damage hippocampal cells, and C1q is a relevant target to suspend this deleterious mechanism in Alzheimer's disease.
