Slices of rabbit hippocampus or caudate nucleus were incubated with [3H]-5-HT (0.1 microM, 60 min) or with [3H]-DA. In hippocampal tissue, the 5-HT uptake blockers chlorimipramine, fluvoxamine, and 6-nitroquipazine (0.1, 1, 10 microM) reduced the percentage content of [3H]-5-HT in a concentration dependent manner. The degree of inhibition of [3H]-5-HT content produced by the 5-HT uptake inhibitors was not affected by the MAO inhibitors pargyline or amezinium (which by themselves enhanced [3H] loading) or the catecholamine uptake inhibitor nomifensine (which by itself did not affect [3H] loading). In caudate nucleus tissue, however, the [3H]-5-HT accumulation was reduced only at the highest concentration of the 5-HT uptake blockers (10 microM). In the additional presence of the MAO inhibitors or nomifensine (which by themselves increased or diminished, respectively, the [3H] labelling) the 5-HT uptake inhibitors became more potent in reducing the percentage [3H]-5-HT accumulation of caudate nucleus slices. These results indicate (1) that a false labelling of [3H]-5-HT into dopaminergic terminals in the caudate nucleus can be prevented by nomifensine, (2) that the 5-HT uptake blockers seem to accumulate within the dopaminergic terminals, where they may display a MAO inhibitory property. The 5-HT uptake blockers were ineffective on the percentage tritium accumulation of caudate nucleus slices incubated with [3H]-DA, regardless of the presence of pargyline or nomifensine. Tritiated DA and deaminated [3H]-metabolites were separated in the superfusate of [3H]-DA-release experiments in caudate nucleus tissue.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
