We investigated the effect of acute ethanol administration on voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) by measuring [3H]nitrendipine ([3H]NTP) binding to crude synaptosomal membrane preparations from different rat brain areas, i.e. cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Ethanol enhances the number of binding sites shortly after the administration (40 min), then Bmax returns towards control values while the binding affinity increases. Kd decreased peaks 8 h after the oral administration and returns within the range of control values at 36 h. The in vitro addition of ethanol has no effect on [3H]NTP binding at various concentrations up to 600 mM. These results suggest that acute ethanol treatment modifies VSCC supporting the concept that the short-term neurochemical alterations induced by in vivo ethanol administration involve calcium channels.
