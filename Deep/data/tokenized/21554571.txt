Glucocorticoid actions in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and the hypothalamus, are critically involved in the response of the organism to stress. The key molecules in this process are the corticosteroid receptors, which upon activation, migrate and act in the nucleus. We have investigated the effect of stress on the activated form of the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor from the above brain areas, using anion exchange chromatography. Exposure of rats to chronic stress resulted in the disappearance of the chromatographic peak, which corresponds to the activated form (DE II) of the hormone-receptor complex. For this phenomenon to occur, 1) the animal must be exposed to chronic, and not to acute stress, and 2) the adrenals of the animal must be intact. The disappearance of the activated form of the hormone-receptor complex (DE II) following chronic stress is most probably due to proteolysis of the receptor molecule, since it is specifically inhibited by the protease inhibitor leupeptin. This phenomenon may represent an adaptive mechanism which helps the organism cope with a repeated stressor.
