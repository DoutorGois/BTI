The tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals (SC) in rat hippocamp slices after 6 hrs in vitro conditions did not produce long-term potentiation (LTP) of the field response amplitude in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. In contrast, LTP after the late tetanization was well preserved in the slices that were perfused for 20 minutes with 0.5 mkM L-pGlu-D-Ala-NH2 (PGAA) after 4-4.5 hrs in vitro. There were no significant reactivity changes during the perfusion of the slices with this drug concentration. Two other drugs with nootropic activity, piracetam (100 mkM) and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (100 mkM, Na-salt) did not prevent the disappearance of LTP in the late period in vitro, while enhanced the reactivity during perfusion period. The maintenance of the plastic properties of the SC-CA1 synaptic transmission under the influence of PGAA is thought to be the result of some specific interaction of the drug with LTP induction mechanisms. LTP damaged in the late period in vitro might be a new model of memory disturbances and this model can turn out to be useful for the comparative estimation of the effectiveness of the drugs with proposed nootropic activity and for the analysis of the possible mechanisms of their action.
