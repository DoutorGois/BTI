This study was designed to investigate the potential beneficial effects of bone marrow stromal cell (MSC) treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. Twelve female C57BL/6J mice (weight, 21-26 g) were injured with controlled cortical impact and divided into 2 groups (n=6 each). The experimental group was injected with MSCs (0.3x10(6)) intravenously one day after TBI, whereas the control group was injected with saline. MSCs were harvested from male mice, and male to female transplantation was performed to identify male donor cells within female recipient animals. This was achieved by localizing Y chromosomes within the female mice. Neurological function was assessed using the Morris water maze and foot fault tests. All mice were sacrificed 35 days after TBI. Brain sections were stained using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to identify MSCs as well as to analyze vascular density following MSC treatment. Both modalities of testing demonstrated significant improvement in neurological function in the MSC-treated group compared to the saline-treated control group (p<0.05). Histologically, Y chromosome labeled MSCs were easily identified in the injured brain, localized primarily around the lesion boundary zone. There was also a significant increase in vascular density in the lesion boundary zone and hippocampus of MSC-treated mice compared to control mice. This is the first study to show beneficial effects of MSC treatment after TBI in mice.
