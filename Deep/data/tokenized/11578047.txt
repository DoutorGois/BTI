The human channel capacity for identifying sensory stimuli is compared with channel capacities based on neurophysiological findings. Studies have shown that cells in the postsubiculum (PoS) and the anterior dorsal thalamus (ADN) of the rat discharge as a function of the animal's head direction in the horizontal plane. We compute the statistical properties of the firing rates of head direction (HD) cells and the potential amount of information transmitted by these cells according to two theoretical models. The ceU response model for single cells indicates that information transmitted is much less than 0.5 bits. The population response model developed for cell ensembles generates values in the range of 1-3.2 bits, suggesting that a cell population can distinguish between two and nine head directions, depending on the value used for the standard deviation of directions over which a cell fires. These values are similar to those found in human psychophysical studies of the channel capacity for unidimensional sensory attributes.
