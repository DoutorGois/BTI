Stress is known to inhibit granule cell proliferation in the hippocampus. However, recent studies suggest that the commonly used dose of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is insufficient to label all fractions of granule cells. Furthermore, stress-induced changes in BrdU availability may influence the labeling of newly born cells. To investigate whether changes in BrdU availability affect measurements of stress-induced granule cell proliferation, granule cell proliferation was assessed using injection of high doses of BrdU before and after restraint stress lasting 1 h. In addition, to determine whether stress-induced changes in plasma corticosterone levels were influenced by the BrdU, time-dependent changes in plasma corticosterone levels over 2 h after BrdU injection were compared with total accumulated plasma corticosterone levels [as determined by areas under the curve (AUC)]. Restraint stress significantly reduced the numbers of BrdU-labeled cells and clusters in the granule cell layer (GCL) of rats that received BrdU after stress, and decreases of similar magnitude were observed when the rats were given BrdU before stress. BrdU injection enhanced the stress-induced plasma corticosterone response, but there was no difference between the mean AUCs of plasma corticosterone levels of animals injected with BrdU before or after stress. These observations suggest that restraint stress decreases granule cell proliferation, and that this may be influenced by the extent and duration of plasma corticosterone increases rather than by changes in the availability of BrdU.
