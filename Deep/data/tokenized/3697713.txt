Cholinergic fibers spared by partial lesions of the fimbrial bundle contribute to the recovery of enzyme markers for hippocampal cholinergic terminals. This recovery, most likely representing structural restoration of cholinergic terminals lost to lesion-induced degeneration, is amplified by a 'conditioning' lesion. This model of functionally relevant postlesion reconstruction, by and of structures within the CNS, is suitable to search for means to enhance homotypic collateral sprouting.
