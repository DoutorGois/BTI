The effect of the 10-day dexamethasone administration on serotonin-2 (5-HT2) and beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was evaluated in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. The dexamethasone treatment (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) significantly increased the density of the 5-HT2 receptor binding sites in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a decreased density of beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites was observed in rat cortex. In contrast, there were no significant differences in the densities of the 5-HT2 or beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites in rat hippocampus using dexamethasone. The results suggest that dexamethasone differentially modulates the 5-HT2 and beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites in rat brain.
