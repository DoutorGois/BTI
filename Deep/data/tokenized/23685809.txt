Previous work has shown that damage to the dorsal hippocampus (DH) occurring at recent, but not remote, timepoints following acquisition produces a deficit in trace conditioned fear memory expression. The opposite pattern has been observed with lesions to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The present studies address: (1) whether these lesion effects are observable within 30 d of training; (2) whether lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) produce temporally graded retrograde amnesia similar to DH lesions; and (3) whether the lesion-to-test interval critically contributes to these lesion deficits. In Experiment 1, excitotoxic lesions of the DH, VH, or mPFC were made at 1 or 30 d following trace fear conditioning. DH and VH lesioned animals showed a deficit in freezing to the tone at the recent, but not remote, timepoint. Medial PFC lesioned animals showed the opposite pattern. In Experiment 2, lesions to DH, VH, or mPFC were made 1 d following training, while testing occurred 30 d later. There were no deficits in freezing to the tone in any lesion condition compared to controls. These results suggest that systems consolidation of trace fear memory occurs within 30 d of acquisition, but does not depend on hippocampus-mPFC interactions during this period.
