BACKGROUND: Decline of hippocampal volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered as a surrogate biomarker of accumulating Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. Previously, we showed in the prospective population-based Rotterdam Scan Study that a higher rate of decline of hippocampal volume on MRI precedes clinical AD or memory decline. We studied potential risk factors for decline of hippocampal volume. METHODS: At baseline (1995-1996), 518 nondemented elderly subjects were included, and the cohort was re-examined in 1999 and in 2006. At each examination, hippocampal volume was determined using an automated segmentation procedure. In all, 301 persons had at least two three-dimensional MRI scans to assess decline in hippocampal volume. RESULTS: Persons carrying the apolipoprotein E (APOE) varepsilon4 allele had lower hippocampal volumes than persons with the varepsilon3/varepsilon3 genotype, but the rate of decline was not influenced by APOE genotype. In persons who did not use antihypertensive treatment, both a high (>90 mm Hg) and a low (<70 mm Hg) diastolic blood pressure were associated with a faster decline in hippocampal volume. Also, white matter lesions on baseline MRI were associated with a higher rate of decline in hippocampal volume. CONCLUSIONS: In a nondemented elderly population, persons with the APOE varepsilon4 allele have a smaller hippocampal volume but not a higher rate of decline. Rate of decline of hippocampal volume was influenced by white matter lesions and diastolic blood pressure, supporting their hypothesized role in the pathogenesis of AD.
