We have isolated a human hippocampus cDNA that encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, termed HIR (hippocampal inward rectifier), with strong rectification characteristics. Single-channel recordings indicate that the HIR channel has an unusually small conductance (13 pS), distinguishing HIR from other cloned inward rectifiers. RNA blot analyses show that HIR transcripts are present in heart, skeletal muscle, and several different brain regions, including the hippocampus.
