The aim of this study was to retrospectively determine if patients with medically refractory epilepsy, due to hippocampal sclerosis, who underwent selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) with a transcortical approach experienced improved seizure outcome. Thirty-nine patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis were included in the study. The mean follow-up was 25.88 +/- 17.69 months. Antiepileptic medication use and seizure frequency were significantly reduced after SAH. After surgery, 32 patients (82.05%) were completely seizure free (Engel class IA), and 2 patients experienced transient memory difficulty. In conclusion, SAH with a transcortical approach can lead to favorable seizure control with a low irreversible complication risk.
