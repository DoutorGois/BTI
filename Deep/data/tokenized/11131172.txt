1. Different animal tests model different anxiety disorders. Thus, the social interaction test is a model of generalised anxiety disorder, plus-maze Trial 1 models elements of panic disorder and Trial 2 in the elevated plus-maze is a model of specific phobia. 2. Studies of the neuroanatomical and neurochemical pathways controlling behaviour in these different tests provides information on the neurobiological mechanisms modulating anxiety disorders. 3. In the social interaction test, nicotine and 8-OH-DPAT had anxiogenic effects when injected into the dorsal hippocampus or the lateral septum. 4. These ligands were without effect on Trial 1 in the plus-maze when injected into the dorsal hippocampus, but had anxiogenic effects when injected into the lateral septum. 5. On Trial 2 in the elevated plus-maze, nicotine had an anxiolytic effect, but 8-OH-DPAT had an anixiogenic effect when injected into the dorsal hippocampus.
