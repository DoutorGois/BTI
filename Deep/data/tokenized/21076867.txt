Abnormal excess of glucocorticoid is one of feature characteristics in type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the effect of treadmill exercise at chronic diabetic stages on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 region and dentate gyrus, which are very vulnerable to diabetes. For this study, we used Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and Zucker lean control (ZLC) rats. Twenty-three-week-old ZLC and ZDF rats were put on the treadmill with or without running for 7 weeks and sacrificed at 30 weeks of age. Treadmill exercise significantly decreased diabetes-induced blood glucose and serum corticosteroid levels although they did not drop to control levels. In sedentary ZLC rats, GR immunoreactivity was detected in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region as well as in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In the sedentary ZDF rats, GR immunoreactivity was significantly increased in these regions. However, treadmill exercise significantly decreased GR immunoreactivity in these regions. These results indicate that treadmill exercise in chronic diabetic rats significantly decreased GR immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 region and dentate gyrus, although blood glucose and serum corticosteroid levels did not fully recover to normal state.
