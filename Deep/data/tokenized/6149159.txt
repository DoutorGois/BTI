In rats, daily electrical stimulation via corneal electrodes by the end of the 3rd week induced an epileptofirm syndrome similar to amygdaloid kindling. 30 days of the stimulation led to a decrease of dopamine, norepinephrine, taurine and glutamine in hippocampus; fall of the level of gomovanillic acid, norepinephrine, as well as increase of glutamic acid, glutamine, GABA and taurine in striatum; decrease of glutamine and increase of GABA and glycine in cerebellum. The decrease of the NA and DA concentrations in hippocampus and of NA in striatum is associated with exhaustion of respective transmitter systems in these brain structures due to enhancement of neuronal activity during electrical stimulation in the kindling regimen. The rise of glutamic acid, glutamine, GABA and taurine in striatum occurred as the result of increased activity of these systems. The fall of the gomovanillic acid in striatum (with normal level of DA) is due to the rise of inhibitory influence of the GABA-ergic system upon DA-ergic neurons. The increase of GABA concentration in cerebellum is the result of compensatory activity of GABA-ergic system.
