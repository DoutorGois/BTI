Administration of hydrocortisone to rats during the first five postnatal days leads to the blockade of the hypophyseoadrenal system and results in a decrease in the number of corticosterone receptors in the hypophysis, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Such a decrease in the receptor binding of corticosterone in the brain structures involved in the regulation of the hypophyseoadrenal system by a feedback mechanism is due to a change in the number of true glucocorticoid receptors.
