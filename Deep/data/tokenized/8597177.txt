Exposure to high levels of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in humans has been associated with a number of respiratory and neurological symptoms. Acute toxicity following exposure to high concentrations is well-documented, however, there is little scientific information concerning the effects of exposure to low concentrations. The effects of low levels of H2S on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the hippocampus and neocortex were investigated on the freely moving rat (Sprague-Dawley). Hippocampal electrodes were implanted in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 region. Activity was recorded for 10 min just prior to H2S exposure in the presence of air (pre-exposure). Rats were exposed to H2S (25, 50, 75, or 100 ppm) for 3 h/day; data was collected during the final 10 min of each exposure. The total power of hippocampal theta activity increased in a concentration-dependent manner in both DG and CA1; repeated exposures for 5 consecutive days resulted in a cumulative effect that required 2 weeks for complete recovery. The effects were found to be highly significant at all concentrations within subjects. Neocortical EEG and LIA (Large Amplitude Irregular Activity) were unaffected. The results demonstrate that repeated exposure to low levels of H2S can produce cumulative changes in hippocampal function and suggest selectivity of action of this toxicant.
