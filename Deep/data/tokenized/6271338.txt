The role of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is rich in dopamine-containing cell bodies, on nucleus accumbens (Acc) neurons was examined. In Acc neurons receiving input from parafascicular nucleus (Pf) of thalamus, VTA conditioning stimulation produced an inhibition of spike generation with Pf stimulation. In contrast, VTA conditioning stimulation did not affect Acc neurons receiving input from limbic structures such as the amygdala nucleus and hippocampus.
