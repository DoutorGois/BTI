AIMS: Active amyloid-beta (Abeta) immunotherapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) induces removal of Abeta and phosphorylated tau (ptau). Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta is a kinase, responsible for phosphorylation of tau, activation of which can be induced by phosphorylated double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (pPKR). Using a post-mortem cohort of immunized AD cases, we investigated the effect of Abeta immunization on GSK-3beta expression and pPKR. METHODS: We immunostained 11 immunized AD cases and 28 unimmunized AD cases for active, inactive and total GSK-3beta, and for pPKR. Quantification of protein load was performed in the hippocampal region including CA1, subiculum and entorhinal cortex. RESULTS: All three areas showed a significant decrease in the three forms of GSK-3beta (P < 0.05) and a nonsignificant trend towards lower pPKR load in the immunized AD cases compared with the unimmunized AD cases. CONCLUSION: The lower GSK-3beta expression generated by Abeta immunotherapy shows evidence of a modification of the signalling pathway induced by GSK-3beta leading to the overall reduction of tau, supporting the contention that in humans, GSK-3beta unifies Abeta and tau-related neuropathology.
