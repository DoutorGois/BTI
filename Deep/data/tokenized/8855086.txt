Organotypic cultures of hippocampus and cerebellum, established from brains of 1-3 days old rats, were exposed at different stages of development (3, 14 and 21 DIV) to 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cladribine, 2-CdA) and 2-bromo-2'-deoxyadenosine (2-BdA) at concentrations up to 10 microM, for up to 10 days. Normal pattern and dynamics of differentiation and maturation of both neurons and glial cells was found with the use of light and electron microscopy. No ultrastructural abnormalities were induced by the substances tested. We conclude that 2-CdA and its sister compound 2-BdA do not exert cytotoxic effects toward normal rat central nervous system tissues in organotypic culture.
