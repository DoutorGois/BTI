The anticonvulsive efficacy of flumazenil, a specific antagonist of the ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor, was studied in the experimental seizures induced by electrical stimulation of corpus Amygdaloideum and Cornu Ammonis dorsale of the hippocampus in rabbits. In the amygdaloid seizure model flumazenil raised the threshold and/or reduced the afterdischarge duration. Results observed in the seizures induced by stimulation of hippocampus were less consistent. Possible explanations are discussed.
