Chemical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus by serotonin and GABA decreases anxiety in a test of avoidance of precarious situation but not of illuminated platform. Intrahippocampal injection of chlordiazepoxide induced similar effect. Microinjection of glutamic acid into the hippocampus increases and that of dopamine decreases anxiety in the test of avoidance of illuminated platform but not of precarious situation. Ipsapiron locally injected unto the dorsal hippocampus induces antiaversive effect counteracting anxiety states in both behavioural models. A conclusion is drown that hippocampal monoanin- and acidergic mechanisms are functionally different in anxiety of different modes of aversive origin. Differences in spectra of anxiolytic action of chlordiazepoxide and ipsapiron may be underlied by nonsimilar degree of involvement of these transmitter mechanisms in anxiety states being formed by aversive influences of different biological significance.
