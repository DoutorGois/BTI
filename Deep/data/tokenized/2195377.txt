We have examined the distribution of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG)-like immunoreactive cell bodies in the medial septal nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca of the rat and assessed the involvement of these cells in the septo-hippocampal pathway. A series of experiments was carried out using immunohistochemistry alone or combined with the retrograde transport of a protein-gold complex injected into the dorsal hippocampal formation. A large number of NAAG-positive cells was observed in the medial septum and the diagonal band. Quantitative analysis revealed that 26% of the NAAG-like immunoreactive cells in the medial septum project to the dorsal hippocampal formation. These results demonstrate that the dipeptide NAAG is a major component of the rat septo-hippocampal pathway.
