It is shown that D-cycloserine has cognition-enhancing properties in quinolinic acid hippocampal-lesioned rats. Lesioned rats had a severe impairment of working memory in an allocentric spatial reversal paradigm in the 8-arm maze, and performance could be restored with 12 mg/kg i.p. D-cycloserine, given 30 min before testing. The present findings favour the testing of D-cycloserine for clinical efficacy in patients with Alzheimer's disease with loss of pyramidal neurons and disconnected glycine-NMDA receptor activation.
