Diverse molecular mechanisms regulate synaptic composition and function in the mammalian nervous system. The multifunctional protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) possesses both methyltransferase and phospholipase activities. Here we examine the role of this neuron-specific protein in hippocampal plasticity and cognitive function. PRMT8 protein localizes to synaptic sites, and conditional whole-brain Prmt8 deletion results in altered levels of multiple synaptic proteins in the hippocampus, using both male and female mice. Interestingly, these altered protein levels are due to post-transcriptional mechanisms as the corresponding mRNA levels are unaffected. Strikingly, electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices of mice lacking PRMT8 reveal multiple defects in excitatory synaptic function and plasticity. Furthermore, behavioral analyses show that PRMT8 conditional knock-out mice exhibit impaired hippocampal-dependent fear learning. Together, these findings establish PRMT8 as an important component of the molecular machinery required for hippocampal neuronal function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Numerous molecular processes are critically required for normal brain function. Here we use mice lacking protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) in the brain to examine how loss of this protein affects the structure and function of neurons in the hippocampus. We find that PRMT8 localizes to the sites of communication between neurons. Hippocampal neurons from mice lacking PRMT8 have no detectable structural differences compared with controls; however, multiple aspects of their function are altered. Consistently, we find that mice lacking PRMT8 also exhibit reduced hippocampus-dependent memory. Together, our findings establish important roles for PRMT8 in regulating neuron function and cognition in the mammalian brain.
