Oxidative damage due to ischemia/reperfusion has been implicated as one of the leading causes for delayed neuronal cell death in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether oral administration of a fermented grain food mixture (AOB(R)) might offer protective effects against ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal damage in Mongolian gerbils, a model known for delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region. Histological analysis revealed that AOB administration ad libitum for 3 weeks (preoperative administration) and 1 week (postoperative administration) dose-dependently suppressed the induction of transient ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal cell death. TUNEL assay also revealed that AOB suppressed it by inhibiting the induction of apoptosis. A significant increase of superoxide dismutase-like (SOD-like) activity was observed in the hippocampal CA1 region of the AOB-treated gerbil. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis showed that AOB administration down-regulated the expression of heat shock proteins HSP27 and HSP70 in the same region. These results indicated that oral administration of AOB protected against ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury by minimizing oxidative damage via its SOD-like activity and inhibiting apoptosis.
