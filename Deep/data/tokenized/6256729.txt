In experiments on mature female rats it was shown that L-DOPA administration restores normal ovulation in rats after the dorsal hippocampus destruction and related partial ovulation blockade. Pharmacological analysis after microinjections of alpha- and beta-adrenoblockers into the dorsal hippocampus region has shown that alpha- and beta-adrenoreception of the dorsal hippocampus plays a definite role in the regulation of gonadotropin secretion. However, the effect of phentolamine injection on the rat ovulatory reaction was less pronounced than under conditions of this hippocampus region destruction. The beta-adrenoblocker propranolol injected into the dorsal hippocampus inhibited compensatory hypertrophy of the ovaries in hemicastrated rats, decreased the hypophyseal FSH content and did not influence ovulation.
