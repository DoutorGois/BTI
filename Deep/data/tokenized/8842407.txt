Neuronal cell populations giving origin to bifurcating projections to the septum and the entorhinal cortex were studied in the rat by means of double retrograde labeling using the fluorescent tracers Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow. Double labeled pyramidal neurons were consistently detected in the temporal level of the CA1 area and subiculum of the hippocampal formation, where they represented at least 50% of the cells retrogradely labeled from the entorhinal injections. Double labeled neurons were also detected in the amygdala, where they prevailed in the basal complex. Scattered double labeled neurons were observed in a number of hypothalamic nuclei, with a slight predominance in the preoptic region. Finally, a few double labeled cells were detected in the midline thalamus, and especially in the thalamic paraventricular nucleus. In all these structures, double labeled neurons were located ispilaterally to the injection sites. The present data indicate that the septum and entorhinal cortex are tightly interconnected by axonal bifurcations deriving from a variety of telencephalic and diencephalic sources.
