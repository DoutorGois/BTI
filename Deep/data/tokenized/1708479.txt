We have measured the binding of [3H]-MK-801 to cortical and hippocampal membrane preparations from the vitamin B-6 restricted neonatal rat. The results indicate a reduced potency and efficacy of glutamate and glycine in enhancing [3H]-MK-801 binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ion channel. Scatchard analysis of [3H]-MK-801 binding isotherms showed a significantly lower number of [3H]-MK-801 binding sites in the cortex and hippocampus of vitamin B-6 restricted rats. These results indicate a reduced function of the NMDA receptor-ion channel in the brain of these animals.
