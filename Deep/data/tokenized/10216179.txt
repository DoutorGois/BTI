Arginine8-vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to improve memory consolidation in various mnemonic tasks. Our previous studies have pointed out the involvement of the hippocampus in memory consolidation and retrieval processes during discriminative learning by mice. The present study attempts to determine what other brain areas besides the hippocampus might be involved in the enhancing effect of intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) injected AVP on memory consolidation in a visual discrimination task using a polyclonal antibody that acts against Fos and Fos-like proteins. For behavioral testing, AVP was i.c.v. injected at the behaviorally active dose of 2 ng after the last learning session and improvement in consolidation processes was assessed in a retention session. Changes in Fos and Fos-like protein expression were determined in non-conditioned and conditioned mice. In non-conditioned mice, AVP i. c.v. injected at a dose of 2 ng evoked a time-dependent increase in Fos and Fos-like protein expression in the dentate gyrus (DG), CA1 and CA3 hippocampal fields, lateral septum (LS), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and basolateral and central amygdaloid nuclei, with a peak 120 min after the injection in most of the these brain areas. In contrast, in conditioned mice, an increase in the level of Fos expression, assessed 120 min after the end of learning and the injection of AVP, was detected only in the DG, ventral CA3 hippocampal field, and LS. Thus, the pattern observed after post-training injection of AVP was not the same as that evoked by AVP alone, since among the limbic structures activated following AVP alone, only the DG, the CA3 hippocampal field, and the LS seem to be involved in the enhancing effect of AVP on memory consolidation in discriminative learning.
