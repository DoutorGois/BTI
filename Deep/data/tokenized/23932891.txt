Seizure susceptibility appears to be greater in males than females during the early developmental stages of the brain when the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting through its GABA-A receptor, predominantly produces neuronal depolarization. GABA-mediated excitation has been observed when the NKCC1 (chloride importer) expression level is higher than KCC2 (chloride exporter). In this study, the relative protein expression of NKCC1 and KCC2 over beta-actin was evaluated in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of male and female rats during postnatal days (PND) 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 using Western blotting assays. For both cerebral regions in the females, the NKCC1/beta-actin expression ratio was constant during all evaluated ages, whereas the KCC2/beta-actin expression ratio increased gradually until reaching a maximal level at PND9 that was nearly three- and ten-fold higher in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, respectively, compared with the initial level. In males, the NKCC1/beta-actin expression ratio was constant during the first week, peaking almost three-fold higher than the initial level at PND9 in the hippocampus and at PND11 in the entorhinal cortex and then returning to the initial values at PND13, whereas the KCC2/beta-actin expression ratio increased gradually to reach a maximal and steady level at PND5, which were nearly two- and four-fold higher in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, respectively, compared with the intial level. In conclusion, the NKCC1/beta-actin and KCC2/beta-actin expression ratios displayed a specific expression profile for each gender and cerebral region, which could be related with the differences in seizure susceptibility observed between genders.
