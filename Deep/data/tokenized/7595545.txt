Autoradiographic studies have shown that sigma receptors are enriched in the locus coeruleus, the origin of noradrenergic projections to the cerebellum, as well as in the Purkinje, molecular, and granular layers and the interpositus cerebellar nucleus of the cerebellum itself. In contrast, the cerebellum is relatively poor in phencyclidine (PCP) binding sites, which have been historically confused with sigma sites. The high ratio of sigma to PCP receptors in cerebellum is advantageous for discriminating sigma-mediated physiological effects. sigma agonists and antagonists have been shown to regulate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-stimulated norepinephrine release in hippocampus, which is innervated by locus coeruleus projections. We now report that sigma drugs also regulate norepinephrine release from cerebellum. In contrast to findings in the hippocampus, where regulation is via sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors, sigma-mediated regulation in cerebellum seems to be primarily via sigma 1 receptors. In radioligand binding studies, we find that sigma receptors primarily of the sigma 1 type are present in the cerebellum. We further report that binding to sigma receptors in cerebellum is not affected by the addition of NMDA or glycine or by the presence of NMDA antagonists, suggesting that sigma receptors are not located within the NMDA-operated cation channel in this brain region.
