OBJECTIVE: To study the effect and mechanism of Congsheng Capsule (CSC) on brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosinkinase (trkB) mRNA in forebrain of rats after cortical devascularization. METHODS: The rat devascularization model was established, and expression of BDNF mRNA and trkB mRNA were determined by hybridization in situ method. RESULTS: Expression of BDNF mRNA and trkB mRNA reduced obviously in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of devascularization model, especially in hippocampal CA1 subregion. There was trkB mRNA but no BDNF mRNA expression in the macrocyte basal nuclei (MBN). CSC significantly increased the decreased BDNF and trkB mRNA in cortex, hippocampus and MBN compared with placebo group. CONCLUSION: CSC could salvage the degenerating neurons and maintain their survival after cortical devascularization by increasing the expression of BDNF and trkB mRNA and improving the synthesis of BDNF mRNA and trkB protein.
