The capacity of thienylcyclohexylpiperidine (TCP), a non-competitive blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, to counteract the convulsant, lethal, and neuropathological effects of 2 x LD50 of soman (an irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterase) was investigated in guinea-pigs treated by pyridostigmine and atropine sulphate. The effects of a weak dose of TCP (1 mg/kg) used in the present study globally reproduced those previously obtained with a higher dose (2.5 mg/kg; [Neurotoxicology 15 (1994) 837]): TCP was again most protective when given curatively within the first hour of soman-induced seizures. In this condition, (a) paroxysmal activity ceased in 10-20 min, (b) all the animals survived, (c) the majority of them recovered remarkably well and did not show any brain damage 24 h after the intoxication, and (d) the minimal duration of seizure activity normally required for producing soman-induced brain damage in other pharmacological environments was increased from 10 to 40 min to 80 min. Strikingly, when TCP was given 120 min after seizure onset, it failed to show any anticonvulsant activity but still provided neuroprotection in the hippocampus. The present study also gives additional evidence (see [Neurotoxicology 21 (4) (2000) 521]) that in soman poisoning, (a) the development of brain damage depends on the occurrence of ECoG seizures, (b) the topographical distribution of lesions depends on seizure duration, and (c) an increase of the relative power in the lowest (delta) frequency band might be a reliable marker of neuronal degradation. All these findings confirm that (a) glutamatergic NMDA receptors are involved in the mechanisms of soman-induced seizures and brain damage, (b) non-competitive antagonists of NMDA receptors might be promising candidates for post-treatment of soman poisoning, and (c) ECoG parameters from ECoG tracings and power spectrum might serve as useful external predictors for soman-induced neuropathological changes.
