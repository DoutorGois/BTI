The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of different concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of mice. C57BL/6J mice (30 days old) were randomly divided into control group, three CGRP groups, and CGRP + CGRP8-37 group (10 mice for each group). Different concentrations of CGRP (50, 100 and 200 nmol/L) were given to the hippocampal slices of mice. The presynaptic release of neurotransmitters and the induction of LTP were measured by extracellular field recording techniques. The result showed that different concentrations of CGRP did not affect the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters, but 100 and 200 nmol/L CGRP increased the amplitude of LTP induced in the hippocampus of mice. This facilitation effect of CGRP was blocked by its specific antagonist CGRP8-37. These results suggest that CGRP dose-dependently facilitates the induction of LTP in the hippocampus of mice through its specific receptor.
