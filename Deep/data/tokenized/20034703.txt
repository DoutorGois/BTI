Although controversial, estrogen replacement therapy has been implicated as a possible therapeutic agent for ameliorating age-related cognitive decline in postmenopausal women. We have shown previously that different types of estrogen promote hippocampal neurogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in young adult female rats. However, previous studies have not found a beneficial effect of 17beta-estradiol in middle-aged female rats. The aim of the present study was to determine the acute effects of 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-estradiol, and estrone on hippocampal cell proliferation in middle-aged ovariectomized female rats and to determine whether effects are dependent on previous reproductive experience. Middle-aged multiparous female rats or age-matched virgin female rats were injected subcutaneously with vehicle or 10 mug dose of 17beta-estradiol, 17alpha-estradiol, or estrone, and then given BrdU 30 min later and perfused 24h later to assess cell proliferation. All estrogens significantly upregulated cell proliferation in the hippocampus in middle-aged multiparous females but none of the estrogens upregulated cell proliferation in the middle-aged virgins. Therefore, previous reproductive experience may make the older brain more responsive to estrogens later in life. We also found that 17alpha-estradiol upregulated cell proliferation to a greater degree than the other estrogens in the multiparous females. Together these findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic advances in the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause in women.
