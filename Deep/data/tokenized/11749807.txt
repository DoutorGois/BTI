AIM: To investigate the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on synaptic transmission in anesthetized rats and the effect of NOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), on long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by Rg1. METHODS: Extracellular recording technique was used to record the population spike (PS) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of anesthetized rats. Drug or vehicle injections were delivered via a cannula in the lateral cerebral ventricle. RESULTS: Rg1 (10 and 100 nmol/L) enhanced the basic synaptic transmission and the magnitude of LTP induced by high frequency stimulation (HFS). Selective nNOS inhibitor 7-NI (5 nmol) icv could inhibit the induction of perforant path-dentate gyrus LTP elicited by Rg1 (P<0.05), and L-arginine 250 g/L ip prevented the action of 7-nitroindazole (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Rg1-accelerated synaptic transmission and nitric oxide produced by nNOS played a role in the induction of PP-DG LTP in anesthetized rats.
