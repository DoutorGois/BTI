We investigated several aspects of the dopaminergic and serotonergic functions throughout brain development in rats prenatally exposed to MDMA ("ecstasy"). Pregnant rats were treated with MDMA (10 mg/kg s.c.) or saline from the 13th to the 20th day of gestation and studies were conducted on the progeny from both groups: (i) quantification of whole brain contents of DA, 5-HT and metabolites from the 14th day of embryonic life (E14) to weaning (21st day of postnatal life, P21); (ii) quantification of DA and 5-HT membrane transporters by autoradiography from E18 to adult age (P70); (iii) measurement of pharmacologically induced release of DA and 5-HT using microdialysis on adult (P70) freely moving rats; (iv) measurement of sucrose preference in adults (P70). Prenatally MDMA-exposed rats showed (i) a two-fold decrease of whole brain levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA at P0; (ii) no effect on the DAT and SERT density; (iii) a strongly reduced pharmacologically induced release of DA and 5-HT at P70 in the striatum and hippocampus; and (iv) a significant 20% decrease in sucrose preference at P70. This study suggests that a prenatal exposure to MDMA induces transient and long-term neurochemical and behavioural modifications in dopaminergic and serotonergic functions.
