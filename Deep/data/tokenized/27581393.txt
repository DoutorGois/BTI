Tottering mutant mice carry a mutation in the pore-forming subunit (alpha1A) of CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) voltage-gated calcium ion (Ca(2+)) channels resulting in reduced neuronal Ca(2+) current density. We assessed male tottering mice for spatial learning using the Morris water maze. Tottering mice performed worse than wild type mice, suggesting abnormal hippocampal function. Because Ca(2+) influx via voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels regulates neuronal survival and function, we assessed hippocampus volume and cell density using hematoxylin and eosin stained serial sections. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was assessed using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling with fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) with diaminobenzidine IHC. We double-labeled neurons using fluorescence IHC with BrdU-neuronal nuclei (Neu-N) or double labeling of astrocytes using BrdU-glial fibrillary protein, respectively, to assess cell proliferation and survival. We assessed numbers of dying cells using fluoro-Jade histochemistry. Decreased hippocampal volume, increased dentate hilar and hippocampal CA1 cell densities were observed in tottering mice compared to wild type mice. Cell proliferation was increased in the hilus and CA2 region of tottering mice compared to wild type mice. Dendritic intersections in Sholl analysis were decreased for tottering mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons compared to wild type mice. The increased regional cell density coincides with increases in cell proliferation in similar, non-neurogenic areas of the hippocampus of tottering mice. Thus, hippocampal alterations observed in adult tottering mice appear to result from changes in neuronal morphology and proliferation in non-neurogenic areas of the hippocampus, and less through altered adult hippocampal neurogenesis or cell death.
