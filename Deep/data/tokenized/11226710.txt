Progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms expression was determined in several regions of the prepuberal and adult male rat brain by using reverse transcription coupled to polymerase chain reaction. Rats under a 14:10-h light-dark cycle, with lights on at 0600 h were used. We found that in the hypothalamus of prepuberal animals the expression of both PR isoforms was similar, whereas PR-A expression was higher than that of PR-B in adults. In the cerebellum PR-B expression was predominant in both prepuberal and adult rats. In both ages PR-A and PR-B exhibited a non-significant tendency to be predominant in the hippocampus and the preoptic area respectively. In the frontal cortex and the olfactory bulb PR isoforms were expressed at a similar level. These results indicate a differential expression pattern of PR isoforms in the male rat brain and suggest that the tissue-specific expression of PR-A and PR-B is important for the appropriate response of each cerebral region to progesterone.
