An exceptional category of cortical non pyramidal interneurons--chandelier cells or axo-axonal cells or axo-axonal cells exert specific inhibition at the level of initial segment of pyramid axons. There are evidences that chandelier cells are directly involved in the development of Alzheimer disease, a degenerative brain pathology. Morphological features and neurochemical specialization, history of opening of chandelier cells was described as well as their links in neocortex, hippocampus and dentate fascia of man and animals. Basing on results of the authors study and the findings available in literature modern conceptions on histophysiology of axo-axonal inhibition were critically analysed. It was emphasized that the function of chandelier cells is highly specified--they prevent occasional cell connections and serve as a factor of nervous system regulation.
