The potential for compounds acting at the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor to injure neurons was examined using induction of a 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-70) as a marker. HSP-70 was consistently detected in retrosplenial and cingulate cortices after MK-801 but not glycine drug treatment. Elsewhere in the cortex, mild diffuse HSP-70 immunoreactivity was detected following 7-chlorokynurenic acid. Following HA-966, intense hippocampal HSP-70 immunoreactivity was observed. These findings indicate that even after very high doses, drugs acting at the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor are less likely to injure cingulate cortical neurons than other classes of NMDA antagonists.
