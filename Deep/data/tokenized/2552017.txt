Stimulation-induced noradrenaline (NA) release in rabbit hippocampus is inhibited by activation of presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors and kappa-opioid receptors. The purpose of the present study was to investigate (a) an interference between the alpha 2- and kappa-mechanisms, and (b) a coupling of the opioid receptors to pertussis toxin (PT)-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), as has been previously shown for the alpha 2-receptors. [3H]NA release from hippocampal slices was evoked by electrical field stimulation (360 pulses/3 Hz). Inhibition of stimulation-evoked NA release by the preferential kappa-receptor agonist ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) was increased in the presence of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.1 or 1.0 microM). When autoinhibition was completely removed, EKC (1 microM) almost abolished transmitter release. Pretreatment of hippocampal tissue with either PT (8 micrograms/ml; 18 h) or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (30 microM; 30 min), which has been shown to alkylate PT substrates, diminished the EKC-produced inhibition of NA release. The kappa-mechanism was still impaired by these compounds when the alpha 2-receptors were blocked with yohimbine. An effect of NEM on the active site of the kappa-receptor seems to be unlikely, because NEM diminished the EKC-induced inhibition of release irrespective of whether or not the opioid receptor was occupied by EKC during exposure to NEM. The present results suggest an interference of both alpha 2- and kappa-opioid receptor-coupled signal transduction possibly through competition for a common pool of G proteins.
