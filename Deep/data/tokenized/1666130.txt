Our previous work indicated that in E14 embryonic rat spinal cord cultures ciliary neuronotrophic factor (CNTF) exerted (1) a survival-promoting effect on motor neurons and on a large population of unidentified neurons, and (2) a regulatory role on the expression of ChAT and low affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR) in a population of small/medium-sized neurons. In the present study, we examined the effect of CNTF on the expression of LNGFR in cultures of different regions from the E18 embryonic rat brain, namely cortex, septum, striatum, mesencephalon, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellum. The number of LNGFR-positive neurons (stained with the 192-IgG monoclonal antibody) was determined in untreated cultures and in cultures treated for 6 days (0-6) with human recombinant CNTF. To distinguish between effects on survival and on LNGFR expression, experiments were performed in which CNTF was administered only for the last 48 h of the culture (from days 4-6). LNGFR positive neurons were found in the cultures of all the regions examined. In each one of them, CNTF increased the number of LNGFR-positive neurons by three- to fourfold after 6 days of treatment. In the striatum, septum, mesencephalon, and cerebellum, the effect of CNTF was shown to be on the regulation of LNGFR expression and not on survival. In cultures from the cortex, hippocampus and brainstem, a survival-promoting role of CNTF could be demonstrated. The effect of CNTF was dose dependent, with half-maximal effects (ED50) achieved at 2-4.5 TU/ml for all the brain regions. Maximal effects were reached at 100-250 TU/ml. From these results, we conclude that (1) there exists a wide spectrum of CNTF-responsive neurons in the central nervous system, and (2) CNTF plays an important and widespread role in regulating the expression of the LNGFR in neurons.
