The tricyclic antidepressant desmethylimipramine (DMI) interacts with the NMDA receptor/ionophore complex; however, the site of the interaction has not been clearly established. Although evidence from receptor binding assays suggests that DMI interacts with the Zn2+ binding site, other binding studies and electrophysiological studies suggest otherwise. Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique to record from cultured hippocampal neurons, we report that recovery of NMDA-activated current from block by DMI is time-dependent and this time-dependent component was not observed following preexposure of neurons to Zn2+. These observations favor the hypothesis that DMI interacts at a binding site within the NMDA receptor/complex channel pore and not at the Zn2+ binding site.
