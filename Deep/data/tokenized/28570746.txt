This research investigated the influence of extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF; 50 Hz, 8 mT, 4 h per day, for 28 days) on calcium ion signaling and the double messenger system in the hippocampus of mice. Messengers that were studied included: G-protein, Ins(1,4,5)P3 (IP3 ), diacylglycerol (DAG), cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and Ca(2+) -dependent protein kinase C (PKC). The results showed that ELF-MF caused an increase in the levels of Gi protein, IP3, DAG, PKA and PKC beta, calcium and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineuring (PP2B), and intracellular Ca(2+) content, and a decrease in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) and PKC alpha. In addition, ELF-MF exposure decreased the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which played a key role in hippocampal neuronal cell death. However, oral administration of procyanidins from lotus seedpod (LSPCs) (especially 90 mg kg(-1) ) significantly recovered these changes, and nearly reached normal levels. All these showed that LSPCs may mediate calcium signal and double messenger system through Ca(2+) /CaMK II/CREB/BDNF and DG/PKC/MAPK signaling pathways to reverse the alteration caused by ELF-MF.
