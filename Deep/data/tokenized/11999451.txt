A Shetland sheepdog with epilepsy refractory to antiepileptic drugs was brought to the division of Veterinary Radiology at Nippon Veterinary and Animal Science University. Scalp electroencephalography and computed tomography was performed, but no abnormality was detected in either examination. To obtain detailed information, electrodes were implanted on the dura mater, and the electrocorticogram (ECoG) was recorded. In the ECoG, sporadic spikes were detected in the left parietal region, suggesting the presence of the epileptic focus in this region. After the dog's death, abnormalities of gyri were found in the region where spikes were detected in the ECoG. On histopathological examination, laminar malacia of the cingulate gyrus was observed. Furthermore, in the hippocampus, neuronal loss of pyramidal cells was observed.
