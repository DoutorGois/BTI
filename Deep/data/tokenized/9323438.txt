The organophosphate pesticide, phorate, is an extremely hazardous insecticide. Not much experimental study is available on effects of phorate on different brain areas. We report in this study the alterations induced by phorate on enzyme profile of mouse olfactory bulb. Olfactory bulb, the first processing centre after the sensory cells in the olfactory pathway, has connections with the other higher centres of the brain like hippocampus and hypothalamus. Phorate was administered orally in the diet at the doses of 1.0 mg and 1.5 mg/kg body weight to adult albino mice. After 32 weeks of exposure animals were sacrificed and cryosections were processed for acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (AChE and BChE, respectively) enzyme localization. Significant reduction occurs in AChE and BChE activity at higher dose level, whereas reduced BChE activity was found at both dose levels. Our results shows an obvious effect on cholinesterase enzyme profile of olfactory bulb of mice after systemic administration of low doses of phorate for long terms.
