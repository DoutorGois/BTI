Adenylyl cyclase (AC) subtypes have been implicated in memory processes and synaptic plasticity. In the present study, the effects of aging and learning on Ca2+/calmodulin-stimulable AC1, Ca2+-insensitive AC2 and Ca2+/calcineurin-inhibited AC9 mRNA level were compared in the dorsal hippocampus of young-adult and aged C57BL/6 mice using in situ hybridization. Both AC1 and AC9 mRNA expression were downregulated in aged hippocampus, whereas AC2 mRNA remained unchanged, suggesting differential sensitivities to the aging process. We next examined AC mRNA expression in the hippocampus after spatial learning in the Morris water maze. Acquisition of the spatial task was associated with an increase of AC1 and AC9 mRNA levels in both young-adult and aged groups, suggesting that Ca2+-sensitive ACs are oppositely regulated by aging and learning. However, aged-trained mice had reduced AC1 and AC9, but greater AC2, mRNA levels relative to young-trained mice and age-related learning impairments were correlated with reduced AC1 expression in area CA1. We suggest that reduced levels of hippocampal AC1 mRNA may greatly contribute to age-related defects in spatial memory.
