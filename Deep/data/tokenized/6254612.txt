The oxidative metabolic activity of restricted regions of hippocampal slices was assessed by a continuous measurement of the fluorescence of intramitochondrial nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH). A large increase in NADH fluorescence was triggered by substituting the oxygen supply to the slice by nitrogen gas. A large and transient increase in NADH fluorescence was also produced by superfusion of the the slice with a high (50 mM) potassium-containing medium. Addition of norepinephrine (NE) to the superfusion medium caused a propranolol-inhibited increase in NADH fluorescence. Furthermore, ouabain, which inhibits the Na-K pump, blocked the effects of NE. An analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), 8-bromo cAMP, mimicked the effect of NE. Finally, effects of NE could still be produced in a kainic acid-treated hippocampus, where most neurons were previously destroyed by the drug. It is suggested that NE activates a Na-K-ATPase, that this effect might be mediated by cAMP, and that these interrelations may underly the physiological action of NE in the brain.
