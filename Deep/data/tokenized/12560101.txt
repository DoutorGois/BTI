We previously showed that starvation causes reversible hyperphosphorylation of tau in the mouse brain. To explore possible involvement of stress in tau hyperphosphorylation quantitative analysis of phosphorylated tau in four brain regions of mice subjected to cold water stress (CWS) was made by immunoblot analyses using phosphorylation-dependent antibodies directed to eight sites on tau known to be hyperphosphorylated in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Ser199, Ser202/Thr205, Thr231/Ser235 were hyperphosphorylated 20 and 40 min after CWS. The response was pronounced in the hippocampus and cerebral hemisphere, but weak in the cerebellum in parallel with the regional vulnerability in AD. Among the regulatory phosphorylation of protein kinases studied, a transient phosphorylation of tau protein kinase I/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta at Ser9 was most conspicuous.
