Two patients are reported, one with severe brain damage and epilepsy, and the other with limbic epilepsy, who were treated with unilateral microsurgical amygdalo-hippocampectomy for the control of rage and aggression. Both had significant improvement in their aggressiveness, and the second patient also improved in the frequency of his seizures and psychotic episodes. The significance of these observations for our understanding of the morphophysiological basis of rage and aggression is discussed.
