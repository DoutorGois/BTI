The aim of the present study was to analyze biochemical effects of a neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate (PS), which accompany changes in the threshold of seizures, and to establish the contribution of local, hippocampal monoaminergic and amino acid systems, to the control of convulsive activity. Pretreatment of mice with PS (intracerebroventricularly) selectively enhanced the potency of peripherally (intraperitoneally) administered NMDA at the LD16 (88.0 mg/kg) to induce clonic-tonic convulsions (PS, LD84 = 184.7 nM; 95% CL = 181.4-188.1). The proconvulsive actions of picrotoxin and bicuculline, the GABA-A receptor antagonists, were not modified by pretreatment of mice with PS. Administration of PS alone (up to 240 nM icv) did not show any seizure-like activity. PS given at LD84, together with NMDA (at the LD16), increased the hippocampal concentration of alanine, and enhanced local metabolism of dopamine in a period immediately preceding the onset of seizures significantly stronger than did NMDA alone. These and other data indicate that the enhancement by PS of hippocampal levels of alanine may contribute to the seizures development as this amino acid is a precursor of glutamate, and a co-agonist of the NMDA receptors. On the other hand, simultaneously occurring stimulation of hippocampal dopaminergic system may be considered a compensatory phenomenon, limiting seizures propagation through the limbic forebrain. Summarizing, our results show that PS-induced potentiation of NMDA seizures is accompanied by selective changes in hippocampal dopamine turnover and alanine concentration.
