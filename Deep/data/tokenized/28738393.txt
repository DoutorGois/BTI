<br>Background: Studies examining the ability of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to enhance memory in women, and in animal models, have not produced consistent results. However, studies examining the effects of activity and exposure to novel environments consistently find enhancement of memory. METHODS: An animal model of reproductive aging was used to determine if estradiol (E2) replacement, activity, and/or exposure to an enriched environment could act synergistically to improve memory, and neural correlates of memory. Young (3 mo) and reproductively senescent (12 mo) female rats were ovariectomized and received either vehicle or E2 treatment. Rats were assigned to one of three exposures; Control: rats remained in their cage; maze control: rats were put into a pen where they could move and explore; enriched maze: rats were put into a pen with various items to climb on or investigate. The amount of time rats were active in each environment was measured. On the third day of exposure, one of the items in the enriched environment was exchanged, and the amount of time animals spent investigating the new item was used as a measure of memory. RESULTS: E2 increased activity, immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and synaptic markers, synaptophysin and spinophilin, in the hippocampus of all animals. However, E2- and activity- induced changes in these markers were more pronounced in young rats. Only young rats displayed improved recognition in response to E2. CONCLUSIONS: Older rats may need an extended period of ERT or increased activity before the benefits on memory become apparent. <br>.
