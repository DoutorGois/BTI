Most brain imaging studies have showed smaller hippocampal volume in adults with chronic PTSD; however, some other studies have not replicated this finding. Most of these investigations included subjects with other psychiatric comorbidities, such as major depression or alcohol abuse. The prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in PTSD is generally high and this makes it difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle the contribution of other disorders to hippocampal volume. Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to compare hippocampal volumes of healthy subjects and drug-naive patients with PTSD caused by different types of mixed civilian traumas (i.e. car accident, physical abuse, sudden death of a family member, assault or robbery, natural disaster and traumatic abortion) and without comorbidity conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure the hippocampi, total cerebrum, gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes in 34 patients with single diagnosis of PTSD, and 34 case-matched non-PTSD comparison subjects. The patients with single diagnosis of PTSD had an 11.8% smaller left hippocampus (p<0.001) and an 8.7% smaller right hippocampus (p=0.003) than the healthy controls. The results were controlled for the total brain volume and for gray matter volumes. Subjects with PTSD also displayed lower overall gray matter volume (p=0.006). There were no significant correlations between hippocampal volumes and illness duration or severity of PTSD. The findings indicate the presence of smaller hippocampal volumes in drug-naive patients with single diagnosis of PTSD, compared with healthy subjects.
