The distribution of high-affinity binding sites for [3H]somatostatin has been studied in membrane preparations from a number of regions of normal human brain. The highest densities of binding sites (greater than 48 fmol/mg protein) were found in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices and the hippocampus, with intermediate binding densities (30-46 fmol/mg protein) being present in the basal ganglia, amygdala, septum and claustrum. The lowest densities of binding sites (less than 14 fmol/mg protein) were observed in the hypothalamus, thalamus and substantia nigra. The binding of [3H]somatostatin in both the frontal cortex and cerebellar cortex demonstrated pharmacological specificity, since somatostatin-28, but not somatostatin-28(1-12) or Des AA1,2,4,5,12,13, D-Trp8-somatostatin, competed for the binding sites. Scatchard analysis of the binding in both frontal cortex and cerebellar cortex revealed the presence of two classes of high-affinity binding sites.
