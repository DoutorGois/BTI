Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation of neuronal function. We examined the effects of inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation on ischemic neuronal damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In the gerbil hippocampus, genistein and lavendustin A, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, were administered 30 min before initiation of 5-min ischemia and reperfusion. Both genistein and lavendustin A blocked tyrosine phosphorylation and prevented delayed neuronal death (DND). However, genistein, an inactive analogue of genistein, did not block DND. Genistein was dose-dependent in the inhibition of DND after ischemia and reperfusion. Administration of genistein 5 to 10 min after ischemia and reperfusion was ineffective in blocking DND in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors selectively blocked the phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-2 kinase following ischemia and reperfusion injury. These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation in the ischemic brain is important for neuronal injury and that MAP-2 kinase may play a role in the onset of delayed neuronal death.
