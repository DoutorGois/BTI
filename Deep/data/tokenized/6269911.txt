The oligopeptides were microiontophoretically applied to neurons of the sensory cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and septum. Metenkephalin and beta-endorphin increased activity of some neurons while decreasing it in other cells. Nalorphine antagonized the inhibition effect of metenkephalin in all the brain areas under study. Inhibition of the peptide activating action occurred in hippocampal and septal neurons. A correlation between effects of metenkephalin and beta-endorphin on the same neurons was revealed in the cortex and thalamus. Thyroliberin mostly activated neurons in all the areas. Independence of neuronal effects of TRH and opioid peptides was obvious.
