In the continuous efforts to test the validity of the theme that the Ca(2+)-modulated ROS-GC subfamily system is a universal transduction component of the sensory and sensory-linked network of neurons, this article focuses on the presence and variant biochemical forms of this transduction system in the gustatory epithelium, the site of gustatory transduction; in the pineal, a light-sensitive gland; and in the hippocampus neurons, linked with the perception of all SENSES.
