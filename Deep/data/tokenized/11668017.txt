In this study we determined the effect of in vitro ethanol exposure on stimulated glutamate release in transverse hippocampal slices (400-microm thickness) of the young postnatal guinea pig (PD 12) by using two chemical stimuli with different mechanisms of action. Ethanol (50 mM) decreased K+ (45 mM)-, but not veratridine (10 microM)-, stimulated glutamate release. The study findings demonstrate that in vitro ethanol exposure produces differential inhibition of stimulated glutamate release in the hippocampus, dependent on the stimulating agent.
