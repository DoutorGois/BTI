This experiment was designed to highlight the relationships between septo-hippocampal cholinergic activation and the processing of memory consolidation. For that purpose, we have analyzed the consequences of a medial septal electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 30 microA) applied soon after partial acquisition session of an appetitive operant conditioning task on in vivo hippocampal cholinergic activity on the one hand and on subsequent retention 24 h later on the other hand. For maximize our data base for such comparison we used two neurochemically and behaviorally distincts strains of mice, BALB/c and C57BL/6. In these conditions, our results showed that BALB/c mice evidenced better performance in retention than C57BL/6 mice after medial septal stimulation. On the other hand, the stimulation applied in resting conditions produced a moderate and similar hippocampal cholinergic activation in the two strains. Moreover, in BALB/c mice the only strain which exhibited good consolidation capacities the stimulation do not induced any additive effect on the substantial increase of the hippocampal cholinergic activity produced by the previous acquisition session. Finally, a correlative study realized in C57BL/6 mice seems to indicate that the higher the hippocampal cholinergic activity was the lower were the consolidation capacities. These results lead us to suggest that the improvement of memory consolidation induced by the medial septal stimulation is the consequence of the recruitment of non cholinergic elements located close to the electrode tip. Consequently the septo-hippocampal cholinergic activation is more likely to facilitate certain information processes prior to the consolidation mechanisms proper.
