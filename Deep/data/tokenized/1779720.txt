Before it is possible to use MR imaging to investigate changes in the hippocampus in disease processes such as epilepsy and memory disorders, it is imperative that normal variations are defined. Using specific anatomic locations, we evaluated the hippocampi of 29 normal volunteers with coronal MR studies. Mild variations occur with regard to hippocampal size and shape, and hippocampal fissure visualization. Hippocampal signal intensity is isointense to cortical gray matter. Recognition of normally occurring variations should help prevent over-interpretation of hippocampal changes in pathologic disorders.
