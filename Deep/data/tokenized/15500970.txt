Hypoxic encephalopathy is a common cause of neonatal seizures and long-term neurological cognitive deficits. In rats at postnatal days 10-12 (P10-P12), global hypoxia induced spontaneous seizures and chronic brain injury, mimicking clinical aspects of neonatal hypoxia. Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein (SynGAP) has important roles in RAS/MAPK-dependent synaptic plasticity and mammalian learning. We investigated possible alterations of SynGAP expression occurring in memory-impaired animals previously exposed to perinatal hypoxia insults. We also evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of A68930, a selective agonist of dopamine D1/D5 receptors, on perinatal hypoxia insults. In the hippocampal CA1 region, perinatal hypoxia insults (P10) led to a reduction in SynGAP expression associated with impairment in long-term spatial learning and memory performance at P45. The use of A68930 (at a dose of 1, 2, 3mg/kg, P17-P23) effectively attenuated the deleterious effects as described above. Our results may indicate the involvement of SynGAP in certain forms of brain injury, leading to long-term learning and memory deficits. A68930 may have clinical potential as a therapeutic agent for alleviation of long-term cognitive deficits in rats and other animal models.
