We report here that the specific Fab' fragment of anti-nerve growth factor (NGF)-antibody (anti-NGF, 12, 120 and 400 micrograms/4 weeks, i.c.v.) impairs learning and memory. The goal latency of the control rats in water maze task was rapidly shortened by training compared to those of the anti-NGF-treated rats. The degree of reduction in movement counts of the anti-NGF-treated rats in habituation task was significantly smaller than that of the control rats. However, the step-through latency of the anti-NGF-treated rats was not significantly shorter than that of the control rats. With regard to the choline acetyltransferase activity, no effects were observed in any of the brain regions. Anti-NGF treatment altered nuclear morphology in the hippocampus and parietal cortex. As a result, it seems that the anti-NGF-induced amnesia could be due to an impairment of nuclear morphology.
