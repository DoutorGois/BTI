The ability of the selective metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) to protect hippocampal CA1 neurons from a hypoxic/hypoglycemic injury was examined. Rat hippocampal slices were exposed to a 4 min hypoxia/hypoglycemia, and the recovery of evoked population spikes was monitored. 500 microM (+)-MCPG exhibited a statistically significant protective effect, whereas the (-)-isomer was ineffective. These data suggest that MCPG-sensitive mGluRs may contribute to hypoxia/hypoglycemia-induced injury in rat hippocampal slices.
