The family of EF-hand calcium binding proteins is composed of more than 250 members. In search for other neuronal markers, we studied the expression pattern of Necab-1, -2 and -3 in the Ammons horn of adult mice at the gene- and protein levels using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The genes for the three Necab's were expressed in specific, non-overlapping areas of the hippocampus. A minority of the Necab-positive interneurons were GABA-ergic, and they virtually never coexpressed one of the classical calcium binding proteins (calretinin, calbindin D-28k and parvalbumin). Necab's are promising new neuronal markers in the brain.
