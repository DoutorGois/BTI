Differences between acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition in the brain structures following VX and RVX exposure are not known as well as information on the possible correlation of biochemical and histochemical methods detecting AChE activity. Therefore, inhibition of AChE in different brain parts detected by histochemical and biochemical techniques was compared in rats intoxicated with VX and RVX. AChE activities in defined brain regions 30 min after treating rats with VX and Russian VX intramuscularly (1.0 x LD(50)) were determined by using biochemical and histochemical methods. AChE inhibition was less expressed for RVX, in comparison with VX. Frontal cortex and pontomedullar areas containing ncl. reticularis has been found as the most sensitive areas for the action of VX. For RVX, these structures were determined to be frontal cortex, dorsal septum, and hippocampus, respectively. Histochemical and biochemical results were in good correlation (R(xy) = 0.8337). Determination of AChE activity in defined brain structures was a more sensitive parameter for VX or RVX exposure than the determination of AChE activity in the whole-brain homogenate. This activity represents a "mean" of the activities in different structures. Thus, AChE activity is the main parameter investigated in studies searching for target sites following nerve-agent poisoning contributing to better understanding of toxicodynamics of nerve agents.
