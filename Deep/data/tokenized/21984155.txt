OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics ceftriaxone on the levels of glutamate in hippocampus following traumatic brain injury in rat. METHODS: Rats were divided randomly into three groups:sham group; trauma group and trauma+ceftriaxone group. Rats in the later two groups were subjected to a lateral cortical impact injury caused by a free-falling object, and trauma+ceftriaxone group was treated with ceftriaxone immediately after injury. The levels of glutamate in hippocampus was determined by HPLC at 12 h after trauma; the pathological change at 24 h after trauma was examined and water content of brain tissue at 3, 12 and 24 h after trauma was measured in three groups. RESULTS: Compared with the trauma group,the water content in brain tissue (P<0.05), neuronal death in hippocampus CAl area and the levels of glutamate and aspartate in hippocampus at 12 h (P<0.05) were significantly decreased in trauma+ceftriaxone group. CONCLUSION: beta-lactam antibiotics ceftriaxone can reduce the level of brain glutamate, brain edema and neuronal death after traumatic brain injury in rat.
