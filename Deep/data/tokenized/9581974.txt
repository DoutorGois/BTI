The developmental regulation of the N-type calcium channel during synaptogenesis was studied using cultured rat hippocampal neurons to elucidate the roles of extrinsic versus intrinsic cues in the expression and distribution of this channel. Prior to synapse formation, alpha1B and beta3 subunits of the N-type calcium channel were distributed diffusely throughout neurites, growth cones, and somata. As synaptogenesis proceeded, the subunit distributions became punctate and colocalized with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. Isolated neurons were also examined to test for the requirement of extrinsic cues that control N-type calcium channel expression and distribution. These neurons expressed N-type calcium channel subunits, but their distributions remained diffuse. Functional omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive channels were expressed in isolated neurons, although the distribution of alpha1B subunits was diffuse. The distribution of the alpha1B subunit and synaptotagmin only became punctate when neuron-neuron contact was allowed. Thus, the expression of functional N-type calcium channels is the result of an intrinsic program while extrinsic regulatory cues mediated by neuron-neuron contact are required to control their distribution during synaptogenesis.
