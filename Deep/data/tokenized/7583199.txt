The present study was designed to examine the effects of chronic stress on GABAA receptor binding. Animals were randomly assigned to either a control, acute, or chronic stress condition and changes in specific binding were assessed using the GABAA receptor antagonist [3H]SR 95531. Exposure to chronic restraint stress led to a significant reduction in GABAA receptor binding in the prefrontal cortex. Alterations in specific binding were not observed in the cerebellum, caudate-putamen, hippocampus, or cingulate cortex however, suggesting that the effects of chronic stress may be regionally specific. Exposure to acute restraint did not lead to a significant alteration in [3H]SR 95531 binding in any brain region examined.
