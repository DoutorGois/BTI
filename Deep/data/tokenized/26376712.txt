BACKGROUND: The volumetry of the hippocampal subregion may provide additional information in the early investigation of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and the T2 signal intensity (T2-SI) of the hippocampal subregion has not been well studied quantitatively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in aMCI. METHODS: Using combined MRI-based hippocampal volumetry and T2-SI at the levels of the whole hippocampus and hippocampal subregion, 18 patients with aMCI and 18 age-matched controls were investigated. RESULTS: Significantly lower left whole hippocampal and hippocampal head volumes and higher T2-SI in the bilateral whole hippocampus and hippocampal head were shown, whereas atrophy of the right whole hippocampus and hippocampal subregion was not significant in aMCI. Additionally, correlations were found among the hippocampal volume, T2-SI and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores for aMCI in the whole hippocampus and some hippocampal subregions and an almost perfect correlation was found between T2-SI of the left hippocampal head and MMSE scores regarding aMCI (r = -0.831, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities of the hippocampal volume and T2-SI were documented in aMCI, whereas T2-SI was implied to be more susceptible than the volume in the pathohistological progression in aMCI. Additionally, T2-SI in the left hippocampal head may be a potential biomarker to facilitate the early diagnosis of aMCI.
