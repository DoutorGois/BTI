The human indusium griseum (IG), the paired dorsal continuation of the hippocampus, was investigated with high-field (3.0T) MR imaging. The IG was clearly visible in 16 out of 20 healthy volunteers. The most common pattern was a single lateralized strip. The classical neuroanatomic pattern of paired symmetric strips along the midline was found in one case. The study clearly demonstrates that diminutive, hitherto overlooked structures such as the IG now can be readily investigated in vivo by non-invasive high-field MR imaging.
