The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic exercise on the hypothalamus and hippocampus levels of the endocannabinoids (eCBs) anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and of two AEA congeners and on the expression of genes coding for CB1, CB2 receptors (Cnr1 and Cnr2, respectively), and the enzymes responsible for eCB biosynthesis and degradation, in rats fed with a standard or high-fat diet. Male Wistar rats (n = 28) were placed on a 12-week high-fat (HFD) or standard diet period, followed by 12 weeks of exercise training for half of each group. Tissue levels of eCBs and related lipids were measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and expression of genes coding for CB1 and CB2 receptors and eCB metabolic enzymes was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). HFD induced a significant increase in 2-AG (p < 0.01) in hypothalamus. High-fat diet paired with exercise training had no effect on AEA, 2-AG, and AEA congener levels in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. Cnr1 expression levels were significantly increased in the hippocampus in response to HFD, exercise, and the combination of both (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that eCB signaling in the CNS is sensitive to diet and/or exercise.
