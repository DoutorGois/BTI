Electroencephalographic changes were examined in the caudate nucleus and accumbens nucleus during limbic seizure development in eight kindled cat preparations. The emergence of self-sustained after-discharge and interictal discharge was demonstrated in the accumbens nucleus during limbic seizure development. This finding suggests secondary epileptogenic functional alterations in the mesolimbic dopamine neuron systems. Moreover, the epileptiform responses triggered from the accumbens and caudate nuclei increased markedly with progressive limbic seizure development. These results suggest that a limbic seizure could produce a secondary functional reorganization of the brain dopaminergic neuron systems, especially of the mesolimbic dopamine neuron systems that has been reported to play an important role in the manifestation of psychotic symptom.
