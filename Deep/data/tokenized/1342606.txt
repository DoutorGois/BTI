An electro-oscillographic study of the hippocampus, thalamic anterior nuclei and cingulate and pericingulate cortical areas was performed in the rat during the wakefulness-sleep cycle. High voltage (usually from 100 to 200 microV) theta waves, oscillating at regular frequencies from 6 to 10 Hz, were found to occur simultaneously in all of these components of the Papez circuit during attentive behavior and dreaming.
