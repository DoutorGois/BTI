Quantitative geneticists traditionally attribute phenotypic variation to genetic or environmental sources. New findings with near-clonal mice raised in a single enriched environment demonstrated significant developmental and behavioural divergence. This suggests intriguing possibilities for how (epi)genomes and environments might interact to drive phenotypic individuality, thus shaping evolutionary pathways.
