The sites of calcium accumulation were studied by 45Ca autoradiography during kainic acid (KA)-induced limbic seizure in rats. Two hours after KA injection into unilateral amygdala, calcium accumulated in CA3 of the hippocampus, lateral septal nucleus and thalamic reticular nucleus on KA-injected side. Those sites coincided with the sites where neuronal cell damage appeared 4 h after KA injection. These results suggested that regional calcium accumulation might be responsible for neuronal cell loss induced by seizures.
