The effect of isoflurane on inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) was studied in rat hippocampal slices by intracellular recordings from pyramidal neurons (n = 34). The amplitude of the IPSP was transiently increased and subsequently reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The duration of the IPSP was increased. The reduction in the IPSP persisted after correction was made for the anesthetic-induced hyperpolarization. The reversal potential for the IPSP was slightly displaced in the depolarizing direction. The depolarizing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) response was unaltered, while the hyperpolarizing GABA response was reduced, suggesting a postsynaptic action. The reduction in the IPSP produced by isoflurane is at least partly due to an altered reversal potential for the IPSP (EIPSP).
