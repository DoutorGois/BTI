The extent to which acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus is regulated by dopaminergic mechanisms was assessed using in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats. Systemic administration of the dopamine (DA) receptor agonist apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg) or the specific D1 agonist CY 208-243 (1.0 mg/kg) increased microdialysate concentrations of ACh in the hippocampus. The D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg) produced a small but statistically significant decrease in hippocampal ACh release. d-Amphetamine (2.0 mg/kg) increased ACh release, an effect that was blocked by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.3 mg/kg) but not by the D2 antagonist raclopride (1.0 mg/kg). These findings suggest that endogenous DA stimulates septohippocampal cholinergic neurons primarily via actions at D1 receptors. In addition, these results are similar to previous findings regarding the dopaminergic regulation of cortical ACh release, and suggest that the anatomical continuum formed by basal forebrain cholinergic neurons that project to the cortex and hippocampus acts as a functional unit, at least with respect to its regulation by DA.
