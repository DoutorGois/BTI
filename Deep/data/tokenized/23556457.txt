Kainate receptors (KARs) play fundamentally important roles in controlling synaptic function and regulating neuronal excitability. Postsynaptic KARs contribute to excitatory neurotransmission but the molecular mechanisms underlying their activity-dependent surface expression are not well understood. Strong activation of KARs in cultured hippocampal neurons leads to the downregulation of postsynaptic KARs via endocytosis and degradation. In contrast, low-level activation augments postsynaptic KAR surface expression. Here, we show that this increase in KARs is due to enhanced recycling via the recruitment of Rab11-dependent, transferrin-positive endosomes into spines. Dominant-negative Rab11 or the recycling inhibitor primaquine prevents the kainate-evoked increase in surface KARs. Moreover, we show that the increase in surface expression is mediated via a metabotropic KAR signalling pathway, which is blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine, the calcium chelator BAPTA and the G-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin. Thus, we report a previously uncharacterized positive feedback system that increases postsynaptic KARs in response to low- or moderate-level agonist activation and can provide additional flexibility to synaptic regulation.
