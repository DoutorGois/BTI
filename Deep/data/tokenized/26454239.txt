The Zbtb33 gene encodes the Kaiso protein-a bimodal transcriptional repressor. Here, the effects of Zbtb33 gene disruption on the brain and behaviour of the Kaiso-deficient (KO) and C57BL/6 (WT) male mice were investigated. Behaviour was studied using the open field, novel object, elevated plus maze and acoustic startle reflex tests. Brain morphology was investigated with magnetic resonance imaging. Biogenic amine levels and gene expression in the brain were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Zbtb33 gene mRNA was not detected in the brain of KO mice. KO mice exhibited increased locomotion, exploration in the open field, novel object and elevated plus-maze test. At the same time, Zbtb33 gene disruption did not alter anxiety-related behaviour in the elevated plus-maze test. KO mice showed elevated amplitudes and pre-pulse inhibitions of the acoustic startle reflex. These behavioural alterations were accompanied by significant reductions in the volumes of the lateral ventricles without significant alterations in the volumes of the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and corpus callosum. Norepinephrine concentration was reduced in the hypothalami and hippocampi in KO mice, while the levels of serotonin, dopamine, their metabolites as well as mRNA of the gene coding brain-derived neurotrophic factor were not altered in the brain of KO mice compared to WT mice. This study is the first to reveal the involvement of the Zbtb33 gene in the regulation of behaviour and the central nervous system.
