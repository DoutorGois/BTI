The rodent hippocampus possesses theta (theta) and beta (beta) rhythms, which occur intermittently as bursts. Both rhythms are related to spatial memory processing in a novel environment. theta rhythm is related to spatial memory encoding process. beta rhythm is related to the match/mismatch process. In the match/mismatch process, rodent hippocampus detects a representation matching sensory inputs of the current place among the retrieved internal representations of places. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) is induced in both processes. The cholinergic agent carbachol induces intermittent theta and beta oscillations in in vitro slices similar to in vivo bursts. LTP is facilitated during the generation of theta oscillation, suggesting that the facilitation of LTP is dependent upon the phases of intermittent burst (burst phases) of the oscillation. However, whether this is the case for beta oscillation has not yet been studied. In the present study, LTP-inducing theta-burst stimulation was administered at the different burst phases of carbachol-induced beta oscillations (CIBO), and the synaptic changes were measured at CA3-CA3 pyramidal cell synapses (CA3 synapse) and at CA3-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses (CA1 synapse). At the CA3 synapse, the largest magnitude of LTP was induced at the late burst phases of CIBO. At the CA1 synapse, LTP was induced only at the late burst phases. Modulation of LTP was suppressed when CIBO was blocked by the application of atropine at both synapses. The results suggest that the bursts of hippocampal beta rhythm can determine the optimal temporal period for completing with the match/mismatch process.
