We have previously demonstrated that early environment influences the metabolic response, affecting abdominal fat deposition in adult female rats exposed to a long-term highly caloric diet. In the present study, our goal was to verify the effects of the chronic exposure, in adulthood, to a highly palatable diet (chocolate) on cerebral Na+,K+-ATPase activity and S100B protein concentrations, and the response to its withdrawal in neonatally handled and non-handled rats. We measured the consumption of foods (standard lab chow and chocolate), body weight gain, S100B protein concentrations, as well as cerebral Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity during chronic exposure and after chocolate withdrawal in adult female rats that had been exposed or not to neonatal handling (10 min/day, 10 first days of life). Non-handled rats chronically exposed to chocolate exhibited increased plasma S100B levels, but there was no difference in abdominal fat S100B concentration between groups. Chronic chocolate consumption decreased Na+,K+-ATPase activity in both amygdala and hippocampus in non-handled, but not in handled rats, and this effect disappeared after chocolate withdrawal. Non-handled animals also demonstrated increased frequency of head shaking in the open field after 24h of chocolate withdrawal in comparison to handled ones. These findings suggest that neonatal handling modifies the vulnerability to metabolic and brain alterations induced by chronic exposure to a highly palatable diet in adulthood.
