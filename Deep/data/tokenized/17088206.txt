In the October 6th issue of Science, Raab-Graham et al. described two surprising findings. They discovered that local dendritic translation of Kv1.1 occurs in CA1 dendrites of rat hippocampal slices and in cultured neurons. This local translation is inhibited by NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic signaling acting through the mTOR kinase.
