Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and dopamine (DA) levels were estimated in the frontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens and the striatum of the rat after electrolytical lesion of the dorsal raphe nucleus. The efficiency of this lesion was tested by measuring the decline in serotonin (5-HT) levels in the striatum. 5-HT levels were reduced by 90% when compared to those of sham-operated rats 11 days after the lesion. As revealed both by the increase in DOPAC levels and in the DOPAC/DA ratio, the rate of DA utilization was markedly increased in the nucleus accumbens, slightly enhanced in the striatum and in contrast remained unaffected in the frontal cerebral cortex 4 days after the lesion. Changes in DOPAC levels in the nucleus accumbens were also seen 11 and 30 days after the lesion but they were less pronounced than those observed at 4 days. These results suggest that neurons originating from the dorsal raphe and projecting to the ventro-tegmental area are regulating the activity of the meso-nucleus accumbens dopaminergic neurons but not that of the meso-cortical dopaminergic neurons.
