We previously showed that electrical stimulation of the nucleus locus coeruleus resulted 4 weeks later in greatly improved performance in the acquisition and extinction of a food-reinforced operant task. To ascertain whether adrenergic receptors of particular brain regions were involved in this long term behavioral modification, we studied the characteristics of alpha 1, and alpha 2 and beta-binding sites after stimulation of the locus coeruleus. In the first experiment these characteristics were studied, 4 weeks after treatment, in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and the brainstem. Neither the number, nor the affinity of beta-receptors ([125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites) was modified in any brain region. A significant increase in the number of alpha 1-receptors ([3H]prazosin binding sites) was observed in the cortex (62%). The number of alpha 2-receptors, ([3H]yohimbine binding sites), was significantly increased in cortex (99%), hippocampus (33%) and hypothalamus (113%). No significant alteration of the alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta-adrenoceptors was observed in the brainstem. To investigate the time course of these adrenoceptor changes, the characteristics of alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta-adrenoceptors were studied 2 weeks after stimulation using the same ligands and in the same brain regions. The only significant modifications observed were an increase of the alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the cortex (19.4%) and in the hypothalamus (54%). Furthermore, in both experiments, the increase in the number of alpha 1 and alpha 2-receptors was associated with a significant decrease in affinity. These results are discussed in relation to our previous behavioral and pharmacological findings.
