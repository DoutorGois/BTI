To detect stress responses of the brain to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), we investigated the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) and hsp70 mRNA by in situ hybridization. Experimental SAH was produced in 49 rats by endovascular penetration. We also monitored the intracranial pressure (ICP) changes. The genes c-fos and c-jun were induced in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and dentate gyrus in the penetrated side. mRNA coding for hsp70 was induced in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and caudoputamen in the penetrated side and extended to the contralateral hemisphere. IEGs in the cerebral cortex were completely blocked by MK-801 pretreatment, but hsp70 mRNA was not. This suggests that the expression of IEGs correlates with spreading depression. The IEGs and hsp70 expression may reflect the severity of SAH impact and relate to the mechanisms of symptomatic vasospasm.
