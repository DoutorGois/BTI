The subiculum (Sub) as a part of the hippocampal formation is thought to play a functional role in learning and memory. In addition to its major input from CA1 pyramidal cells, the subiculum receives input from the entorhinal cortex (EC) via the temporoammonic pathway. Thus far, synaptic plasticity in the subiculum was mainly investigated at CA1-Sub synapses. According to their spiking pattern, pyramidal cells in the subiculum were classified as bursting cells and non-bursting cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that subicular bursting cells show input-specific forms of long-term potentiation (LTP). At CA1-Sub synapses, bursting cells have been shown to express a presynaptic NMDA receptor-dependent LTP that depends on the activation of a cAMP-PKA cascade (Wozny et al., Journal of Physiology 2008). In contrast, at EC-Sub synapses the induction of LTP in bursting cells shows a high induction-threshold and relies on the activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, postsynaptic depolarization and postsynaptic Ca(2+) influx. Each form of LTP is input-specific and fails to induce heterosynaptic plasticity. Taken together, our data suggest that distinct, input-specific mechanisms govern high frequency-induced LTP at subicular bursting cells' synapses.
