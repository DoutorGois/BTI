MT-III, a brain-specific member of the metallothionein gene family, binds zinc and may facilitate the storage of zinc in neurons. The distribution of MT-III mRNA within the adult brain was determined by solution and in situ hybridization and compared to that of MT-I mRNA. MT-III mRNA is particularly abundant within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and nuclei at base of the cerebellum. Transgenic mice generated using 11.5 kb of the mouse MT-III 5' flanking region fused to the E. coli lacZ gene express beta-galactosidase in many of the same regions identified by in situ hybridization. MT-III mRNA was present in readily identifiable neurons within the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum, and beta-galactosidase activity was localized to neurons throughout the brain, but not to glia, as determined by costaining with X-Gal and neural- and glia-specific antibodies. There is marked correspondence between the neurons that are rich in MT-III mRNA and those neurons that store zinc in their terminal vesicles. MT-III is found complexed with zinc in vivo and its expression in cultured cells leads to the intracellular accumulation of zinc and enhanced histochemical detection of zinc. These results are discussed in light of the possibility that MT-III may participate in the utilization of zinc as a neuromodulator.
