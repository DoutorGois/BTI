In rat hippocampal slices, BC 264 (0.1-1 microM), a highly potent and selective CCK-B agonist, was found to increase basal release of endogenous glutamate and aspartate but not that of GABA. The natural peptide cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) at 1 microM, induced the same effect. The selective CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260, completely reversed these responses, confirming that they are related to CCK-B receptor activation. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, the increase in excitatory amino acid release was completely abolished. In contrast to the basal release, the potassium evoked release of aspartate and glutamate was not modified by BC 264.
