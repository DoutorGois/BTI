Several works have shown that males and females differ in the ability to learn spatial locations in mazes. In this study, we used the Morris water maze to assess the acquisition of a spatial working memory (WM) task in adult male and female Wistar rats. The task consisted of a paired sample procedure made up of two daily identical trials, sample and retention. To study the oxidative metabolic activity of some brain limbic system regions after the WM task, we applied the cytochrome oxidase (COx) histochemistry. In addition to the experimental groups, free swimming control groups and untrained naive groups were added to explore the COx changes not specific to the learning process. Similar spatial performances were found between sexes as only one more sample and retention trials were needed in males to reduce the escape latencies significantly. Males showed decreased COx activity as compared to control groups in the medial prefrontal cortex (prelimbic and infralimbic regions) as well as in the lateral septum and dentate gyrus. Regarding females, an increase in COx activity was found in nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and supramammillary region in relation to control groups. Overall, these findings suggest that the acquisition of the spatial WM task is mediated by different subsystems in a sex-dependent manner that points to the hippocampus as the central structure in males whereas other structures would be central in females.
