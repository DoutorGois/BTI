We analyzed intracranial brain activity recorded from human participants during the performance of a working-memory task. We show that 6-13 Hz activity exhibits consistent phase across trials following experimental stimuli, and that this phase significantly differs between study and test stimuli. These findings suggest that oscillatory phase reflects the encoding-retrieval state of neural networks, supporting predictions of recent models of memory.[Hasselmo, M.E., Wyble, B.P., and Bodelon, C., 2002.
