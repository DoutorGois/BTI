Psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy are common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Pathological alterations in TLE are well characterised; however, neuropathologic data are relatively scale regarding the association between psychiatric diseases and epilepsy. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical data of 46 adult TLE patients with and without psychiatric co-morbidities and to correlate the data with hippocampal neuronal density and mossy fiber sprouting. Accordingly, patients were grouped as follows: TLE patients without history of psychiatric disorder (TLE, n=16), TLE patients with interictal psychosis (TLE+P, n=14), and TLE patients with major depression (TLE+D, n=16). Hippocampi from autopsies served as non-epileptic controls (n=10). TLE+P exhibited significantly diminished mossy fiber sprouting and decreased neuronal density in the entorhinal cortex when compared with TLE. TLE+P showed significantly poorer results in verbal memory tasks. TLE+D exhibited significantly increased mossy fiber sprouting length when compared with TLE and TLE+P. Further, a higher proportion of TLE+D and TLE+P presented secondarily generalised seizures than did TLE. Our results indicate that TLE patients with psychiatric disorders have distinct features when compared with TLE patients without psychiatric co-morbidities and that these changes may be involved in either the manifestation or the maintenance of psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy.
