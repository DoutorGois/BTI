Embryonic septal, striatal and habenular tissues were transplanted to adult hippocampi from which the native septal input had been removed. Cholinergic innervation of the host hippocampal formation was observed with each type of transplant. The pattern of innervation was comparable to the native cholinergic projection, suggesting that transmitter type is correlated with the pattern of innervation produced regardless of the origin of the innervating cells. The grafts differed, however, in their survival, their propensity to innervate the host, and the degree of innervation they produced.
