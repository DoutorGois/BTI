The expression of S100B and S100A6 mRNA in CA1 region of rat hippocampal sections was studied after tetanizing stimulation. The level of S100B expression increased 2-4-fold in comparison with the control after 30 min and gradually returned to the basal level 120 min after tetanization. The level of S100A6 mRNA was very low and did not change after tetanization.
