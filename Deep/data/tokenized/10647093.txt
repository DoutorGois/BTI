Inositol was reported to have effects in depression, panic disorder and OCD, and in animal models of depression and anxiety. The present study tested whether inositol treatment alters monoamine systems. Brain areas of rats pre-treated with acute or chronic inositol were analysed by HPLC for monoamines and their metabolites and compared to control animals. Inositol treatment had no significant effect on levels of monoamines, their metabolites, or turnover rates compared to controls.
