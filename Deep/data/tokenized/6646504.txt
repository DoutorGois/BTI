The present report documents the influence of temperature (T) on kindling, i.e. the acquisition of an epileptic focus through localized low voltage electrical stimulation, In the frog hippocampal cortex. Kindling cannot be induced if T is lowered from 18.0 degrees C to just 17.0 degrees C. The possible mechanisms underlying this T threshold are briefly discussed.
