The model neurotic state in rats was formed within 1 month by the method of "conflict of afferent excitations". Piracetam and N-acetyl aspartic acid in doses of 250 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, administered intraperitoneally daily for the last 7 days of the experiment prevented the amnesia of the passive avoidance habit, which is typical of the developed abnormality in 60 and 40% of the rats, respectively (p < 0.05). The neurotic state was characterized by a significant increase of contents of inhibitory amino acids GABA and glycine in the brain cortex, GABA and glutamate in the hippocampus. Piracetam caused inversely directed changes of these parameters in the neuroticized animals.
