Intravenous administration of [(3)H]lysergic acid diethylamide(LSD) to rats resulted in accumulation of the drug in the brain within 15 minutes. Autoradiographic methods were used to differentiate free and bound [(3)H]LSD in brain tissue. Free [(3)H]LSD was generally distributed in the pituitary and pineal glands, cerebellum, hippocampus,and choroid plexus. Bound [(3)H]LSD was localized in neurons of the cortex, caudate nucleus, midbrain, and medulla,as well as in choroid plexus epithelium.
