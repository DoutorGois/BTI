Male mice treated with MPTP or vehicle were tested for their ability to demonstrate a memory-recognition response as evaluated in a habituation-dishabituation task. Treatment with MPTP severely disrupted the male's habituation-dishabituation response profile compared to vehicle treated animals. Administration of L-DOPA at 45 min prior to behavioral testing in MPTP animals restored their performance on the habituation-dishabituation test to levels observed in vehicle treated animals. There was also a tendency for L-DOPA to produce enhanced responsiveness in vehicle treated animals. Mice treated with MPTP had significantly reduced concentrations of norepinephrine within the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. Vehicle treated mice administered L-DOPA had significantly increased dopamine concentrations within the corpus striatum. These results suggest that, in addition to its putative effects upon the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system and motor behavior, MPTP is also exerting substantial effects upon other systems. In particular, the noradrenergic system and its potential involvement with memory/recognition processes in the CD-1 mouse appears to be very sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of MPTP.
