A local pathological inert motor reaction, involving a forced flexion of the forepaw, was formed after simultaneous stimulation with NaCl solution of a part of the tongue brought out to the cheek and electrical stimulation of the forepaw. The reaction decreased (by 70 to 80%) after electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus (beyond CA3). At the same time the animal's emotional stress diminished, as evidenced by the reduced heart rate and a reduced theta-rhythm in the hippocampus.
