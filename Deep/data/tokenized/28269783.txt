Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients suffer a disturbance in the balance between synaptic (GluN2A, mediating the protective pathway) and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (GluN2B, mediating the excitotoxic pathway), and, therefore, restoring the balance of GluN2A and GluN2B should be beneficial for AD. In this study, the GluN2B-selective antagonist, ifenprodil, and the non-selective NMDAR agonist, NMDA, had little effect on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced long-term potentiation deficits. Enhancing the activity of GluN2A had a protective effect against Abeta, and specific activation of GluN2A and inhibition of GluN2B showed a better protective effect. In Abeta ICV-injected animals, the combination of ifenprodil and D-cycloserine (a co-activator of NMDRs similar to D-serine) led to greater improvement in behavior tests (nest building, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze) than ifenprodil (Morris water maze) or D-cycloserine (nest building) alone. Signal pathway analysis showed that Abeta disturbed the GluN2A/GluN2B-related pathway. The ratio of GluN2A to GluN2B decreased in Abeta-treated animals, and TORC dephosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation, which could be initiated by GluN2A, also decreased in the hippocampal tissues of Abeta-treated animals. As a result, the activation of CREB and the content of brain-derived BDNF decreased. The combination of ifenprodil and D-cycloserine reversed the signal pathway more significantly than ifenprodil or D-cycloserine alone, indicating that Abeta-induced toxicology was mediated both by functionally inhibiting GluN2A and enhancing GluN2B. These results indicate that enhancing synaptic NMDARs and inhibiting extrasynaptic NMDARs concurrently showed protective effects against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity, suggesting that modulation of the balance between GluN2A and GluN2B could be a potential strategy for AD drug development and therapy.
