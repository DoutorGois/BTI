We studied changes in the levels of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters in female rat brain structures during different phases of the estrous cycle in health and after creation of a cobalt epileptogenic focus at stage I of epileptogenic system development. The most pronounced shifts were found in the contralateral cortex, where the levels of GABA and glycine decreased significantly during the diestrus-2 phase (corresponding to menstruation), which attests to a convulsive threshold decrease during this period.
