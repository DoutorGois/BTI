Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been implicated in antiepileptic action in different in vivo and in vitro epilepsy models in rats and mice. Both Y2 and Y5 receptors could mediate the seizure-suppressant effect of NPY. However, lack of selective ligands precluded previous studies from conclusively evaluating the role of Y5 receptors in anti-epileptiform action of NPY. In the present study, using the new highly selective Y5 receptor antagonist, CGP71683A, and agonist, [cPP]hPP, we show that the Y5 receptor subtype is centrally involved in NPY-induced suppression of spontaneous epileptiform (interictaform) bursting in the CA3 area of rat hippocampal slices. This novel finding underscores the importance of Y5 receptors as a potential target for future antiepileptic therapy, particularly, for interictal components of temporal lobe epilepsy.
