A voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) was used for quantitative analysis of parahippocampal atropy with 1.5-tesla (T) MRI in a voxel-wise manner. The analysis of images acquired under a different imaging condition provides an error factor that has a calculated value. Clinical application of 3T-MRI is necessary for establishing a normal data base (N-DB) specific for 3T-MRI data, which permits appropriate application of VSRAD. We established an N-DB specific for 3T-MRI for use in VSRAD. The "Z-score of the parahippocampal gyrus" was 0.79 +/- 0.32, and the N-DB of each age group did not have a big deflection when we analyzed a group of physically unimpaired persons in an N-DB specific for 3T-MRI. Therefore, we were able to confirm the validity of the customized N-DB. The "Z-score of the parahippocampal gyrus" was 1.62 +/- 0.47 for the N-DB of VSRAD. The numerical value was high for the group of physically unimpaired persons.
