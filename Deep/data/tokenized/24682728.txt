Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for the proper development of mammalian central nervous system. TH deficiency during the critical period of brain development results in permanent cognitive and neurological impairments. Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family play a key role in the regulation of cellular functions in the nervous system. Alteration of PKC can be involved in the pathogenesis of neuronal disorders. This review details recent progress made in determining the roles played by PKC isoforms in developing hypothyroid rat brain. Evidence indicates that hippocampus down-regulation of PKCbeta and PKCgamma may be related to impaired learning and memory observed in perinatal hypothyroid rats. Enhanced PKCalpha activity in neonatal hypothyroid brain may bring about oxidative stress and cause brain damage. The activated pro-apoptotic PKCs including PKCdelta can cause extensive apoptosis in the hypothyroid rat brain.
