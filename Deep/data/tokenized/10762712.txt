Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel non-invasive method with anti-depressant properties. However, the mechanism of activation on the cellular level is unknown. Twelve hours after the last chronic rTMS treatment (14 days, once per day, 20 Hz, 10 s, 75% machine output, the transcription factor c-fos was markedly increased in neurons in layers I-IV and VI of the parietal cortex and in few scattered neurons in the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats. The cortical activation was not blocked by the NMDA antagonist MK-801. The increase of c-fos was not paralleled by an increased glial response and activation of cortical growth factors. Thus, it is concluded that chronic rTMS differentially activates parietal cortical layers and this might be involved in mediating anti-depressant activity in other brain areas.
