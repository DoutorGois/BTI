Brain endothelial ultrastructural properties contribute to maintain proper blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Several physiological and pathological conditions have been shown to alter BBB permeability to blood-borne molecules, acute and chronic stress among them. In the rat, early life stress increased transvascular transport of Evans blue, however, the route of tracer extravasation is not fully known; therefore the aim of the present experiment was to describe the ultrastructural changes in endothelial cells subsequent to chronic perinatal stress in order to ascertain the route for transvascular transport of an electrodense tracer. Pregnant Wistar rats and their litters were used. Four pregnant rats were subjected to forced swimming between gestational days 10 to 20. After delivery, half of the control litters underwent 180 min maternal separation from postnatal day 2 to 20. Controls were kept free of any stress manipulation. At sacrifice between postnatal days 1 to 30 subjects were given intracardially the lectin wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP). WGA-HRP stained hippocampi were processed for ultrastructural analysis, transmission electron micrographs were obtained and endothelial ultrastructural parameters quantified using the ImageJ software. Both stress procedures accelerated gross microvessel development by decreasing capillary wall thickness and endothelial microvilli. However, early-life stress also neutralized endothelial glycocalyx, increased vesicle-mediated transport and tended to promote the formation of secondary lysosomes containing endocytosed WGA-HRP vesicles, all parameters of altered endothelial cell function. Tight junction development in both stress groups was similar to the control pups.
