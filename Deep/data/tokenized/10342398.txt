The effects of enriched environment on short-term memory for event durations and on astrocytes (cell density, cell area and % of GFAP immunoreactivity) in hippocampus (Hi), frontal cortex (FC) and corpus callosum (CC) were analysed in old rats housed from weaning to the end of behavioural testing (23 months) either in standard (SC) or in enriched (EC) conditions and in young adults (5 months) all housed in SC. Old SC and EC and young SC rats trained (for 2 months) or not, in a Symbolic Delayed Matching to Sample Task, had to discriminate and remember two (2- and 10-s) signals after short retention intervals. Results confirm the aging-related acquisition and memory deficit. EC reduced the slowness of acquisition, reversed the short-term memory deficit and promoted the retention of the short signal (choose short effect). Old SC naive rats had many hypertrophied astrocytes with long processes in Hi and CC while old EC rats had decreased astrocytes number and size. The behavioural testing resulted in young adult SC rats in Hi and CC, in increased astrocytes number, size and GFAP% and in their decrease in old SC rats. EC and testing have additive effects (very low astrocytes number, size and GFAP%) to compensate for the aging-induced gliosis, mostly in Hi.
