We stimulated the dorsal hippocampus of the rat with 2 Hz electrical stimulation to induce kindling seizures. As we reported previously using cats, pulse-number threshold (PNT), the number of stimulating-pulses required for the triggering of epileptic afterdischarge, decreased profoundly in the initial stage of the kindling process and the behavioral seizure stage (BSS) developed in the later stage. After the completion of kindling, a 4 week interval elevated PNT significantly compared to the value at the completion of kindling, whereas BSS showed no regression. These results suggest that there are two types of neuroplasticities which are independent of each other in the kindling phenomenon, one is the early-short type which is involved in the susceptibility of epileptic focus in hippocampus and the other is the late-long type which is involved in the full propagation of kindled seizures to the extra-limbic area.
