Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) regulates neuronal excitability. We investigated whether alterations in the level of TNFalpha occur at a time point that precedes the reported seizure-associated hyperexcitability of hippocampal networks in pre-plaque models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Western blot and ELISA experiments indicated a significant increase in hippocampal TNFalpha expression in 1-month-old TgCRND8 mice that correlated with levels of the beta-C-terminal fragment (betaCTF) of amyloid-beta protein precursor. CD11b labeling indicated changes in microglial morphology toward an activated state, suggesting that these cells may be a putative source of the observed TNFalpha increase during this pre-symptomatic stage of AD-like pathology.
