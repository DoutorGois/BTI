Cognitive models suggest that memory consists of potentially independent modules. In addition, clinical data lead to a reference to the central systems that interact with these operative modules, and which assign significance and pertinence to the information being processed. Such an organization fits better with clinical data, since it can be demonstrated with the example of episodic or procedural memories as both require the activation of strategic processes, under the control of the prefrontal cortex, needed for the organization or the control of the information to be processed.
