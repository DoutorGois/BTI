We have isolated a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan from mouse brain by affinity chromatography with a fragment of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin-R (TN-R) that comprises the amino-terminal cysteine-rich stretch and the 4.5 epidermal growth factor-like repeats. The isolated chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan has a molecular mass of 500-600 kDa and carries the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope. Treatment with chondroitinase ABC reveals a major band of approximately 400 kDa and two minor bands at 200 and 150 kDa. Immunoblot analysis relates the molecule to phosphacan but not to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans neurocan and versican. Binding of the phosphacan-related molecule to the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of TN-R is Ca2+-dependent. Co-localization of the molecule with TN-R in the retina and optic nerve by immunocytochemistry suggests a functional relationship between the two molecules in vivo. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth from hippocampal neurons by the phosphacan-related molecule in vitro is neutralized by TN-R when coated as a uniform substrate. Furthermore, the phosphacan-related molecule neutralizes growth cone repulsion induced by TN-R coated as a sharp substrate boundary with or without prior treatment with chondroitinase ABC. These observations indicate that TN-R can interact with a phosphacan-related molecule and thereby modulate its inhibitory influence on neuritogenesis.
