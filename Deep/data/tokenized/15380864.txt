We studied the effects of the active neurosteroid (ANS) allotetrahydrodeoxy corticosterone (ATHDOC) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of intact, urethane anesthetized rats. Intravenous injection of the hormone at two doses, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg, produced a significant decrease in both components of the response: excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) and population spikes (PS). The effects were similar for the two doses. The results are discussed in terms of the potential mechanism by which ATHDOC modulates neural processes associated with symptoms present in depression syndromes.
