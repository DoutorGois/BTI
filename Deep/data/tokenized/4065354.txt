Epileptic events can be produced in in vitro brain slices after perfusion with convulsant agents such as penicillin or picrotoxin. These events consist of one or more synchronized neuronal bursts. In this experimental system, epileptic events occur because of blockade of synaptic inhibition by the convulsant agent. A sparse network of excitatory synaptic interconnections in the hippocampus serves to synchronize a population of neurons, each of which is capable of bursting after appropriate stimulation.
