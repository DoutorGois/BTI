AIM: To investigate the effect of magnesium ion (Mg2+) on neuronic damage induced by 0.1 mmol/L glutamic acid. METHODS: The neurons isolated from hippocampus in rats were cultured for 6-9 days, and then randomly divided into three groups: A. medium alone. B. medium + glutamic acid. C. medium+ Mg2+, and + glutamic acid (30 min late). RESULTS: (1) DAs compared with A group, the survival rate of hippocampal neurons in B group was remarkably decreased in dose dependent mauner. (2) In contrast to B group, when the concentration of Mg2+ was lower, the survival rates of hippocampal neurons in C group was significantly increased. CONCLUSION: Mg2+ in lower concentration could protect hippocampal neurons from damage induced by glutamic acid.
