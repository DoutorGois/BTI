Female Wistar rats weighing 200 g were implanted with cortical electrodes and two intraventricular cannulae. Five days later they were given 3H-thymidine and exposed to shuttle-box training for four hours. They were then left free to sleep in the following three hours during which their EEG activity was recorded. In comparison with control animals (C), learning (L) and non-learning (NL) rats exhibited an increase in SS. In comparison to the EEG recording made the previous day, all animal groups displayed an increase in SS, but only NL rats suffered a decrease in PS(%). The specific radioactivity of DNA measured in several brain regions was tendentially lower in NL rats, but significance was achieved only in the cerebellum in the comparison between NL rats and C rats. No change occurred in liver. More marked and significant decrements in the DNA specific radioactivity of all brain regions were observed in the subgroup of NL rats displaying relatively high values of PS time in comparison to the analogous subgroups of C and L animals. Comparable decrements were present with regard to the subgroup of NL rats endowed with relatively low PS time. Less widespread and more limited changes were observed in the concentration of acid-soluble radioactivity. In addition, several significant correlations were detected by Spearman's analysis among behavioral, biochemical and sleep parameters. The results are consistent with the interpretation that the selective decrease in brain radioactive DNA observed in NL rats reflects a loss of DNA synthesized during the training period. The loss is related to the amount of post-training PS and is associated to a lengthening of the mean duration of PS episodes. It may be concluded that the loss of newly-synthesized brain DNA reflects the elimination of molecules associated with neural information devoid of adaptive value.
