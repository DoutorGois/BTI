The effect of chronic ethanol treatment (CET) for 21-26 weeks on the neurotrophic activity contained in the rat hippocampus (HPC) was determined with a bioassay in cultures of dissociated dorsal root ganglion cells (DRG) obtained from E7-8 chick embryos. Extracts of the HPC from CET or pair-fed control rats were used as experimental media, and neuronal survival and neurite-outgrowth of DRG cultures were determined. Both neuronal survival (-25%) and neurite-outgrowth (-50%) were reduced in the presence of HPC extracts from CET rats relative to controls. These data suggest that CET reduces the neurotrophic content of the HPC which may result in damage to septohippocampal neurons.
