Dopamine D1-like receptors, composed of D1 and D5 receptors, have been documented to modulate glutamate-mediated fast excitatory synaptic neurotransmission. Here, we report that dopamine D1 receptors modulate NMDA glutamate receptor-mediated functions through direct protein-protein interactions. Two regions in the D1 receptor carboxyl tail can directly and selectively couple to NMDA glutamate receptor subunits NR1-1a and NR2A. While one interaction is involved in the inhibition of NMDA receptor-gated currents, the other is implicated in the attenuation of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity through a PI-3 kinase-dependent pathway.
