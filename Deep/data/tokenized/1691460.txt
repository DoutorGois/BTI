In order to study the morphological localization of the endogenous benzodiazepine ligand octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) in rat brain, we have developed antibodies against this peptide. Using a radioimmunoassay for ODN, we have observed that synthetic ODN and serial dilutions of several brain areas gave parallel displacement curves. By light microscope immunocytochemistry, ODN-immunoreactive material was only detected in glial and ependymal cells. Immunolabelled cells were found in high concentrations in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebral cortex and the circumventricular organs. In the cerebellar cortex, immunostaining was associated with Bergmann cells. The studies performed at the electron microscopic level confirmed the association of immunoreactive material with glial and ependymal cells. The present results suggest that ODN might play a role in the function of glial cells which have been shown to contain benzodiazepine receptors of the "peripheral type".
