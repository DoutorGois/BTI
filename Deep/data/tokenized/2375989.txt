Muscarinic autoreceptors of the M2 subclass were examined in rat forebrain using a number of different methodologies, including receptor autoradiography and image analysis, regulation of acetylcholine release, phosphoinositide turnover, low-Km GTP hydrolysis, and behavioral analysis. The relatively minor population of M2 receptors in coronal sections was visualized by autoradiography and image analysis using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in the presence of a concentration of pirenzepine that blocked most of M1 (and M4) receptors. The highest densities of M2 receptors in forebrain regions were found in the outer layers of the cortex, CA1 region of the hippocampus and striatum. The M2-, but not M1-selective antagonists were able to block the oxotremorine-induced attenuation of acetylcholine release in forebrain synaptosomes. Low concentrations of the M2-selective antagonist gallamine increased phosphoinositide turnover, which is thought to be an M1 postsynaptic response in the forebrain, in brain slices by a Ca2(+)-dependent mechanism. The M2-selective agonist oxotremorine produced a substantial stimulation of low-Km GTPase in cortical membranes, suggesting that M2 forebrain receptors are efficiently coupled to G-proteins in the cortex. Behavioral signs of cholinergic stimulation were observed after intracerebroventricular injections of M2-, but not M1-selective antagonists. It is suggested that a minor population of forebrain M2 receptors regulates acetylcholine release by a mechanism that includes coupling through G-proteins presynaptically at synapses for which the postsynaptic response involves phosphoinositide turnover. Selective blockade of these receptors produces both biochemical and behavioral signs of acetylcholine release.
