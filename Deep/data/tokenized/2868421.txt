Effect of glutamate, aspartate and GABA on antidromic population spike was examined in isolated hippocampal slices separately in the region of somata and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The sensitivity of somata and apical dendrites to glutamate and aspartate was equal. The action of these drugs was never accompanied by desensitization. The sensitivity to GABA was higher in the dendrites then in the somata. The somata showed strong desensitization to GABA. In distal dendrites desensitization to GABA was absent.
