OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Redox factor-1(Ref-1) in rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: AD rat model was established by a single injection of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta25-35) into the lateral cerebral ventricle of rats. Y-shape maze task was conducted to check the ethology. At 4th, 7th and 14th day after injection, Ref-1 expression in hippocampus CA1 area was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULT: The numbers of repeated learning and error and the total reaction time in AD group were significantly higher than those in control group at 7th and 14th day after injection of Abeta25-35 (P<0.05). At 4th day after injection of Abeta25-35, the Ref-1 expression was increased with time prolongation in AD group(P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Injection of Abeta25-35 in lateral cerebral ventricle can decrease the learning and memory abilities of rats, and results also indicate that Ref-1 expression in hippocampus may be involved in the development of AD.
