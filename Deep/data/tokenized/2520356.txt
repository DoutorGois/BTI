The search for new and selective neurotoxins has attracted several efforts in the recent years. Convulxin, a neurotoxin isolated from the Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, was reported to elicit convulsions upon intravenous injection in mice and cats. Therefore we have studied the behavioral, electroencephalographic and neuropathological effects of convulxin when microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus of rats. To test the hypothesis that substances released by convulxin from platelets and not convulxin itself is the convulsive agent, we injected a mixture of convulxin and platelet rich plasma. Results demonstrated that neither convulxin nor convulxin/platelet rich plasma exhibited neurotoxic effects upon intrahippocampal injection.
