Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (iba-1) is specifically expressed in microglia and plays an important role in the regulation of the function of microglia. We observed chronological changes of iba-1-immunoreactive cells and iba-1 level in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region after transient ischemia. Transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils was induced by the occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries for 5 min. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of iba-1 were performed in the gerbil ischemic hippocampus. In the sham-operated group, iba-1-immunoreactive cells were detected in the CA1 region. Thirty minutes after ischemia/reperfusion, iba-1 immunoreactivity significantly increased, and its immunoreactive cells were well ramified. Three hours after ischemia/reperfusion, iba-1 immunoreactivity and level decreased, and thereafter they increased again with time after ischemia/reperfusion. Three days after ischemia/reperfusion, iba-1-immunoreactive cells had well-ramified processes, which projected to the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region. Seven days after ischemia/reperfusion, iba-1 immunoreactivity and level were highest in the CA1 region, whereas they significantly decreased in the CA1 region 10 days after ischemia/reperfusion. Iba-1-immunoreactive cells in the ischemic CA1 region were co-localized with OX-42, a microglia marker. In brief, iba-1-immunoreactive cells change morphologically and iba-1 immunoreactivity alters in the CA1 region with time after ischemia/reperfusion. These may be associated with the delayed neuronal death of CA1 pyramidal cells in the gerbil ischemic hippocampus.
