The processes underlying long-term memory formation in the neocortex are poorly understood. Using taste learning, we found learning-related induction of PSD-95 in the gustatory cortex, which was temporally restricted, coupled to the learning of a novel, but not familiar, taste and controlled by ERK. Using temporally and spatially restricted RNA interference knockdown of PSD-95 in vivo, we found that PSD-95 induction is necessary for learning novel tastes, but not for the recollection of familiar ones.
