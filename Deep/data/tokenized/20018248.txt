The GABA(A)R alpha4 subunit is highly expressed in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus at predominantly extra synaptic locations where, along with the GABA(A)R delta subunit, it forms GABA(A) receptors that mediate a tonic inhibitory current. The present study was designed to test hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent learning and memory in GABA(A)R alpha4 subunit-deficient mice using trace and delay fear conditioning, respectively. Mice were of a mixed C57Bl/6J X 129S1/X1 genetic background from alpha4 heterozygous breeding pairs. The alpha4-knockout mice showed enhanced trace and contextual fear conditioning consistent with an enhancement of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory. These enhancements were sex-dependent, similar to previous studies in GABA(A)R delta knockout mice, but differences were present in both males and females. The convergent findings between alpha4 and delta knockout mice suggests that tonic inhibition mediated by alpha4betadelta GABA(A) receptors negatively modulates learning and memory processes and provides further evidence that tonic inhibition makes important functional contributions to learning and behavior.
