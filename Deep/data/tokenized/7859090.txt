Recently developed antisera selective for angiotensin Type 2 (AT2) receptors were used to localize AT2 receptors in rat brain by immunohistochemistry. While the results from these experiments were largely consistent with previous autoradiographic and radioligand binding analyses of AT2 receptor populations in brain, there were also some notable differences in the distribution of immunoreactivity. More specifically, in agreement with previous studies, AT2 antisera detected apparent receptor populations in the locus coeruleus and the bed nucleus of the accessory olfactory tract, whereas AT2 receptor-immunoreactivity in the cerebellum was primarily associated with the Purkinje cell layer and the deep cerebellar nuclei rather than the molecular layer as has been previously reported in autoradiographic studies. Other regions with prominent immune-staining included all subfields of the hippocampus, which had been previously reported to contain exclusively AT1 receptors. Limbic structures such as the amygdala, thalamic areas such as the rhomboid thalamic nucleus, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, hypothalamic areas such as the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and the supraoptic nucleus also exhibited prominent AT2-immunoreactivity. In the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, AT2 receptor staining appeared to be associated primarily with the magnocellular neurons. In all regions examined, AT2 receptor immunoreactivity was associated with the cytoplasm and cell membrane and was not localized within the nucleus. Collectively, these results confirm and extend the neuroanatomical resolution of previous autoradiographic studies as well as identify new AT2 receptor populations in rat brain.
