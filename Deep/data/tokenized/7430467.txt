Two experiments using contingently reinforced T-maze alternation with rats found that (a) normal rats, after achieving high accuracy in alternation with brief (0 sec) intertrial intervals (ITIs), dropped to chance levels with longer ITIs (90 sec) but reacquired effective alternation with additional practice; (b) small lesions in mediodorsal pregenual cortex had no effect on postoperative retention of alternation at either short or long ITIs; (c) contrariwise, small lesions in posterodorsal septum temporarily disrupted alternation at brief ITIs whereas at long ITIs animals chose randomly and never recovered; and (d) large lesions in medial frontal cortex disrupted retention of alternation at brief ITIs of 10 sec but significant recovery did occur with additional experience. Implications regarding task difficulty and locus of lesion for recovery of function are discussed.
