Reactive gliosis is a prominent morphological feature of temporal lobe epilepsy. The molecular mechanisms underlying glial cell activation remain unclear. We examined expression of Id1-3 protein, a family of helix--loop--helix proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation, in glial cells after electrically induced status epilepticus (SE) in the rat. In control hippocampus, Id3 was weakly expressed in astrocytes, while Id1-2 were below detection level. After SE, Id1-3 protein expression increased markedly in reactive astrocytes within 1 day and this persisted up to 3 weeks after SE. Three months after SE when rats experience spontaneous seizures, Id expression had returned to control levels. These results support a role of the Id gene family in regulating astrocyte reactivity in epileptic tissue.
