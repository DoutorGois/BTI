Ten min forebrain ischemia/1-day reperfusion resulted in significant decreases in total phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), and cardiolipin in gerbil hippocampus. CDP-choline restored cardiolipin levels, arachidonic acid content of PtdCho, partially but significantly restored total PtdCho, and had no effect on PtdIns. These data suggest that CDP-choline prevented the activation of phospholipase A(2) (rather than inhibiting phospholipase A(2) activity) but did not affect activities of PtdCho-phospholipases C and/or D, or phosphoinositide-phospholipase C. CDP-choline also provided significant protection for hippocampal CA(1) neurons.
