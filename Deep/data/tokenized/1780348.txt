Performances of male rats of the Roman High- (RHA), Roman Control- (RCA) and Roman Low- (RLA) Avoidance strains were compared in two working memory tests, a spatial one, the radial maze, and a nonspatial one, an object recognition test. The same rats were subjected to measures of emotional reactivity and of different forms of motor activity and finally to measures of cholinergic and aminergic activities in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum. Compared to RHA, RLA performed better in the two working memory tests, displayed "anxiety" and had also lower levels of exploratory locomotor activity. Hippocampal ChAT activity was higher in RLA than in RHA. Levels of DA and DOPAC in the striatum were higher in RLA compared to RHA, whereas in the frontal cortex they were lower. For most of these measures, RCA were intermediate between RLA and RHA. These results confirm and extend the finding that the Roman strains are not only a genetic model for two-way avoidance conditioning but also for working memory.
