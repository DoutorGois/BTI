Using targeted mouse mutants and pharmacologic inhibition of alphaCaMKII, we demonstrate that the alphaCaMKII protein, but not its activation, autophosphorylation or its ability to phosphorylate synapsin I, is required for normal short-term presynaptic plasticity. Furthermore, alphaCaMKII regulates the number of docked vesicles independent of its ability to be activated. These results indicate that alphaCaMKII has a nonenzymatic role in short-term presynaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses.
