To investigate the effects of stress on c-fos mRNA expression, rats were submitted to forced immobilization for 15, 30, 60 or 120 min before sacrifice. In situ hybridization was performed on sections containing the dorsal hippocampus with a 32P-labelled 50-base oligonucleotide probe (10(7)-10(9) cpm/micrograms) complementary to nucleotides 370-319 of rat c-fos. Forced restraint induced a time-dependent increase in c-fos mRNA expression which was most pronounced in the dentate gyrus and CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampal formation, and which peaked after 30 min of immobilization (72.7 +/- 1.0 vs 24.1 +/- 0.8 cpm/mm2 in unrestrained animals). A positive but weaker signal was also detected in the amygdala, pyriform cortex and other parts of the cerebral cortex and habenulae. These results suggest that the hippocampal formation is activated during stress.
