Lectin affinity chromatography is a powerful separation technique that fractionates proteins by selectively binding to specific carbohydrate moieties characteristic of protein glycosylation type. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) selectively binds terminal N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) and sialic acid moieties characteristic of O-linked glycosylation. The current study utilizes WGA affinity chromatography to fractionate proteins from hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) from subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and arguably its earliest form, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Proteins identified by proteomics that were fractionated from MCI and AD hippocampus by WGA affinity chromatography with altered levels compared with age-matched controls included GP96, gamma-enolase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glucosidase IIalpha, 14-3-3, 14-3-3gamma, 14-3-3zeta, tropomyosin-2, calmodulin 2, gelsolin, beta-synuclein, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and dimethylguanosine tRNA methyltransferase. Proteins identified by proteomics that were fractionated from MCI and AD IPL by WGA affinity chromatography showing altered levels compared with age-matched controls included protein disulfide isomerase, calreticulin, and GP96. The proteins described in this study are involved in diverse processes, including glucose metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions, chaperoning, cytoskeletal assembly, and proteolysis, all of which are affected in AD. This study, the first to use proteomics to identify WGA-fractionated proteins isolated from brains from subjects with MCI and AD, provides additional information about the active proteome of the brain throughout AD progression.
