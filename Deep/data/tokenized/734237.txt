Distribution of orally administered methaqualone-14C (25 mg/kg) in several rat brain areas was examined. Peak concentration attained at 1.5 hr. Among brain areas, highest concentration was measured in pineal gland (8.2 microgram/g). MTQ levels in the cortex, pituitary, hypothalamus and hippocampus ranged from 3 to 3.5 microgram/g, those in the mid-brain, medulla-pons, striatum and cerebellum from 2 to 2.5 microgram/g. Significant amounts of MTQ in all brain regions were still present at 3 hr. These results indicate that MTQ was somewhat uniformly distributed in various brain regions as a result of its lipophilic nature.
