White matter changes have been investigated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in a number of studies using diffusion imaging. Fewer studies have investigated dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution (0.3 mm in-plane) coronal 3T MRI of the medial temporal lobe in 16 subjects with AD, 16 with DLB and 16 similarly aged healthy subjects. We found increased mean diffusivity in the temporal lobe of AD, and reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in a small cluster in the right postcentral gyrus region in the DLB group. Mean FA in this cluster correlated with UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale) motor score. We had previously reported reduced visibility in the AD group of a dark appearing layer of the hippocampus in the high-resolution images. In an SPM analysis on all subjects, there were significant clusters of reduced FA in the corpus callosum, fornix and stria terminalis that correlated with the visual rating of the hippocampus. These results suggest that changes to the hippocampus are associated with structural changes to the white matter fibres of the hippocampus output, and that changes in motor function are associated with changes in white matter underlying somatosensory cortex.
