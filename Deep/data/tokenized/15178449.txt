Nestin-expressing neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have been isolated from hippocampus of brains and propagated with epidermal growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). However, the underlying signaling mechanisms regulating NPC proliferation remain elusive. Here we showed that neuregulinbeta1 (NRG), like bFGF, effectively promoted the proliferation of hippocampus-derived NPCs and maintained the progenitor states of NPCs. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC), a downstream effector of phospholipase C (PLC), with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) mimicked the NRG-induced proliferation of NPCs. The synergic effect of TPA plus NRG on neurosphere growth further prompted us to find that NRG induced NPC propagation through PLC/PKC signaling pathway. ErbB4, an important functional receptor of NRG, had an interaction with PLCgamma1 protein. In addition, inactivation of PLC pathway led to severe proliferative suppression of NPCs. Our study suggests that activation of PLC/PKC pathway plays an essential role in the NRG-induced proliferation of hippocampus-derived NPCs.
