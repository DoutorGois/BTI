The olfactory bulbectomized (OB) rat is a well-accepted animal model of depression. The present magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation demonstrates alterations in signal intensities in cortical, hippocampal, caudate and amygdaloid regions in OB animals, but not in sham operated controls. Ventricular enlargement was also evident in OB animals. These alterations have implications with regard to the face and construct validity of this model.
