OBJECT: The surface of the developing fetal brain undergoes significant morphological changes during fetal growth. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the morphological development of the brain sulci from the fetal to the early postnatal period. METHODS: Two hundred fourteen brain hemispheres from 107 human brain specimens were examined to evaluate the timing of sulcal formation, from its appearance to its complete development. These brains were obtained from cadavers ranging in age from 12 weeks of gestation to 8 months of postnatal life. RESULTS: The order of appearance of the cerebral sulci, and the number and percentages of specimens found in this study were as follows: longitudinal cerebral fissure at 12 weeks (10/10, 100%); callosal sulcus at 12 weeks (10/10, 100%); hippocampal sulcus at 15 weeks (7/10, 70%); lateral sulcus at 17 weeks (20/22, 90.9%); circular insular sulcus at 17 weeks (18/22, 81.8%); olfactory sulcus at 17 weeks (18/22, 81.8%); calcarine sulcus at 17 weeks (14/22, 63.6%); parietooccipital sulcus at 17 weeks (11/22, 50%); cingulate sulcus at 19 weeks (16/20, 80%); central sulcus at 21 weeks (22/38, 57.9%); orbital sulcus at 22 weeks (9/16, 56.2%); lunate sulcus at 24 +/- 2 weeks (12/16, 75%); collateral sulcus at 24 +/- 2 weeks (8/16, 50%); superior frontal sulcus at 25 +/- 2 weeks (5/6, 83.3%); rhinal sulcus at 25 +/- 2 weeks (3/6, 50%); precentral sulcus at 26 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); postcentral sulcus at 26 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); superior temporal sulcus at 26 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); central insular sulcus at 29 +/- 2 weeks (4/4, 100%); intraparietal sulcus at 29 +/- 2 weeks (2/4, 50%); paraolfactory sulcus at 29 +/- 2 weeks (2/4, 50%); inferior frontal sulcus at 30 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); transverse occipital sulcus at 30 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); occipitotemporal sulcus at 30 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); marginal branch of the cingulate sulcus at 30 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); paracentral sulcus at 30 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); subparietal sulcus at 30 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%); inferior temporal sulcus at 31 +/- 3 weeks (3/6, 50%); transverse temporal sulcus at 33 +/- 3 weeks (6/8, 75%); and secondary sulcus at 38 +/- 3 weeks (2/4, 50%). CONCLUSIONS: The brain is subjected to considerable morphological changes throughout gestation. During fetal brain development the cortex begins to fold in, thereby increasing the cortical surface. All primary sulci are formed during fetal life. The appearance of each sulcus follows a characteristic timing pattern, which may be used as one of the reliable guides pertinent to gestational age and normal fetal development.
