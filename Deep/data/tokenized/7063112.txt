The steady state levels of acetylcholine and choline and the synthesis of acetylcholine in the hippocampus and striatum of rat brain have been determined after one-trial passive avoidance training. Steady state levels of acetylcholine and choline were not altered, but the rate of acetylcholine synthesis was significantly elevated in the striatum but not significantly elevated in the hippocampus at one hour after training.
