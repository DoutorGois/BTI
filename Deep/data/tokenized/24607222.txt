Two reports in this issue of Neuron, Hsieh et al. (2014) and Ezzyat and Davachi (2014), describe fMRI activity patterns in the human hippocampus that correlate with memory for temporal context. Analogous activity of neural ensembles recorded from the rodent hippocampus suggests a general model for remembering episodes.
