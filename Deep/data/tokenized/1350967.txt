1. Effects of structural philanthotoxin (PTX) analogues on the high affinity uptake of [3H]-L-glutamate by slices of the rat hippocampus were studied using light microscopy surface autoradiography. 2. Considering the various effects of the PTX-analogues it can be concluded that the presence of an aromatic nucleus in the molecule is an important moiety, while the number and distribution of positive charges in the polyamine chain seems to be of a still not understood importancy.
