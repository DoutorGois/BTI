Multiunit activity was recorded simultaneously in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus dorsalis CA 1 area, the nucleus locus coeruleus and the nucleus raphe dorsalis of encephale isole rats; drugs were injected intravenously in increasing doses. Chlordiazepoxide decreased multiunit activity dose-dependently to a similar extent in substantia nigra, hippocampus and dorsal raphe, but was less effective in the locus coeruleus. Midazolam reduced multiunit activity in all 4 nuclei to a similar degree and was more potent than chlordiazepoxide. Specific benzodiazepine antagonists completely reversed the effects of the two benzodiazepines. Pentobarbitone was a less potent depressant than chlordiazepoxide, and its effect was not reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788.
