Correlations between the morphology of beta-amyloid (A beta) deposits and the frequency with which they are associated with neurons and glial cells were studied in Down's syndrome. The diameter of diffuse deposits was positively correlated with the frequency of large (> 25 microns) neuronal cell bodies in the isocortex and with glial cells in the hippocampus. Diameters of primitive deposits were positively correlated with glial cells in the hippocampus and with glial cells and neurons in the isocortex. Staining intensity was positively correlated with glial cells especially in the hippocampus. The data suggest that: (i) diffuse deposits develop from neurons and primitive deposits from glia; (ii) the size of A beta deposits depends on the numbers of neurons and glia; (iii) glial cells are also involved in the conversion of A beta to amyloid; and (iv) the increased density of primitive deposits in the hippocampus is determined by the high density of glial cells.
