Neural stem cells (NSCs) are important in rehabilitation following stroke. Electroacupuncture (EA) treatment has been observed to promote the recovery of neurological functions subsequent to stroke, however, the effects of EA on the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs and its potential mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, rats, in which a stroke was induced through middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), were treated with EA or control manipulation for 21 days. The modified Neurological Severity score and Morris water maze tests were used to assess the neurological functions of the rats. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or BrdU/neuronal marker (NeuN) double immunofluorescence staining were used to examine the proliferation and differentiation of the NSCs. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) and western blot analyses were performed to detect the expression levels of Notch1 and Hes1 in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of rats following MCAO. The results demonstrated that EA treatment significantly improved the neurological functional recovery of rats following stroke. A significant increase was observed in the number of BrdU+/GAFP+ and BrdU+/NeuN+ cells in the DG area in the EAtreated rats compared with that of the control group. RTqPCR analysis revealed that EA treatment significantly increased the expression levels of Notch1 and Hes1, which may account for the enhanced proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate that EA treatment promoted NSC proliferation and neurogenesis in the DG area through the upregulation of Notch signaling following a stroke; therefore, EA may be a useful novel therapeutic strategy in future stroke treatment.
