OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of coenzyme Q10 pretreatment on the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in rats suffering from ischemia/reperfusion injury. METHODS: Thirty-six adult male SD rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups: sham-operated group (sham), ischemia/reperfusion group (I/R) and coenzyme Q10 preconditioning group (Q10). Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models were established in experimental rats by blocking middle cerebral artery with suture. Histological changes of hippocampal neurons were observed by HE staining. The expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and GSK-3beta were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that the percentage of Bcl-2 positive cells increased in the hippocampus, while the percentages of Bax and GSK-3beta positive cells decreased in Q10 group compared with I/R group. Western blotting revealed that the expression level of Bcl-2 was higher and the expression levels of Bax and GSK-3beta were lower in Q10 group than in I/R group. There were significant differences between the two groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Coenzyme Q10 promoted the expression of Bcl-2 and suppressed the expressions of Bax and GSK-3beta in the hippocampus of rats exposed to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
