The objective of this study was to use high-resolution MRI techniques to determine whether children with Down syndrome exhibit decreases in hippocampal and amygdala volumes similar to those demonstrated in recent studies of adults with this condition. When corrected for overall brain volumes, amygdala volumes did not differ between groups but hippocampal volumes were significantly smaller in the Down syndrome group. These findings suggest that the hippocampal volume reduction seen in adults with Down syndrome may be primarily due to early developmental differences rather than neurodegenerative changes.
