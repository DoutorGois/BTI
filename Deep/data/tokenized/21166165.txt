AIM: A method of stereotaxic apparatus was employed to damage the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and the effects of Tiao-xinzishen prescriptions on neurotransmitters such as ACh, 5-HT and NE in hippocampus were observed. METHODS: Rats were placed on the brain stereotaxic apparatus and received a bilateral lesion of Meynert by IA injection, according to the atlas of Daxinos and Watson. After seven days of lesion, AD rats were selected. Rats were treated with Tiaoxin or/and Zishen prescription for 20 days, respectively. Hippocampus ACh was measured by spectrophotometer and 5-HT and NE by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: The contents of hippocampus ACh, 5-HT and NE of AD rats were significantly increased after the treatment with the three prescriptions, respectively. CONCLUSION: These prescriptions had some up regulating effects on hippocampus neurotransmitters in rats, which had already decreased due to dementia.
