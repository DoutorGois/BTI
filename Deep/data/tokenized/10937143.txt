A clinically tonic seizure phase, immediately followed by psychomotor features (right hand dystonic posture, left hand and oral automatisms), was recorded by video and EEG, in a patient who had gliosis of the left temporal lobe and left hippocampal atrophy. Interictal epileptiform discharges were frequently seen in the left temporal area, and at the time of the tonic seizure phase, ictal spike discharges were continuously observed at the left posterior temporal area, which was recognized only by applying a high frequency filter (HFF) of 15 Hz to the digitally recorded EEG because EMG artifacts totally obscured the EEG with a HFF of 60 Hz. It is most likely that tonic seizure can occur in an adult patient with temporal lobe epilepsy, and it is speculated that an epileptogenic focus might activate a certain brain area which is regarded as a symptomatogenic zone for tonic seizures. If the tonic seizure phase is immediately followed by psychomotor features as seen in the present patient, the former could be due to focal epilepsy.
