The properties and distribution of voltage-gated ion channels contribute to electrical signaling in neuronal dendrites. The apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampus express a wide variety of sodium, calcium, potassium, and other voltage-gated channels. In this report, we provide some new evidence for the role of the delayed-rectifier K(+) channel in shaping the dendritic action potential at different membrane potentials.
