When common carotid arteries of Mongolian gerbils were clamped for 5 min, locomotor activity significantly increased the day after the ischemic insult. This hyperactivity induced by cerebral ischemia was evident in both light and dark periods. The significant increases in locomotor activity seen in both periods were noted for 3 and 9 days after occlusion, respectively. Effects of dopamine receptor antagonists on the ischemia-induced hyperactivity were investigated the day after the ischemia insult. Haloperidol, sulpiride, and eticlopride, all dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, decreased the ischemia-induced hyperactivity at doses that had no effects on locomotor activity in sham-operated animals. SCH23390, a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, had no clear effects on the ischemia-induced hyperactivity. Clozapine, with not so high an affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor decreased the ischemia-induced hyperactivity when given in a relatively high dose. Thus, the ischemia-induced hyperactivity is apparently related to abnormalities in dopaminergic functions, particularly the dopamine D2 receptor.
