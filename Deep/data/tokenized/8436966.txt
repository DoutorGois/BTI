Clinical and preclinical evidence supports a possible role for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in cocaine action. However, the interaction between cocaine and TRH has not been directly examined. In the following report we describe a solution hybridization RNase protection assay that can sensitively detect mRNA for the TRH precursor, prepro-TRH (ppTRH). Using this assay, we examined ppTRH mRNA levels in rat brain regions implicated in cocaine reinforcement, including the nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus. Acute cocaine treatment (15 mg/kg) resulted in significant decreases in ppTRH mRNA levels in the amygdala and hippocampus, but not in the hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, or thalamus, 45 min postinjection. Chronic cocaine treatment (15 mg/kg twice daily for 14 days) resulted in marked regulation in all regions but the thalamus. Regulation was strongly dependent on the length of cocaine withdrawal and persisted up to 72 h postinjection in the amygdala. These studies support the hypothesis that TRH or other ppTRH-derived peptides are involved in cocaine action, especially in the extrahypothalamic regions of the amygdala and hippocampus.
