In patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin, stereotactic amygdalohippocampectomy can now provide excellent results. Target structures can be accurately identified and completely resected with use of a carbon dioxide laser. In a series of 18 patients who underwent this computer-interactive procedure, all experienced a cessation or dramatic reduction in frequency of seizure activity. Because the inferior optic radiations are disrupted with use of the posterolateral approach, nondisabling postoperative visual field deficits always ensue. In addition, two of our patients who underwent left-sided procedures had transient minor speech problems, perhaps attributable to postoperative swelling of the lateral temporal lobe. Patients in whom a surface electroencephalogram discloses a posterior temporal focus of seizure activity are candidates for stereotactic amygdalohippocampectomy.
