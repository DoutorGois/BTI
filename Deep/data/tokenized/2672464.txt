A number of recent studies have implicated a role of the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C in the generation of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Membrane protein kinase C activity was increased following a high frequency tetanus that produced long-term potentiation; and intracellular injection of protein kinase C caused enhancement of synaptic transmission identical to that occurring during long-term potentiation. Roger Anwyl describes studies using inhibitors and activators of protein kinase C which suggest that a late, nondecremental component of long-term potentiation is dependent on protein kinase C activation, although an early, short-lasting decremental component of long-term potentiation is probably independent of its activity.
