We examined bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) for the functional expression of P2X receptors, the ATP-gated cation channels. We identified the P2X subtypes present in BAECs using RT-PCR. mRNA was present for only three of seven family members: P2X4, P2X5, and P2X7. We then characterized agonist-activated currents in whole cell and outside-out patch recordings using 2-methyl-thio-ATP (MeSATP) as a P2X4 and P2X5 receptor agonist and 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)ATP (BzATP) as a P2X7 receptor agonist. MeSATP (10-20 microM) produced current with characteristics of P2X4 receptors. The current was an inwardly rectifying current, reversed near 0 mV, slowly desensitized, was not blocked by suramin (300 microM) or reactive blue (60 microM), and had a single channel conductance of 36 pS. BzATP (10-100 microM), on the other hand, activated a 9-pS channel with sustained activity in the continued presence of the agonist. BzATP-activated current was blocked by reactive blue (60 microM) and by suramin (approximately 50% block at 300 microM). We confirmed, by immunocytochemistry, the presence of P2X4 and P2X7 protein. The agonists failed, however, to induce significant uptake of the large molecule YO-PRO, indicating the lack of pore development that has been demonstrated for P2X7 and P2X4 in response to agonist in some cell types.
