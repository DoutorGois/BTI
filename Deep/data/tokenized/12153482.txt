We have focused on activation mechanisms of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM) kinase I in the hippocampal neurons and compared them with that of CaM kinase IV. Increased activation of CaM kinase I occurred by stimulation with glutamate and depolarization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Similar to CaM kinases II and IV, CaM kinase I was essentially activated by stimulation with the NMDA receptor. Although both CaM kinases I and IV seem to be activated by CaM kinase kinase, the activation of CaM kinase I was persistent during stimulation with glutamate in contrast to a transient activation of CaM kinase IV. In addition, CaM kinase I was activated in a lower concentration of glutamate than that of CaM kinase IV. Depolarization-induced activation of CaM kinase I was also evident in the cultured neurons and was largely blocked by nifedipine. In the experiment with 32P-labeled cells, phosphorylation of CaM kinase I was stimulated by glutamate treatment and depolarization. The glutamate- and depolarization-induced phosphorylation was inhibited by the NMDA receptor antagonist and nifedipine, respectively. These results suggest that, although CaM kinases I and IV are activated by the NMDA receptor and depolarization stimulation, these kinase activities are differently regulated in the hippocampal neurons.
