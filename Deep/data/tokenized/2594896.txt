Neuronal plasticity can manifest itself in alterations in the sensitivity of memory to the effects of drugs. After the production of a brain lesion, the memory processing of a passive-avoidance task in mice gradually becomes sensitive to the effect of morphine, i.e., an improvement in retention performance is seen after 6 weeks, but not after 1 or 2 weeks. The results presented demonstrate that, even if they lead to no discernible changes in behaviour, plastic processes can still be detected by means of behavioural tests.
