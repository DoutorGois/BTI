Expression in sheep brain of EP transcripts and their ontogeny in the brainstem was determined using RT-PCR. Sheep EP subtypes showed high homology (>80%) with other species. EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 were expressed in spinal cord, medulla, pons, diencephalon, hippocampus, pituitary, cortex and cerebellum of the fetal, newborn and adult sheep brain. Expression of all four peaked in the newborn, whereas fetal and adult expression were similar. A similar ontogeny suggests a common regulation.
