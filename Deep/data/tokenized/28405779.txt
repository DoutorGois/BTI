Earliest signs of neurodegenerative cascades in the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are seen within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, with pathological evidences in both cortical structures correlating with manifestation of behavioural and cognitive deficits. Despite the enormous problems associated with AD's clinical manifestations in sufferers, therapeutic advances for the disorder are still very limited. Therefore, this study examined cortico-hippocampal microstructures in models of AD, and evaluated the possible beneficial roles of kolaviron (Kv)-a biflavonoid complex in rats. Nine groups of rats were orally exposed to sodium azide (NaN3) or aluminium chloride (AlCl3) solely or in different combinations with Kv. Sequel to sacrifice and transcardial perfusion (using buffered saline then 4% paraformaldehyde), PFC and hippocampal tissues were harvested and processed for: spectrophotometric assays of oxidative stress and neuronal bioenergetics parameters, histological demonstration of cytoarchitecture and immunohistochemical evaluation of astrocytes and neuronal cytoskeleton. Results showed alterations in mitochondrial functions, which led to compromised neuronal antioxidant system, dysfunctional neural bioenergetics, hypertrophic astrogliosis, cytoskeletal dysregulation and neuronal death within the PFC and hippocampus. These degenerative events were associated with NaN3 and AlCl3 toxicity in rats. Furthermore, Kv inhibited cortico-hippocampal degeneration through multiple mechanisms that primarily involved halting of biochemical cascades that activate proteases which destroy molecules expedient for cell survival, and others that mediate a program of cell suicide in neuronal apoptosis. In conclusion, Kv showed important neuroprotective roles within cortico-hippocampal cells through multiple mechanisms, and particularly has prominent prophylactic activity than regenerative potentials.
