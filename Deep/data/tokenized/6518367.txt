Rats with electrodes in the ventral tegmental area were tested for the threshold of intracranial reward using a rate insensitive self-stimulation procedure. It was found that an electrolytic lesion of a part of the dorsal hippocampus induced a marked decrease in the variation of thresholds across rats, while the mean reward level did not change. This indicates that a factor is removed, by the hippocampal lesion, which causes differences in reward between individual rats. It is suggested that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is involved in this modulatory influence of the hippocampus on reward.
