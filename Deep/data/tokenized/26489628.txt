Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) involvement has been reported in the animal models of epilepsy and in human intractable epilepsy. The difference between pharmacosensitive epilepsy and pharmacoresistant epilepsy remains poorly understood. The present study aimed to observe the hippocampus SV2A protein expression in amygdale-kindling pharmacoresistant epileptic rats. The pharmacosensitive epileptic rats served as control. Amygdaloid-kindling model of epilepsy was established in 100 healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The kindled rat model of epilepsy was used to select pharmacoresistance by testing their seizure response to phenytoin and phenobarbital. The selected pharmacoresistant rats were assigned to a pharmacoresistant epileptic group (PRE group). Another 12 pharmacosensitive epileptic rats (PSE group) served as control. Immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine SV2A expression in the hippocampus tissue samples from both the PRE and the PSE rats. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that SV2A was mainly accumulated in the cytoplasm of the neurons, as well as along their dendrites throughout all subfields of the hippocampus. Immunoreactive staining level of SV2A-positive cells was 0.483 +/- 0.304 in the PRE group and 0.866 +/- 0.090 in the PSE group (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) value of SV2A mRNA was 0.30 +/- 0.43 in the PRE group and 0.76 +/- 0.18 in the PSE group (P < 0.05). Western blotting analysis obtained the similar findings (0.27 +/- 0.21 versus 1.12 +/- 0.21, P < 0.05). PRE rats displayed a significant decrease of SV2A in the brain. SV2A may be associated with the pathogenesis of intractable epilepsy of the amygdaloid-kindling rats.
