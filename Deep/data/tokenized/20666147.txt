The onset of schizophrenia symptoms typically occurs in young adulthood. It most commonly manifests as hallucinations, paranoid or bizarre delusions, or disorganized speech and thinking. Schizophrenia is often accompanied by social or occupational dysfunction. Recent genetic studies revealed several probable susceptibility genes for schizophrenia such as Neuregulin1, Dysbindin and Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1). DISC1 was originally identified as the sole gene that associated with a high inheritance of schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses in a large Scottish family. We here review the recent advance in understanding of pathophysiological functions of DISC1. [corrected]
