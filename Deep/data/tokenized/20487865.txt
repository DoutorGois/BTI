The influence of medioventral septal lesions and of chronic administration of gangliosides (50 mg/kg) on the colchicine binding activity in the soluble and particulate fractions of the hippocampus was investigated in rats from the 3rd to 50th postoperative day. In operated rats colchicine binding activity in the soluble fraction first decreased (on the 6th day) and then progressively increased to 120% of control value between the 8th and 13th day. In operated gangliosides injected rats colchicine binding activity in this fraction was decreased by 20% from the 6th to 13th day, returned to control level after 3 weeks and amounted to 140% of control value on the 50th day. In the particulate fraction, time course of changes in colchicine binding activity was the same for both groups of animals. There was no change in the activity up to the 18th day and an increase was subsequently observed on the 21st and 50th day (by about 25%). Chronic gangliosides administration to nonoperated rats had no influence on colchicine binding activity in either fraction. It is postulated that septal lesions in rats results in an elevation of tubulin content in the hippocampus and that chronic administration of gangliosides modifies this effect.
