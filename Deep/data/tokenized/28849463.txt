Neurotransmitters and neuronal activity affect neurodevelopmental events like neurogenesis, neuronal migration, apoptosis and differentiation. Beside glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid, the aminosulfonic acid taurine has been considered as possible neurotransmitter that influences early neuronal development. In this article I review recent studies of our group which demonstrate that taurine can affect a variety of identified neuronal populations in the immature neocortex and directly modulates neuronal activity. These experiments revealed that taurine evoke dose-dependent membrane responses in a variety of neocortical neuron populations, including Cajal-Retzius cells, subplate neurons and GABAergic interneurons. Taurine responses persist in the presence of GABA(A) receptor antagonists and are reduced by the addition of strychnine, suggesting that glycine receptors are involved in taurine-mediated membrane responses. Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp and cell-attached recordings demonstrated that taurine evokes depolarizing and mainly excitatory membrane responses, in accordance with the high intracellular Cl(-) concentration in immature neurons. In addition, taurine increases the frequency of postsynaptic GABAergic currents (PSCs) in a considerable fraction of immature pyramidal neurons, indicating a specific activation of presynaptic GABAergic networks projecting toward and exciting pyramidal neurons. In summary, these results suggest that taurine may be critically involved in the regulation of network excitability in the immature neocortex and hippocampus via interactions with glycine receptors.
