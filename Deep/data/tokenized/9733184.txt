Previous research has shown that head direction (HD) cells in both the anterior dorsal thalamus (ADN) and the postsubiculum (PoS) in rats discharge in relation to familiar, visual landmarks in the environment. This study assessed whether PoS and ADN HD cells would be similarly responsive to nonvisual or unfamiliar environmental cues. After visual input was eliminated by blindfolding the rats, HD cells maintained direction-specific discharge, but their preferred firing directions became less stable. In addition, rotations of the behavioral apparatus indicated that some nonvisual cues (presumably tactile, olfactory, or both) exerted above chance stimulus control over a cell's preferred firing direction. However, a prominent auditory cue was not effective in exerting stimulus control over a cell's preferred direction. HD cell activity also was assessed after rotation of a novel visual cue exposed to the rat for 1, 3, or 8 min. An 8-min exposure was enough time for a novel visual cue to gain control over a cell's preferred direction, whereas an exposure of 1 or 3 min led to control in only about half the sessions. These latter results indicate that HD cells rely on a rapid learning mechanism to develop associations with landmark cues.
