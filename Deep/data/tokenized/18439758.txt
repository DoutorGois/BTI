Ovarian steroids alter cognitive performance of young individuals. Whether progesterone enhances learning and memory in tasks involving the prefrontal cortex and/or hippocampus in aged mice was investigated. Aged mice received progesterone (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or vehicle and were tested for cortical and/or hippocampal learning and memory. Progesterone increased spontaneous alterations in the T-maze and time spent exploring novel objects in the object recognition task. Progesterone increased the time mice spent in the quadrant of the water maze where the hidden platform had been during training, increased latencies to crossover to the shock-associated side of the inhibitory avoidance chamber, and increased freezing in the contextual fear conditioning task. Progesterone did not enhance performance in tasks mediated by the amygdala (cued conditioning), striatum (conditioned place preference), or cerebellum (rotarod) in these aged mice. Thus, progesterone improved learning and memory in tasks mediated by the prefrontal cortex and/or hippocampus of aged mice.
