The authors present a case of linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS) with atrophy of bilateral frontotemporal areas of the brain, left cerebellum and hippocampus, and bilateral uncal dysplasia demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance angiography revealed bilateral internal carotid artery hypoplasia with absence of flow in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT demonstrated more areas of perfusion defects while MRI detected volume loss and gliosis in affected areas. Tc-99m HMPAO brain SPECT may be more useful for revealing absent or decreased perfusion areas of brain lesions than MRI in LNSS.
