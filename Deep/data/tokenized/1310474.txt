Following lesions of the fimbria-fornix, there is a time-dependent increase in interictal spikes and seizure susceptibility. This may result from sprouting of local excitatory and inhibitory circuits in response to the loss of subcortical and commissural innervation of the hippocampal formation. We used receptor autoradiography to examine the density of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive L-[3H]glutamate and [3H]-kainate (KA) binding sites in the hippocampal formation at 5 days, 3 months, and 1 year following bilateral aspiration lesions of the fimbria-fornix. At 5 days post-lesion, the CA3 and CA1 strata radiatum and oriens displayed a decrease (20-42%, P less than 0.01) in NMDA-sensitive L-[3H]glutamate binding. The initial decrease was followed by a moderate recovery at later time points but was still evident at 1 year postlesion. This may reflect a lesion-induced turnover of synaptic complexes, down-regulation of postsynaptic receptors, or loss of presynaptic receptors. Five days following fimbria-fornix lesion there was also a decrease (13-15%, P less than 0.05) in [3H]KA binding in CA3 strata radiatum and pyramidale. However, at 3 months postlesion KA receptor density was elevated by 29-33% (P less than 0.01) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus with no significant change in binding to the inner molecular layer. By 1 year postlesion, the density of [3H]KA binding sites was not significantly different from that observed in control animals of the same age. The increase in KA receptor density in the outer molecular layer 3 months after fimbria-fornix lesion may reflect sprouting of the perforant path input or mossy fibers to this region and contribute to the increase in interictal spikes and seizures susceptibility.
