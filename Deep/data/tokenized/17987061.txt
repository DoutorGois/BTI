Little is known about the sites of action for the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressants. The novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test is one of few animal behavioral tests sensitive to acute benzodiazepines and chronic antidepressants. The goals of these experiments were to examine patterns of brain activation associated with the behavioral response to novelty and identify regions that could regulate the anxiolytic effects of acute benzodiazepine and chronic antidepressant treatments, measured using the NIH test. In the first experiment, rats were treated acutely with the anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, i.p.). In separate experiments, animals were implanted with osmotic minipumps delivering vehicle or fluoxetine (5 or 20 mg/kg per day s.c.) for 3 or 28 days. NIH was assessed by giving animals access to a familiar palatable food in a novel environment. Associated brain areas were identified using c-fos immunohistochemistry. NIH was mitigated by acute chlordiazepoxide and chronic fluoxetine. Both drugs reversed novelty-induced changes in c-fos expression in the lateral division of the posterolateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (STLP), cingulate cortex (Cg), and dorsal field CA2 of the hippocampus (dCA2). Chronic fluoxetine additionally increased c-fos expression in the anterior nucleus accumbens (aAcb) and the piriform cortex (Pir). The effects of the drugs on c-fos expression in many regions correlated with anxiolytic efficacy. These findings identified brain regions where the effects of chronic antidepressants and benzodiazepines may converge to produce anxiolytic activity, as well as distinct sites of action for the two classes of drugs.
