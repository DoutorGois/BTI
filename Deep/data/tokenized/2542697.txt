Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a candidate for the synaptic alternations underlying memory storage in the mammalian CNS. In this chapter LTP in hippocampus and in visual neocortex are compared. Comparisons of the optimal tetanus parameters revealed that 2-3 trains of high-frequency stimulation (100-400 Hz) delivered within a brief period of time (minutes) results in maximal potentiation in hippocampal synapses. In contrast, the parameters most effective in neocortex were either low-frequency (2 Hz for 60 min) or high-frequency bursts (100 Hz, 100 ms train at 1/5 s for 10 min), both of which deliver at least an order of magnitude more afferent activation than that required for hippocampus. Hippocampal population spike potentiation averages 250% and the population excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) potentiation averages 50%. Neocortical LTP also averages about 50%. The expression of LTP requires about 5 min in CA1 hippocampus, whereas about 30 min are required for expression of neocortical potentiation. Both hippocampus and visual neocortex display an enhanced potentiation early in development, with a later stabilization at lower adult levels. Centering at postnatal day 15, hippocampal CA1 displays an LTP magnitude that is over twice that seen at day 60. Neocortical responses display a similar peak at postnatal day 15 and a subsequent adult stabilization at approximately half of the day 15 maximum. Both tissues first display LTP during the early stages of synapse formation between postnatal days 6-10. The role of the NMDA receptor is implicated in aspects of both hippocampal and neocortical LTP.
