If two copies of a meaningful word are tachistoscopically presented simultaneously in both visual half-fields of normal subjects the word will be processed more rapidly and more accurately compared to unilateral presentation (bilateral gain). The word-specific bilateral gain may be due to excitatory transcallosal connections within interhemispheric cell assemblies corresponding to words. In this case, the bilateral gain should be absent in split-brain patients. L.B., a split-brain patient, performed a lexical decision task with words and non-words presented in the left visual field, the right visual field, or in both visual fields simultaneously. As predicted, bilateral presentations did not improve performance compared to unilateral presentation in the right visual field. This result suggests that transcallosal connections play a significant role in lexical processing.
