Neonatal maternal separation of rat pups leads to a stable stress hyper-responsive phenotype characterized by increased basal levels of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in the hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic nuclei, increased hypothalamic CRF release, and enhanced adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT) responses to psychological stressors. Stress and exposure to glucocorticoids either early in life or in adulthood have been associated with hippocampal atrophy and impairments in learning and memory. In this study, male Long Evans rat pups were exposed to daily 3-h (HMS180) or 15-min (HMS15) periods of maternal separation on postnatal days (PND) 2-14 or normal animal facility rearing. Maternal separation and subsequent reunion with the dam resulted in elevated plasma CORT levels versus HMS15 animals at PND7, a time when rat pups are normally hyporesponsive to stressors and show limited pituitary-adrenal responses. As adults, HMS180 rats exhibited elevated indices of anxiety, startle-induced pituitary-adrenal hyper-responsiveness, and slight, but significant impairment on acquisition in the Morris water maze task. In addition, HMS180 rats exhibited decreased mossy fiber density in the stratum oriens region of the hippocampus as measured by Timm's staining, but no change in volume of the dentate gyrus. These changes may be the result of neonatal exposure to elevated glucocorticoids and/or changes in other signaling systems in response to maternal separation. Overall the results suggest that repeated, daily, 3-h maternal separations during critical periods of hippocampal development can disrupt hippocampal cytoarchitecture in a stable manner. The resulting change in morphology may contribute to the subtle, but consistent learning deficit and overall stress hyper-responsive phenotype observed in these animals.
