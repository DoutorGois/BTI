Ethanol-induced cell damage was investigated using human neuroblastomas SH-SY5Y cells, which can be differentiated by retinoic acid. With 100 mM or more of ethanol, cytotoxicity was significantly higher in undifferentiated cells than in differentiated cells. Thus, a severer effect of ethanol was observed in undifferentiated cells. In differentiated cells it was shown that the secreted amount of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) activity were significantly reduced by ethanol. These effects may be involved in ethanol-induced cell damage in differentiated cells. It was reported that neurotrophic factors have protective effects and that the hippocampus exclusively was damaged by ethanol. Since SH-SY5Y cell is a cell line (a neuronal cell model) and similar cytotoxic effect of ethanol was observed in both SH-SY5Y and primary culture neuronal cells, it will be favorable to use primary culture cells to test a protective effect of BDNF. Exogenous BDNF was shown to have a protective effect against ethanol-induced damage in primary culture neurons from rat hippocampi.
