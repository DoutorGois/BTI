Repetitive activation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces a persistent enhancement of synaptic efficiency known as long-term potentiation (LTP). In anesthetized and in freely moving rats, the induction of LTP in the perforant path led to a transient increase in the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) coding for a presynaptic glutamate receptor (GR33) in dentate granule cells. The amount of GR33 mRNA was increased for at least 5 hours after the induction of LTP but was indistinguishable from control values 1 day after induction. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-aminophosphonovalerate prevented the induction of both LTP and the increase in GR33 mRNA. The amount of GR33 protein was increased in the mossy fiber terminal zone of dentate granule cells 5 hours after the induction of LTP. These results suggest that the induction of LTP in synapses at one stage in a neural network may lead to modification in synaptic function at the next stage in the network.
