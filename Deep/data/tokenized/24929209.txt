After traumatic brain injury (TBI), proteolysis of Alpha II Spectrin by Calpain 1 produces 145 Spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs) while proteolysis by Caspase 3 produces 120 SBDPs. 145 and 120 SBDP immunoblotting reflects the relative importance of caspase-dependent apoptosis or calpain-dependent excitotoxic/necrotoxic cell death in brain regions over time. In the adult rat, controlled cortical impact (CCI) increased 120 SBDPs in the first hours, lasting a few days, and increased 145 SBDPs within the first few days lasting up to 14 days after injury. Little is known about SBDPs in the immature brain after TBI. Since development affects susceptibility to apoptosis after TBI, we hypothesized that CCI would increase 145 and 120 SBDPs in the immature rat brain relative to SHAM during the first 3 and 5 days, respectively. SBDPs were measured in hippocampi and cortices at post injury days (PID) 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 after CCI or SHAM surgery in the 17 day old Sprague Dawley rat. 145 SBDPs increased in both brain tissues ipsilateral to injury during the first 3 days, while changes in contralateral tissues were limited to PID2 cortex. 145 SBDPs elevations were more marked and enduring in hippocampus than in cortex. Against expectations, 120 SBDPs only increased in PID1 hippocampus and PID2 cortex. 145 SBDPs elevations occurred early after CCI, similar to previous studies in the adult rat, but resolved more quickly. The minimal changes in 120 SBDPs suggest that calpain-dependent, but not caspase-dependent, cell death predominates in the 17 day old rat after CCI.
