We report the case of a child with drug-refractory partial epilepsy in whom computed tomography showed no abnormality and magnetic resonance imaging showed a noninvasive cystic lesion in the left hippocampus. The finding in the positron emission tomography study with L-[methyl-11C]-methionine as a tracer suggested a tumor. This finding was confirmed histologically.
