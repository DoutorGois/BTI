Differential display (DD) PCR was applied to identify genes regulated by anorexia (anx) in mouse brain. Of the four apparently differentially expressed genes, three (H2-H4) had high homology with known genes such as apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf 1), adenylate cyclase 6 (Adcy 6), and myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). H1, designated as HIPA1, had a homology with unknown function gene fragments. Northern blot analysis confirmed HIPA1 expression induced by anorexia. A 1579 bp full-length cDNA of HIPA1 was isolated from a mouse brain cDNA library using a probe from the differentially displayed H1 fragment. Sequence analysis showed that HIPA1 had 98.7% homology to mouse hippocampus cDNA. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the HIPA1 mRNA was highly up-regulated in the hippocampus of anx/anx mouse brain.
