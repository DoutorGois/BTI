Early undernutrition causes long lasting alterations that affect the response to psychoactive drugs. Particularly, undernutrition during lactation affects the acute locomotor response to nicotine during adolescence, but the reward effect of continued exposure to nicotine remains unknown. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of undernutrition during lactation on the nicotine susceptibility indexed via conditioned place preference (CPP), on dopamine content and turnover and on nicotine-induced nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) upregulation in the cerebral cortex, midbrain and hippocampus of adolescent mice. The impact of undernutrition and nicotine exposure on stress-related hormones and leptin was also investigated. From postnatal day 2 (PN2) to weaning (PN21), dams were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Control (C) - free access to standard laboratory diet (23% protein); Protein Restricted (PR) - free access to isoenergenetic diet (8% protein); Calorie Restricted (CR) - access to standard laboratory diet in restricted quantities (mean ingestion of PR). PR and CR groups showed less mass gain and less visceral fat mass. While C and CR were equally susceptible to nicotine-induced place preference conditioning, PR failed to show a conditioning pattern. In contrast, all groups presented a nicotine-evoked nAChR upregulation in the cerebral cortex. While dopamine and DOPAC levels did not differ between groups, the DOPAC/dopamine ratio was increased in CR animals. No differences in endocrine parameters were observed. Taken together, our results indicate that undernutrition during lactation programs for brain alterations later in life. Our data also suggest that early undernutrition does not affect the rewarding associative properties of nicotine at adolescence.
