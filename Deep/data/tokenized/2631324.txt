The polypeptide composition of neurospecific glycoproteins in different areas of the rat brain under experimental neurosis is characterized using SDS-PAG-electrophoresis followed by electroblot and immunofixation on nitrocellulose membranes. The soluble and membrane-bound glycoproteins are purified by Con A-Sepharose column chromatography. Changes in the glycoprotein polypeptide composition in different areas of the rat brain under experimental neurosis are qualitative. Soluble glycopolypeptide 27 kDa and membrane glycopolypeptide 32 kDa are not revealed in the midbrain and corpus striatum. Soluble polypeptide 47 kDa is absent in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. It is suggested that the above mentioned glycopolypeptides are important for the CNS physiological functioning.
