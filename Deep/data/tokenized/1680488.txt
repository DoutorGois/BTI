The possible involvement of the metabotropic glutamate receptor in mechanisms of posthypoxic neuronal damage was investigated in an in-vitro model of mild hypoxia with the stereoselective antagonist L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionate (L-AP3). When 300 microM L-AP3 was present during hypoxia the evoked field potentials (population EPSP and population spike in the CA1 region of the hippocampus) recovered to about 80-100% of baseline values. The recovery without drug treatment reached only 40-75%. The NMDA antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (100 microM) was equally effective as L-AP3, whereas the less effective and less specific isomer D-AP3 (300 microM) did not show any protective effect. The results suggest that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors plays a role in hypoxic injury.
