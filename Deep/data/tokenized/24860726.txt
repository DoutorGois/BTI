In this brief comment we add to our previous discussion (Posner, Rothbart & Tang, 2013) of the importance of control mechanisms related to attention networks by dealing with how control influences what is learned and how wide the generalization of the learned information will be. A brain network connecting the anterior cingulate to the hippocampus appears to be important for the registration of new learning. This network provides a mechanism for how attention influences learning. Information coming to mind spontaneously or during testing activates a parietal area related to orienting of attention. Information about attentional control systems related to learning holds promise for new applications to acquiring expertise related to all school subjects.
