Quantitative characteristics (the area and number of chromocenters) of the interphase C-heterochromatin in the nuclei of pyramidal neurons of the midbrain reticular formation, sensorimotor cortex, and hippocampus (CA3) of rat strains with different genetically determined excitability were studied in the normal state of the animals and after exposure to a short-term emotional pain stress. The results indicate a relationship between the excitability of the nervous system and structural-functional state of the neuronal interphase heterochromatin. The role of cytogenetic features of different brain structures in the CNS functioning and behavior and their relation with genetically determined excitability of the nervous system are discussed.
