A population of uncoupled neurons can often be brought close to synchrony by a single strong inhibitory input pulse affecting all neurons equally. This mechanism is thought to underlie some brain rhythms, in particular gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations in the hippocampus and neocortex. Here we show that synchronization by an inhibitory input pulse often fails for populations of classical Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. Our reasoning suggests that in general, synchronization by inhibitory input pulses can fail when the transition of the target neurons from rest to spiking involves a Hopf bifurcation, especially when inhibition is shunting, not hyperpolarizing. Surprisingly, synchronization is more likely to fail when the inhibitory pulse is stronger or longer-lasting. These findings have potential implications for the question which neurons participate in brain rhythms, in particular in gamma oscillations.
