In the adult nervous system, neuronal subpopulations sustain a hierarchical pattern of selective vulnerability to hypoxia. Hypoxia also activates quiescent neural progenitor cells (NPCs) resulting in their amplification and subsequent differentiation into neurons and glia. Use of rat organotypic hippocampal cultures facilitates examination of early signaling events in response to hypoxia and reoxygenation that result in neurogenesis. Cultures were exposed to hypoxia for up to 6 h followed by reoxygenation. CA1 neurons showed focal nuclear condensation by 2 h of hypoxia, but CA2 and CA3 neurons were spared. JNKs and c-Jun reached peak activation by 4 h, returning to basal levels by 6 h. Expression of oxygen sensors, hemoxygenase 2 and HIF1, were elevated by 30 min and 2 h, respectively. By 24 h of reoxygenation, there was proliferation of nestin-positive NPCs. With U0126, an upstream inhibitor of ERK activation, BrdU labeling was markedly reduced immunohistochemically as well as PCNA protein expression, suggesting a role for ERKs in the proliferation response. Immunohistochemically, antinestin detected NPCs and on Western blots reached peak levels by 24-48 h of reoxygenation. Proliferation and differentiation of endogenous NPCs in the area of neuronal loss further suggests that mechanisms potentially exist in vitro for replacement with functional neurons.
