Hydrophobic adhesive tape was used to produce miniature wells on microscope slides for staining several sections of tissue with minimal amounts of cytochemical reagents. The wells could be tailored to individual specifications and the method allowed coverslips to be mounted close to the sections using either aqueous or xylene based mounting media. This method was especially useful for multiple immunolabelling of serial semithin cryosections.
