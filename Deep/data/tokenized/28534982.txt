Chrysanthemum indicum Linne extract (CIL) is used in herbal medicine in East Asia. In the present study, gerbils were orally pretreated with CIL, and changes of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1 and SOD2, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in the hippocampal CA1 region following 5 min of transient cerebral ischemia were investigated and the neuroprotective effect of CIL in the ischemic CA1 region was examined. SOD1, SOD2, CAT and GPX immunoreactivities were observed in the pyramidal cells of the CA1 region and their immunoreactivities were gradually decreased following ischemiareperfusion and barely detectable at 5 days postischemia. CIL pretreatment significantly increased immunoreactivities of SOD1, CAT and GPX, but not SOD2, in the CA1 pyramidal cells of the shamoperated animals. In addition, SOD1, SOD2, CAT and GPX immunoreactivities in the CA1 pyramidal cells were significantly higher compared with the ischemiaoperated animals. Furthermore, it was identified that pretreatment with CIL protected the CA1 pyramidal cells in the CA1 region using neuronal nuclei immunohistochemistry and FluoroJade B histofluorescence staining; the protected CA1 pyramidal cells were 67.5% compared with the shamoperated animals. In conclusion, oral CIL pretreatment increased endogenous antioxidant enzymes in CA1 pyramidal cells in the gerbil hippocampus and protected the cells from transient cerebral ischemic insult. This finding suggested that CIL is promising for the prevention of ischemiainduced neuronal damage.
