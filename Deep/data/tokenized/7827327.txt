Inducibility of NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been demonstrated in pyramidal neurones of the hippocampus, but the mechanisms of this induction are not known. The present study aimed to assess the role of anti-inflammatory drugs in injury-induced production of NADPH-d/NOS in CA1 pyramidal neurones. We found that either a steroid, dexamethasone or a non-steroid, indomethacin, prevents induction of these enzymes. We also found that NO is not necessary for the induction. None of the three drugs used had detectable effect on the neurones which contain constitutive NADPH-d/NOS.
