Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is induced under various stresses. Here we report the induction and localization of HO-1 in the rat brain by intraperitoneal administration of kainic acid (KA). Both mRNA and protein of HO-1 were markedly induced by KA treatment, and each maximal induction was observed 24 h after KA administration. In situ hybridization analysis showed that HO-1 mRNA appeared predominantly in glial cells, and confined neurons were positive in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampal pyramidal cell layer. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the positive cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were mainly astrocytes and microglia, whereas neurons in the basal ganglia showed intense immunoreactivity. We also demonstrate the dissociation between HO-1 mRNA and protein level in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, which is known to be vulnerable against excitotoxicity, and discuss the correlation between this dissociation and the vulnerability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
