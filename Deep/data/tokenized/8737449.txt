AIM: To study the spontaneous firing of CA1 neurons in rat hippocampus after transient cerebral ischemia and the effect of desipramine (Des) on the post-ischemic electric activity of CA1 neurons. METHODS: Single-unit extracellular recordings were performed in rats on d 3 after 10 min of cerebral ischemia by occlusion of 4 arteries. Des and saline were injected into a tail vein. The histological changes of CA1 neurons was assessed by the neuronal density of the CA1 sector. RESULTS: The spontaneous firing rate of CA1 neurons on d 3 after ischemia was enhanced in comparison with the control value. Des (0.2 and 0.4 mg.kg-1, i.v., n = 5 & 6, respectively) reduced dose-dependently the increase of firing rate with maximal inhibition by 6 min (58% & 85%) to 9 min (69% & 94%) (vs vehicle group, P < 0.01). About 50% cells in CA1 region showed necrotic changes. CONCLUSION: Des antagonized the hyperexcitability of CA1 neurons after cerebral ischemia.
