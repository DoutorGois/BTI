Gap junctions are intercellular channels that mediate the cytoplasmic exchange of small hydrophilic molecules and are formed by a family of integral membrane proteins called connexins (Cxs). Cx43 is expressed predominantly in astrocytes, while Cx36 is expressed in neurons. In this study, we show alteration of Cx43 and Cx36 in the hippocampus after traumatic brain injury in rats. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to lateral fluid percussion injury of moderate severity. Brain coronal sections were used for immunohistochemistry with Cx43 and Cx36 antibodies. Cx43 immunoreactivity was increased in reactive astrocytes in the damaged hippocampus 24 hours after injury, and persisted for 72 hours. On the other hand, Cx36 immunoreactivity increased in CA3 neurons 1 hour after injury, and decreased later. These results indicate that gap junctions might participate in the pathophysiological process after traumatic brain injury.
