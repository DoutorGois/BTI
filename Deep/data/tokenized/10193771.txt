1. We investigated whether dopamine plays a role in the neurodegeneration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) nerve endings occurring in Dark Agouti rat brain after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy') administration. 2. Haloperidol (2 mg kg(-1) i.p.) injected 5 min prior and 55 min post MDMA (15 mg kg(-1) i.p.) abolished the acute MDMA-induced hyperthermia and attenuated the neurotoxic loss of 5-HT 7 days later. When the rectal temperature of MDMA + haloperidol treated rats was kept elevated, this protective effect was marginal. 3. MDMA (15 mg kg(-1)) increased the dopamine concentration in the dialysate from a striatal microdialysis probe by 800%. L-DOPA (25 mg kg(-1) i.p., plus benserazide, 6.25 mg kg(-1) i.p.) injected 2 h after MDMA (15 mg kg(-1)) enhanced the increase in dopamine in the dialysate, but subsequent neurodegeneration was unaltered. L-DOPA (25 mg kg(-1)) injected before a sub-toxic dose of MDMA (5 mg kg(-1)) failed to induce neurodegeneration. 4. The MDMA-induced increase in free radical formation in the hippocampus (indicated by increased 2,3- and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in a microdialysis probe perfused with salicylic acid) was unaltered by L-DOPA. 5. The neuroprotective drug clomethiazole (50 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not influence the MDMA-induced increase in extracellular dopamine. 6. These data suggest that previous observations on the protective effect of haloperidol and potentiating effect of L-DOPA on MDMA-induced neurodegeneration may have resulted from effects on MDMA-induced hyperthermia. 7. The increased extracellular dopamine concentration following MDMA may result from effects of MDMA on dopamine re-uptake, monoamine oxidase and 5-HT release rather than an 'amphetamine-like' action on dopamine release, thus explaining why the drug does not induce degeneration of dopamine nerve endings.
