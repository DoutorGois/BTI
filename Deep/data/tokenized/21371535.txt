Clinical studies show an evident antidepressive effect of physical exercise and animal research corroborate such evidence. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the antidepressive effect of exercise are not completely understood. Notwithstanding, it is known that exercise increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus similarly to antidepressant drugs. BDNF is synthesized as a precursor molecule that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage to generate either a mature or a truncated isoform. Precursor and mature BDNF are assumed to elicit opposing biological effects in neuroplasticity. In the present study we investigated the effect of voluntary physical activity on precursor and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and on proBDNF cleavage related genes, p11 and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), as well as the antidepressive and cognitive effects of voluntary physical activity. Mice had access to mobile or locked running wheels for 28 days and were submitted to forced-swim, tail suspension and water maze tests. Their hippocampi were dissected and analyzed by Western blot and real time RT-PCR. Voluntary physical activity, but not locked wheel exposure, induced a robust increase in hippocampal mature BDNF protein levels, as well as in p11 and tPA mRNA expression; and also promoted antidepressive effects and improved learning, when compared with sedentary mice. On the other hand, there were no significant differences between any groups in the expression of precursor or truncated isoforms of BDNF. Our data suggest that the antidepressive effect of the physical exercise may depend, at least in part, on changes in BDNF post-translational processing.
