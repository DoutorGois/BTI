We propose a model for schizophrenia that incorporates findings of impaired auditory sensory gating with a possible structural abnormality of the hippocampus. The deficit in auditory sensory gating would be a genetic schizotaxic factor, necessary in the development of schizophrenia but not sufficient by itself. Genetic or acquired hippocampal dysgenesis or frank damage in combination with the sensory gating deficit would be necessary to produce the full-blown syndrome. We review the relevant literature and reply to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's hypothesis.
