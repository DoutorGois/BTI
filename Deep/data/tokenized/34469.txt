Female rats, treated at birth with 6-hydroxydopamine (3 x 100 mg/kg s.c. at 24 h intervals) or vehicle, were subjected at 112 days of age to unilateral electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus. Two weeks later regions of the telencephalon, both ipsi- and contralateral to the lesion, were simultaneously assayed for norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) content, and for tyrosine hydroxylase (TOH) and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) activities. In the vehicle-treated rats the lesion resulted in at least an 80% reduction of NE and DBH on the ipsilateral side, relative to the contralateral side. TOH was reduced to a similar extent only in the parietal cortex and hippocampus. In the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus TOH was decreased by only 31% and 64% respectively; the remainder was interpreted to be associated with projections of the mesocortical dopamine system. From this data it was possible to calculate that the ratio of TOH to DA in dopaminergic terminals is about 10-fold greater than the ratio of TOH to NE in noradrenergic terminals. Neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine treatment resulted in practically total elimination of noradrenergic terminals throughout the telencephalon, and the locus coeruleus lesion had no additional effect. The drug treatment produced no significant change in DA content or in the TOH to DA ratio in the prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus, indicating complete sparing of the mesocortical DA projections.
