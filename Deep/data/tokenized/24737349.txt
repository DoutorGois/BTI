Chrysin (CH) is an important natural plant flavonoid and possesses diverse pharmacological activities. Our present investigations aimed to assess the neuroprotection of CH against diabetes-associated cognitive decline (DACD) in a rat model of diabetes and exploring its potential mechanism. Diabetic model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Then, they were treated with vehicle or CH by doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg for 26 days. Learning and memory function was evaluated by Morris water maze test. The oxidative indicators [malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH)], NF-kappaB p65 unit, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and caspase-3 were measured in cerebral cortex and hippocampus using corresponding commercial kits. The diabetic rats showed marked reductions in body weight, percentage of time spent in target quadrant and number of times of crossing platform, coupled with increases in plasma glucose levels, escape latency, mean path length and oxidative stress (increased MDA level and decreased CAT and SOD as well as reduced GSH), NF-kappaB p65 unit, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and caspase-3 in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, CH supplement dramatically reversed the corresponding behavioral, biochemical and molecular alterations in diabetes. The alterations of swimming speed among different groups were not observed after CH adminstration. In conclusion, our current work discloses that CH remarkably alleviates DACD and suggests that oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic cascades are linked with diabetes-associated cognitive deficits. These findings point toward the therapeutic potential of CH in DACD.
