The brain localization of the neurotensin receptor NTS2 was studied with [3H]levocabastine, using an autoradiographic procedure. This study suggests that NTS2 receptors are mainly intracellular. High densities of binding sites were observed in the cingulate, insular, temporal, occipital, enthorhinal cortex, amygdaloid complex, septohippocampal nuclei, medial thalamus, mammillary bodies and superior colliculi; a moderate labelling was observed in the anterior and medial hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, septum, lateral thalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus and cerebellum; finally, a low labelling was apparent in the ventral tegmentum area and substantia nigra. Thus it appears that NTS2 receptors are particularly abundant in the cerebral cortex, the limbic areas and some areas involved in pain perception.
