The activity from 55 septohippocampal neuron pairs was examined in rats anesthetized with urethane. In addition to the statistical characterization of the firing patterns of the recorded units, the functional interactions between pairs of neurons and between neurons and hippocampal theta (theta) waves were investigated with cross-correlation techniques. Pairs were classified according to the rhythmic or non-rhythmic discharge pattern of their neurons. (a) theta-Pairs were those in which both the medial septal (MS) and hippocampal (HPC) units were rhythmic (type 1 units). (b) Pairs with a rhythmic and a theta-related non-rhythmic unit (type 2 unit) were called mixed pairs. (c) Pairs composed of type 2 units were called type 2 pairs. theta-Pairs showed periodic cross-correlations and frequently fired with a phase difference which could change in different pairs. Mixed pairs also showed periodic cross-correlations although one of the units was non-rhythmic. Type 2 pairs showed non-periodic positive cross-correlations. Our data provide new information regarding the temporal relationship between MS and HPC rhythmic activities supporting the role of the MS in providing the afferent timing for the generation of theta-rhythm in the HPC.
