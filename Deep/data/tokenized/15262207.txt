It has been shown that exogenous ceramide induces delayed neuronal death (DND) of cultured hippocampal neurons. To evaluate the role of endogenous ceramide in ischemic DND, the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (D-PDMP), was used to generate ceramide in gerbil hippocampi in vivo. The trimethylsilylated derivatives of ceramide were analyzed directly by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, after separation with high-performance thin-layer chromatography. The ceramide compositions in vehicle hippocampus consisted mainly of C18:0 fatty acyl sphingosine (87.9%), with C16:0 and C20:0 ceramides being minor components (7.1% and 5.1%, respectively). Ceramide level in the hippocampi from gerbils subjected to D-PDMP treatment was 1.5-fold higher than those from vehicle-treated gerbils. In spite of the accumulation of ceramide observed in the D-PDMP group, the histological studies did not reveal any ischemic neuronal death in hippocampal CA1 neurons with the gerbils that had been subjected to a sham operation (2-min sublethal ischemia). These results suggest that the ceramide accumulation induced by blocking the de novo synthesis of glucosylceramide with D-PDMP may be independent of the metabolic pathway underlying ischemic DND.
