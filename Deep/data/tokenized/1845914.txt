Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is a widely studied model of memory processes. In the CA1 region, LTP is triggered by the entry of Ca2+ through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels and maintained by the activation of Ca2(+)-sensitive intracellular messengers. We now report that in CA1, a transient block by tetraethylammonium of IC, IM and the delayed rectifier (IK) produces a Ca2(+)-dependent NMDA-independent form of LTP. Our results suggest that this new form of LTP (referred as to LTPK) is induced by a transient enhanced release of glutamate which generates a depolarization by way of the non-NMDA receptors and the consequent activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
