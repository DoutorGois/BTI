The effect of extremely low frequency (ELF, 60 Hz) magnetic fields (MFs) on convulsions was investigated in rats. We determined the onset and duration of convulsions induced by bicuculline alone or by co-exposure to MFs and bicuculline. In addition, we measured the GABA concentrations in the rat brains using HPLC-ECD. MFs strengthened the convulsion induced by bicuculline (0.3, 1, and 3 microg, i.c.v.), with a shortening of the onset time, but lengthening of the duration time. Co-exposure to MFs and bicuculline decreased the GABA levels in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, whereas MFs alone reduced the level of GABA only in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the exposure to MFs may modulate bicuculline-induced convulsions due to GABA neurotransmissions in rat brains.
