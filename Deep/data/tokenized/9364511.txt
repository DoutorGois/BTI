Kindling model is useful to study the mechanism of learning and memory. Cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA and CCK-like immunoreactivity (CCK-LI) levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of chemically kindled rats were determined at different time points. In the frontal cortex, chronic treatment with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) (40 mg/kg per day for 8 days) increased CCK mRNA level at 7 days, and decreased CCK-LI level at 2 and 7 days after the last injection. However, neither CCK mRNA nor CCK-LI levels in the hippocampus changed. These results suggest that PTZ-induced kindling increases CCK mRNA expression and CCK-LI release in the frontal cortex.
