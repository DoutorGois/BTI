Experiments on the model of bilateral photothrombosis in prefrontal cortex showed that antibodies to glutamate one-time administered intranasally 1h after ischemic damage to the brain cortex lead to decrease of neurodegenerative influence of excitatory neurotransmitter after photothrombosis. It was showed the change of the level of dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
