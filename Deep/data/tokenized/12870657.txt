The Ku autoantigen/KARP-1 (Ku86 autoantigen related protein-1) plays an important role in the double-strand break repair of mammalian DNA as a DNA-binding component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex. KARP-1 is differently transcribed from the human Ku86 autoantigen gene locus and it is implicated in the control of DNA-dependent protein kinase activity. We cloned rKAB1, a rat homolog of KAB1 (KARP-1 binding protein 1 of human) from a rat hippocampal cDNA library. rKAB1 mRNA was specifically expressed in the brain and the thymus. EGFP-tagged rKAB1 protein localized in cell nucleus and in the condensed chromosome during the mitotic cell division. We found that rKAB1 works as a protective protein against cell damage by oxidative stress.
