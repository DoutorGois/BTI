A monoterpene ketone, alpha-thujone originally attracted attention as a major natural ingredient of absinthe and was suspected to cause adverse effects such as hallucinations and seizures in persons excessively consuming this beverage. Although subsequent studies ruled out any major role of alpha-thujone in the "absynthism", it was found that at high doses it may induce epileptic activity pointing to an interaction with GABAergic inhibition. Indeed, subsequent studies, including those from this laboratory, showed that alpha-thujone inhibits GABAergic currents. However, GABAA receptors are extremely heterogeneous and in the present study we have investigated the effect of alpha-thujone on different recombinant GABAA receptors (alpha1beta2gamma2L, alpha1beta2, alpha1beta2delta and alpha4beta2delta) relevant to phasic or tonic forms of inhibition. We report that alpha-thujone inhibits all considered receptor types by a qualitatively similar mechanism but the strongest effect is observed for alpha1beta2delta receptors, suggesting that tonic currents might be more sensitive to alpha-thujone than the phasic ones. Moreover, we demonstrate that tonic currents, mimicked by response to a submicromollar GABA concentration (0.3 muM) in cultured neurons, showed a substantially larger sensitivity to alpha-thujone than responses elicited by higher [GABA] (more similar to phasic currents) or Inhibitory Postsynaptic Currents in the same preparation. Importantly, the extent of tonic current inhibition by alpha-thujone was as strong as in the case of currents mediated by alpha1beta2delta receptors. Altogether, these data provide evidence that different GABAA receptor subtypes show distinct sensitivities to alpha-thujone and suggest that this compound may differentially affect tonic and phasic components of GABAergic inhibition.
