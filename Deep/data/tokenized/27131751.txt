Based on how the silent information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) regulates the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB), which is the molecular switch of long-term memory that maintains cognitive function, it is postulated that the impact of lead (Pb) on SIRT1 is one of the mechanisms leading to Pb-induced cognitive and learning deficits. Hence, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of Pb exposure on the expression of SIRT1, and the reversion effect of resveratrol, which is an activator of SIRT1. We examined the effects of maternal rat ingestion of Pb in drinking water during gestation and lactation on the expression of SIRT1 and CREB in the hippocampus of their offspring at postnatal week 3 (PNW3) and 52 (PNW52), and then reexamined these effects in offspring after intragastric administration of resveratrol for 4 weeks. Pb exposure decreased SIRT1 and CREB phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in the rat hippocampus at both PNW3 and 52, and resveratrol reversed those losses. These results indicated that SIRT1 might be a novel target to prevent Pb neurotoxicity.
