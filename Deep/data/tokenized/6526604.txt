The effect of dichlorvos on phospholipids and proteins in brain of suckling rabbits has been studied by treating the animals with dichlorvos by oral gavage for 10 days starting on the 6th day of life. In 16-day-old animals a significant decrease of amino-acid concentrations in plasma was found; the concentration and synthesis of protein were lowered in their brains. The phospholipid pattern studied in the brain hippocampus exhibited changes in proportions of particular phospholipids. The ratio of phospholipids to proteins significantly increased in some brain regions. It is concluded that a phospholipid-protein imbalance in the brain of animals chronically intoxicated with organophosphorus compounds may be a primary cause of the multifocal changes in that organ.
