The content of Quinolinic Acid (QUIN) was fragmentographically measured in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortex obtained at autopsy from patients affected by Alzheimer's disease-senile dementia Alzheimer type (AD/SDAT) or matched controls. The density of large cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and the density of plaques in the hippocampal formation, parietal and frontal cortex of these patients was also evaluated in order to obtain a quantitative estimation of the Alzheimer type changes. In the three cortical areas studied, the content of QUIN was similar in AD/SDAT patients and age matched controls. The AD/SDAT patients had an important reduction of the number of large cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and a much higher density of plaques in cortex and in hippocampus than age matched controls. The data reported here do not support the possibility than an accumulation of QUIN plays a role in the neuronal degeneration occurring in the cortex of patients affected by AD/SDAT.
