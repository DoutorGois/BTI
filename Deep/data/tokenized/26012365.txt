Temporal lobe epilepsy is one of the most common clinical neurological disorders. One of the major pathological findings in temporal lobe epilepsy is hippocampal sclerosis, characterized by massive neuronal loss and severe gliosis. The epileptogenesis process of temporal lobe epilepsy usually starts with initial precipitating insults, followed by neurodegeneration, abnormal hippocampus circuitry reorganization, and the formation of hypersynchronicity. Experimental and clinical evidence strongly suggests that dysfunctional neurogenesis is involved in the epileptogenesis. Recent data demonstrate that neurogenesis is induced by acute seizures or precipitating insults, whereas the capacity of neuronal recruitment and proliferation substantially decreases in the chronic phase of epilepsy. Participation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in neurogenesis reveals its importance in epileptogenesis; its dysfunction contributes to the structural and functional abnormality of temporal lobe epilepsy, while rescuing this pathway exerts neuroprotective effects. Here, we summarize data supporting the involvement of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the epileptogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy. We also propose that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway may serve as a promising therapeutic target for temporal lobe epilepsy treatment.
