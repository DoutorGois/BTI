The aim of the study was to investigate the lipid peroxidation levels, nitrite formation, GABAergic and glutamatergic receptor densities in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum of Wistar rats after seizures and status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine. The control group was treated with 0.9% saline and sacrificed 1 h after the treatment. One group of rats was administered with pilocarpine (400 mg/kg sc) and sacrificed 1 h after treatment. The result shows that pilocarpine administration and the resulting SE produced a significant increase of lipid peroxidation level in the hippocampus (46%), striatum (25%) and frontal cortex (21%). In nitrite formation, increases of 49%, 49% and 75% in hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex, respectively, was observed. Pilocarpine treatment induced down-regulation of GABAergic receptors in the hippocampus (38%), striatum (15%) and frontal cortex (11%). However, with regard to glutamatergic receptor densities, increases in the hippocampus (11%), striatum (17%) and frontal cortex (14%) was observed during the observation period. These results show a direct evidence of lipid peroxidation and nitrite formation during seizure activity that could be responsible for the GABAergic and glutamatergic receptor concentration changes during the establishment of SE induced by pilocarpine.
