We report the case of a 44-year-old woman with complex partial seizures (CPS) of right frontotemporal origin who developed generalized amnesia after undergoing intracranial electrode implantation complicated by left hippocampal hemorrhage. Serial memory testing disclosed recovery from the amnesic disorder, while repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed resolution of her left hippocampal hemorrhage in a 2-month period. A second intracarotid amytal procedure confirmed the capability of her left temporal region to support memory. Consequently, a right orbitofrontotemporal lobectomy was performed without complication.
