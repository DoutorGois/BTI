It has been shown that neuroleptics which interact selectively with either D-1 or D-2 dopamine receptors possess a marked difference in their propensity on seizures. The aim of this work was to investigate whether the D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 differs from haloperidol (D-2 antagonist) in models of experimental epilepsy induced by electrical stimulation of selected brain regions (hippocampus and amygdala), in rabbits. Haloperidol increased and SCH 23390 significantly decreased the susceptibility to seizures in both models investigated. The data suggest that the D-1 and D-2 receptor subtypes have different roles in the mechanisms underlying seizures.
