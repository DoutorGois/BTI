Although reports of aggressive behavior in temporal lobe epileptics are common, it has proven difficult in clinical settings to gain the experimental control necessary to systematically investigate temporal lobe aggression or even to provide unequivocal evidence of its existence. Increases in aggressive behavior were observed in rats with experimentally induced epileptic foci in temporal lobe structures but not in control rats or those with foci in the caudate.
