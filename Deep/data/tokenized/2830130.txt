Total, Mg2+-, Na+,K+-, and Ca2+-ATPase activities were studied in fresh brain membrane preparations from adult epileptic (El) mice and nonepileptic C57BL/6J (B6) mice. The El mice have an inherited type of temporal lobe epilepsy. No significant differences were observed between the El and B6 mice for any of the ATPase activities in the hippocampus, brain stem, or cerebellum. These findings indicate that seizure susceptibility in El mice is not associated with differences in the activities of these cationic ATPases and that seizure susceptibility in El mice and audiogenic DBA/2 mice may involve different biochemical mechanisms.
