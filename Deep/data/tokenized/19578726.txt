The aging or senescence process that follows maturation is characterized by time-related functional decline due to genetic, biochemical, physiological and anatomical degeneration in tissues and organ systems with time. Oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the heart and brain is inversely related to maximum life span of mammals, suggesting that accumulation of mtDNA damage is involved in the various disorders associated with aging, cancer and neurodegeneration. The suppression of stem/progenitor cell proliferation also contributes to the aging process, by reducing tissue regeneration and repair and ultimately reducing longevity. Another important factor is the intracellular deposition of lipofuscin granules (age pigment), a non-degradable polymeric material accumulated within lysosomes, which ultimately exacerbate oxidative stress levels in senescent cells. Drugs of abuse can strongly contribute to these senescence accelerating factors in the brain. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ('ecstasy') and methamphetamine were shown to promote deletions in brain mtDNA. Concerning stem/progenitor cells, it has been shown that several opiates and psychostimulants, including ecstasy, decrease the self-renewal capacity of the hippocampus by diminishing the rate of proliferation of neural progenitors and/or by impairing the long-term survival of neural precursors. Chronic alcohol consumption induces lipofuscin deposition in neurons and heart cells. These facts provide interesting hints on the potential of these drugs in accelerating brain senescence. While the extent and severity of the contribution of drugs of abuse for accelerated senescence remain uncertain, these putative aging effects add up to the dark side of drug addiction and undoubtedly require a strong research effort in the near future.
