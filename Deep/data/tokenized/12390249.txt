BACKGROUND: Densin-180, a brain-specific protein highly concentrated at the postsynaptic density (PSD), belongs to the LAP [leucine-rich repeats and PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains] family of proteins, some of which play fundamental roles in the establishment of cell polarity. RESULTS: To identify new Densin-180-interacting proteins, we screened a yeast two-hybrid library using the COOH-terminal fragment of Densin-180 containing the PDZ domain as bait, and we isolated MAGUIN-1 as a Densin-180-binding protein. MAGUIN-1, a mammalian homologue of Drosophila connector enhancer of KSR (CNK), is known to interact with PSD-95 and has a short isoform, MAGUIN-2. The Densin-180 PDZ domain bound to the COOH-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of MAGUIN-1. Densin-180 co-immunoprecipitated with MAGUIN-1 as well as with PSD-95 from the rat brain. In dissociated hippocampal neurones Densin-180 co-localized with MAGUINs and PSD-95, mainly at neuritic spines. In transfected cells, Densin-180 formed a ternary complex with MAGUIN-1 and PSD-95, whereas no association was detected between Densin-180 and PSD-95 in the absence of MAGUIN-1. MAGUIN-1 formed a dimer or multimer via the COOH-terminal leucine-rich region which is present in MAGUIN-1 but not in -2. Among the PDZ domains of PSD-95, the first was sufficient for interaction with MAGUIN-1. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the potential to dimerize or multimerize allows MAGUIN-1 to bind simultaneously to both Densin-180 and PSD-95, leading to the ternary complex assembly of these proteins at the postsynaptic membrane.
