OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism on the protein expressions of CaMK II in the hippocampus of pups. METHODS: Female Wistar rats (n=28) after pregnancy were randomly divided into control group, hypothyroid group and iodine deficient group. According to the dose of PTU in fed water, hypothyroid group was divided into 5 mg/L group and 15 mg/L group (7 in each). 5 pups from each group were sacrificed and perfused intracardially in PN7, PN14 and PN21. Brains were removed, fixed and sectioned coronally. All sections were observed and analyzed the protein exression of CaMK II by immunohistochemistry in the hippocampus CA1, CA3 and DG regions. RESULTS: Control group in CA1, CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus had strong positive staining and the cytoplasm of neurons were filled with CaMK II. The distribution of the immune reaction product in hippocampus of 5 mg/L, 15 mg/L and iodine groups were in line with the control group, but the staining intensity as compared with the control group gradually decreased. In PN21 and PN14, integrated optical density average of CaMK II in CA1, CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus in iodine deficient group [PN21: (26.05 +/- 4.98), (30.79 +/- 3.22), (26.40 +/- 2.63); PN14:(25.48 +/- 4.87), (44.17 +/- 5.91), (26.41 +/- 3.01)] and 15 mg/L groups [PN21: (17.02 +/- 2.68), (24.57 +/- 6.62), (20.18 +/- 4.05); PN14:(20.66 +/- 3.51), (34.94 +/- 5.09), (27.32 +/- 4.97)] were significantly lower than those of controls [PN21: (57.75 +/- 13.22), (65.03 +/- 6.20), (49.39 +/- 8.41), P < 0.05; PN14: (54.08 +/- 12.00), (71.04 +/- 5.07), (78.52 +/- 12.42), P < 0.05]. In PN7, integrated optical density average of CaMK II in CA1 region of the hippocampus in iodine deficient group (25.74 +/- 3.33) and 15 mg/L groups (26.89 +/- 5.25) were significantly lower than those of controls(40.53 +/- 3.65), P < 0.05. CONCLUSION: Iodine deficiency and hypothyroidism may decrease the protein expression of CaMK II.
