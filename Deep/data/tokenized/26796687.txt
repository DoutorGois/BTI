An emerging view, based on gene expression patterns, is that discrete cell types occupy different regions in the hippocampus. In this issue of Neuron, Cembrowski et al. (2016) challenge this concept by identifying gradients of gene expression that suggest a molecular continuum of excitatory neurons and provide insights for organizational motifs at hippocampal poles.
