This study shows the effect of transient global cerebral ischemia (ISC) on hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Naive adult Wistar rats received either a brief (2 min) or a long (10 min) ischemic episode by the four-vessel occlusion method. Pre-conditioned rats received double ischemia: a 10 min episode inflicted 24 h after a 2 min event, a condition known to confer cytoprotection to CA1 pyramidal cells of hippocampus. 2 min of ischemia caused an increase in acetylcholinesterase activity both immediately and 30 min after the episode, however enzyme activity was significantly decreased after 24 h of reperfusion. 10 min of ischemia caused an increase in activity both 60 min and 24 h after ischemia. Conversely, pre-conditioned rats displayed lower activity both immediately and 60 min after ischemia. Our results suggest that: a) neuronal death, that follows 10 min of ischemia, is associated to a late increase in acetylcholinesterase activity; b) pre-conditioning is related to diminished acetylcholinesterase activity. This is in agreement with previous evidence that acetylcholinesterase inhibition and maintenance of acetylcholine levels are beneficial for cell surviving after cerebral ischemia.
