Intracellular recordings from CA1 and CA2/3 neurons in rats under urethane anesthesia revealed the following effects of medial septal stimulation (10 pulse trains at approximately 100 Hz): (1) in most cases only minimal signs of any synaptic potential; (2) a marked and prolonged (200-500 ms) depression of on-going inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), particularly evident when IPSPs were reversed by Cl- injection; (3) a corresponding increase in input resistance: (4) depolarization when recording with non-Cl(-)-containing electrodes; (5) a predominant hyperpolarization when recording with Cl(-)-containing electrodes; and (6) a marked reduction of the variability of resistance and voltage data. These observations indicate that septal stimulation can strongly depress tonic inhibition in the hippocampus. Septal trains also tended to weaken IPSPs evoked in pyramidal cells by fimbrial stimulation, reducing conductance increase during IPSPs by an average of 42% (S.D. +/- 24.3). Septal inputs to the hippocampal CA1 and CA2/3 regions appear to have a major disinhibitory function.
