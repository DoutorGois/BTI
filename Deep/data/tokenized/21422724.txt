Adult neurogenesis is the process of generating new neurons that become integrated into existing circuits after fetal and early postnatal development has ceased. In most mammalian species, adult neurogenesis only appears to occur in the olfactory bulb and the hippocampus, where neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) exist to create new neurons. In adult neurogenesis, microenviromental change is thought to provide a specific modulation for maintaining the multi-potent state of these NPCs. Neurodegeneration is driven by the activation of resident microglia, astrocytes, and infiltrating peripheral macrophages, which release a plethora of cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters, and reactive oxygen species. These endogenous factors cause further bystander damage to neurons and produces both detrimental and favorable conditions for neurogenesis. Interestingly, these endogenous factors also affect the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival of the NPCs, as well as regulate the incorporation of newly formed neurons into the brain circuitry. The unique profile of the endogenous factors released can vary the degree of neuroregeneration after neurodegeneration. This current review summarizes recent knowledge in the emerging field that is showing that adult neurogenesis is regulated by endogenous factors produced during neurodegeneration.
