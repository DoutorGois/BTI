The aim of this study was to examine gene expression changes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of animals with different susceptibility to stressful stimuli. Using a learned helplessness (LH) paradigm, mice received moderate current stimulation to induce different extents of LH behavior. Changes in mRNA expression were investigated by microarray and semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Comparisons of expression profiles between LH and control or non-learned helplessness (non-LH) animals revealed that the signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3)-interacting protein (StIP1) gene is downregulated in LH animals and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3) gene is up-regulated in non-LH animals. Since both StIP1 and Socs3 regulate the activity of Stat3 gene, these results suggest that Stat3 systems may be involved in the pathogenesis of depressive disorders.
