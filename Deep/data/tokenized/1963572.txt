The in vivo microdialysis technique was used to monitor steady-state noradrenaline release in the rat hippocampus after hippocampal kindling. At 8 weeks after the last seizure, the noradrenaline release was reduced by 62% in the stimulated hippocampus in kindled animals as compared to non-kindled rats. The reduction was not due to the repeated handling of the animals as assessed in a separate experiment. The results suggest a decrease of inhibitory noradrenergic influence at the primary kindling site, which could play a role in kindling epileptogenesis.
