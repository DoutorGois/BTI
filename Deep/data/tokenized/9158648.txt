BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat hippocampus induced by tetanic stimulation is impaired by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The effects of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion on other forms of LTP are unknown. Such data could help delineate the pathways of cellular alteration caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The in vitro phenomenon of calcium-induced LTP was thus examined in rat hippocampal CA1 cells that had undergone chronic hypoperfusion with a reduction in cerebral blood flow of between 25% and 50% maintained for 26 weeks. METHODS: Ten Sprague-Dawley rats had a cervical arteriovenous fistula surgically constructed, and an additional 10 animals were used as age-matched controls. Hippocampal slices were prepared after 26 weeks of hypoperfusion, and in vitro extracellular field potential recordings were taken from the Schaffer collateral CA1 region. Properties of LTP induced through transient exposure to a hypercalcemic solution were analyzed. RESULTS: LTP was impaired in animals with an arteriovenous fistula (P < .05). Control animals demonstrated potentiation lasting for the entire 2 hours of recording, whereas fistula animals showed only transient potentiation (< 60 minutes) before returning to baseline values. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium-induced LTP is impaired by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. This form of LTP is different from that induced by tetanic stimulation. It is the most sensitive test available for in vitro detection of the changes induced in neuronal function by chronic noninfarctional reductions in cerebral blood flow of 25% to 50% and may indicate that the most basic cellular parameters involving calcium homeostasis and metabolism are being altered. The precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated, and several postulates are discussed.
