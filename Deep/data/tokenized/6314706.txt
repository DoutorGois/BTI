Comparative analysis of the parameters of synaptic transmission in the central synapses of the snail (parietal ganglia) and in the brain of rabbit (hippocamp and sensorymotor cortex) has been made. Both differences and common features were revealed in synaptic organization of these two objects. Functional re-arrangements may alleviate differences between central synapses of the snail and rabbit. It is concluded that evolution of the central nervous system involved mainly the decrease of the effectiveness of separate synapses at the cost of the decrease of the number of quanta of the released transmitter and the increase of the number of various synaptic connections on each neuron.
