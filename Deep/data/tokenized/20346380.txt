Trans-2,4-dimethoxystibene (S(3)) is a synthetic stilbene. In this study, S(3) was investigated in terms of its neuroprotective effect against the toxicity induced by beta-amyloid(25-35) (Abeta(25-35)) both in vitro and in vivo. Protection by S(3) was studied at the in vivo level using a model of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta(25-35) in mice. The consumption of S(3) (50mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the cognitive deficits and neuron apoptosis caused by i.c.v. injection of Abeta(25-35). At the same time, the decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) were markedly increased, and the increased acetylcholine esterase (AchE) activity was significantly decreased in hippocampus and cortex. In vitro, SHY-SY5Y cells were co-cultured with Abeta(25-35), and then treated with S(3) immediately. Neuronal survival rates were increased, and this protection was associated with reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential.
