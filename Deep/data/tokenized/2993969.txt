The effect of delta-aminovaleric acid (delta-AV) on bicuculline-insensitive gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA B) sites in the central nervous system (CNS) was investigated by binding studies and experiments on slices in vitro. delta-AV inhibited [3H]GABA (10 nM) binding to GABA B sites in a rat brain membrane preparation with an IC50 value of 10(-4) M. It also inhibited [3H]baclofen (20 nM) binding with an IC50 value of 10(-4) M. In preparations of hippocampal slices, (-)-baclofen (5 microM) reduced the population spikes evoked by stimulating the Schaffer collaterals in CA1 pyramidal cells in the presence of 100 microM bicuculline. delta-AV (1 mM) antagonized this inhibitory action of baclofen. Since baclofen is an agonist of GABAB sites, our results indicate that delta-AV has an antagonistic effect on GABAB sites in the CNS.
