The basolateral region of the amygdala (BLA) plays a crucial role in making significant experiences memorable. There is extensive evidence that stress hormones and other neuromodulatory systems activated by arousing training experiences converge in regulating noradrenaline-receptor activity within the BLA. Such activation of the BLA modulates memory consolidation via BLA projections to many brain regions involved in consolidating lasting memory, including the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, nucleus basalis and cortex. Investigation of the involvement of BLA projections to other brain regions is essential for understanding influences of the amygdala on different aspects and forms of memory.
