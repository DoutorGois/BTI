NMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is a compelling hypothesis for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, because in part, NMDAR antagonists cause symptoms in healthy adult subjects that resemble schizophrenia. Therefore, NMDAR antagonists have been used as a method to induce NMDAR hypofunction in animals as a pharmacological model of schizophrenia. Serine racemase-null mutant (SR-/-) mice display constitutive NMDAR hypofunction due to the lack of d-serine. SR-/- mice have deficits in tropomyosin-related kinase receptor (TrkB)/Akt signaling and activity regulated cytoskeletal protein (Arc) expression, which mirror what is observed in schizophrenia. Thus, we analyzed these signaling pathways in MK801 sub-chronically (0.15mg/kg; 5days) treated adult wild-type mice. We found that in contrast to SR-/- mice, the activated states of downstream signaling molecules, but not TrkB, increased in MK801 treated mice. Furthermore, there is an age-dependent change in the behavioral reaction of people to NMDAR antagonists. We therefore administered the same dosing regimen of MK801 to juvenile mice and compared them to juvenile SR-/- mice. Our findings demonstrate that pharmacological NMDAR antagonism has different effects on TrkB/Akt signaling than genetically-induced NMDAR hypofunction. Given the phenotypic disparity between the MK801 model and schizophrenia, our results suggest that SR-/- mice more accurately reflect NMDAR hypofunction in schizophrenia.
