To study the complex synaptic interactions underpinning dendritic information processing in single neurons, experimenters require methods to mimic presynaptic neurotransmitter release at multiple sites with no physiological damage. We show that laser scanning systems built around large-aperture acousto-optic deflectors and high numerical aperture objective lenses provide the sub-millisecond, sub-micron precision necessary to achieve physiological, exogenous synaptic stimulation. Our laser scanning systems can produce the sophisticated spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic input that are necessary to investigate single-neuron dendritic physiology.
