We report direct electron spin resonance (ESR) evidence of extracellular free radical formation during kainic acid-induced seizures obtained using in vivo brain microdialysis in freely moving rats. Saline solution containing the spin trap agent alpha-(4-pyridyl-N-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was perfused through the hippocampus. ESR analysis of the dialysate samples revealed a six-line spectra, for which the hyperfine coupling constants corresponded to those of the ESR signal from the lipoxygenase/linoleic acid system, a lipid radical generating system. This result is direct evidence that lipid peroxidation of the neuronal membrane progresses during seizure activity. Increased formation of lipid radicals may participate in the cascade of reactions leading to neuronal damage in the hippocampus following kainic acid-induced seizure activity.
