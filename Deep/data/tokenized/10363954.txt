The aim of our study was to assess polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration into the injured parenchyma after a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed on the hippocampus, temporal and parietal cortex 6, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h post-trauma. MPO activity occurred in these structures from 6 h post-trauma and was maximum at 24-48 h. It was resolved by 72 h in the hippocampus and the parietal cortex, but persisted in the temporal cortex until 120 h after trauma. This suggests that neutrophil infiltration is a delayed phenomenon in the physiopathology of TBI. Considering that a large therapeutic window may be crucial in the management of TBI, inhibition of neutrophil infiltration needs to be further investigated following cerebral trauma.
