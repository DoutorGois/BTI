Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often becomes refractory, and patients with TLE show a high incidence of psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety and depression. Therefore, it is necessary to identify molecules that were previously unknown to contribute to epilepsy and its associated disorders. We previously found that the sialyltransferase ST3Gal IV is up-regulated within the neural circuits through which amygdala-kindling stimulation propagates epileptic seizures. In contrast, this study demonstrated that kindling stimulation failed to evoke epileptic seizures in ST3Gal IV-deficient mice. Furthermore, approximately 80% of these mice failed to show tonic-clonic seizures with stimulation, whereas all littermate wild-type mice showed tonic-clonic seizures. This indicates that the loss of ST3Gal IV does not cause TLE in mice. Meanwhile, ST3Gal IV-deficient mice exhibited decreased acclimation in the open field test, increased immobility in the forced swim test, enhanced freezing during delay auditory fear conditioning, and sleep disturbances. Thus, the loss of ST3Gal IV modulates anxiety-related behaviors. These findings indicate that ST3Gal IV is a key molecule in the mechanisms underlying anxiety - a side effect of TLE - and may therefore also be an effective target for treating epilepsy, acting through the same circuits.
