Clinical studies suggest involvement of brain noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of disruptive agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This behavioral problem is even more prevalent in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Here we used receptor autoradiography with [(125)I]para-iodoclonidine to estimate alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (A2R) density in locus coeruleus (LC) projection areas in postmortem brain tissue from age and gender comparable groups of DLB (n = 6), AD (n = 5) and normal (n = 7) subjects. LC neuronal loss was substantial and equivalent in DLB and AD. A2R density was greater in DLB than in normals in the deep layers of the frontal cortex. A2R density was greater in DLB than in AD in hippocampus (CA-1, CA-3 and dentate hilus) and in the granule layer of the cerebellum. Increased A2R binding in DLB is consistent with expression of presynaptic A2R on fibers from surviving LC neurons involved in reinnervation of LC projection areas. These areas develop compensatory noradrenergic hyperinnervation in a rat model of partial LC ablation. It is also consistent with upregulation of post-synaptic A2R in response to loss of LC noradrenergic innervation. Either mechanism could lower the threshold for increased agitation in response to noradrenergic outflow in these dementing disorders.
