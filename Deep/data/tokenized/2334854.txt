Transient anoxia occurring 1-2 min after high-frequency stimulation selectively prevented the stable expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Anoxia occurring after this brief vulnerable period did not reverse LTP. Experiments on the duration of anoxia necessary to block LTP expression indicated that simply reducing synaptic transmission was insufficient but that membrane depolarization was not required. The effects of anoxia on LTP were blocked by antagonists of A1 adenosine receptors. It is concluded that LTP develops in about one minute and that the chemistries operating in this period are easily disrupted by an event triggered by adenosine receptors.
