Slices from rat CA3 hippocampal area show a 30% decrement in ATPase activity after 35 min of 'in vitro' incubation. Such a drop is accompanied by an alteration of mitochondrial ultrastructure. However, if rats are treated daily with GM1 ganglioside (10 mg/kg during 3 days) both phenomena are fully prevented. These results would suggest a protective effect of gangliosides onto membrane structures under stress conditions.
