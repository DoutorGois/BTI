Relative power within the delta, theta, low-alpha, high-alpha, and gamma electroencephalographic spectra of 8 human volunteers was recorded over the left and right frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes during and after the circumcerebral application through an array of 8 solenoids of 6 different configurations of weak (5 to 10 microTesla) magnetic fields. The solenoids were equally spaced around the subject's head along a horizontal plane above the ears. An approximately 30% increase in power within the theta band occurred transcerebrally during the application of a specific configuration, previously shown to affect subjective time, involving 20-msec. rates of change in the duration of delivery of the magnetic fields to each successive solenoid. Compared to the left hemisphere, the right hemisphere displayed a 20% increase in power within the 5.0- to 5.9-Hz range for all 6 configurations. The results suggest that very complex magnetic fields with the appropriate temporal parameters rotated around and within brain space can interact with the cerebral processes, measured as specific hands of frequencies, generating consciousness. Implications for the roles of hippocampal theta activity, cortical resonance, and Goldstone bosons in these processes are discussed.
