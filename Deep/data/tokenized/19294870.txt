Though being inferior to magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography (CT) of the brain is the most frequently applied imaging modality in the diagnostic workup of acute cerebral Ischaemia. We report on a case of a comatose 53-year-old man who was brought to the emergency room after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The CT of the brain showed a diffuse brain oedema with an explicit hypodense demarcation of all deep nuclei.
