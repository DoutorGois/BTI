OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the causal gene in a consanguineous Moroccan family with temporo-occipital polymicrogyria, psychiatric manifestations, and epilepsy, previously mapped to the 6q16-q22 region. METHODS: We used exome sequencing and analyzed candidate variants in the 6q16-q22 locus, as well as a rescue assay in Fig4-null mouse fibroblasts and immunohistochemistry of Fig4-null mouse brains. RESULTS: A homozygous missense mutation (p.Asp783Val) in the phosphoinositide phosphatase gene FIG4 was identified. Pathogenicity of the variant was supported by impaired rescue of the enlarged vacuoles in transfected fibroblasts from Fig4-deficient mice. Histologic examination of Fig4-null mouse brain revealed neurodevelopmental impairment in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum as well as impaired cerebellar gyration/foliation reminiscent of human cortical malformations. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends the spectrum of phenotypes associated with FIG4 mutations to include cortical malformation associated with seizures and psychiatric manifestations, in addition to the previously described Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4J and Yunis-Varon syndrome.
