The brainstems of 3 cats were transected at the ponto-medullary junction and the cats maintained in stable condition for periods of from 16 to 31 days. After transection, all of these cats had periods in which forebrain sensorimotor cortex, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, eye movement and lateral geniculate recordings exhibited the pattern of activity seen only in REM sleep in the intact cat. We conclude that medullary regions are not required to generate these signs of REM sleep. The pons is necessary for REM sleep and is sufficient to produce REM sleep signs in rostral as well as caudal brain regions. However, the medulla may contribute to regulation of the duration and periodicity of REM sleep.
