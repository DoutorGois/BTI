Here we describe a detailed analysis of the expression of neurochondrin ( ncdn) in the developing and adult mouse brain. Ncdn is first expressed in the hindbrain and spinal cord at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) followed by expression in the midbrain at E11.5. By E18 ncdn is also expressed in the diencephalon and telencephalon. However, strongest expression is still observed in the hindbrain. In adults, the expression in the forebrain is as strong as in the hindbrain. Ncdn is highly expressed in the hippocampus, piriform cortex, septum, amygdaloid complex, medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, cerebellar nuclei and the nuclei of the Vth, VIIth, and XIIth cranial nerves.
