Exposure of human fetuses to ethanol often results in the fetal alcohol syndrome. Animal models of fetal alcohol syndrome have been developed and used to examine the consequences of prenatal ethanol exposure on the central nervous system. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on parvalbumin-expressing (PA+) GABAergic neurons of the rat medial septum. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were maintained on 1 of 3 diets from gestational day 0 to 21: an ethanol-containing liquid diet in which ethanol accounted for 35% of the total calories, a similar diet with the isocaloric substitution of sucrose for ethanol, or a lab chow control diet. Offspring were killed on postnatal day 60, and their brains were prepared for parvalbumin immunocytochemistry. Female rats exposed to the ethanol-containing diet during gestation had 42% fewer PA+ neurons in the medial septum and reduced PA+ cell density when compared with female rats exposed to the sucrose diet. Ethanol females also had fewer PA+ neurons per unit volume than sucrose females. Male rats exposed to ethanol did not display a similar reduction in PA+ neurons or density. No effect of prenatal diet was found on the area or volume of the medial septum, nor were cell diameters affected. As such, prenatal exposure to ethanol seems to reduce permanently the number of PA+ neurons in the female rat medical septum without affecting area, volume, or neuronal size. Functional implications and possible relations to the fetal alcohol syndrome are discussed.
