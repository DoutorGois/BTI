Aging alters ion regulation in brain tissue. This article describes methods useful for studying such age-related changes in the rat hippocampal slice preparation. Topics considered include (a) selection of appropriate age groups of rats for aging studies, (b) a description of methods for preparing and maintaining hippocampal slices, (c) measurement of intracellular pH with the H+-sensitive dye carboxy-SNARF-1, and (d) measurement of extracellular pH and K+ with cation-selective microelectrodes.
