The present data confirm the results of others that post-synaptic receptor changes may contribute to the decline in brain cholinergic function in ageing and dementia. We have also shown that chronic oral treatment with an extract of Gingko biloba increases the apparent muscarinic receptor population in the hippocampus of the aged Fisher 344 rat. The possible effect on (3H) kainic acid binding to the kainate-excitatory amino acid site is also interesting because of the proposed association of neurodegenerative disease and excessive excitatory amino neurotransmission.
