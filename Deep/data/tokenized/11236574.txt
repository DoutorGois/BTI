The treatment of pregnant and lactating female rats with ethanol inhibits the proliferation of matrix cells in the lateral brain ventricles of fetuses and, during the early postnatal period, of granule cells in the dentate gyrus and cells of the ventral horn of Ammon. A low proliferation rate leads to a decrease in the number of neurons forming the granule layer of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal neurons in the CA-1 field of the horn of Ammon.
