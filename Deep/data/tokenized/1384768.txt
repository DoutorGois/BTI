We investigated the action of nitric oxide in hypoxic neuronal injury, using the hippocampal slice. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with the competitive inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, provided significant protection against hypoxia for population spike, EPSP and fiber volley responses, with an EC50 of 30 microM for protection of antidromic population spike amplitude. Confirming a stereo-specific site of action, this protection was reversed by the addition of L-arginine, but not D-arginine. These results indicate that nitric oxide generation may mediate acute CA1 neuronal injury during hypoxia, and that inhibition of nitric oxide synthase may be a useful neuroprotective strategy.
