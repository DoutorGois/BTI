OBJECTIVE: The goals of the work described here were to determine if hippocampal and extrahippocampal atrophy in children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) follows a pattern similar to that in adult patients, and to assess the clinical and neuropsychological relevance of regional brain atrophy in pediatric TLE. METHODS: Children with symptomatic TLE (n=14: 9 with mesial TLE due to hippocampal atrophy and 5 with TLE due to neocortical lesions), healthy children (n=14), and 9 adults with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) were compared using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The children underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: Children with MTLE with unilateral hippocampal atrophy (n=9) exhibited a significant reduction in gray matter in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the seizure origin and significant atrophy in the ipsilateral cingulate gyrus and contralateral middle frontal lobe. Children with TLE (n=14) exhibited a significant reduction in the gray matter of the ipsilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. There was a correlation between gray matter volume in children with TLE and scores on several neuropsychological tests. Atrophy in pediatric patients with MTLE was less extensive than that in adults, and involved the hippocampi and the frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to adult MTLE, pediatric MTLE is associated with hippocampal and extrahippocampal cell loss. However, children display less intense quantifiable gray matter atrophy, which affects predominantly frontal lobe areas. There was a significant association between volume of gray matter in medial temporal and frontal regions and scores on neuropsychological tests. In childhood, TLE and the concomitant cognitive/behavior disturbances are the result of a damaged neural network.
