In this study, we tested changes of internal standard genes of the brain after electrical tail shock in rats. The level of 28S rRNA of the amygdala was increased significantly after the stress. There was no significant change in GAPDH, beta-actin, 36B4 mRNA and 28S rRNA at the subfornical organ and the hippocampus.
