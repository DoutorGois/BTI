Cholinergic muscarinic receptors in aged and young rat brains were studied by quantitative autoradiography of tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate. A selective pattern of decreased binding density was observed in the aged rat. A large number of regions showed no effect of aging; these include subdivisions of the hippocampal formation and most thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. Small but significant decreases were found in cortical regions and in the striatum. The largest effects were seen in ventral forebrain cholinergic nuclei, where 40-60% depletions were found in the diagonal band, nucleus basalis magnocellularis, ventral pallidum, and substantia innominata.
