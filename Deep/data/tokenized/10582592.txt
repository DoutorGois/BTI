Activity-dependent neurotrophic factor (ADNF) and a 14-amino acid fragment of this peptide (sequence VLGGGSALLRSIPA) protect neurons from death associated with an array of toxic conditions, including amyloid beta-peptide, N-methyl-D-aspartate, tetrodotoxin, and the neurotoxic HIV envelope coat protein gp120. We report that an even smaller, nine-amino acid fragment (ADNF9) with the sequence SALLRSIPA potently protects cultured embryonic day 18 rat hippocampal neurons from oxidative injury and neuronal apoptosis induced by FeSO4 and trophic factor withdrawal. Among the characteristics of this protection are maintenance of mitochondrial function and a reduction in accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species.
