AIM: To investigate the protective effect of monosialoganglioside (GM1) on injury induced by oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/Rep) in rat hippocampal slices. METHODS: The protective effects of GM1 on hippocampal slices after OGD/Rep were observed by detecting the light transmittance (LT) changes of rat hippocampal slices and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of rat hippocampal slices. RESULTS: (1) In four groups treated with 0 (control), 0.1, 1.0, 10 micromol/L GM1, the peak of light transmittance (LT) in the slices treated with 1.0 micromol/L GM1 was significantly lower than that of the control and the group treated with 0.10 micromol/L GM1 (P < 0.01, ANOVA), while the peak of LT in the slices treated with 10.0 micromol/L GM1 was significantly lower than that of the other groups (P < 0.01, ANOVA). The time to reach the peak of LT in four groups was significantly different from each other (P < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). The time to reach the peak of LT in the group treated with 1 micromol/L GM1 was the significantly longer than that in the control (P < 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test). (2) There was characteristic dose-response relationship between GM1 and TTC staining of rat hippocampal slices. In the five groups, treated with 0 (control), 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10 micromol/L GM1 respectively, TTC staining in the group treated with 1 micromol/L GM1 was the deepest (P < 0.05 vs. control, 0.01 and 0.1 micromol/L GM1 group, ANOVA), and the next was in the group treated with 10 micromol/L GM1 (P < 0.05 vs. control and 0.01 micromol/L GM1 group, ANOVA). CONCLUSION: GM1 could protect injury induced by OGD/Rep in rat hippocampal slices effectively in vitro.
