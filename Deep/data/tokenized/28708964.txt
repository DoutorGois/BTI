Immobilization induces oxidative damage to the brain. Ilex paraguariensis extracts (Mate) and their major natural compound, chlorogenic acid (CGA), exert protective effects against reactive oxygen species formation. Here, the effects of Mate and CGA on oxidative damage induced by chronic immobilization stress (CIS) in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were investigated. For CIS, animals were immobilized for 6 h every day for 21 consecutive days. Rats received Mate or CGA by intragastric gavage 30 min before every restraint session. Endpoints of oxidative stress (levels of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms of glutathione) were evaluated following CIS. While CIS increased oxidized lipid and carbonyl levels in all brain regions, CGA (and Mate to a lesser extent) attenuated lipid and protein oxidation as compared with control groups. GSH/GSSG balance showed a tendency to increase in all regions in response to stress and antioxidants. Taken together, our results support a protective role of dietary antioxidants against the neuronal consequences of stress.
