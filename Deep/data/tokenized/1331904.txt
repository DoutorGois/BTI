The neuronal lesion caused locally by the injection of 0.47 nmol kainic acid into the dorsal hippocampus was greatly reduced by the co-administration of 190 nmol 2,3-dihydro-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX). Protection was particularly marked for the neurons present in the CA3 and dentate hilar regions which are the neurons most vulnerable to kainic acid. On the other hand, systemic administration of NBQX (3 doses of 30 mg/kg i.p.) was completely ineffective in blocking neuronal loss in the CA3 and hilar regions. Furthermore, neither hippocampal nor systemic NBQX could prevent the diffuse neuronal damage to other regions in the limbic system outside of the dorsal hippocampus.
