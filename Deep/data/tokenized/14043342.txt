Etectroencephalographic sleep patterns of chimpanzees reveal greater similarities to human records than those of lower mammals. Flash-evoked responses in the midbrain reticular formation remain during "paradoxical" sleep, which does not appear to necessarily involve deep unconsciousness. Characteristic spindling occurs in the amygdala during a "paradoxical" type sleep while other areas were desynchronized. Telencephalic sleep-control mechanisms in higher primates are considered.
