Interneurons of the hippocampal formation are traditionally identified electrophysiologically as those cells that fire trains of weakly accommodating action potentials in response to depolarizing current injection. We studied the firing properties of nonpyramidal neurons in the five substrata of the CA3b region of hippocampus. With the use of whole cell recording methods we found that nonpyramidal neurons fired in a range from weak to strong spike-frequency accommodation (SFA) that was calcium dependent. Slow afterhyperpolarizations were not associated with strong SFA. In addition a subset of interneurons ( approximately 20%) fired with an irregular firing pattern that was generally calcium independent. These results suggest a calcium-dependent mechanism for SFA in nonpyramidal neurons that is distinct from pyramidal cells and further demonstrates the heterogeneity of hippocampal interneurons.
