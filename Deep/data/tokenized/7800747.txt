Rats were submitted to paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) for 24, 72, or 96 h and were trained on a double aversively motivated task, encompassing a step-through inhibitory avoidance and a classical conditioning of fear to a brief tone serving as conditional stimulus. Retention test of the inhibitory avoidance was performed at the same apparatus of training (without tone presentation). Retention of conditioned fear was assessed in an open field apparatus, where the freezing reaction to the tone was measured. PSD for 24 and 72 h preceding the training session had no effect on either task. However, PSD during the 96 h preceding the training session impaired acquisition of inhibitory avoidance, but had no effect on classically conditioned fear. It is concluded that PSD had differential effects on the two tasks, both aversively motivated and trained at the same time and conditions.
