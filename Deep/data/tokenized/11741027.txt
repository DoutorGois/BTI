Recent physiological studies have implicated theta - a high-amplitude 4-8 Hz oscillation that is prominent in rat hippocampus during locomotion, orienting and other voluntary behaviors - in synaptic plasticity, information coding and the function of working memory. Intracranial recordings from human cortex have revealed evidence of high-amplitude theta oscillations throughout the brain, including the neocortex. Although its specific role is largely unknown, the observation of human theta has begun to reveal an intriguing connection between brain oscillations and cognitive processes.
