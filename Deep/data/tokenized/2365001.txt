The intrahippocampal injection of the mast cell degranulating (MCD) peptide, a bee venom component acting on the K+ channel, results in the appearance of the proto-oncogene c-fos mRNA in the ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus of the treated animals without generating convulsions. This MCD-induced transcriptional event is discussed in terms of cellular plasticity since MCD peptide is known to induce long-term potentiation.
