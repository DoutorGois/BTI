To evaluate the efficacy of (18)F-FC119S as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceutical for the imaging of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we studied the drug absorption characteristics and distribution of (18)F-FC119S in normal mice. In addition, we evaluated the specificity of (18)F-FC119S for beta-amyloid (Abeta) in the AD group of an APP/PS1 mouse model and compared it with that in the wild-type (WT) group. The behavior of (18)F-FC119S in the normal mice was characteristic of rapid brain uptake and washout patterns. In most organs, including the brain, (18)F-FC119S reached its maximum concentration within 1 min and was excreted via the intestine. Brain PET imaging of (18)F-FC119S showed highly specific binding of the molecule to Abeta in the cortex and hippocampus. The brain uptake and binding values for the AD group were higher than those for the WT group. These results indicated that (18)F-FC119S would be a candidate PET imaging agent for targeting Abeta plaque.
