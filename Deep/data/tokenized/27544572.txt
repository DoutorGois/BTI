In the present study, to evaluate the effects of wireless 1880-1900MHz Digital Enhanced Communication Telephony (DECT) base radiation on fetal and postnatal development, Wistar rats were exposed at an average electric field intensity of 3.7V/m, 12h/day, during pregnancy. After parturition, a group of dams and offspring were similarly exposed for another 22days. Controls were sham-exposed. The data showed that DECT base radiation exposure caused heart rate increase in the embryos on the 17th day of pregnancy. Moreover, significant changes on the newborns' somatometric characteristics were noticed. Pyramidal cell loss and glia fibrilliary acidic protein (GFAP) over-expression were detected in the CA4 region of the hippocampus of the 22-day old pups that were irradiated either during prenatal life or both pre- and postnatally. Changes in the integrity of the brain in the 22-day old pups could potentially be related to developmental behavioral changes during the fetal period.
