Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate has been shown to reduce ischaemic-induced brain damage in rabbits and gerbils. In view of these findings, we investigated the effects of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate on delayed neuronal death, following bilateral forebrain ischaemia, in the gerbil hippocampus at the fourth day of reperfusion. We subjected gerbils to bilateral forebrain ischaemia for 20 min. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was administered: intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 g/kg in saline in hr before the occlusion or at a dose of 1 g/kg 1 hr before the occlusion and every 24 hr for 3 days; or intraventricularly at a dose of 0.1 g/kg just after the carotid occlusion. No significant differences in the number of dying cells in the CA1 area were found between each group of treated animals when compared with controls. This study suggests that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, administered according to these three different schedules, fails to ameliorate delayed neuronal death after 20 min of bilateral forebrain ischaemia in the CA1 area of the gerbil hippocampus.
