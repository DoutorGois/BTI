Seven mice of Balb/C strain were implanted with electrodes to perform sleep-waking recordings. In 100% of the cases, the mice showed, prior to paradoxical sleep, the intermediate stage of sleep characterized by high-amplitude cortical spindles interspersed with slow waves and low-frequency theta rhythm in the dorsal hippocampus. Consequently, the intermediate stage which seems to correspond to a transient functional isolated forebrain does exist in the rat, cat and mouse. in the rat, cat and mouse.
