A relatively small number of inhibitory interneurons can control the excitability and synchronization of large numbers of pyramidal neurons in hippocampus and other cortical regions. Thus, anesthetic modulation of interneurons could play an important role during anesthesia. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of a general anesthetic, halothane, on membrane and synaptic properties of rat hippocampal interneurons. GABA receptor-mediated IPSCs were recorded with whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in visually identified CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons located at the border of stratum lacunosum-moleculare and stratum radiatum. Halothane (0.35 mm congruent with 1.2 vol%) depressed evoked IPSC amplitudes recorded from both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons. Also, halothane considerably prolonged the decay time constant of evoked IPSCs in pyramidal cells and interneurons. The frequencies of miniature IPSCs were increased by halothane (two- to threefold) in both types of neuron. On the other hand, halothane effects on resting membrane potentials were variable but minimal in both types of neurons. In current-clamp recordings, halothane depressed EPSP amplitudes and increased IPSP amplitudes recorded from both types of neurons. In addition, halothane increased the failure rate of synaptically evoked action potentials. Taken together, these data provide evidence that halothane increases GABA(A) receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition between synaptically connected interneurons and depresses excitatory transmission, similar to effects observed in pyramidal neurons.
