We have studied the effect of intrahippocampal administration of quinolinic acid (QUIN) on the temporal expression of mRNAs encoding the immediate early genes (IEGs) c-fos and NGFI-A, by in situ hybridization histochemistry. After administration of QUIN to the left hippocampus, expression of mRNA of both IEGs was transiently stimulated. Maximal expression was found between 1 and 3 h. mRNA of both IEGs was simultaneously expressed in the ipsilateral and contralateral sides in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 and CA3 fields as well as in the cortex. After pretreatment with the non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 (2 mg/kg i.p. -30 min) the increased expression of both IEGs was partially prevented in the hippocampus and completely in the cortex. No inhibition was observed after treatment with the AMPA antagonist NBQX (30 mg/kg i.p. -15, -5 and +10 min). Additional delayed expression of both IEGs was observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus. This expression was related to cell damage. Twelve h after QUIN administration, c-fos and NGFI-A mRNAs were present in the dentate gyrus. After 4 days, only c-fos mRNA was observed in the dentate gyrus and CA1 field while no NGFI-A mRNA was detected. The present results show that the effect of QUIN is mediated by NMDA and not by AMPA receptors.
