OBJECTIVE: We investigated neurotrophic activity of extracts from pre-degenerated and non-pre-degenerated peripheral nerves (complete extracts and extracts with fractions of narrower range of molecular weight) on the injured hippocampus. METHODS: The experiment was carried out on male Wistar C rats. The complete extracts or fractions with different ranges of molecular weight were introduced to the site of injury with the autologous connective tissue chambers. We examined DiI-labeled hippocampal cell and AChE-positive nerve endings to assess the regeneration intensity. RESULTS: The highest number of labeled hippocampal cells was observed in the group treated with fraction of molecular weight 10-100 kDa (72.5 +/- 13.7) obtained from pre-degenerated nerves. We observed the presence of AChE-positive fibers inside all examined chambers. DISCUSSION: These results demonstrate that suitable modification of CNS environments by introducing the protein fractions obtained from peripheral nerves can initiate the regeneration of the damaged hippocampal structure in adult rats. Moreover, it is possible to intensify their neurotrophic effect by former pre-degeneration of peripheral nerves and extraction from the entire extract proteins of molecular weight of 10-100 kDa.
