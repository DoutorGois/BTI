Fluctuating levels of estradiol and progesterone during the estrous cycle may induce structural changes in several brain nuclei including the hippocampus, where some neurons express estrogen receptors. Nitric oxide plays a wide range of functions in the nervous system generally by acting as a neurotransmitter-like molecule. It has been demonstrated that long-term treatments with estradiol in ovariectomized females and with testosterone in castrated males induce neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression in rat hypothalamus, whereas changes in nNOS immunoreactivity or in associated NADPH-diaphorase activity were observed both in hypothalamus and in amygdala during different phases of estrous cycle. Estradiol could induce nNOS expression in several brain regions in rodents. Therefore, to clarify if the hippocampal NO producing system is a target for gonadal hormones in physiological conditions, we have investigated the effects of estrous cycle in the expression of nNOS immunoreactivity on two-month-old intact female mice. Immunoreactive cells were observed in all hippocampal subregions: the higher number was detected in the pyramidal layer of CA1 region and in polymorph layer of dentate gyrus. The number of nNOS positive neurons fluctuates during the estrous cycle, reaching its peak during proestrus and metaestrus, and these variations were statistically significant in CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions. These results suggest that the nitrinergic system is a target for estrogen action in the hippocampus, and that this action may take place in physiological conditions according to the short-term variations of gonadal hormones during the estrous cycle.
