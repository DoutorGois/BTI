The hippocampal dentate gyrus is a major recipient of olfactory input in rodents, via connections from the olfactory (piriform) cortex and the olfactory bulb to the entorhinal cortex. Given this connectivity and the known role of activity in dentate gyrus granule cell survival, the present experiment examined the immediate effects of loss of olfactory input to the hippocampus on apoptosis. Adults rats underwent unilateral or bilateral olfactory bulb ablations (OBX), and allowed to recover 24-72 h before the piriform cortex and hippocampal dentate gyrus were processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL] of apoptotic cells. OBX transiently increased TUNEL-positive cells in the ipsilateral piriform cortex and dentate gyrus. Increased TUNEL-labeling was apparent within 24h in both structures, but was more extensive and prolonged in piriform cortex. The results suggest a trans-synaptic regulation of cell survival through at least two synapses.
