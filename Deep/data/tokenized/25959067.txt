Loss of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) correlates with cognitive deficits in Alzheimer disease (AD). Our recent evidence suggests that chronic exposure to Abeta up-regulated neuronal alpha7-nAChRs and increased neuronal excitability in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, the impact of the up-regulated alpha7-nAChRs on Abeta-induced neurotoxicity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of alpha7-nAChRs in the mediation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. The effects of Abeta exposure on alpha7-nAChRs and cytotoxicity were examined using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, atomic force microscope (AFM) imaging, immunoprecipitation, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay in primary cultured hippocampal neurons as well as differentiated human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells with cholinergic characteristics. We found that alpha7-nAChRs are necessary for Abeta-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons because chronic Abeta significantly increased LDH level in hippocampal cultures, which was prevented by either alpha7-nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) or by alpha7 subunit gene deletion (cultures prepared from nAChR alpha7 subunit KO mice), whereas beta2-containing nAChR antagonist (dihydro-beta-erythroidine, DhbetaE) or the genetic deletion of nAChR beta2 subunit (cultures prepared from beta2 KO mice) failed to prevent Abeta-induced toxicity. In SH-SY5Y cells, larger aggregates of Abeta preferentially up-regulated alpha7-nAChR expression and function accompanied by a significant decrease in cell viability. Co-treatment MLA, but not mecamylamine (MEC), prevented Abeta exposure-induced neurotoxicity. Our results suggest a detrimental role of upregulated alpha7-nAChRs in the mediation of Abeta-induced neurotoxicity.
