We herein report the case of a 26-year-old woman with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis presenting with ophthalmoplegia and flaccid paraplegia. She developed disorientation and hallucination after fever and vomiting. Hypothermia, hypoventilation, hypertension, paralytic ileus and hyponatremia were present. Neurological examination showed mild consciousness disturbance and bilateral ophthalmoplegia on admission, flaccid paraplegia with leg areflexia on Day 4. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Motor nerve conduction velocity was decreased in the tibial and peroneal nerves. F-wave amplitudes were reduced in the tibial nerve. MRI disclosed lesions in the callosal splenium, hippocampus and cerebral subarachnoid regions. In addition to various encephalitic symptoms, physicians should pay more attention to peripheral nerve damage in patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.
