Expression of m1 and m3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors mRNAs was examined in rat hippocampus following either: (1) kindling to five Stage 5 amygdala-kindled seizures; or (2) eight electroconvulsive shock (ECS) seizures. Twenty-four hours after the last seizure of either type, there was a significant decrease in both m1 and m3 mRNAs in CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus subfields of the hippocampus. Twenty-eight days after the last seizure of either type, there was a significant increase in m1 mRNAs in CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus; for m3 mRNAs, there was a significant increase in CA3 28 days after the last ECS seizure, and in CA1 and CA3 28 days after the last kindled seizure. These results suggest that seizures alter the cholinergic system in the hippocampus, and that some of the alterations are very long-lasting.
