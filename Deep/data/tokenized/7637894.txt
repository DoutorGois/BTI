The effect of unilateral or bilateral lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) on the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were assessed using microanatomical and electrophysiological techniques. NBM is the main cholinergic basal forebrain nucleus that supplies the fronto-parietal cortex. Lesions were induced using the neurotoxin ibotenic acid or a radio-frequency system and did not affect glutamic acid decarboxylase activity both in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus. At 4 weeks after lesioning, a loss of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and of ChAT-immunoreactive fibres was observed in the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus and no changes in the density of granule neurons of the dentate gyrus or in the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) were noticeable. At 8 weeks after lesioning the loss of both ChAT activity and of ChAT-immunoreactive fibres persisted in the frontal cortex of NBM-lesioned rats. Moreover, at this time a significant decrease in the density of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus accompanied by a reduced probability of dentate LTP induction were observed in both ibotenic acid- and radio-frequency-lesioned rats. These findings have shown that although NBM does not send direct cholinergic projections to the hippocampus, lesions of this cholinergic nucleus are accompanied by delayed neurodegenerative changes involving the dentate gyrus. This suggests the occurrence of indirect connections between NBM and the hippocampus, the functional relevance of which should be explored.
