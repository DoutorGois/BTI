INTRODUCTION: Aim of the present study is to evaluate homolateral and contralateral hippocampus (H-H, C-H, respectively) dose during Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy (FSRT) or Radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases (BM). MATERIALS & METHODS: Patients with BM<5, size</=30mm, KPS>/=80 and a life expectancy>3months, were considered for SRS/FSRT (total dose 15-30Gy, 1-5 fractions). For each BM, a Flattening Filter Free (FFF) Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) plan was generated with one or two arcs. Hippocampi were not considered during optimizations phase and were contoured and evaluated retrospectively in terms of dose: the Dmedian, Dmean, D0.1cc and the V1Gy, V2Gy, V5Gy and V10Gy were analyzed. RESULTS: From April 2014 to December 2015, 81 BM were treated with FFF-FSRT/SRS. For the H-H, the average values of Dmedian, Dmean and D0.1cc were 1.5Gy, 1.54Gy and 2.2Gy, respectively, while the V1Gy, V2Gy, V5Gy and V10Gy values were 25%, 8.9%, 8.9% and 2.1%, respectively. For the C-H, the average Dmedian, Dmean and D0.1cc were 0.7Gy, 0.7Gy, 0.9Gy, respectively, while the average values of V1Gy, V2Gy, V5Gy and V10Gy were 18%, 10.2%, 2.8% and 1.4%, respectively. Tumor dimension, tumor cranial-caudal length and the distance between BM and H-H were correlated to Dmedian, Dmean and D0.1cc. For C-H, only the distance from PTV was correlated with a dose reduction. CONCLUSION: During FFF-FSRT/SRS, hippocampus received a negligible dose. Despite its clinical significance is still under evaluation, in patients with a long life expectancy, H-H should be considered during Linac-based FSRT/SRS.
