We assessed whether consumption of a diet lacking in tryptophan (TRP) resulted in alteration in learning and memory performance and hippocampal 5-HT release in rats. Two hours after the acute administration of TRP-free (T) and balanced (B) diet rats were trained in a one-trial passive avoidance task. The two groups of rats showed no significant difference in retention latencies. Two other groups of rats, fed with the above diets during the acquisition of a radial-arm maze task, showed no difference in baseline performance. The acute ingestion of the T diet produced a significant and long lasting decrease of hippocampal and cortical 5-HT release in rats when compared to the B diet, while the 12th day of the T diet, 5-HT was not detectable in the dialysate. These data indicate that the diminished brain release of 5-HT induced by a T diet is not sufficient to impair cognitive processes.
