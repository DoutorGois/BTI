Neuroscientists have become increasingly aware and accepting of the concept that astrocytes likely have many important functions in the CNS. One limitation in establishing these functions is the usual problem of what constitutes suitable experimental approaches. A major experimental step for functional studies of astrocytes has been the widespread use of primary astrocyte cultures, an approach that Leif Hertz pioneered. However, it is now becoming clear that, building on this work, an experimental paradigm shift is now needed. Namely, to increasingly study preparations corresponding to in situ conditions, such as slices. An alternative experimental system where the cells have some of the technical advantages of primary astrocyte cultures is freshly isolated astrocytes. Recent experiments from our laboratory have shown metabotropic glutamate receptor expression by such cells. Examples are given of how functional receptor studies and channel activity measured by patch clamp electrophysiology can be combined with single cell RT-PCR to define further the receptor or channel type are described to illustrate the uses of such preparations.
