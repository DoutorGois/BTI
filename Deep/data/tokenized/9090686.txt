The immunohistochemical localization and changes in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) were examined in 14 neonates with pontosubicular neuron necrosis (PSN), as compared with those in 15 controls in which the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells showed SOD immunoreactivity. In the temporal lobes and hippocampus with PSN, Cu, Zn-SOD reactivity was negative in neurons at 0 and 1 days after birth, but was positive after 5 days of age in 8 of 10 cases. In the pons and cerebellum, SOD-positive neurons appeared soon after birth, but eosinophilic or karyorrhectic neurons were SOD negative. On the other hand, glial cells were positive after birth in all cases of PSN, and their reactivity was increased in the cases of reactive astrogliosis. Early loss of the scavenging system directed at free radicals may lead to neuronal damage, and the induction of Cu, Zn-SOD may act as a defense mechanism against damage of neurons in neonates with PSN. Therefore, oxygen-derived free radicals may be one of the pathogenetic factors of PSN with characteristics of apoptosis in neonates.
