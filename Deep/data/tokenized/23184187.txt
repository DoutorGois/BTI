The effect of Arsenosugar on motor function and contextual memory-related to place and event; the extent of DNA damage and oxidative stress in male swiss albino mice was investigated. Passive avoidance test was used for memory test; rota motor test was used for motor function. Several biochemical parameters were used for assessing oxidative stress due to arsenosugar ingestion. Decreased passive avoidance time and decreased retention time in rotating rod indicated disruption of normal neurobehavior. Significant dose-dependent DNA damage was found in mice blood and brain. Decreased super oxide dismutase, increased lipid peroxidation, decreased protein sulfohydryl content, increased protein carbonyl content in blood and hippocampal tissue; glutathione in blood and glutathione peroxidase in hippocampal tissue indicated the ability of arsenosugar to cause oxidative stress. This study concludes with evidence that arsenosugar ingestion causes higher oxidative stress, increases DNA damage in the blood and hippocampus in vivo. This might be responsible for the dysfunction of cognitive and motor functions. However, further investigation is suggested for deciphering the biomolecular mechanism.
