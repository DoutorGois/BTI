We induced brief secondarily generalized seizures of limbic origin in Sprague-Dawley rats by bicuculline microinfusion into the anterior piriform cortex. After 1 h or 5 days we performed comet assay, a sensitive marker for DNA damage, within entorhinal cortex, hippocampus (limbic areas recruited by seizure spreading) and striatum (which is not recruited). DNA damage occurred selectively in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at 1 h, but not at 5 days. These data shed new light on molecular genetics as a marker during limbic seizures, the most common in epileptic patients.
