The processing of visual information during learning and memory is considered to be a vital function of the hippocampus. Some researchers believe that the sole purpose of the hippocampus is to process visuo-spatial information, whereas other investigators believe that the hippocampus integrates cues from multiple sources. In the current studies, we tested the effects of vision loss on a hippocampal task, acquisition and retention with T-maze footshock avoidance conditioning. Acquisition and retention, in adult-blinded mice, were not significantly impaired in T-maze footshock avoidance. Blindness did not affect activity, footshock startle or motivation to avoid shock. The same doses of memory enhancing drugs that improve memory in sighted mice improved memory in blind mice. Electrolytic lesions in blind mice, which destroyed 31+/-4% of the hippocampus, significantly impaired acquisition and retention for T-maze footshock avoidance and so demonstrated that the hippocampus retained its integrative role in blind mice. The current findings show that blind mice are as capable of learning T-maze footshock avoidance as sighted mice and that the hippocampus retains its important role in blind mice in learning and memory processing. It is concluded that the T-maze footshock avoidance conditioning task is a spatially but not visually dependent task that is hippocampally dependent.
