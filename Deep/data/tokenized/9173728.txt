The main hypothesis developed in the paper proposes that the events of the subjective experience emerge as a result of the synthesis of three kinds of information in crucial for this mental function cortical areas. This information includes sensory one, information derived from memory and one coming from motivational centers. The hypothesis is based on researches of the brain mechanisms of perception and thinking. It has been shown that the sensation emerges as a result of the synthesis of information on physical parameters and of significance of the stimulus in the projection cortex neurons. This synthesis is provided by the circular spreading of the nerve impulses from the projection cortex to associative cortex, then to hippocampus and the hypothalamic motivation centers with the subsequent return of the impulsation to the projection cortex. It have been shown also that at thinking operations the cortical connections converge to define centers named the interaction foci. Their topography is specific for particular thinking operations. Thus in imaginative thinking the foci are located in temporo-parietal and in abstract-verbal thinking--in frontal cortex. It is proposed that the confrontation and the synthesis of information in the interaction foci result in decision making. The last part of the paper concerns the functional role of the subjective events and their possible influence on brain processes.
