The present study was designed to clarify the time-dependent changes in brain monoamine turnover in the frontal cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, septum and amygdala after ovariectomy, and the difference in behavioral responses to psychological stress between sham-operated and ovariectomized (OVX) rats. At 2 and 4 weeks after ovariectomy, the turnover rates of dopamine and norepinephrine in all of the brain regions examined did not differ significantly between the sham-operated and OVX rats. However, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) turnover in all of the brain regions at 2 weeks after OVX was significantly lower than that in sham-operated rats. This difference was greater in the hypothalamus than in other brain regions. At 4 weeks after ovariectomy, 5-HT turnover in all of the brain regions examined was not significantly different between sham-operated and OVX rats. At 2 and 4 weeks after ovariectomy, exploratory behaviour (e.g., locomotor activity, head- dipping, crossing and rearing behaviours) in a non-stressed ovariectomy group did not differ from that in a non-stressed sham-operation group. Locomotor activity and the number of head-dips and crossings significantly (P<0.05) increased after repeated exposure to psychological stress for 5 days in sham-operated rats, but not in those at 2 weeks after OVX. At 4 weeks after ovariectomy, locomotor activity and the number of crossings and rearings in sham-operated and OVX rats were not significantly different in the psychological stress and non-stress groups. However, the number of head-dips significantly (P<0.05) increased with psychological stress in the sham-operated rats, but not in OVX rats. These results suggest that female gonadal hormones may play an important role in the regulation of brain 5-HTergic systems. These interactions between gonadal hormones and 5-HT metabolism may be related to 5-HT-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
