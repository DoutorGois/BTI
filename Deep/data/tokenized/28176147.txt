Several Src family kinase (SFK) members are expressed in the mammalian brain and serve as key kinases in the regulation of a variety of cellular and synaptic events. These SFKs may be subject to the modulation by dopamine, although this topic has been investigated incompletely. In this study, we explored whether dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) regulate SFKs in adult rat brains in vivo. We investigated the role of D2Rs in two forebrain areas, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus, since dopamine plays a pivotal role in regulating activity of mPFC and hippocampal neurons and D2Rs are expressed in these regions. We found that a systemic injection of a D2R selective antagonist eticlopride elevated phosphorylation of SFKs at a conserved autophosphorylation site, an event correlated with activation of SFKs, in the mPFC. Similarly, antagonism of D2Rs by haloperidol increased SFK phosphorylation. In contrast, eticlopride and haloperidol did not alter SFK phosphorylation in the hippocampus. The effect of eticlopride was time-dependent and relatively delayed. Among two common SFK members enriched at synaptic sites, eticlopride selectively altered phosphorylation of Fyn but not Src. Our data suggest that D2Rs exert an inhibitory effect on the activity-related phosphorylation of Fyn in the mPFC under normal conditions.
