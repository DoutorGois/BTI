The influence of transient forebrain ischemia on the temporal alteration of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II) in the rat hippocampus was analysed by the immunohistochemical method using antigen-affinity purified polyclonal antibodies against CaM kinase II of rat brain. Six to twenty-four hours after ischemia, CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells, and dentate granule cells lost CaM kinase II immunoreactivity in neuronal perikarya, although immunoreactivity in the dendritic fields was preserved. The recovery of immunoreactivity of the CA3 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells was noted 3 days after recirculation. Seven days after ischemia, immunoreactivity in the CA1 subfield was greatly reduced. These results suggest that CaM kinase II molecules in the CA1 subfield are preferentially located on the CA1 pyramidal cells and that CaM kinase II plays a critical role in the reconstruction of neuronal cytoskeleton and neuronal networks damaged by ischemic insult.
