INTRODUCTION: Volumetric analysis of brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) measures structural changes associated with neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In recent years several studies have shown the utility of the volumetric measurement of the medial temporal lobe structures, especially the amygdala and the hippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy, memory disorders, Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia. AIM: The purpose of this study was to measure and establish our normal values of the hippocampus and amygdala volumes. METHODS: All studies were performed using a 1.0 T Siemens unit with FISP 3D sequence. One millimeter, contiguous coronal scans of 40 healthy volunteers aged 19-26 years were obtained. The regions of interest were outlined using a mouse driven cursor. To determine the anatomic boundaries of the hippocampus and the amygdala the authors followed a generally accepted protocol previously described by C. Watson. RESULTS: The mean right and left hippocampal volumes were 2.12 cm3 (SD = 0.31) and 2.07 cm3 (SD = 0.3) and the mean right and left amygdaloid volume were 1.19 cm3 (SD = 0.19) and 1.2 cm3 (SD = 0.2) respectively. The mean asymmetry between the right and left hippocampus and amygdala was 3.17% and 3.48%, respectively. The inter-observer reliability range (alpha) was between 0.97 and 0.77. Subregional analysis of hippocampus was calculated as well. CONCLUSIONS: Normal volumetric data measured in our study fell in the midrange of the values in the literature. The volumetric analysis of the hippocampal subregions may allow assessment of providing more sensitive determination of the atrophic area, which may be important in epileptic disorders.
