The expression of metalloproteinase MMP-1 was traced in frontal sections of the rat brain in normal conditions and 4 h after an intraperitoneal injection of kainate. In the olfactory lobe, immunoreactivity was normally detected in the lateral olfactory tract. Kainate treatment led to the appearance of additional immunoreactivity in the neuropilar tracts. In the hippocampal part of brain, immunoreactive neurons were found exclusively after the kainate treatment in several hypothalamic and amygdalar nuclei, and in the restricted cortex areas (clusters of neurons in layers 3-4 of cortex, and a stripe of cells in layer 6). In the area between the hippocampus and cerebellum, MMP-1-like immunoreactivity was normally present in the entorhinal cortex, in the lateral periaqueductal gray, and in the pontine nucleus. After kainate treatment, the immunoreactive neurons were also found in the medial entorhinal cortex and in the dorsal raphe nucleus. In the brain stem, the immunoreactive cells were normally found in six nuclei. After kainate treatment, additional immunoreactivity appeared in the inferior olive neurons and in tracts supplying the cerebellar cortex. Thus, MMP-1 is present in several brain areas in normal conditions at a detectable level, and its expression increases after kainate-induced seizures.
