Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channels are expressed in the central nervous system, but their role in regulating the aging process under physiological and pathological conditions is still largely unknown. To identify age-related changes in the TRPV4 channel that contribute to the central nervous system, we investigated the distribution of TRPV4 in the brain and spinal cord regions of adult and aged rats. The expression of TRPV4 in the brain and spinal cord of adult and aged Sprague-Dawley rats was compared using immunohistochemistry performed with antibodies recognizing TRPV4 on free floating sections and western blotting analysis. TRPV4 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, thalamus, basal nuclei, cerebellum and spinal cord of aged rats compared with adult control rats. In the cerebral cortex, TRPV4 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in pyramidal cells of aged rats. In addition, TRPV4 immunoreactivity was increased in the spinal cord, hippocampal formation, thalamus, basal nuclei and cerebellum of aged rats. This first demonstration of age-related increases in TRPV4 expression in the brain and spinal cord may provide useful data for investigating the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. The exact regulatory mechanism and its functional significance require further elucidation.
