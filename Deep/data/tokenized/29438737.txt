Different conditions induce proliferation, migration and integration of new neurons in the adult brain. This process of neurogenesis is a clear example of long lasting plastic changes in the brain of different species. Sexual behavior is a motivated behavior that is crucial for the survival of the species, but an individual can spend all his life without displaying sexual behavior. In the present review, we briefly describe some of the effects of pheromones on neurogenesis. We review in detail studies describing the effects of sexual behavior in both males and females on proliferation, migration and integration of new cells and neurons. It will become evident that most of the studies have been done in rodents, assessing the effects of this behavior on neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone - rostral migratory stream - olfactory bulb system.
