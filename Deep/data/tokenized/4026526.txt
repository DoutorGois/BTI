The ability of the pulvinar-lateralis posterior nucleus complex (P-LP) to evoke epileptic activity when stimulated, was studied in 20 adult cats. Twelve animals were analyzed after they recovered from the surgical procedure (chronic model). In seven of them a cannula with electrodes was implanted in the P-LP and one twisted bipolar electrode was placed ipsilaterally in the following structures: hippocampus, superior colliculus, caudate nucleus and cerebral cortex. Through the cannula Na penicillin was injected. The electrodes allowed both to stimulate and to record the electrical activity. In the remaining five cats, the cannula was implanted in hippocampus in order to compare its sensitivity to generate epileptic activity to that of P-LP. Another group of eight cats were surgically implanted and studied in the same day (acute model). In four of them the cannula was placed in the P-LP through the temporal pathway, to avoid crossing the hippocampus and the ventricle. In another four, penicillin was injected in the P-LP after suctioning the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus overlying the former structure. Epileptic activity could be induced in P-LP and it spread rapidly to hippocampus and after a while to the other implanted structures. This was observed both with penicillin and electrical stimulation. The sensitivity of P-LP to generate epileptic activity was lower than that of the hippocampus. In particular, it was necessary to use two to ten times more penicillin and three times the electrical current intensity in the P-LP as compared to the values needed in the hippocampus. These results are discussed in view of the controversial problem about the ability of the thalamus to generate and spread epileptic activity.
