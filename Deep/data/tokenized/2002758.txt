The present studies were carried out to explore a role of the hippocampal efferents in the development of the locomotor augmentation induced by repeated methamphetamine administrations. For this purpose, electrolytic lesions of either the dorsal fornix or the fimbria fornix were made bilaterally in rats. The latter treatment, not the former, blocked the behavioral sensitization. These results suggest that the hippocampo-accumbal pathway may play an important role in the development of the sensitization.
