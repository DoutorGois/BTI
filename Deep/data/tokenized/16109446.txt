Alterations in maternal dietary choline availability during days 12-17 of pregnancy led to an increase in the level of immunoreactive netrin-1 and a decrease in the level of DCC protein in the developing fetal mouse brain hippocampus compared with controls. Changes in the expression of cell migration cues during development could account for some of the lifelong consequences of maternal dietary choline availability for cognitive and memory processes.
