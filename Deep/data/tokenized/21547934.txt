The concentration of brain N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) in mice was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using fluorescence detection after pre-column derivatization with 4-N,N-dimethylaminosulfonyl-7-N-(2-aminoethyl)amino-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (DBD-ED). Six different brain parts, namely, the prefrontal cortex, olfactory bulb, nucleus accumbens, striatum, cerebellum and hippocampus, of male C57BL6/J mice, were investigated. The NAA concentration (nmol/mg protein) was highest in the olfactory bulb (58.2 +/- 4.0, n = 8) and lowest in the hippocampus (42.8 +/- 1.6, n = 8). The proposed HPLC method with fluorescence detection was successfully used to determine the NAA concentration in each investigated brain area.
