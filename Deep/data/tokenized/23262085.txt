Seizure disorder is a chronic condition in the brain that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of this disorder and can cause neuronal injury. Approximately one in three treated patients suffers from seizures regardless of pharmacological intervention, which results in oxidative damage. The present study aims to investigate the possible protective effect of antioxidant-rich Vitis labrusca extract on pentylenetetrazol-induced oxidative damage in Wistar rats. Possible behavioral alterations, genotoxic and mutagenic effects of the extract were also evaluated. The results showed that V. labrusca extract provides a significant protective effect against oxidative damage to lipids and proteins induced by pentylenetetrazol in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and liver of rats. Also, the extract did not alter locomotor behavior. Moreover, it was non-genotoxic and non-mutagenic. Our results suggest the possibility of using V. labrusca extract as a therapeutic agent to minimize neuronal damage associated with seizures.
