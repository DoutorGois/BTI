Using the evoked potentials (EP) studies have been made on functional connections of different fields (CA1, CA3) of the dorsal hippocamp with phylogenetically different parts of the hypothalamus in rabbits. It was shown that during stimulation of both the field CA1 and the field CA3 of the hippocamp, the EP are widely present in nuclear structures of the posterior hypothalamus (supramammilary area, the posterior hypothalamic area, mammilary bodies). In the anterior hypothalamus (area preoptic medialis), the EP were recorded only during stimulation of the field CA1 in the dorsal hippocamp.
