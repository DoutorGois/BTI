Quantitative analysis was performed to evaluate the numbers of principal cells cells and interneurons in differenet layers and areas of the horn of Ammonis, hilus and dentate gyrus 2 weeks and 1 month after kindling--specific electrical stimulation of ventral hippocampus. After both experimental time intervals, a significant cell loss was found in all the layers and areas studied, with the exception of stratum oriens of CA4. Thus, in this model of experimental epilepsy, both interneurons and principal cells were found to be involved in the process of epileptogenesis. Different possibilities of reorganization of intrahippocampal circuits and their participation in increased excitability, typical to epilepsy, are discussed.
