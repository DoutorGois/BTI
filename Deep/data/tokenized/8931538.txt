Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-labeled hexamethylpropylene-amine oxime (HMPAO) was used to evaluate cerebral blood flow in 6 patients with hypoxic brain injury (HBI). The SPECT scans were compared with electroencephalograms (EEGs), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, or computer tomography (CT) scans. The findings on SPECT scans in all 6 patients supported the clinical impression of HBI. SPECT showed decreased perfusion in regions of the brain including the hippocampus, cerebellum white matter, rostral brain stem, the cortex, and occiput. MRI, CT, and EEG provided information that was often not representative of HBI. It was believed that SPECT provided more useful information in the identification of HBI. SPECT imaging with 99mTc HMPAO appears to be a valuable adjunct for evaluation and clinical diagnosis of HBI patients.
