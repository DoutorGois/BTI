Groups of adult male mice were either fed a thiamine-deficient diet for 10 weeks and thereafter treated with ethanol by making them inhale vapourized cane spirit for 10 weeks, or given both treatments simultaneously. The brains of these mice were then searched for degeneration using both light and electron microscopy. No degenerating nerve cells were observed in any animal in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulbs, midbrain or hindbrain. However, axon terminal degeneration was seen in the olfactory bulbs and deep cerebellar nuclei in mice given the combined treatment. No cerebellar degeneration was found and only little degeneration was present in the olfactory bulbs of mice given the two treatments at different times. Thus, the combined treatment of alcohol and thiamine deficiency produced more brain damage than the sum of that produced by the two treatments given separately. This represents the first experimental in vivo demonstration of a biochemical interaction between these two factors in alcohol-related brain damage. The findings of long-term animal treatment with models using thiamine antagonists are compared.
