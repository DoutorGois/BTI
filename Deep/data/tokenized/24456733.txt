Diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment and brain aging, with alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity implicated in these changes. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, readily implemented strategies are increasingly needed in order to protect the brain's cognitive functions. One possibility is resveratrol (RES) (3,5,4- trihydroxystilbene), a polyphenol of the phytoalexin family that has been shown to be protective in a number of neuropathology paradigms. In the present study, we sought to determine whether dietary supplementation with RES has potential for the protection of cognitive functions in diabetes. Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin, and once stable, animals received AIN93G rodent diet supplemented with RES for 6 weeks. Genome-wide expression analysis was conducted on the hippocampus and genes of interest were confirmed by quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction. Genome-wide gene expression analysis of the hippocampus revealed that RES supplementation of the diabetic group resulted in 481 differentially expressed genes compared to non-supplemented diabetic mice. Intriguingly, gene expression that was previously found significantly altered in the hippocampus of diabetic mice, and that is implicated in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Hdac4, Hat1, Wnt7a, ApoE), was normalized following RES supplementation. In addition, pathway analysis revealed Jak-Stat signaling was the most significantly enriched pathway. The Jak-Stat pathway induces a pro-inflammatory signaling cascade, and we found most genes involved in this cascade (e.g. Il15, Il22, Socs2, Socs5) had significantly lower expression following RES supplementation. These data indicate RES could be neuroprotective and beneficial for the maintenance of cognitive function in diabetes.
