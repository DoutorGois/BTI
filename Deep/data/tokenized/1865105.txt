We have developed a technique in which immunofluorescence is combined with in situ hybridization using cDNA and RNA probes to assess the expression and distribution of messenger RNAs (mRNA) by neurons and neuroglia in tissue cultures of the rat dentate gyrus. The probes used in this study include a cDNA probe for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and an RNA probe (cRNA) for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GEAP), an intermediate filament protein subunit expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system. Both ubiquitous (tubulin) and cell type-specific (MAP-2 and GEAP) antibodies were used to identify neurons and neuroglia in culture. Using this procedure, the mRNA for rRNA was found in the cell bodies and large processes of MAP-2-positive neurons and throughout the cytoplasm of GEAP-positive flat astrocytes. In process-bearing astrocytes, GEAP mRNA is concentrated in the cell body, although some hybridization also occurred in astrocyte cell processes. With this combined in situ hybridization-immunofluorescence technique, the expression and distribution of an mRNA can be examined in different immunocytochemically identified cell types under identical culture and hybridization conditions. It is also possible to determine if there is a differential subcellular distribution of an mRNA in a single cell and if the distribution of the mRNA reflects the distribution of the protein itself. Finally, this technique can be utilized to verify the specificity of probes for cell type-specific mRNAs and to determine appropriate hybridization conditions to produce a specific signal.
