AIM AND METHODS: Changes in cerebrospinal fluid osmotic pressure modulate brain excitability. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), which is sensitive to hypotonic stimulation, is expressed in hippocampus. The present study investigated the effect of hypotonic stimulation on hippocampal synaptic transmission and the role of TRPV4 in hypotonicity-action using electrophysiological recording and pharmacological technique. RESULTS: Accompanied with the decrease in paired pulse facilitation, field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) was enhanced by hypotonicity and TRPV4 agonist 4alpha-PDD in hippocampal slices, which was sensitive to TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047. Hypotonicity-induced increase in fEPSP was blocked by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, but not N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor or N- or P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist. High voltage-gated calcium current (ICa ) in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons was not affected by hypotonicity. AMPA-activated current (IAMPA ) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was increased by hypotonicity and 4alpha-PDD, which was attenuated by HC-067047. Inhibition of protein kinase C or protein kinase A markedly attenuated hypotonicity-increased IAMPA , whereas antagonism of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II had no such effect. CONCLUSION: TRPV4 is involved in hypotonicity-induced enhancement of hippocampal synaptic transmission, which may be mediated through promoting presynaptic glutamate release and increasing postsynaptic AMPA receptor function.
