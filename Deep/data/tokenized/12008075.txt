We report a protein factor(s) contained in the conditioned medium (CM) of the Mg(2+)-free treatment induced the synaptic potentiation. This type of potentiation shared a different pathway from those induced by neurotrophins. Neurotrophins were confirmed to induce a synaptic potentiation in the dissociated chick neurons. Furthermore, K252a, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, abolished this potentiation. Nevertheless, the potentiation induced by the CM was not blocked by K252a. In addition, the CM prepared from the chick neurons induced a similar potentiation in rat and mouse neurons. These results suggest that the protein factor is a novel protein molecule for inducing the potentiation and it plays a critical role in the common mechanism for the potentiation between avian and mammal.
