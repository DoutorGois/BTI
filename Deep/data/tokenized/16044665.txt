Astrocytes have long been considered as merely structural support for neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). However, more recent evidence has demonstrated roles for astrocytes in both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. One major role is in the modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Astrocytes can also modulate inflammatory responses in the CNS; they contain high levels of antioxidants and mediate neuronal protection after physiological assault, as well as releasing neurotrophic factors and being important to neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus. Targeting astrocytes as mediators for neuroprotective drugs may be a promising strategy.
