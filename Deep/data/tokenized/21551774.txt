Submicrosomal fractions obtained from pre-degenerated distal stumps of sciatic nerves were implanted by means of connective tissue chambers into the injured hippocampus for 8 and 18 weeks. The nerve stumps were allowed to pre-degenerate for 7, 28 and 35 days. The neuronal outgrowth was examined by means of FITC-HRP injected into the chamber. Eight weeks postoperatively the greatest number of traced cells was present in brains treated with the fraction obtained from nerves pre-degenerated for 7 days. Eighteen weeks following implantation the greatest number of FITC-HRP positive cells was found in brains grafted with the fraction from nerves pre-degenerated for 35 days.
