Ferroportin1 is a newly discovered transmembrane iron export protein. It plays a key role in Fe(2+) transport across the basal membrane of enterocytes in the gut. It has been suggested that this protein might have the same role in Fe(2+) transport across the abluminal membrane of the blood-brain barrier as it works in enterocytes. However, the presence of ferroportin1 in the brain has not been well determined. In the present study, we investigated expression of ferroportin1 protein in different brain regions, including cortex, hippocampus, striatum and substantia nigra, in developing male Sprague-Dawley rats. The results provided direct evidence for the existence of ferroportin1 protein in the rat brain. All brain areas examined have the ability to synthesize ferroportin1 protein. The findings also showed that age has a significant effect on the expression of ferroportin1 protein in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and substantia nigra of the rat brain.
