Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele located on chromosome 19 is a major genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the direct effects of ApoE4 on the cognitive function and long-term synaptic plasticity have not fully investigated. At the same time, although amyloid beta protein (Abeta)-ApoE complexes are principal components of AD-associated brain damage, there is still lack of in vivo study on the effects of co-existed Abeta1-40 and ApoE4. In the present study, we examined the effects of ApoE4 on the spatial memory and hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) by using Morris water maze test and in vivo field potential recording, compared the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-40 and ApoE4, and investigated the effects of co-application of Abeta1-40 and ApoE4 on cognitive behavior and synaptic plasticity. The results showed that intracerebrovenrticular (i.c.v.) injection of Abeta1-40 or ApoE4 significantly and similarly impaired spatial learning and memory, and depressed the high-frequency stimulus (HFS) induced LTP. Importantly, compared to the effects of Abeta1-40 or ApoE4 alone, co-injection of Abeta1-40 and ApoE4 produced much heavier damages in cognitive behaviors and long term synaptic plasticity. These results demonstrated that ApoE4 not only exerted direct neurotoxicity but also enhanced the neurotoxicity of Abeta1-40 on spatial cognitive function and hippocampal LTP, which maybe partly elucidates the mechanism by which APOE4 allele exerted negative effects as a major genetic risk factor for developing AD.
