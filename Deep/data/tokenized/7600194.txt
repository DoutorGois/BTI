This experiment was conducted to ascertain whether or not hypertonic saline solution (HSS) has preventive effects on delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of the gerbil. Twenty-eight gerbils were anesthetized with 1% halothane and 50% nitrous oxide during the experimental period. Their common carotid arteries were occluded bilaterally for 2.5 min, immediately after which 2 mL/kg of 10% NaCl was infused via the tail vein. Two mL/kg of physiological saline solution (PSS) was used for the control group in the same manner. 5 days later, after the cerebrum was removed, the hippocampus was stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and histopathological changes in the CA1 subfield were observed under the light microscope. Degenerative or necrotic pyramidal cells were compared among groups. The degeneration rates of the pyramidal cells were as follows; after sham operation with PSS, 4.2 +/- 1.8%; after sham operation with HSS, 6.5 +/- 3.3%; on ischemia-reperfusion with PSS, 95.6 +/- 1.6%; on ischemia-reperfusion with HSS, 7.1 +/- 3.0%. This study suggested that hypertonic saline might prevent delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of gerbils subjected to cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
