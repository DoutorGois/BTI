Glutamate and GABA are the principle neurotransmitters of the cerebral cortex and are known to modulate dopaminergic function. Evidence of structural abnormalities in the cortex raises the possibility that schizophrenia involves disturbances of cortical amino-acid neurotransmission. The psychotomimetic effects of phencyclidine, a glutamate antagonist, have been taken to suggest that schizophrenia involves reduced brain glutamate function. Direct evidence for diminished glutamate function in schizophrenia is lacking. However, in polar temporal cortex and hippocampus we reported evidence of an asymmetric loss of glutamate terminals, and of reduced GABA function, which may be secondary to the loss of glutamatergic input. Glutamate cell body markers are spared in temporal lobe; the neurones which degenerate may originate in frontal cortex. A number of studies have reported increases in markers of glutamatergic cell bodies and terminals in orbital frontal cortex in schizophrenia. These findings are consistent with the presence of an abnormally abundant glutamatergic innervation, which may be the result of an arrest in the normal process of cellular and synaptic elimination which occurs during development. There is evidence that frontal abnormalities in schizophrenia are genetically determined. We suggest that glutamatergic abnormalities in anterior temporal cortex in schizophrenia are the result of the degeneration of fronto-temporal projections. Orbital frontal projections to polar temporal cortex may be prone to degeneration because they arise from an unstable frontal cortical cytoarchitecture which has not completed the normal process of post-natal remodelling. The structural abnormality of the orbital frontal region may confer vulnerability to some intrinsic or extrinsic mechanism, which brings about a progressive degeneration of projections to polar temporal lobe.
