Basing on literature the sources and migration of the olfactory bulb progenitors are described. These progenitors originate in the 1) ventricular zone, 2) subventricular zone, 3) lateral ganglionic eminence, 4) hippocampus, 5) ependymal cells, and 6) subventricular zone astrocytes. Neurons migrate tangentially in the rostral migratory stream. This type of migration is called the chain migration.
