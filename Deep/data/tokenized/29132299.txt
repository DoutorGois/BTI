BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that cyclooxygenase-2, a key enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is involved in anxiety and cognitive processes, but few studies have investigated the effects of chronic administration of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on anxiety, learning and memory under normal physiological conditions. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of chronic administration of parecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, on anxiety behavior and memory performance under normal physiological conditions and to explore the possible neural mechanism underlying parecoxib-mediated effects. METHODS: Adult male ICR mice were randomly divided into four groups: the control group and three parecoxib groups. Mice received normal saline or parecoxib (2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection once a day for 21 days, respectively. Elevated plus-maze, novel object recognition and Y maze tests were conducted on day 23, 24 and 26, respectively. Four additional groups that received same drug treatment were used to measure synaptophysin protein levels by western blot and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels by ELISA in the amygdala and hippocampus on day 26. RESULTS: Chronic parecoxib exerted an anxiolytic-like effect in the plus-maze test test, and enhanced memory performance in the novel object recognition and Y maze tests. Western blot analysis showed that chronic parecoxib down-regulated synaptophysin levels in the amygdala and up-regulated synaptophysin levels in the hippocampus. ELISA assay showed that chronic parecoxib inhibited PGE2 in the hippocampus but not amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic parecoxib exerts anxiolytic-like and memory enhancing effects, which might be mediated through differential modulation of synaptophysin and PGE2 in the amygdala and hippocampus.
