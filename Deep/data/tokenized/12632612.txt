BACKGROUND: NMDA receptor contributes to cause neuronal death in anoxic condition. It is not known how a part of NMDA receptors, NMDA-binding site and/or glycine-binding site, influence neuronal damage in rats' hippocampus in vitro. METHODS: Rats' hippocampus, labeled with norepinephrine (3H-NE), was incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and we measured 3H-NE in superfusion solution and remaining tissue. Glucose was eliminated from aCSF and 95% N2 + 5% CO2 produced the anoxic state. RESULTS: The amount of 3H-NE release increased in anoxia with NMDA (NMDA-binding site agonist), while there was no influence on NMDA receptor in non-anoxic state even after D-serine (glycine-binding site agonist) has been administered. The 3H-NE was released more when D-serine (100 mu mM) and NMDA (100 mu mM) were administered together than when only D-serine (10 mu mM, 100 mu mM, 1000 mu mM) in anoxia or NMDA (10 mu mM, 100 mu mM, 1000 mu mM) in anoxia was administered. CONCLUSION: Glycine-binding site agonist alone does not act significantly but ion channels in NMDA receptor open more and become more effective when both glycine-binding site agonist and NMDA-binding site agonist exist, suggesting that there are interactions between NMDA-binding site and glycine-binding site in NMDA-receptor during anoxia.
