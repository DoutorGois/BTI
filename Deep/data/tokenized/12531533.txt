In this study, a chronological and comparative analysis of the immunoreactivities of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1), Na(+)/HCO(3)(-) cotransporter (NBC) and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCE) was conducted in order to identify the effects of spontaneous seizure on their protein expression levels using the gerbil model. The distribution of NHE1 and NBC immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of seizure-resistant (SR) gerbils was similar to that observed in the pre-seizure group of seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils. From 30 min to 3 h after the onset of the seizure, both NHE1 and NBC immunoreactivities were elevated in the hippocampus, as compared to the pre-seizure group of SS gerbils. At 6 h postictal, these immunoreactivities in the hippocampus had reduced to the pre-seizure level. However, NCE immunoreactivity within the hippocampus was unaltered. These findings suggest that the changes in both NHE1 and NBC immunoreactivity within the hippocampus following seizure may affect tissue excitability and play a role in the reduction of the seizure activity in the gerbil.
