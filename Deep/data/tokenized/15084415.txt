There is evidence that ageing both in humans and animals is accompanied by changes in emotional behaviour. Behavioural studies in rats point to an increase in emotional reactivity and/or anxiety-related behaviour with age. Here we studied social interaction in young adult (3 months) and aged (30 months old) rats using an established test system for anxiety-related behaviour. Using Fos expression as a marker of neuronal activation, we aimed to investigate whether age-related differences in anxiety would be reflected by changes in neuronal activity in brain regions known to be sensitive to fear- and anxiety-related stimuli. Aged rats spent significantly less time (75%) in active social interaction than young rats, without concomitant changes in general locomotor activity. Social interaction enhanced Fos expression both in young and aged rats in several anxiety-related brain areas. Lower Fos response in aged versus young rats was noted in the dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventrolateral part of the periaqueductal grey, the medial and basolateral amygdala and parvocellular region of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, while no differences in Fos expression were observed in the other regions examined, including the hippocampus, septum or locus coeruleus. These results demonstrate age-related reduction in social interaction, indicative of enhanced anxiety-related behaviour in aged rats. However, since the supposedly increased anxiety level was not accompanied by augmented Fos expression in any of the key brain areas of the fear/anxiety circuitry known to be activated by anxiogenic stimuli, it is suggested that reduced social interaction does not reflect enhanced anxiety in aged rats.
