Recently, we have reported that 6R-L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4), a natural cofactor for hydroxylases of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan, has a dopamine releasing action in the rat striatum independent of its cofactor role. Here we studied the effects of 6R-BH4 on acetylcholine (ACh) release in the rat hippocampus using brain microdialysis. Intracerebroventricular injection of 6R-BH4 dose-dependently increased extracellular ACh levels monitored by brain microdialysis. Biopterin, an oxidized form of 6R-BH4, and 6S-BH4, an unnatural diastereoisomer of 6R-BH4, had little effect on the ACh levels. The 6R-BH4-induced increase in ACh levels was eliminated after inhibition of voltage-dependent Na+ channels by tetrodotoxin, but not after depletion of catecholamines by reserpine. These results show that 6R-BH4 has direct ACh releasing action in vivo.
