To study the type of adaptive modification (tolerance vs. sensitization) in different organism's indices following intermittent cocaine (COC) administrations, acute COC (2 mg/kg, SC)-induced changes in heart and breathing rate, response to increasing noxious stimulation, spontaneous EEG and event-related evoked and slow brain potentials (ERP) registered from the occipital cortex and hippocampal CA1 region were investigated in naive rabbits and one subchronically treated with COC (6 injections at a same dose). Tolerance developed for bradycardia, depression of noxious responsiveness, cortical desynchronization and increase of main components of cortical ERP, typical to acute COC, while the changes in breathing and hippocampal ERP were stable. These changes as well as a significant increase due to COC administrations of the basal values of an animal's noxious responsiveness and increase in relative changes in main component of cortical ERP (N205) are considered as a consequence of adaptive changes in neurophysiological/neurochemical substrate accepting COC action and mediating phenomena tolerance-sensitization and dependence typical to the drug.
