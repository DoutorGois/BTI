alpha-Tocopheryl phosphate (alphaTP) is a phosphorylated form of alpha-tocopherol. Since it is phosphorylated in the hydroxyl group that is essential for the antioxidant property of alpha-tocopherol, we hypothesized that alphaTP would modulate the antioxidant system, rather than being an antioxidant agent per se. alpha-TP demonstrated antioxidant activity in vitro against iron-induced oxidative stress in a mitochondria-enriched fraction preparation treated with 30 or 100 microM alpha-TP. However, this effect was not observed ex vivo with mitochondrial-enriched fraction from mice treated with an intracerebroventricular injection of 0.1 or 1 nmol/site of alphaTP. Two days after treatment (1 nmol/site alphaTP), peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) and glutathione reductase (GR) expression and GR activity were decreased in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Glutathione content, glutathione peroxidase, and thioredoxin reductase activities were not affected by alphaTP. In conclusion, the persistent decrease in GR and Prx2 protein content is the first report of an in vivo effect of alphaTP on protein expression in the mouse brain, potentially associated to a novel and biologically relevant function of this naturally occurring compound.
