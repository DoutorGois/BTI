Hypoxia tolerance in the naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber) represents a unique physiological phenomenon characterized by the capability to regulate oxygen demand to attenuate energetically costly response to low oxygen condition. Several aspects of tolerance to hypoxia in the naked mole rat are consistent with a state of neuroprotection; however, it remains to be established if such protective capability is expressed in the brain cells of mole rats subjected to hypoxia insults. The objective of this study was to determine whether evidence of tolerance to oxygen nutrient deprivation exists in the chronic cultures of the naked mole rats hippocampal slices. We used oxygen nutrient deprivation (OND), an in vitro model of hypoxia tolerance, to determine neuronal survival in the hippocampal slices of mole rats and rats (Rattus sp.). Our results indicate that hippocampal slices of mole rats kept in hypoxic condition consistently tolerate OND right from the onset time of 5 hrs and the tolerance to OND is maintained for 24 hrs, suggesting that there is evidence of tolerance to OND in hippocampal slices of mole rats.
