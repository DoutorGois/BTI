PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of 1H spectroscopic imaging (SI) in the mouse brain at 9.4 T, and investigate regional variations in brain metabolites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 21 SI studies were performed in CD-1 mice to evaluate the basal ganglia (N=5), hippocampus and thalamus (N=11), and cerebellum (N=5). We adjusted the B0 homogeneity for each slice using a fully automated shim calculation method based on the B0 map, which we measured using a multislice gradient-echo sequence with multiple phase evolution delays. The SI employed a modified localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (LASER) sequence with TE/TR of 50/2000 msec, 24x24 encodes over a field of view (FOV) of 24 mmx24 mm, 1 microL voxel resolution, and two averages, for a total acquisition time of 38 minutes. RESULTS: Sufficient shimming was achieved and high-quality spectra were consistently obtained in each slice. N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr) ratios in the basal ganglia and thalamus (0.86+/-0.07, and 0.87+/-0.07, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the hippocampus and cerebellum (0.76+/-0.03 and 0.67+/-0.07), which were also significantly different from each other. CONCLUSION: 1H SI of the mouse brain is highly reproducible and allows differences in regional metabolite ratios to be easily visualized.
