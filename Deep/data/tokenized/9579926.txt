PURPOSE: To investigate changes in hippocampal volume. METHODS: We used serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient who developed chronic epilepsy after having generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus (SE). Five MRI investigations were performed during SE and a 58-month follow-up period. Hippocampal volumetric measurements and coregistration of scans were performed to detect hippocampal atrophy. RESULTS: During status both mesiotemporal regions returned a high signal on T2-weighted images. Two months after the onset of SE, bilateral hippocampal atrophy was detected. Further progressive hippocampal atrophy was detected in the subsequent 58 months by both hippocampal volumetric measurements and coregistration of scans. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that hippocampal atrophy is a process that may continue after the end of the SE.
