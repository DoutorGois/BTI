Awareness of estrogen's effects on neural function is broadening rapidly. Areas of recent progress include increased understanding of estrogen signaling through both genomic and nongenomic pathways, as well as the mechanisms by which estrogen can induce or maintain synapses and protect neurons from a variety of insults. Findings in these areas demonstrate a role for estrogen that goes beyond direct control of reproductive function.
