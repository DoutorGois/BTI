The volume of several parts of the basal ganglia and of the limbic system was measured by planimetry of myelin-stained serial sections in postmortem brains of 13 schizophrenic patients and nine control cases. The medial limbic structures of the temporal lobe (amygdala, hippocampal formation, and parahippocampal gyrus) and the pallidum internum were significantly smaller in the schizophrenic group, whereas the pallidum externum showed only a modest trend toward volume reduction. The volumes of the putamen, nucleus caudatus, nucleus accumbens, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis did not differ between patients and controls. The volume reductions of the limbic temporal structures and of the pallidum internum of schizophrenics are interpreted as degenerative shrinkages of unknown etiology.
