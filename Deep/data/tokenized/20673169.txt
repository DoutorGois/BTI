Increasing evidence demonstrates that stress or depression can lead to atrophy and cell loss in the hippocampus. In contrast, antidepressant treatment significantly reduces apoptosis in the dentate granule cell layer and subgranular zone in animal models of depression. In the present study, we investigated the neuroprotective action of SCLM, the total saponins extracted from Chaihu-jia-longgu-muli-tang, a traditional Chinese medicinal formula which was prescribed 1000 years ago, in the reduction of apoptosis in hippocampal neurons using an experimental chronic mild stress (CMS) model. Mice were subjected to the CMS procedure for a period of 21 consecutive days. SCLM (100 mg/kg, p.o.) or fluoxetine (20 mg/ kg, p.o.) was administered during the stress periods. CMS mice showed a decreased sucrose intake over 21 days, and an increase in the number of TUNEL-positive neurons as well as up-regulation of the apoptotic-related factors, such as Bax and caspase-3 in the hippocampus, compared with control mice. On the other hand, the administration of SCLM (100 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) reversed these effects induced by CMS, showing a significant increase of sucrose intake and a dramatic reduction of TUNEL-positive neurons and decreased expression of Bax and caspase-3 proteins. The present results suggest that SCLM possesses a significant antidepressant-like property, and this effect may be through protection against stress-induced neuronal apoptosis by affecting the expression of Bax and caspase-3 proteins in the hippocampus. These findings provide important information that the anti-apoptotic effect of herbal medicine therapy may be beneficial for the treatment of depression.
