AIM: to investigate the effect of isochaihulactone (also known as K8), a lignan compound of Bupleurum scorzonerifolium, on H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells (nPC12). METHODS: viability of neuronal PC12 cells was measured using MTT assay. Protein expression was determined by Western blot. Apoptotic cells was determined using TUNEL assay. D-galactose aging mice were used as a model system to study the anti-oxidant effects of isochaihulactone in vivo. RESULTS: pretreatment with isochaihulactone (5-10 micromol/L) increased cell viability and decreased membrane damage, generation of reactive oxygen species and degradation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in H(2)O(2)-treated nPC12 cells and also decreased the expression of cyclooxygenase-2, via downregulation of NF-kappaB, resulting in a decrease in lipid peroxidation. The results suggest that isochaihulactone is a potential antioxidant agent. In a murine aging model, in which chronic systemic exposure to D-galactose (D-gal) causes the acceleration of senescence, administration of isochaihulactone (10 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1), sc) for 7 weeks concomitant with D-gal injection significantly increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and decreased the MDA level in plasma. Furthermore, H&E staining to quantify cell death within hippocampus showed that percentage of pyknotic nuclei in the D-gal-treated mice were much higher than in control. CONCLUSION: the results suggest that isochaihulactone exerts potent anti-aging effects against D-gal in mice possibly via antioxidative mechanisms.
