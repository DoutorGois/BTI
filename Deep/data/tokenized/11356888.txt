The perirhinal cortex appears to play a key role in memory, and the neighboring hippocampus is critically involved in spatial processing. The possibility exists, therefore, that perirhinal-hippocampal interactions are important for spatial memory processes. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the contribution of the perirhinal cortex to the location-specific firing ("place field") of hippocampal complex-spike ("place") cells. The firing characteristics of dorsal CA1 place cells were examined in rats with bilateral ibotenic acid lesions centered on the perirhinal cortex (n = 4) or control surgeries (n = 5) as they foraged in a rectangular environment. The activity of individual place cells was also monitored after a delay period of either 2 min, or 1 or 24 hr, during which time the animal was removed from the environment. Although the perirhinal cortex lesion did not affect the place field size or place cell firing characteristics during a recording session, it was determined that the location of the place field shifted position across the delay period in 36% (10 of 28) of the cells recorded from lesioned animals. In contrast, none of the place cells (0 of 29) recorded from control animals were unstable by this measure. These data indicate that although the initial formation of place fields in the hippocampus is not dependent on perirhinal cortex, the maintenance of this stability over time is disrupted by perirhinal lesions. This instability may represent an erroneous "re-mapping" of the environment and suggests a role for the perirhinal cortex in spatial memory processing.
