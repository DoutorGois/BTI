The brains of eight horses that had suffered from natural Borna disease were examined with virologic, immunohistological, and electron-microscopic methods. All brains harbored infectious virus as shown by inoculation of experimental animals. Regional assessment of the infectivity exhibited the highest titers in the hippocampus and piriform cortex and the lowest in the cerebellum. Conventional histology yielded pathologic alterations very similar to those of the classical description of the disease. Immunohistology demonstrated the highest amounts of Borna disease virus-specific antigen in the nuclei of neurons. In the perikarya, dendrites, and axons smaller amounts of antigen were found. A comparison of the antigen distribution with the inflammatory reaction established a high concordance of these two parameters. The presence of virus-specific antigen seems to trigger the exsudation of inflammatory cells, which reflect the extension of the infectious process. Heavy inflammatory exsudates in the white matter underlying diseased cortical areas can be explained by the axonal presence of virus-specific antigen. Virus particles could not be demonstrated with the electron microscope. The most significant findings at the ultrastructural level were stacks of fine filaments, adhering closely to cytoplasmic cisterns. These structures might be related to virus components or might be involved in virus morphogenesis.
