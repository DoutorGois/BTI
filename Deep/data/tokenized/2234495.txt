We examined mRNA, cytoplasmic RNA and structural damage in the hippocampus of the gerbil brain after transient ischemia by in situ hybridization, Acridine orange histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Progressive decline of mRNA became visible in the CA1 region after reperfusion for 3 h and loss of cytoplasmic RNA and emergence of structural damage in 3 days. Reduction of mRNA in the CA3-CA4 region was transient. The findings suggested positive correlation between progressive loss of mRNA and delayed neuronal death.
