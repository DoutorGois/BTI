Ultrastructural changes in hippocampal granule cells, mossy fibers and mossy fiber boutons were examined following the administration of picrotoxin in adult rats. Generalized seizures occurred within 5-10 min after the intraperitoneal injection of picrotoxin. The electron-microscopic examination of hippocampal tissues from rats that had been perfused with fixative during the seizure revealed that the large dense-core vesicles increased in number and accumulated on the presynaptic membranes of mossy fiber boutons; some of these vesicles appeared to be fused with the membranes, and omega-shaped exocytotic profiles were frequently seen. Furthermore, greatly increased numbers of coated vesicles (60-90 nm in diameter) were observed on the maturing faces of Golgi fields of granule cells. Thus, our study not only indicates an increased incidence of exocytosis of large dense-core vesicles during picrotoxin-induced seizures, but also suggests that these vesicles are replaced in excess from the perikaryon of the granule cell.
