Phospholipase D (PLD) is implicated in a variety of physiological processes that reveal it to be a member of the signal transducing phospholipases. We found that PLD1 is activated when basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) stimulates neurite outgrowth of an immortalized hippocampal cell line (H19-7). Overexpression of PLD1 in H19-7 cells dramatically elongated bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth and increased PLD activity. Transfection of DN-rPLD1 blocked bFGF-induced PLD activation and completely inhibited neurite outgrowth induced by bFGF, suggesting that PLD1 activation is important in bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth of H19-7 cells. PLD activation and neurite outgrowth induced by bFGF was dependent on phospholipase C gamma (PLC-gamma) and Ca2+, but not protein kinase C (PKC). Furthermore, inhibition of Src and Ras partially blocked bFGF-induced PLD activation and neurite outgrowth, respectively. Coinhibition of Src and Ras completely blocked bFGF-induced PLD activation, suggesting that Src and Ras independently regulate PLD1 activation. Interestingly, bFGF-induced PLD activation and neurite outgrowth did not require ERK1/2 activated by Ras. Taken together, this study demonstrates that bFGF activates PLD1 through PLC-gamma activation, which leads to neurite outgrowth in H19-7 cells. Furthermore, our results show that PLD1 activation by bFGF is regulated by Src and Ras independently.
