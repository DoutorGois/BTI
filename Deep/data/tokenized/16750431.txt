Ack1 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in the adult central nervous system (CNS). Here, we studied the distribution of Ack1 mRNA throughout the development of mouse CNS. Expression was detected in all areas of the brain but especially high levels were observed in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Interestingly, expression levels were prominent in areas of proliferation such as the subventricular zone and areas that originate other structures such the pontine nucleus and the ganglionic eminence. During development, several areas showed an increase in Ack1 expression, especially the dentate gyrus and CA3 in the hippocampus, layer V in the neocortex, and the Purkinje cell layer in the cerebellum. These results demonstrate that this kinase is up-regulated during development and that it is expressed in proliferative areas and in migratory pathways in the developing brain.
