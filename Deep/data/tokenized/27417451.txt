Exposure to severe stress can lead to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in at-risk individuals. Gastrodin (GAS), a primary constituent of an Oriental herbal medicine, has been shown to effectively treat various mood disorders. Thus, the present study aimed to determine whether GAS would ameliorate stress-associated depression-like behaviors in a rat model of single prolonged stress (SPS)-induced PTSD. Following the SPS procedure, rats received intraperitoneal administration of GAS (20, 50, or 100 mg/kg) once daily for 2 weeks. Subsequently, the rats performed the forced swimming test, and norepinephrine (NE) levels in the hippocampus were measured. Daily GAS (100 mg/kg) significantly reversed depression-like behaviors and restored SPS-induced increases in hippocampal NE concentrations as well as tyrosine hydroxylase expression in the locus coeruleus. Furthermore, the administration of GAS attenuated SPS-induced decreases in the hypothalamic expression of neuropeptide Y and the hippocampal mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These findings indicate that GAS possesses antidepressant effects in the PTSD and may be an effective herbal preparation for the treatment of PTSD.
