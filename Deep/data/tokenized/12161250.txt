There have been reports of regional differences in the activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and in the induction of immediate early genes after electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in the rat brain. This study was performed to determine whether ECS induce the region-specific phosphorylation of MAPK-downstream transcription factors, ATF-2, Elk-1, c-Jun, in rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Following ECS, the phosphorylation of ATF-2 was highly increased in the hippocampus but slightly in the cerebellum. The phosphorylation of Elk-1 was increased in the cerebellum but not in the hippocampus. In contrast, the phosphorylation of c-Jun was increased only in the hippocampus. These results indicate that ECS can induce the region-specific phosphorylation of MAPK-downstream transcription factors in rat hippocampus and cerebellum.
