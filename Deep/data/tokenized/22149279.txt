A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminal extracellular epitope of rat gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) type-A (GABA(A)R) receptor gamma2 subunit was generated. This antibody identified a protein of approximately 42 kDa in Western blot assays using rat and mouse hippocampal proteins. The antibody also detected the expression of gamma2 subunit by immunohistochemistry and could immunoprecipitate the gamma2 subunit.
