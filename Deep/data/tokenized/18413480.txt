OBJECTIVE: To investigate amyloid accumulation by carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (11C-PiB) in hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy and APP locus duplication. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Positron emission tomography with 11C-PiB and magnetic resonance imaging were performed for 2 patients, 49-year-old and 60-year-old siblings with APP locus duplication, with hereditary Alzheimer disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Change in 11C-PiB uptake. RESULTS: Uptake of 11C-PiB was increased especially in the striatum (caudate nucleus to 225% and 280% of the control mean and putamen to 166% and 185% of the control mean) and in the posterior cingulate (to 168% and 198% of the control mean), and it was marginally increased in other cortical brain areas. The pattern of increased 11C-PiB uptake was different from that seen in sporadic Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloid imaging with 11C-PiB positron emission tomography is a useful tool for detecting in vivo amyloid accumulation in patients with hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy. However, the pattern of 11C-PiB accumulation differs between patients with typical AD and patients with APP locus duplication.
