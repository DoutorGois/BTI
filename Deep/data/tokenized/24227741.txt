Some forms of idiopathic epilepsy in animals and humans are associated with deficiency of synapsin, a phosphoprotein that reversibly associates with synaptic vesicles. We have previously shown that the epileptic phenotype seen in synapsin II knock-out mice (SynII(-)) can be rescued by the genetic deletion of the Rab3a protein. Here we have examined the cellular basis for this rescue using whole-cell recordings from CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells in brain slices. We find that SynII(-) neurons have increased spontaneous activity and a reduced threshold for the induction of epileptiform activity by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Using selective recordings of glutamatergic and GABAergic activity we show that in wild-type neurons low concentrations of 4-AP facilitate glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission in a balanced way, whereas in SynII(-) neurons this balance is shifted toward excitation. This imbalance reflects a deficit in inhibitory synaptic transmission that appears to be secondary to reduced Ca(2+) sensitivity in SynII(-) neurons. This suggestion is supported by our finding that synaptic and epileptiform activity at SynII(-) and wild-type synapses is similar when GABAergic transmission is blocked. Deletion of Rab3a results in glutamatergic synapses that have a compromised responsiveness to either low 4-AP concentrations or elevated extracellular Ca(2+). These changes mitigate the overexcitable phenotype observed in SynII(-) neurons. Thus, Rab3a deletion appears to restore the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance observed in SynII(-) hippocampal slices indirectly, not by correcting the deficit in GABAergic synaptic transmission but rather by impairing excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission.
