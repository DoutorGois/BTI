Whether ischemic postconditioning (IPC) can significantly alleviate ischemic injury hinges on the appropriate measure. In this study, the expression RGMa and IL-1beta, IL-6 are investigated to estimate the therapeutic benefits of various postconditioning strategies after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. The study consists of the sham-operated group and five treatment groups: ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), two proximate ischemic postconditioning (IPC-S and IPC-M), remote postconditioning (RIPC) and delayed postconditioning (DIPC) groups. We find that rats in IPC and RIPC groups exhibit significantly less neural deficit and lower infarct volume than that in I/R and DIPC groups after ischemia/reperfusion. Moreover, in ischemic cortex and hippocampus, the mRNA level of RGMa is much lower in IPC and RIPC groups. Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that the expression of RGMa, IL-1beta and IL-6 are reduced in IPC and RIPC groups (especially in IPC-S group). Furthermore, neurofilament staining reveals that the rats in IPC and RIPC groups have less axonal injury than that in I/R and DIPC groups. Our studies suggest that the optimal strategy to attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion is achieved by early, short-term, and multiple cycles of proximal IPC. The cerebral protective effect of IPC may be associated with the decreased expression of RGMa and inflammation mediators.
