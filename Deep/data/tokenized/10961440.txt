Neurotrophins, such as NGF, BDNF and NT-3 play a regulatory role on the function of microglial cells in vivo and in vitro, and the identification of new compounds with neurotrophic properties is becoming a new strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study we describe the use of two different models to demonstrate the ability of Cerebrolysin to reduce microglial activation. The results of these in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that Cerebrolysin might exert a neuroimmunotrophic activity reducing the extent of inflammation and accelerated neuronal death under pathological conditions such as those observed in neurodegenerative diseases.
