Rat hippocampal neurones in primary culture exhibited directional growth in response to DC electric fields. Neurites lay perpendicular to the field after exposure to 28, 80 or 219 mV/mm but there was no orientation effect at 9 mV/mm or in unexposed control cultures. Fields that evoked perpendicular responses also reduced the number of cathode-facing neurites. Orientation was the same for neurite initiation sites and the direction of overall neurite growth.
