Passiflora incarnata L. (Passifloraceae) has been traditionally used for treatment of anxiety, insomnia, drug addiction, mild infections, and pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a commercial extract of P. incarnata in the analgesia induced by alcohol withdrawal syndrome in rats. In addition, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and interleukin-10 levels were evaluated in prefrontal cortex, brainstem, and hippocampus. Male adult rats received by oral gavage: (1: water group) water for 19 days, 1 day interval and water (8 days); (2: P. incarnata group) water for 19 days, 1 day interval and P. incarnata 200 mg/kg (8 days); (3: alcohol withdrawal group) alcohol for 19 days, 1 day interval and water (8 days); and (4: P. incarnata in alcohol withdrawal) alcohol for 19 days, 1 day interval and P. incarnata 200 mg/kg (8 days). The tail-flick and hot plate tests were used as nociceptive response measures. Confirming previous study of our group, it was showed that alcohol-treated groups presented an increase in the nociceptive thresholds after alcohol withdrawal, which was reverted by P. incarnata, measured by the hot plate test. Besides, alcohol treatment increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor and interleukin-10 levels in prefrontal cortex, which was not reverted by P. incarnata. Considering these results, the P. incarnata treatment might be a potential therapy in the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
