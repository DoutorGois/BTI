The cholinergic neurotoxin AF64A was administered to rats in order to produce learning impairment to test the effect of cholinergic drugs. Seven days after receiving an intracerebroventricular injection of AF64A (2.5-7.5 nmol), rats were subjected to one-trial passive avoidance acquisition and tested 24 h later. Learning was significantly impaired at 3.75 nmol AF64A, a dose at which significant reduction in acetylcholine level and choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was observed but changes in monoamine levels in the hippocampus, general behavior, or sensory sensitivity were not observed. Arecoline (4 mg/kg, IP) and physostigmine (0.1 mg/kg, IP) significantly decreased the learning impairment produced by AF64A (3.75 nmol) when given before the acquisition of passive avoidance learning but not when given after the acquisition or before the 24 h retention test. These drugs and oxotremorine (0.1 mg/kg, IP) given immediately after the acquisition, however, improved passive avoidance retention when the interval between the acquisition and the test was shortened to 1 h. These results indicate that the impairment of learning in AF64A-treated rats is caused by a memory retention deficit and suggest that such impairment can be effectively ameliorated by cholinergic drugs.
