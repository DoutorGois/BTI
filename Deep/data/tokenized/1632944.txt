Rats were exposed for 24 min to bilateral clamping of the common carotid arteries (BCCA) in pentobarbital anaesthesia. The GABA content was measured 24 hours, 48 hours, 4 days, 14 days and 3 months after BCCA. In other groups of rats seizures were elicited by i.p. injection of (+)-bicuculline (3 mg/kg) 24 hours, 48 hours, 4 days, 14 days and 3 months after BCCA. Analysis of the GABA content revealed significant increase compared with controls in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and substantia nigra from 24 hours up to 3 months. Bicuculline treatment induced tonic/clonic seizures and status epilepticus in sham operated animals; these effects were drastically diminished at various time points after BCCA. The present results suggest that BCCA produces a longlasting increase in GABA content and as a consequence protection from bicuculline-induced seizures.
