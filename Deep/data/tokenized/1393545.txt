Tetraethylammonium (TEA) effects on K currents were examined on either side of the membrane of hippocampal CA1 neurons by means of whole-cell voltage-clamp recording and intracellular perfusion. Recording media contained ion channel blockers to allow the selective activation of voltage-dependent K currents which consisted of a rapidly decaying component (A-current) and a delayed component. Voltage protocols were applied to separate the A-current from the delayed component. Results show that 10 mM extracellular TEA suppressed 50 +/- 11% (S.D., n = 4) of the delayed current at different levels of depolarization but had little effect on the A-current. In contrast 10 mM TEA applied by intracellular perfusion suppressed the A-current by 42 +/- 10% (S.D., n = 4) in addition to inhibiting the delayed currently 55 +/- 15% (S.D., n = 4). Both the intracellular and extracellular actions of TEA on K currents showed no voltage- nor time-dependency. The results suggest that voltage-dependent transient current (A-current) is mediated through a separate group of ionic channels distinct from those that sustained the delayed current. Furthermore, the asymmetrical effects of intracellular and extracellular TEA on the transient current are similar to those described for the A-current in molluscan neurons. This observation supports the notion that the structure of the ion channel mediating the A-current is closely conserved across different species.
