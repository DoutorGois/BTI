Several evidences have demonstrated that oxidative stress has a central role in bipolar disorder (BD). Recently, studies have been suggested histone deacetylases (HDAC) as a possible target for new medications in treatment of mood disorders. In this study, we investigated the effects of sodium butyrate (SB, a histone deacetilase inhibitor) on oxidative stress in rats submitted to an animal model of mania induced by d-amphetamine (d-AMPH). Wistar rats were first given d-AMPH or saline (Sal) for 14 days, and then, between days 8 and 14, rats were treated with SB or Sal. Locomotor activity and risk-taking behavior were assessed by open-field test and oxidative stress was measured in prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and striatum. The results showed that SB reversed and prevented d-AMPH-induced behavioral effects. The d-AMPH administration induced oxidative damage in all brain structures analyzed. Depending on the cerebral area and technique, SB was able to reverse this impairment. The present study reinforces the need for more studies of HDAC inhibitors as possible target for new medications in treatment for BD.
