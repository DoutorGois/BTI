The regional distribution and temporal appearance of astrocytes expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100 protein, and vimentin were determined in a nonpenetrating lateral fluid percussion (LFP) brain injury model. Following injury, reactive astrocytes were observed in the subcortical white matter tracts as early as 1 day, in the hippocampus and injured cortex by 3 days, and in the thalamus by 1 week. Reactive astrocytes in the injured cortex, subcortical white matter tracts, and CA3 region of the hippocampus were all vimentin positive at 1 month post-injury. These astrocytes had a distinct morphology characterized by an enlarged cell body and long intertwined processes. In contrast, reactive astrocytes in the thalamic nuclei never expressed vimentin, and displayed an enlarged cell body with thick shortened processes. An increase in S100 protein was detected in all reactive astrocytes following LFP brain injury. Quantitative assessment of GFAP, S100, and vimentin polypeptides confirmed the immunohistochemical evaluation. Our data indicate that although astrogliosis mirrors the spatial pattern of post-traumatic neuronal cell loss, the expression of vimentin and the cellular morphology of the cells were regionally distinct, suggesting that astrogliosis may be modulated by factors present in the post-traumatic brain.
