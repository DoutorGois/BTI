Microdialysis was used to measure changes in extracellular serotonin in the hypothalamus of rats while they engaged in feeding behavior or received drug treatments used to treat feeding disorders and affective disorders in humans. Hypothalamic serotonin increased significantly relative to controls in response to (1) intraperitoneal tryptophan after food deprivation, (2) the smell of food and eating a meal, (3) a conditioned taste aversion, (4) d-fenfluramine and fluoxetine, and (5) an amphetamine challenge test after chronic low doses of lithium. In some cases, increases correlated with nonspecific behavioral arousal were seen in the hippocampus. The results suggest that diet, drug, and behavioral therapies, alone or combined, can be used to preferentially modify hypothalamic serotonin in the control of behavioral, emotional, and endocrine problems.
