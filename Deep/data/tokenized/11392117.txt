Zinc content in pancreatic islet cells and hippocampus was studied with the aid of highly sensitive selective cytochemical reaction of 8-(p-toluensulfonylamino)-quinoline. It was shown that the factors stimulating B-insulocyte secretory activity induced the decrease of this metal concentrations in the cell. An increase of these cells zinc content observed in the cases of their secretory activity inhibition. The extreme irritants induced two phase changes of zinc concentrations in pancreatic islets and hippocampus.
