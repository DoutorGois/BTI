Male Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously with either saline or naloxone, 1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg, 10 min before exposure to 1-hour immobilization-stress. Control animals were sacrificed 70 min after respective injections. Levels of noradrenaline (NA) and its major metabolite, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-S04) in seven discrete brain regions and plasma corticosterone levels were fluorometrically determined. Immobilization stress caused significant elevations of plasma corticosterone which were not affected by pretreatment with naloxone. In the hypothalamus, amygdala and thalamus, immobilization-stress caused significant elevations of MHPG-S04 levels, and naloxone at 5 mg/kg significantly enhanced these stress-induced elevations virtually without affecting the basal level of the metabolite. In contrast, in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and pons plus medulla oblongata, MHPG-S04 levels were elevated by stress, but were not affected by naloxone pretreatment. The effect of naloxone on stress-induced reductions of NA levels was unclear, since naloxone by itself (5 mg/kg) significantly decreased the amine levels in 5 of 7 brain regions examined. These results indirectly suggest that endogenous opioid peptides in the hypothalamus, amygdala and thalamus are partly involved in the stress process and attenuate increases in NA turnover induced by stress.
