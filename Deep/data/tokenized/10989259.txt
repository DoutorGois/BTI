The calcium-binding proteins, parvalbumin and calbindin D-28k, are markers of different classes of GABAergic interneurons and display different functions. The present study was attempted to determine immunoreactivities and colocalization of the parvalbumin and calbindin D-28k in the developing canine hippocampus by immunohistochemistry. The calcium-binding protein-containing neurons showed different developmental patterns. The first appearance of parvalbumin immunoreactive nonpyramidal cells was observed at P7. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity was elicited by the sequence from CA3 to CA1 to reach an adult-like distribution pattern, which was reached at P60, while calbindin D-28k immunoreactivity appeared from P0, including pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells. The characteristic distribution of calbindin D-28k immunoreactive pyramidal cells was clarified by P28, and an adult-like distribution pattern was reached by the end of the second postnatal month. Double-labeled nonpyramidal cells were frequently seen in the subareas, CA3 of P14/CA1-CA2 of P28, where parvalbumin immunoreactive nonpyramidal cells were emerging. These data suggest that the colocalization of the two calcium-binding proteins during development is related closely to the area-specific maturation of parvalbumin expression, although either prenatal expression of calbindin D-28k or parvalbumin was not determined.
