In this study, we performed the first high-throughput and comprehensive proteomic profiling of the rat hippocampal proteome. Using a combination of 2-D LC-MS and data analysis with the Rosetta Elucidator((R)) system, we identified 1340 unique proteins. Functional classification showed that most of these were associated with synaptic function and comprised a high proportion of phosphorylated proteins and analytically challenging classes of membrane proteins such as ion channel receptor subunits.
