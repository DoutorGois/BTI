Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), which consists of several isozymes, plays a pivotal role in lipid second-messenger diacylglycerol metabolism. A nuclear isozyme, DGKzeta, which is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in hippocampal neurons under transient ischemic stress, is implicated in nuclear events of delayed neuronal death. Kainate (KA)-induced seizure is another model used to study excitotoxic stress. Therefore, we examined whether DGKzeta is implicated in a different type of degenerative excitotoxicity in hippocampal neurons. We conducted immunohistochemical analysis of rat hippocampi after KA-induced seizures. DGKzeta in hippocampal neurons shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It never relocates to the nucleus during KA-induced seizures. Marked change in the immunoreactivity is first observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons 2h after injection during stage 3 seizures. Immunoreactivity for DGKiota remains unchanged in the cytoplasm. That for NeuN remains mostly unchanged in the nucleus. Results show that nucleocytoplasmic translocation of DGKzeta also occurs in a different model of excitotoxicity that results in apoptotic neuronal death. Cytoplasmic translocation of DGKzeta might be involved in early events of the apoptotic cell death pathway in hippocampal neurons under stressed conditions.
