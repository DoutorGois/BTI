Neurotensin has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The neonatal amygdala lesion in rat has been proposed to be a neurodevelopmental model for some aspects of schizophrenia. [125I] Neurotensin binding was assessed in adult rats using in vitro autoradiography following a lesion of the basolateral amygdala at postnatal day 7 (Pd 7) or postnatal day 21 (Pd 21). The Pd 7 and Pd 21 lesions differentially affected neurotensin receptor densities in the hippocampal complex and (less pronounced) in the dopaminergic cell regions, implying a neurodevelopmental cause. These results may be of relevance for the involvement of neurotensin in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
