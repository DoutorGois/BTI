Having described a peptidergic transmitter system in the rat brain, we now begin to evaluate its behavioral function. We stimulated cell bodies in the medial amygdaloid nucleus (AME) with indwelling bilateral electrodes. These cell bodies contain a vasopressin-like peptide and send fibers to the hippocampus where the peptide is released upon stimulation. There the peptide inhibits hippocampal output in the awake rat just as it does in the anesthetized rat and in the rat brain slice. The stimulation reorganizes behavior with the same latency and duration as the hippocampal effect. For about 15-20 minutes after the brief stimulus, rats remain motionless with eyes wide open. This "freezing" state is punctuated by episodes of exploratory behavior. The stimulus appears to have a positive affective quality. Review of the literature in light of the present results indicates a probable role for this peptidergic system in the generation of sexual behavior in male rats.
