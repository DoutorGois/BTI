The effect of ladasten (50 mg/kg) on the activity of tyrosine hydrolase (TH) and DOPA-decarboxylase (DDC) gene expression and on the content of dopamine and L-DOPA in the striatum and hypothalamus in rat brain was studied depending on the duration of drug action. In the initial stage (first hours) of the drug action, the dopaminergic effects are related to an increase in the dopamine release. The observed accumulation of L-DOPA and dopamine is correlated with the transcription activity of genes studied. This leads to a conclusion that the pharmacological activity of ladasten is related to activation of de novo synthesis of TH and DDC. There is a certain difference in the ladasten action upon the TH and DDC gene expression of the key enzymes in hypothalamus and striatum of rat brain.
