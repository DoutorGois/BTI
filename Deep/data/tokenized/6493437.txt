Numerous reports indicate that both central nervous system (CNS) and immune system functions decline with age. We have previously shown that the CNS can modulate both mitogen-induced spleen cell proliferation and NK activity in young Fischer 344 rats. In the present study we have determined the effects of AHT lesions on the lymphocyte reactivity of aged Fischer 344 rats. These data show that lesions in the AHT of aged rats cannot modulate splenic mitogen responsiveness, however, NK activity is impaired. This differential effect may be due to multiple factors including enhanced splenic suppressor cell activity, the inability of the brain to send modulatory signals following lesioning, or the failure of the immune system to receive a neural signal and react to it.
