Much useful information on the localization of alpha 1-adrenergic binding sites has been gained by using tritiated radioligands for in vitro autoradiography. However, the iodinated alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist HEAT [( 2-beta (4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylaminomethyl)-tetralone], BE 2254), a radioligand with high affinity and specificity, provides autoradiographs with a higher signal to noise ratio. This has allowed us to describe the anatomy of these binding sites in much greater detail than previously possible. Regions showing the highest levels of binding include external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb, layers Va and Vc of frontoparietal cortex, lateral and central amygdaloid nuclei, thalamus, and inferior olive. Other regions were generally less intensely labeled, with the least evidence of labeling in white matter, such as corpus callosum. Some regions (e.g., hippocampus) had only moderate labeling, but the binding appeared in a discrete pattern that reflected the functional organization of the structure. Although the [125I]-HEAT binding sites were distributed in a pattern similar to that previously reported for [3H]-WB 4101 and [3H]-prazosin, the anatomical detail seen with the iodinated ligand is greater. As a result, an association of alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist binding sites with specific layers in the cortex and with some catecholamine-containing nuclei in the brainstem, such as the locus coeruleus, have been seen for the first time.
