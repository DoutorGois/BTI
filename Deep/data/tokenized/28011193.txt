The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to involve acute neurotoxic effects exerted by oligomeric forms of amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta). Application of Abeta oligomers in physiological concentrations have been shown to transiently elevate internal Ca(2+) in cultured astroglia. While the cellular machinery involved has been extensively explored, to what degree this important signalling cascade occurs in organised brain tissue has remained unclear. Here we adapted two-photon excitation microscopy and calibrated time-resolved imaging (FLIM), coupled with patch-clamp electrophysiology, to monitor Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]) inside individual astrocytes and principal neurons in acute brain slices. Inside the slice tissue local micro-ejection of Abeta in sub-micromolar concentrations triggered prominent [Ca(2+)] elevations in an adjacent astrocyte translated as an approximately two-fold increase (averaged over approximately 5min) in basal [Ca(2+)]. This elevation did not spread to neighbouring cells and appeared comparable in amplitude with commonly documented spontaneous [Ca(2+)] rises in astroglia. Principal nerve cells (pyramidal neurons) also showed Ca(2+) sensitivity, albeit to a lesser degree. These observations shed light on the extent and dynamics of the acute physiological effects of Abeta on brain cells in situ, in the context of AD.
