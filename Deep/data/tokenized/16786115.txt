Previous reports suggested that a low-frequency stimulus (LFS) of 1~2 Hz (600~900 pulses) induced a homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy in the hippocampal CA1 area of young rats (< 4-week old). However, these stimulation protocols often failed to induce LTD in the adult CA1 hippocampus. In the present study, we examined the effects of two novel tetanus patterns on LTD induction in adult rat hippocampal slices. We determined that these novel stimulation protocols induced LTD in the adult hippocampus, and that the characteristics of induced LTD were parameter-specific, including latency (period from the end of tetanus to a beginning of LTD) and the amplitude of LTD. These results suggest that LFS with certain patterns can induce LTD in the CA1 area of adult rat hippocampal slices, and that the multi-trains of 2-Hz protocol provided more effective response than the 5-Hz protocol.
