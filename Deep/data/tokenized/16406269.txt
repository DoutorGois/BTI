Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins may result in altered epigenetic signaling after pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI). Hippocampal histone H3 acetylation and methylation in immature rats after moderate TBI were measured and decreased only in CA3 at 6 h and 24 h with persistent methylation decreases up to 72 h after injury. Decreased histone H3 acetylation and methylation suggest altered hippocampal CA3 epigenetic signaling during the first hours to days after TBI.
