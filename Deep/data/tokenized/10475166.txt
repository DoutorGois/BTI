Long-term ethanol consumption in humans and laboratory animals is associated with morphological and functional alterations of brain structures involved in cognitive processes. In the present experiments, we assessed whether voluntary long-term consumption of ethanol by alcohol-preferring (sP) rats under free choice condition with water (also) caused alterations in memory performance and hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release in vivo. A group of sP rats were offered a 10% v/v ethanol solution in a free choice with water for 36 weeks; controls had only tap water available. After withdrawal of ethanol, rats were tested in one trial passive avoidance test and thereafter were trained in a food-reinforced radial arm maze task for 12 days. One day after the last session in the radial-arm maze, rats were implanted with a microdialysis probe in the dorsal hippocampus and dialysate concentrations of ACh were measured. No significant differences were observed between sP drinking and control rats in retention latencies in the passive avoidance test, in radial arm-maze performance or in basal levels of hippocampal ACh release. These results show that long-term ethanol consumption by sP rats is not associated with cognitive impairments or with alterations in the hippocampal cholinergic function. To the extent that chronic ethanol intoxication can be considered a causal factor in the development of memory and neurochemical alterations, these results suggest that sP rats self-regulate ethanol consumption so as to avoid intoxication. These findings may challenge the notion that sP rat lines can be considered a valid model of human alcoholism.
