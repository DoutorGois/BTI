Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling of the electroencephalogram (EEG) effect was combined with intracerebral glutamate determinations using microdialysis for rats receiving norfloxacin intravenously (150 mg/kg of body weight). The EEG effect (accompanied by tremors and seizures) was consistently observed without glutamate level modifications. Therefore, norfloxacin-inducted seizures are not triggered by intracerebral glutamate level enhancement.
