The localization in the brain and metabolism of 3H-labeled corticosterone (B) and 11-dehydrocorticosterone (A) of high specific radioactivity was determined after stereotaxic injection into the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. [3H]B was cleared very rapidly with, on average, only about 7% being recovered after 5 min and 0.5% after 30 min. Most of this 3H-radioactivity was localized in the area surrounding the site of injection with little diffusion to adjacent areas. These findings make it possible to compare the short term metabolism of [3H]A and [3H]B in different lobes of the hippocampus in the same animal and establish their local equilibrium point in vivo. Under these conditions, about 5% conversion of each steroid to the other was observed in contrast to the situation in cultured hippocampal cells where 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) has been shown by others to act primarily as a reductase catalyzing the conversion of A to B. This method can also be used to study the effect of inhibitors such as 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, applied locally in the brain, on the metabolism of corticosteroids. The rate of conversion [3H]B or [3H]A to their dihydro- and tetrahydro-derivatives capable of modulating the GABAa receptor in the hippocampus was much lower than their interconversion. Thus, factors which influence the direction of the 11-HSD catalyzed reaction are important in regulating not only salt appetite and blood pressure but also the levels of neuroactive metabolites of corticosterone.
