In order to evaluate the involvement of dysfunctional teeth in age-related deficits in hippocampal function, we examined the effect of removal of molar teeth (molarless condition) on neuronal degeneration and glial fibrous acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the hippocampus and on learning ability in a water maze test in young, middle-aged, and aged accelerated senescence-prone mice (SAMP8). The molarless condition enhanced an age-dependent decrease in both learning ability and the number of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and the age-dependent increase in the number and hypertrophy of GFAP-labeled astrocytes in the same subfield. These observations suggest that the molarless condition may be involved in the senile process in the hippocampus in SAMP8 mice.
