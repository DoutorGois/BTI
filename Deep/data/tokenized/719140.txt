In chronic experiments on rabbits the possibility of artificial modeling of motivational feeding pacemaker's function by different limbic-reticular structures was investigated. It was shown that simultaneous stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic "feeding" centre with various structures of the limbic-reticular complex makes secondary pacemaker of feeding motivation in the midbrain reticular formation only.
