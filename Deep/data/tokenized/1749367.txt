The hippocampus exhibits a post-ictal phenomenon in which it is unresponsive to further stimulation. It has been suggested that this loss of excitability is the basis of post-seizure amnesia. The biochemical events associated with this phenomenon are unclear. In the present study, energy metabolites were measured in the stratum oriens, stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum in rat hippocampus, and correlated with field potential recordings. Wistar rats were anesthetized and the calvarium removed. Following removal of the cortex by aspiration, the hippocampus was covered with oil, and stimulating and recording electrodes were placed. Stimulation consisted of a train of stimuli at 100 Hz (10-20 m Amps). This stimulation was found to be effective in evoking self-sustaining after-discharges and post-ictal depression. Tissues for metabolite analysis were taken from a series of controls, from animals during active self-sustaining seizures, and from animals which were totally unresponsive to further electrical stimulation. Hippocampal tissue for metabolite analysis was obtained by pouring liquid N2 on the exposed tissue, then removing the frozen tissue. Glucose, ATP, and phosphocreatine were measured in hippocampal layers of CA1 using fluorescence techniques and enzymatic cycling. Results showed that during seizure activity, glucose, ATP, and phosphocreatine were all decreased from 40-80% in the three layers of the hippocampus, whereas from 60 seconds after the onset of hippocampal shutdown, energy metabolites had returned toward normal. Thus, at a time when the hippocampus was unresponsive, energy metabolites were at control levels. These data suggest that the shutdown phenomenon occurs in the presence of adequate energy stores.
