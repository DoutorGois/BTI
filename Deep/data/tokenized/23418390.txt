Late post-training activation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-hippocampus dopaminergic loop controls the entry of information into long-term memory (LTM). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) modulate VTA function, but their involvement in LTM storage is unknown. Using pharmacological and behavioral tools, we found that alpha7-nAChR-mediated cholinergic interactions between the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the medial prefrontal cortex modulate the duration of fear-motivated memories, maybe by regulating the activation state of VTA-hippocampus dopamine connections.
