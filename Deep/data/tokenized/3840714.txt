Regional brain concentrations of neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity (NPY) were measured in age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats using a sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay developed within our laboratory. In 5 of the 9 brain regions examined the SH rats had significantly lower NPY levels compared to the WKY strain. The largest differences occurred within the cortex (-43%), and cervical (-30%) and thoracic spinal cord (-30%), whilst smaller differences were observed in the midbrain (-11%) and medulla oblongata-pons (-18%). The concentrations of NPY in the hypothalamus and hippocampus did not vary between the strains. The SH rats contained significantly greater (+18%) NPY levels in the striatum compared to the WKY rats.
