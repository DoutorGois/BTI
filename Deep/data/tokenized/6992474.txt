A survey is given of the studies in the genetics of neuroanatomical characters. It is assumed that a complex use of the genetic and physiological methods for the study of the connection between neuroanatomical characters and behaviour will permit to approach the understanding of the relations between the structure of the brain, the genotype and behaviour.
