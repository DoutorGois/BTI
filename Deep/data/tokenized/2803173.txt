Adult male Long-Evans hooded rats were given bilateral microinjections of 18 mM leupeptin or saline through cannulae implanted with tips aimed at the frontal cortex or CA1 or CA3 hippocampal cell fields. Five minutes following injections animals were allowed to complete an eight-arm radial maze. The acquisition criterion required that the animal make 7 correct choices of the first 8, and 8 correct choices of the first 10, for five consecutive sessions. Leupeptin slowed acquisition of the eight-arm radial maze task when injected into the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal fields or the frontal cortex, but did not influence spontaneous activity. These results suggest that earlier reports of the amnestic effect of leupeptin when administered into the lateral cerebral ventricle may have been due to effects within the cortex and hippocampus. The present experiment represents the first attempt to identify behaviorally those brain areas in which leupeptin acts to alter learning.
