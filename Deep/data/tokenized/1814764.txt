The effect of continuous administration of 4-aminomethyl-1-benzylpyrrolidin-2-one-hemifumarate (WEB 1881 FU) on cerebral cholinergic neurons was studied using rats treated with ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF64A), a neurotoxic choline analog. AF64A (2.0 nmol, administered i.c.v.) caused a significant decrease in the hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) content. This decrease in hippocampal ACh content was accompanied by a reduction of choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. Under these experimental conditions, the latency of the passive avoidance response of rats, determined with a step-through method, was strongly decreased as compared with that of sham-operated rats. Although treatment with WEB 1881 FU (50 mg/kg per day, administered orally for 7 days) from immediately after the administration of AF64A did not affect the AF64A-induced decrease of ACh in the hippocampus, 100 mg/kg per day of WEB 1881 FU (orally for 7 days) significantly suppressed the AF64A-induced declines in hippocampal ACh content and CAT activity. The AF64A-induced reduction in latency of the passive avoidance response was also significantly antagonized by the treatment with 100 mg/kg per day of WEB 1881 FU (administered orally for 7 days) from immediately after the administration of AF64A. Continuous administration of WEB 1881 FU (100 mg/kg per day, orally for 7 days) from 7 days after the treatment with AF64A also had a significant inhibitory effect on the AF64A-induced decrease in ACh content in the hippocampus. These results suggest that WEB 1881 FU may have protective actions on the destruction of hippocampal cholingergic neurons as well as memory impairment induced by AF64A administration.
