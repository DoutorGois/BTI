Single unit activity of CA3 dorsal hippocamp has been registered in free moving rabbits. The influence of microiontophoretic application of pentagastrin and oxytocin on neuronal involvement into feeding or defensive behaviour has been studied. The change of the dominant feeding motivation to defensive was shown to cause resettings in the typical feeding activity of most neurons. Microiontophoretic application of pentagastrin induces typical feeding activity even if rabbits demonstrate defensive behaviour. It is believed that pentagastrin presence in perineuronal area leads to the involvement of most hippocampal neurons into the organization of the feeding behaviour.
