Synaptic incorporation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is regulated by GluN2 subunits with different rules controlling GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing receptors; whereas GluN2B-containing receptors are constitutively incorporated into synapses, GluN2A incorporation is activity-dependent. We expressed electrophysiologically tagged NMDARs in rat hippocampal slices to identify the molecular determinants controlling the mode of synaptic incorporation of NMDARs. Expressing chimeric GluN2 subunits, we identified a putative N-glycosylation site present in GluN2B, but not in GluN2A, as necessary and sufficient to drive NMDARs into synapses in an activity-independent manner. This suggests a novel mechanism for regulating activity-driven changes and trafficking of NMDARs to the synapse.
