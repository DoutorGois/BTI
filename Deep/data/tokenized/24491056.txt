OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) on the expressions of serine/threonine kinase Akt, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and caspase-3 in the brain tissues of rat models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups (n=10 per group): Sham group, AD group, Tan IIA treatment group. The models of AD were established by injecting beta-amyloid (Abeta) into the hippocampus of rats. The location and expression level of Abeta1-16; was observed by immunofluorescence, the expression level of caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression levels of Akt and NF-kappaB were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS: There was no Abeta1-16; detected in the control group, and the difference in the expression level of Abeta1-16; between AD group and Tan IIA treatment group was not significant statistically (P>0.05); The expression of Akt in AD group was lower than that in the control group and the Tan IIA treatment group, and the difference between AD group and the other two groups was of statistical significance (P<0.05). Conversely, compared with Tan IIA treatment group and sham group, the AD group was significantly higher in the expression levels of NF-kappaB and caspase-3 (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Tan IIA can up-regulate the expression of Akt and inhibit the production of NF-kappaB and caspase-3 in the model rats with AD.
