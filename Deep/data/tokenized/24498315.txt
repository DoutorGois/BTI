BACKGROUND: Enhanced glycolysis leads to elevated levels of the toxic metabolite methylglyoxal which contributes to loss of protein-function, metabolic imbalance and cell death. Neurons were shown being highly susceptible to methylglyoxal toxicity. Glyoxalase 1 as an ubiquitous enzyme reflects the main detoxifying enzyme of methylglyoxal and underlies changes during aging and neurodegeneration. However, little is known about dynamics of Glyoxalase 1 following neuronal lesions so far. METHODS: To determine a possible involvement of Glyoxalase 1 in acute brain injury, we analysed the temporal dynamics of Glyoxalase 1 distribution and expression by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were excitotoxically (N-methyl-D-aspartate, 50 microM for 4 hours) lesioned in vitro (5 minutes to 72 hours). Additionally, permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed (75 minutes to 60 days). RESULTS: We found (i) a predominant localisation of Glyoxalase 1 in endothelial cells in non-lesioned brains (ii) a time-dependent up-regulation and re-distribution of Glyoxalase 1 in neurons and astrocytes and (iii) a strong increase in Glyoxalase 1 dimers after neuronal injury (24 hours to 72 hours) when compared to monomers of the protein. CONCLUSIONS: The high dynamics of Glyoxalase 1 expression and distribution following neuronal injury may indicate a novel role of Glyoxalase 1.
