Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an abundant brain peptide with endogenous antiepileptic activity. Here we examined the role played by Y1 receptors (Y1R) in the mouse hippocampus. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we show that hilar neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices exhibit a G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) current that is significantly enhanced during exogenous NPY application. NPY-mediated enhancement of GIRK current was observed on 47% of putative interneurons and was mimicked by application of Y1R specific agonist (Leu(31)Pro(34) NPY). Immunostaining revealed the presence of Y1R on cell somas of hilar NPY-containing interneurons. Thus, our results suggest that Y1R on hilar interneurons may act as a peptide autoreceptor.
