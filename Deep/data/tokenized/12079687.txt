The present study investigated the involvement of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) neuronal system in the Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced impairment of spatial memory in the eight-arm radial maze in rats. Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (6 mg/kg, i.p.), which impairs spatial memory, significantly increased the 5-HT content in the ventral hippocampus. A microdialysis study showed that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (6 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased 5-HT release in the ventral hippocampus. The 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP; 50 mg/kg, i.p.), the 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor, clomipramine (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), the 5-HT receptor agonist, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT; 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg, i.p.), and the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy 4-iodophenyl)-2-amino propane (DOI; 10 microg/kg, i.p.), significantly attenuated the Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced impairment of spatial memory. These results suggest that the 5-HT neuronal system may be involved in the Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced impairment of spatial memory.
