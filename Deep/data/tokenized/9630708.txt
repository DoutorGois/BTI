Here, we report on the expression of the small chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan decorin in the developing postnatal rat brain. Northern analysis of brain RNA demonstrated decorin transcripts with peak expression on postnatal day 3 followed by a slow decline to the lower adult level. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed postnatal decorin expression in the grey matter of neocortex, hippocampus and thalamus, in myelinated fibre tracts and in several mesenchymal tissues (blood vessels, pia mater and the choroid plexus). In the neocortex, decorin is expressed in a specific laminar pattern with intense staining of the cortical plate and its derivatives, which differs remarkably from the distributions observed for other proteoglycans [B. Miller, A.M. Sheppard, A.R. Bicknese, A.L. Pearlman, Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the developing cerebral cortex: the distribution of neurocan distinguishes forming afferent and efferent axonal pathways, J. Comp. Neurol. 355 (1995) 615-28]. Thus, decorin seems to serve yet unknown functions in the developing rat brain parenchyma in addition to its well-established role as a constituent of the mesenchymal extracellular matrix.
