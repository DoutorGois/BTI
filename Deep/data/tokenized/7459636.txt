In order to determine what aspect of septohippocampal denervation elicits sympathetic sprouting, entorhinal lesions were made to first elicit intensification of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in the dentate molecular layer. Transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from the septum confirmed that the dense band of AChE staining reflects the presence of septohippicampal fibers. Animals receiving entorhinal lesions, followed 30 days later by septal lesions, demonstrated the same pattern of sympathetic sprouting as seen in animals without entorhinal lesions. These results suggest that sympathohippocampal sprouting is directed by a tropic factor released by the cholinergic-denervated hippocampal formation.
