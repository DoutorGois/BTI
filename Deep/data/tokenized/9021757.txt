We studied protein synthesis, lipid synthesis and CO2 production by oxidation of glycine, alanine and leucine by slices of rat hippocampus during the period of brain growth spurt. The metabolism of the three amino acids decreased with the age of the animals. A major reduction was observed in protein synthesis, which was 4 times higher at 7 days of age than at 21 days of age for all amino acids studied. Glycine oxidation to CO2 was twice as high as alanine oxidation and ten times higher than leucine oxidation. The major pathway of leucine utilization was incorporation into proteins. Glycine was the amino acid that had the highest metabolic rate.
