The regional distribution of various forms of tachykinin-like immunoreactivity (TKLI) was studied in rat brain using radioimmunoassay. TKLI was measured with two different tachykinin-antisera (K12 and E7), which react with neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) but not with substance P (SP) and with a specific SP-antiserum. TKLI-K12 and TKLI-E7 were found to have similar regional distributions which were, however, significantly different from that of the substance P-like immunoreactivity (SPLI). Thus, the ratio of the tissue concentrations of TKLI-K12 or TKLI-E7 to that of SPLI was higher in frontal cortex and hippocampus and lower in pons/medulla oblongata than in the other regions studied. Cation-exchange chromatography of neutral water extracts of brain tissue revealed two major immunoreactive components of TKLI-K12 and TKLI-E7, one of which co-eluted with synthetic NKB while the other appeared in the same region as synthetic NKA. The relative quantities of these components varied depending on the brain region studied. No TKLI-K12 or TKLI-E7 co-eluted with synthetic SP. Almost all of the SPLI in acetic acid or water extracts of brain tissue eluted as a single chromatographic component in the same position as synthetic SP. Potassium-stimulated in vivo release of TKLI-K12, TKLI-E7 and SPLI in striatum of rat brain could be demonstrated using intracerebral dialysis. The present results imply that tachykinins, which may serve as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators, are present in different proportions in different regions of rat brain.
