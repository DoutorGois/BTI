DL-alpha-Lipoic acid (LPA) was reported to be effective in reducing free radicals generated by oxidative stress. The protective of effect of LPA on methanol (MeOH) induced free radical changes and oxidative damages in discrete regions of rat brain have been reported in this study. Folate deficient rat (FDD) model was used. The five animal groups (saline control, FDD control, FDD+MeOH, FDD+LPA+MeOH, LPA control) were used. The FDD+MeOH and FDD+LPA+MeOH animals were injected intraperitoneally with methanol (3gm/kg). After 24h, the level of free radical scavengers such as, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione was estimated in six discrete regions of brain, retina and optic nerve. Level of protein thiol, protein carbonyl and lipid peroxidation was also estimated. Expression of heat shock protein 70 mRNA (hsp70) was studied in the cerebellum and hippocampus by reverse transcriptase PCR. All the samples showed elevation in the level of free radical scavenging enzymes and reduced level of glutathione in the FDD+MeOH group in relation to the other groups. hsp70 expression was more in FDD+MeOH group when compared to FDD+LPA+MeOH group. In conclusion, MeOH exposure leads to increased free radical generation and protein oxidative damages in the rat nervous tissue. Treatment with LPA prevents oxidative damage induced by MeOH exposure.
