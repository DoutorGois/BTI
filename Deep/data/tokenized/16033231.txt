In this paper we aimed at studying brain structures involved in intermodal attention and memory processes. This was accomplished by dipole modeling of the difference waves of event-related potentials recorded during the performance of verbal tasks and in the control condition. The models were constructed independently from each other for six difference waves obtained by subtracting different experimental conditions. The majority of equivalent sources were located in temporal and frontal areas. The differences in the evoked activity observed between task conditions in the interval from 450 to 850 ms are mainly related to variations in the activity of the hippocampus and adjacent structures.
