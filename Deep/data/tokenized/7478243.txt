We studied the neuroprotective effect of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl GABA, VGB) in the rat hippocampus after status epilepticus (SE) induced by kainic acid (KA). Rats were treated with VGB (500 or 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h before KA injection (9 mg/kg, i.p.). The lower dose of VGB had no effect on the generation or severity of convulsions. However, VGB decreased neuronal damage in the CA3a (P < 0.05) and CA1 (P < 0.01) subfields of the hippocampus. The higher dose of VGB attenuated the severity of convulsions (P < 0.05) but had no effect on the development or generalization of convulsions. This finding may have clinical implications in the prevention of neuronal damage induced by drug refractory seizures or SE.
