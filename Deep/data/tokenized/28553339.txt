Aging is a key risk factor for cognitive decline and age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Also, an age-related decrease in sex steroid hormones may have a negative impact on the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs); these hormones can regulate Tau phosphorylation and the principal kinase GSK3beta involved in this process. Hormone replacement therapy decreases NFTs, but it increases the risk of some types of cancer. However, other synthetic hormones such as tibolone (TIB) have been used for hormone replacement therapy. The aim of this work was to evaluate the long-term effects of TIB (0.01 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, intragastrically for 12 weeks) on the content of total and hyperphosphorylated Tau (PHF-1) proteins and the regulation of GSK3beta/Akt/PI3K pathway and CDK5/p35/p25 complexes in the hippocampus of aged male mice. We observed that the content of PHF-1 decreased with TIB administration. In contrast, no changes were observed in the active form of GSK3beta or PI3K. TIB decreased the expression of the total and phosphorylated form of Akt while increased that of p110 and p85. The content of CDK5 was differentially modified with TIB: it was increased at low doses and decreased at high doses. When we analyzed the content of CDK5 activators, an increase was found on p35; however, the content of p25 decreased with administration of low dose of TIB. Our results suggest a possible mechanism of action of TIB in the hippocampus of aged male mice. Through the regulation of Tau and GSK3beta/Akt/PI3K pathway, and CDK5/p35/p25 complexes, TIB may modulate neuronal plasticity and regulate learning and memory processes.
