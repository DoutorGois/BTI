The extensive research concerning the interaction between nitric oxide (NO) and ischemic brain tissue has yielded contradictory results. The present study was designed to explore the effect of gradual inhibition of NO production on brain ischemia. Gerbils were administered (i.p.) either saline (control-ischemia), or 5, 10, 25 or 50 mg/kg of NG-nitro-L-arginine (NARG), a specific inhibitor of NO synthase (NOS), and 4 h later were subjected to 5 min of forebrain ischemia. A group receiving 50 mg/kg NARG with sham operation served as a second control (control-NARG) group. Body weights and spontaneous activity were monitored daily until day 6, when the gerbils were sacrificed and their brains processed for histologic-morphometric evaluation. All ischemia groups displayed significant decreases in body weights starting on day 1, as compared to control-NARG (non-ischemic) gerbils. At 24 h post-ischemia spontaneous activity was increased in all ischemia groups in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a peak at 25 mg/kg. Typical ischemia-induced neuronal cell degeneration was observed at the hippocampal CA1 layer in control-ischemia and in each of the dose-groups of 10 mg/kg NARG and above. The 5 mg/kg group displayed damage which was not different from control-NARG, and was milder (P < 0.01) than control-ischemia gerbils and each of the other dose-groups. It is suggested that during ischemia, NO activates a series of processes which are beneficial to brain tissue, whereas an excess amount of NO causes neurotoxic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
