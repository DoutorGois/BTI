The 14-3-2 acidic protein specific for nerve tissue has been localized to bands 4 and 5 counted from the anodal front band in a polyacrylamide-gel electrophoretic pattern. The material consisted of cut-out layers of pyramidal nerve cells of the CA3 hippocampal region of the rat. Extracted protein samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation, Coons' double-layer immunofluorescence, microcomplement fixation, and a localization experiment using microdensitometry on a 400 muphi gel electrophoresis pattern with and without extra added 14-3-2 protein. The protein fractions 4 and 5, now shown to contain 14-3-2 protein, have recently been found to incorporate increased precursors at training as compared to controls.
