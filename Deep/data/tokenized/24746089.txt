OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFS) of hippocampus on the expression of GABAA receptor alpha1 and beta2 subunits in the kainite (KA)-kindled rats and explore its underlying rescue mechanism for temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: The SD rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 10):control group:no operation; epilepsy group:KA was stereotactically injected into rat hippocampus to establish KA-kindled model; sham-LFS group:only implanting of electrodes into hippocampus without LFS; LFS group:KA-kindled model with LFS. Then hippocampal tissues were collected and their expressions of GABAA receptor alpha1 and beta2 subunits measured by immunohistochemistry, quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) and Western blot.Nissl staining was performed to detect the number of damaged hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: There were significant decreases of GABAA receptor alpha1 and beta2 subunits in kindled hippocampus (P < 0.01). LFS resulted in an effective rescue, but failed to reach normal levels. The damaged neurons could not be reversed according to Nissl staining. CONCLUSION: The hippocampal application of LFS may protect against seizures by modulating the expressions of alpha1 and beta2 GABAA receptor subunits.
