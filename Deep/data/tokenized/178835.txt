Intracerebral inoculation of newborn mice with Parainfluenza I (6/94) virus produces a chronic panencephalitis. Electron microscopic studies were carried out over 125 days of the infection. Productive infection of choroidal and ependymal epithelial cells was seen from postinoculation days 2nd to the 8th. Fusion of adjacent choroid and ependymal cells resulted in giant cell formation. Completed virions were seen adsorbed to circulating macrophages and these cells replicated intracytoplasmic nucleocapsids. Neuronal infection was evident on the 3rd postinoculation day, was widespread by the 6th day postinoculation and persisted to the 35th day postinoculation. Nucleocapsid alignment and budding from neuronal plasma membranes was never seen. An initially intense mononuclear cell infiltrate subsided by the 35th day but residual inflammation persisted throughout the study. Late in the course of the infection, vacuolation of the neuropil and a periventricular and deep cerebral spongiform change was seen which could not be directly associated with local viral replication. These ultrastructural findings are correlated with prior light microscopic, virological and immunofluorescent studies of the infection and compared to other experimental models of myxovirus central nervous system infections.
