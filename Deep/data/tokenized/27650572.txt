Hippocampal neurons exhibit spatially localized firing patterns that, at the population level, represent a particular environment or context. Many studies have examined how hippocampal neurons switch from an existing representation to a new one when the environment is changed, a process referred to as remapping. New representations were commonly thought to emerge rapidly, within a few minutes and then remain remarkably stable thereafter. However, a number of recent studies suggest that hippocampal representations may be more fluid than previously thought and most of the previous studies only required that subjects switch from a familiar environment to a novel one. In the present study, we examined the concurrent development of two distinct hippocampal representations by exposing rats to two distinct environmental contexts in an ABAB pattern and we recorded neuronal activity for eight daily training sessions. Hippocampal neurons exhibited normal place fields with typical firing properties during the initial exposure to each context on the first day. However, when the rats were returned to the original context after having spent 15 min in the second context, many of the neurons fired in new locations (i.e., they remapped) as if the rat had encountered a new environment. By the third day, the representations had stabilized and were highly consistent across visits to the same context. These results suggest that when subjects concurrently encode multiple contexts, hippocampal representations may require repeated experiences to fully stabilize. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
