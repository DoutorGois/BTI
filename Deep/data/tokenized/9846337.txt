Brain imaging showed extra-hippocampal temporal lesions in two patients with major disturbances of memory for academic knowledge including complete loss of professional knowledge and school learning especially regarding history, but sparing recent episodic memory in both cases and remote episodic memory in one of them. The antero-inferior and/or lateral regions of the temporal lobe could contain critical structures required to evoke and maintain memory of academic knowledge.
