Using field potential recording in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from rats injected with cysteamine (200 mg/kg, s.c.), changes in activity and plasticity of Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses were examined. Extracellular field potential recording prior to and following either theta-pattern primed bursts (PBs), perfusion with low Mg(2+) or with high Ca(2+), indicated long-term potentiation (LTP) of population spikes amplitude (PSA). The extent of LTP of PSA was significantly lower in cysteamine-treated rats. It is concluded that cysteamine can entail lasting modifications in susceptibility of hippocampal CA1 for synaptic plasticity induced by tetanus. Similarly, disability in function of CA1 synapses can be traced by other protocols of LTP induction. The relevancy of the results to the facilitatory role of endogenous somatostatin in the function of Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses is also discussed.
