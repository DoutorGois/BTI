OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Tiaoxin Recipe (TXR) on learning and memory related gene expression in hippocampus of senescence accelerated mice (SAM). METHODS: Changes of learning and memory related gene expression, including mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), presenile protein 1 and 2 (PS-1, PS-2), tau, APP, apoE and bcl-2 in hippocampus of SAM were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The effect of TXR were tested. E2020 was used as the drug for control. RESULTS: Compared with those in the same aged mice, in the 5-month old SAM, levels of gene expression of MR, tau, PS-2 and APP were significantly higher, that of apo-E lower, levels of gene expression PS-1 and bcl-2 were unobviously changed; while in the 12-month old SAM, gene expression of MR and tau were higher, bcl-2 was lower and PS-1, PS-2, apoE and APP were also unobviously changed. Continuously orally taken TXR could correct the abnormality of MR, tau and apoE gene expression in hippocampus of 5-month SAM and that of MR and bcl-2 in 12-month SAM. CONCLUSION: Continuously orally taken of TXR has the effect of regulating and correcting learning and memory related gene expression in hippocampus of 5-month and 12-month SAM.
