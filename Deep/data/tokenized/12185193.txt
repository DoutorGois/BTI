We studied the level of the basal (constitutive) HSP70 expression (inducible and constitutive forms) in the central nervous system (CNS) of male and female rats from the postnatal period to maturity. HSP70 levels were analyzed by immunoblotting in five different areas (cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord). The highest levels of HSP70 were found in juvenile rats and decreased progressively until reaching baseline levels between 2 and 4 months. A slight and nonsignificant increase in aged (2-year-old) rats compared with adult subjects was observed in some cerebral areas (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum). In the first weeks of postnatal development, HSP70 immunoreactivity was distributed throughout CNS sections and no specific immunopositive cells could be clearly determined. In adult animals, strong immunostaining was observed in some large neurons (Purkinje neurons and mesencephalic and spinal cord motor neurons), some perivascular and subpial astrocytes, and ependymocytes. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that HSP70 in these cells is located in the perinuclear area and in mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and microtubules. In neurons, strong immunolabeling was also observed in synaptic membranes. The postnatal time course of HSP70 levels and the location and size of HSP70-immunopositive cells suggest that HSP70 constitutively expressed in the rat CNS may be mainly determined by the degree of development and metabolic activity of the neural cells.
