Over the past decade, it has become clear that neural stem cells in the adult mammalian brain continuously generate new neurons, predominantly in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. However, the central issue of whether these new neurons participate in functional synaptic circuitry has yet to be resolved. Here, we use virus-based transsynaptic neuronal tracing and c-Fos mapping of odor-induced neuronal activity to demonstrate that neurons generated in the adult functionally integrate into the synaptic circuitry of the brain.
