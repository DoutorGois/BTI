Thyroid hormone regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a process involved in key functions, such as learning, memory, and mood regulation. We addressed the role of thyroid hormone receptor TRalpha1 in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, using mice harboring a TRalpha1 null allele (TRalpha1(-/-)), overexpressing TRalpha1 6-fold (TRalpha2(-/-)), and a mutant TRalpha1 (TRalpha1(+/m)) with a 10-fold lower affinity to the ligand. While hippocampal progenitor proliferation was unaltered, TRalpha1(-/-) mice exhibited a significant increase in doublecortin-positive immature neurons and increased survival of bromodeoxyuridine-positive (BrdU(+)) progenitors as compared to wild-type controls. In contrast, the TRalpha1(+/m) and the TRalpha2(-/-) mice, where the overexpressed TRalpha1 acts as an aporeceptor, showed a significant decline in surviving BrdU(+) progenitors. TRalpha1(-/-) and TRalpha2(-/-) mice showed opposing effects on neurogenic markers like polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule and stathmin. The decreased progenitor survival in the TRalpha2(-/-) and TRalpha1(+/m) mice could be rescued by thyroid hormone treatment, as was the decline in neuronal differentiation seen in the TRalpha1(+/m) mice. These mice also exhibited a decrease in NeuroD(+) cell numbers in the dentate gyrus, suggesting an effect on early postmitotic progenitors. Our results provide the first evidence of a role for unliganded TRalpha1 in modulating the deleterious effects of hypothyroidism on adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
