The effects of the neuroactive steroids alphaxalone and pregnanolone on single GABA(A) receptor channels were tested in cell-attached and inside-out patches from cultured newborn rat hippocampal neurons. The conductance of these single channels ranged between 10 and 80 pS when exposed to low (0.5-3 microM) GABA concentrations. These GABA concentrations activated low-conducting channels (<40 pS) in 78% of the patches, 22% of patches had channels with a maximum conductance above 40 pS. Alphaxalone at concentrations above 1 microM, and pregnanolone at concentrations above 0.1 microM, significantly increased the conductance of initially low-conducting single channels activated by GABA up to seven-fold and at all concentrations tested, both drugs increased open probability and mean open time and decreased closed probability and mean closed time of channels. Both steroids at higher concentrations could directly activate high conductance (>40 pS) chloride channels. Both the directly activated channels and those channels that had been previously affected by alphaxalone were modulated by diazepam, a benzodiazepine drug that is known to specifically modulate GABA(A) channels. The present study is the first one to show that neurosteroids can significantly increase single GABA(A) channel conductance, thus enlarging our current knowledge on the molecular mechanism of action of these compounds.
