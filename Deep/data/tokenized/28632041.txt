Background and purpose We evaluated two methods to identify mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS): visual inspection by experienced epilepsy neuroradiologists based on structural magnetic resonance imaging sequences and automated hippocampal volumetry provided by a processing pipeline based on the FMRIB Software Library. Methods This retrospective study included patients from the epilepsy monitoring unit database of our institution. All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging in 1.5T and 3T scanners with protocols that included thin coronal T2, T1 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and isometric T1 acquisitions. Two neuroradiologists with experience in epilepsy and blinded to clinical data evaluated magnetic resonance images for the diagnosis of MTS. The diagnosis of MTS based on an automated method included the calculation of a volumetric asymmetry index between the two hippocampi of each patient and a threshold value to define the presence of MTS obtained through statistical tests (receiver operating characteristics curve). Hippocampi were segmented for volumetric quantification using the FIRST tool and fslstats from the FMRIB Software Library. Results The final cohort included 19 patients with unilateral MTS (14 left side): 14 women and a mean age of 43.4 +/- 10.4 years. Neuroradiologists had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 73.3% to detect MTS (gold standard, k = 0.755). Automated hippocampal volumetry had a sensitivity of 84.2% and specificity of 86.7% (k = 0.704). Combined, these methods had a sensitivity of 84.2% and a specificity of 100% (k = 0.825). Conclusions Automated volumetry of the hippocampus could play an important role in temporal lobe epilepsy evaluation, namely on confirmation of unilateral MTS diagnosis in patients with radiological suggestive findings.
