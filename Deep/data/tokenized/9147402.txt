We describe how endogenous adenosine can prevent the induction of homosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) in the CA1 region of slices of adult rat hippocampus. Neither of two consecutive periods of prolonged low frequency stimulation (LFS; 1 Hz, 900 stimuli) of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibres resulted in the induction of LTD in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices from adult (8-30 week) animals. However, in the presence of adenosine deaminase or the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentyl-xanthine (DPCPX), LTD was induced by each of the first and second of two periods of LFS. The first period of LFS did not, but the second period of LFS did, induce LTD in the presence of DPCPX and the NMDA receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5). The present results show that A1 receptor activation by endogenous adenosine can prevent the induction of LTD in the adult hippocampus.
