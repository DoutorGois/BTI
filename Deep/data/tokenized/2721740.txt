Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the dorsal hippocamp and basolateral amygdalar complex impede the differential and extinctive inhibition. The damage of the corticomedial amygdala against a background of the dorsal hippocamp deficiency facilitates differentiation and extinction of alimentary reflexes induced by a decrease of the alimentary motivation and by weakening of alimentary conditioned reflexes. Lesions of the dorsal hippocamp after the corticomedial amygdala damage facilitates the training of positive alimentary reflexes, but weakens inhibitory conditioned reflexes.
