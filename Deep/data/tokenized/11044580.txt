gamma-Aminobutyric acid-transaminase (GABA-T) plays an important role in the metabolism of GABA, particularly in the neurons or glial cells. The present study was undertaken to determine the alteration of GABA-T expression in the gerbil hippocampus after ischemia-reperfusion. In the sham, GABA-T(+) neurons were scattered in the hippocampus proper and dentate gyrus. The intensity of the GABA-T immunoreactivity had nearly disappeared in the interneurons at 12 h after ischemia. In contrast, 24 h post-ischemia the dramatic augmentation of GABA-T immunoreactivity in the pyramidal cells was observed in the CA1 area but not in the CA2 or CA3 areas. Forty-eight hours after ischemia-reperfusion, its immunoreactivity was preserved in the CA1 neurons. These results suggest that the over-expression of GABA-T in the CA1 area may be related to delayed neuronal death after ischemia-reperfusion insult.
