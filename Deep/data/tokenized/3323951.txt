We examined the influence of helium pressure on the depression induced by various excitatory amino acids in CA1 hippocampal field potentials. The effects of quisqualate, L-glutamate, L-aspartate and kainate were not significantly affected by helium pressure, while those of N-methyl-D-aspartate and D,L-homocysteate were enhanced. These findings suggest that helium pressure specifically increased the sensitivity of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor type in the hippocampus. Other hypotheses are discussed.
