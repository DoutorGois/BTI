Since it is known that several immediate early genes are induced by olfactory stimuli, we determined whether an olfactory stimulus also induces the expression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase gene hVH-5 (homologue of vaccinia virus H1 phosphatase gene, clone 5), a member of a novel class of immediate early genes encoding dual-specificity protein phosphatases. The expression was studied by in situ hybridization in different brain structures involved in odor processing, in control and bilateral entorhinal cortex (EC) lesioned rats. EC-lesion did not significantly affect hVH-5 gene expression in the glomerular cell layer of the olfactory bulb (OB), while odor stimulation induced it in both control and EC-lesioned groups. In contrast, odor-induced expression of hVH-5 gene in mitral/granular cell layers was only evident after lesion of the EC. Similar results were obtained in the piriform cortex (PCx), a structure intimately connected to the mitral cell layer. In the CA1 hippocampal subfield, odor stimulation induced hVH-5 gene expression in both control and EC-lesioned animals, the increase being potentiated in lesioned rats. CA3 and dentate gyrus exhibited a similar pattern of gene expression, the odor stimulating gene expression in both control and lesioned groups. The amygdala (Am) displayed no significant change. It appears that through the induction of a MAPK phosphatase, the EC controls MAPK activities differently after odor stimulation in OB, PCx and hippocampus (Hip). The results illustrate the notion that odor representation in the brain requires plastic modifications at both anatomical and functional levels.
