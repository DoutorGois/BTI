Earlier we have reported that repeated ethanol treatment during adolescence causes long-lasting impairments in spatial learning and memory. The present study was undertaken to determine the cellular mechanisms underlying the persistent ethanol-induced cognitive dysfunction in adolescent male rats. Since in adult animals ethanol is known to affect the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-gated ion channel, the hypothesis tested here was that adolescent ethanol exposure modulates NMDA receptor (NR) regulation in the brain. Adolescent male rats were injected daily with ethanol (2g/kg intraperitoneally) for 5 consecutive days. Control rats received isovolumetric saline for the same number of days. Groups of control and experimental rats were sacrificed 7 days after the last ethanol/saline administration, and NR activity was measured in specific brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus) using the [(3)H]MK-801 binding assay. In addition, some rats were sacrificed and their brains were used to investigate changes in NR pharmacology by measuring specific NR2 subunits immunohistochemically. Compared to saline-treated controls, ethanol-treated rats showed significant increases in [(3)H]MK-801 maximal binding in the frontal cortex. This was associated with increased cortical NR2B subunit protein. [(3)H]MK-801 binding in the hippocampus was minimally affected. These results indicate that ethanol exposure during the adolescent period produces brain region-specific alterations in NR activity. These changes are different from those reported in literature for ethanol administration during the perinatal period or adulthood. Together, these data suggest that adolescence represents a unique stage in brain development in its long-term sensitivity to ethanol.
