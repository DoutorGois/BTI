The vitamin A metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), is a regulator of nervous system development. Using a subtracted cDNA library constructed from neuroblastoma cells, the atRA-responsive gene calmin (Clmn) was identified (Merrill et al. [2004] Biol Chem 385:605-614). The Clmn transcript is detected very early in rat embryonic development and is sensitive to retinoid status. In vitamin A-deficient embryos, Clmn mRNA is dramatically down-regulated in the neuroepithelium adjacent to the somites, and this expression can be rescued with the addition of atRA. In embryonic day 18.5 embryos, CLMN is detected in regions where newly differentiated neurons are found, including the neural retina and the cortical plate; and in the adult brain, CLMN is most highly expressed in the neuron cell bodies of the hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb. Thus, Clmn is sensitive to retinoid status during early gestational stages, and its expression is relegated to postmitotic neuronal cells in the adult rat brain.
