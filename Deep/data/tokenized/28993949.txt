Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques. These protein deposits impair synaptic plasticity thereby producing a progressive decline in cognitive function. Current therapies are merely palliative and only slow cognitive decline. Poly-N-methylated Abeta-Peptide C-Terminal Fragments (MEPTIDES) were recently shown to reduce Abeta toxicity in vitro and in Drosophila melanogaster, however whether these novel compounds are effective in inhibiting Abeta-induced toxicity in the mammalian brain remains unclear. We therefore investigated whether MEPTIDES have the ability to reduce the neurotoxic effects of Abeta in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Abeta42 (100 mug, 2 mM) or vehicle (0.15 M Tris buffer) was stereotaxically injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus at a rate of 1 mul/min for 10 min. The effects on hippocampal-mediated learning were subsequently assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM). The presence of apoptotic activity was also assessed by determining the expression levels of active caspase-3 using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western Blot techniques. In addition, half of the animals (n = 20) received an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of MEPTIDES (2 mg/kg) 48 h after intrahippocampal injection of Abeta42. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI -TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) showed that MEPTIDES crossed the blood brain barrier (BBB) and revealed their distribution in the rat brain. Rats treated with Abeta42 displayed spatial learning deficits and increased hippocampal caspase-3 gene (CASP-3) expression which was reversed by subsequent injection of MEPTIDES. The present results show that MEPTIDES have the potential to reverse the toxic effects of Abeta42 in vivo.
