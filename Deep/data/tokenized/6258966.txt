The activity of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and acetylcholine esterase were followed in rat brain cerebral cortex, caudate, thalamus, hippocampus and medulla after i.v. administration of physostigmine. Both enzymes were found to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The most pronounced inhibition of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase was found in caudate, where the highest activity of acetylcholine esterase is found.
