Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and electroacupuncture (EA) at specific acupoints have both shown promising anticonvulsant effects in intractable epilepsy patients. The differences between these therapies are target selection and stimulation parameter modulation. It has been demonstrated that EA of the extremities results in stimulation of the VN and protection of hippocampus neurons, possibly by an anti-inflammatory response. Similarly, VNS can also suppress neural inflammatory responses, implying that VNS may protect hippocampal neurons against seizure-induced damage.
