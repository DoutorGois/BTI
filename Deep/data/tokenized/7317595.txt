The thresholds of convulsive reaction and duration of epi-discharges in the dorsal hippocamp and basolateral amygdala exposed to high-frequency electrical stimulation were studied in experiments on cats with traumatic shock. The thresholds of convulsive reaction were found to be significantly increased and the duration of epi-discharges shortened. This indicates marked depression of the function of the structures under study in the course of the shock development.
