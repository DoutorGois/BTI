PURPOSE: To define the properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid-type A (GABAA) receptors expressed on dentate granule cells in neonatal rats and to define the impact of prolonged seizures on GABAA receptors in 28- to 35-day-old rats. METHODS: Whole GABAA receptor currents were recorded from acutely isolated dentate granule cells. Cells were isolated from 7- to 14-day-old rats for the first experiment. For the second experiment, cells were isolated from 28- to 35-day-old naive rats and rats that had undergone 45 minutes of status epilepticus. Modulation of GABAA receptor currents by diazepam (DZP), zinc, and zolpidem was studied. RESULTS: In 7- to 14-day-old rats, dentate granule cells express DZP- and zolpidem-insensitive, zinc-sensitive GABAA receptors. In 28- to 35-day-old rats, dentate granule cells express DZP-sensitive GABAA receptors. At the latter age, prolonged seizures render GABAA receptors DZP-insensitive. CONCLUSION: Hippocampal dentate granule cells express DZP-insensitive receptors in hyperexcitable states. These receptors are likely to contain alpha4 subunit.
