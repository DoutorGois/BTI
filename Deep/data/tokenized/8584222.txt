To elucidate the mechanisms of ischemic cell damage, biochemical disturbances developing during and following in vitro ischemia of 5, 10 or 15 min duration were compared in hippocampal slices prepared from gerbil and rat brains. During ischemia the release of glutamate from slices into the medium was determined, and after ischaemia and 10 min of recovery slices were analyzed for ATP levels, adenylate energy charge and cGMP content. The release of glutamate into the medium during in vitro ischemia and the recovery of energy metabolism determined after 10 min of recovery was almost identical in slices prepared from gerbil and rat hippocampi. In contrast, cGMP levels measured 10 min following in vitro ischemia were significantly higher in gerbil as compared to rat slices. Since after 10 min of recovery following in vitro ischemia, cGMP levels reflect nitric oxide (NO) synthesis (inhibition by NO synthase blocker), it is concluded that increased NO synthesis may contribute to the higher sensitivity of the gerbil as compared to the rat hippocampus towards transient ischemia.
