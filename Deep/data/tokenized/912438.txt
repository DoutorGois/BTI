Rats were given thallous acetate (5 mg elemental thallium/kg body weight) IP daily for 7 days and prepared for electron microscopy (perfusion-fixation) and for biochemical study. Increased incidence of Golgi zones and electron-dense bodies were observed in the anterior hypothalamus and hippocampus. Sequestrated axons were seen in the hypothalamus. Depletion of succinic dehydrogenase and guanine deaminase occurred in the cerebrum.
