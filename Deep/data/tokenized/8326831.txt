Neurons undergoing delayed neuronal death produced by hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) or status epilepticus (SE) showed a massive expression of c-Jun in their nuclei 24 h after the insult. With SE there was also a weaker induction of c-Fos and Jun B in dying neurons. SE induced in the presence of the NMDA antagonist MK-801 produced no delayed c-Jun expression in the hippocampus and nerve cell death did not occur in this region, although there was a delayed c-jun expression in the amygdala/piriform region, and cell death occurred in this area. Activation of central muscarinic receptors with pilocarpine, or block of D2 dopamine receptors with haloperidol, treatments which do not cause neuronal damage, strongly induced Fos and Jun B in hippocampal and striatal neurons, but only induced c-Jun very weakly. Thus, c-Jun may participate in the genetic cascade of events that produce programmed cell death in neurons.
