A search for genes differentially expressed in the rat striatum revealed a gene fragment with a ventral to dorsal striatal expression pattern. The sequence of the fragment was used to isolate mouse and rat clones that upon sequencing were identified as homologous to human guanine deaminase. Here we report the distribution of guanine deaminase in the rodent brain. In situ hybridization localization of the encoding mRNA showed a distribution primarily in forebrain areas including cortical pyramidal neurons, ventral striatal medium spiny neurons, hippocampal pyramidal neurons in CA3-CA1 and granule cells in the dentate gyrus, and neurons of the amygdala. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies raised against peptide fragments derived from the guanine deaminase protein sequence showed localization of guanine deaminase in areas predicted by the mRNA distribution. In addition to immunolabeling of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala there was also labeling in the terminal fields of these neurons including the thalamus, globus pallidum and substantia nigra. A functional histochemical assay that demonstrates the site of guanine deamination shows guanine deaminase activity in a pattern that matched the immunohistochemical localization. The cellular distribution of guanine deaminase to distal areas of the cell including terminals and dendrites was additionally demonstrated by the expression of recombinant guanine deaminase in transformed cortical neurons in culture. In summary we have described the isolation and characterization of mouse and rat guanine deaminase. The expression of guanine deaminase is primarily restricted to forebrain neurons. A histochemical assay was used to localize guanine deaminase activity to the dendrites and axons of neurons expressing guanine deaminase.
