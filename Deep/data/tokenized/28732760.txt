Chronic stress results in neurological complications like depression, cognitive dysfunction, and anxiety disorders. In our previous study, we observed that Urtica dioica leaf extract attenuated chronic stress-induced complications. Further, we observed that Urtica dioica contained a great amount of the flavonoid rutin in it. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the effect of rutin on 21days chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) mouse model. CUS led to a decline in locomotion & muscle coordination abilities, cognitive deficits, anxiety, and depression. These neurobehavioral outcomes were associated with neurodegeneration in the CA3 region of the hippocampus as found by H&E staining. Rutin efficiently rescued the CUS-induced behavioral deficits by reducing depression, anxiety, improving cognition, and locomotor & muscle coordination skills. Further, rutin treatment protected the CUS-induced hippocampal neuronal loss. This study establishes the neuroprotective effect of rutin in chronic stress.
