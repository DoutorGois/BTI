Recent work indicates that treatments which block adhesion receptors prevent the stabilization of long term potentiation (LTP). The experiments reported here show that brief stimulation of hippocampal NMDA receptors, a triggering event for LTP induction, results in the extracellular proteolysis of two or more members of the Cell Adhesion Molecule (CAM) family. This effect is rapid, occurs at a consensus serine protease site, and is selective to NMDA receptors. It is also found in vivo after kainic acid induced seizures. Cleavage of adhesive connections could be an early step in the formation of new synaptic configurations.
