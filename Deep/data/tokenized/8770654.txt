It has been proposed that neurodegenerative processes of aging are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cellular metabolism. These reactive oxygen species are scavenged by antioxidant enzymes in biological systems. The present study was designed to determine the selective distribution of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in different regions of the C57BL/6N mouse brain and to determine if any alterations occurred with age. Catalase activity did not show any significant change except in cerebellum. Activity of superoxide dismutase was increased with age in all regions of the brain except in hippocampus of 2-yr-old mice. The glutathione peroxidase activity in the caudate nucleus increased in all regions of the brain, however, the activity did not change at one, six and 12 months. A significant increasing pattern of glutathione content was found in the cerebellum and brain stem with age. These data demonstrate that although the level of antioxidant enzymes varied in different regions of the brain, overall the enzyme activities tend to increase with age.
