Subcellular localization of the NMDA receptor NR1 splice forms was studied by expressing individual splice variants and their epitope-tagged derivatives in mouse fibroblasts and in hippocampal neurons. When NR1 splice variants were expressed in fibroblasts, the amount of NR1 molecules expressed on the cell surface varied among forms with different C-terminal cytoplasmic domains. The splice forms with the longest C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (NR1-1a and NR1-1b) showed the lowest amount of cell surface expression, and the splice forms with the shortest C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (NR1-4a and NR1-4b) showed the highest cell surface expression. Cell surface expression of NR1 was enhanced by the coexpression of the NR2 subunit. We measured the glutamate-induced increase of calcium concentration in fibroblasts expressing one of the NR1 splice forms and the NR2B subunit. The increase of calcium concentration after glutamate application had a positive correlation with the amount of NR1 splice forms expressed on the cell surface. When epitope-tagged NR1 splice variants were expressed in primary hippocampal neurons using recombinant adenoviruses, we also observed the differential expression on the cell surface between splice variants. These results suggest that the splicing of the C-terminal domain of the NR1 subunit regulates the cell surface expression of the functional NMDA receptors.
