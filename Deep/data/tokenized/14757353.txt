We have adapted for use in fish several of the procedures employed for recording single neuron activity in freely behaving rodents. Developing a method for single unit chronic recording in freely behaving fish was motivated by a need for a comparison across taxa of telencephalic neural activity evoked during spatial navigation by animals of their environments. However, the procedures outlined here can be modified easily for underwater recording from most aquatic species and from other brain areas. Under anesthesia, bundles of stereotrodes or tetrodes were implanted into the dorsolateral region of the goldfish or cichlid telencephalon. An infrared light emitting diode (LED) was also fixed to the fish's head at the time of surgery. After recovery from anesthesia, fish were allowed to swim freely within a large aquarium. Single unit activity was analyzed and correlated with stimulus conditions, behavior, and the location and movement of the LED recorded by a camera tracking system. The value of this technique is demonstrated by providing the first evidence in fish for navigation-related neural firing, including "place cells" that display location-specific discharge.
