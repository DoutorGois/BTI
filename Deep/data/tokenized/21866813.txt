The aim of the study was to examine the distribution of cells expressing Msi-1 (Musashi-1) protein which is believed to be a marker of neural stem cells, in rat telencephalon. These cells were found to be concentrated in the subventricular proliferative zone and diffusely scattered in striatum and hippocampus. Moreover, neurons with extensive Msi-1 reaction were found in habenular nuclei. The data obtained are not in full agreement with current views on the localization of neural stem cells in the brain.
