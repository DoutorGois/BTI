The hippocampus may play a critical role in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression. There are two main lines of evidence for this: firstly, many of its functions correspond to those altered in depression, and secondly, many hippocampal functions are regulated by the serotonergic (5-HT) system, which is a common target of antidepressant treatments. Chronic effects of antidepressants and electroconvulsive shock (ECS) have been studied by various methods using electrophysiology, in vivo microdialysis or ex vivo neurochemical measurements. The aim of the current review is to point out possible correlations between these studies based on different methods and to suggest neurochemical mechanisms that result in the observed changes in hippocampal physiology and neurogenesis. These changes in hippocampal neurochemistry are reviewed and compared with the abnormalities associated with stress, corticosterone or depression.
