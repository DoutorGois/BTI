Hippocampal pyramidal cells can be divided into place cells, which fire action potentials when an animal is in specific locations, and silent cells, which are not spatially selective. In this issue of Neuron, Epsztein et al. find intracellular differences between place and silent cells by using whole-cell recordings in freely moving rats.
