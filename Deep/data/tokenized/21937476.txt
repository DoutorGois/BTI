Healthy midlife children of a parent with Alzheimer's disease ([AD] N = 23; 9 male) participated in neuropsychological testing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain volumetrics were obtained. In all, 35% of the sample were apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-e4 positive (n = 8; 5 male). The ApoE-e4 group exhibited significantly slower performances on an executive function and processing speed measure and had less white matter volume than the non-ApoE-e4 group. Lesser white matter volume was significantly correlated with slower processing speed. Processing speed and changes in white matter volume might be indicators of preclinical decline in AD.
