The presence of beta-nerve growth factor (NGF) and its cell surface receptor (NGF-R) in the brain has been well established by a variety of experimental techniques in recent years. In particular, the molecular cloning of NGF and NGF-R as well as the development of sensitive two-site ELISA techniques for determining the levels of NGF and antibodies to NGF-R suitable for immunohistochemistry have led to rapid accumulation of data in this field from many laboratories. A main finding is the function of NGF in the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, expressing NGF receptors and responding to the factor by increased activity of choline acetyltransferase, and the production of NGF in cortical areas and hippocampus comprising terminal areas for the cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain. In addition, findings suggest that additional neurons in the brain and spinal cord may utilize NGF, notably during development and possibly also after lesion of the adult CNS. Moreover, observations indicate that endogenous levels of NGF are lowered in the aged rat brain concomitant with losses of NGF-dependent neurons in the basal forebrain. The involvement of NGF in human neurodegenerative diseases is not established but the application of NGF to degenerating cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer patients may prove useful. A promising approach to achieve this goal is the production of biologically active, recombinant NGF.
