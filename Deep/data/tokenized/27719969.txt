Brain ageing leads to a series of changes that reduce the processes of adaptation and response. These transformations can end in cognitive impairment and/or dementia. Although the cause of these changes is diverse, inflammation and oxidative stress explain some of the pathophysiological mechanisms of these anomalies of brain functioning. Neuroinflammation triggers neuronal injury through the presence of inflammatory cytokines and the activation of microglia through membrane receptors and nuclear activation factors. This neuroinflammatory phenomenon also affects neuron plasticity, altering the genesis and maintenance of long-term potentiation, leading to impairment of hippocampus-dependent memory. Oxidative stress and the production of free oxygen radicals also cause toxic effects in aged brains, largely due to lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. The identification of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these events could shed new light on possible therapeutic targets and offer strategies for the prevention of diseases related to brain ageing, cognitive impairment and dementia.
