The rates of local cerebral glucose utilization have been measured in normal conscious and hypnotized rabbits by the [14C]deoxyglucose method. In control rabbits the rates vary widely throughout the brain, with the values in gray matter broadly distributed around an average which is about 3 times greater than that of white matter. The higher values area in structures of auditory system (superior olive, inferior colliculus, auditory cortex). Animal hypnosis reduces the rates of glucose utilization in all structures of the rabbit brain, particularly in the caudate nucleus, putamen and sensory and motor cortices.
