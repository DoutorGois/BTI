Antisense digoxigenin-labeled deoxyoligonucleotides probes and non-isotopic in situ hybridization (HIS) techniques have been used to explore the NMDA-NR1 receptor subunit mRNA distribution in different brain areas of rats which had their dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway previously lesioned with intracerebral administration of 6-OH-dopamine (6-OH-DA). Intense and significant hybridization signals for NR1 mRNA were found in dentate gyrus and regions CA1-CA2-CA3 of the hippocampus, in layers II-III and V-VI of the cerebral cortex, and in the cerebellum of sham-treated rats. Basal ganglia structures such as the striatum exhibited few NR1 mRNA hybridization signals as compared to the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In contrast, both zona compacta and reticulata of substantia nigra (SN) showed a reduced number of cells with nevertheless intense NR1 mRNA HIS signals. The NR1 mRNA distribution in the brain was affected in a brain regional selective manner by 6-OH-DA induced lesions of DA neuronal systems. A striking increase in NR1 mRNA HIS signals was observed in both striata after unilateral lesioning with 6-OH-DA. Instead, in SN compacta but not in reticulata, a moderate but significant bilateral reduction of NR1 mRNA was observed after unilateral 6-OH-DA injection. No significant changes in NR1 mRNA were detected in cerebral cortex and other brain regions after 6-OH-DA treatment. These studies, and others reported in the literature, support the view that extensive lesions of nigrostriatal DA-containing neurons in the brain may trigger compensatory or adaptative responses in basal ganglia structures such as striatum and substantia nigra which involve glutamateric neurons and the genic expression of NMDA receptors.
