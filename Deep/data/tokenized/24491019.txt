The increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) associated with specific apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms appears to relate to altered amyloid-beta (Abeta) homeostasis. Clearance of Abeta from the brain is reduced in the presence of the AD-associated ApoE4 isoform, which may contribute to the accumulation of Abeta deposits in the parenchyma and vasculature. The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), both established ApoE receptors, are involved in Abeta uptake, with LRP1 additionally implicated in Abeta transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we detected the co-distribution of heparan sulfate (HS), ApoE and LRP1 in Abeta(1-40)-positive brain microvessels from individuals with Down's syndrome diagnosed with AD. In addition, ApoE was pulled-down from AD cerebrospinal fluid with anti-Abeta antibodies. Using Chinese hamster ovary cells deficient in HS or LRP1, we found that ApoE increases cell association of Abeta in a HSPG- and LRP1-dependent manner; and further, ApoE processing is altered in the absence of cellular HS. These interactions may facilitate Abeta clearance from the brain, but if overwhelmed could contribute to Abeta accumulation and the pathogenesis of AD.
