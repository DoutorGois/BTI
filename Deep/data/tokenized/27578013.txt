In this study, we seek to explore alterations of coupling between functional connectivity density (FCD) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in systemic lupus erythematosus patients without overt neuropsychiatric symptoms (non-NPSLE) by using resting-state functional MR imaging. This study was approved by the institutional ethical review board, and all participants signed written informed consent prior to the study. Twenty six non-NPSLE patients and 35 matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MR imaging. The correlation analysis between FCD and ALFF was conducted to assess the imaging coupling. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to correlate imaging variables to clinical and neuropsychological data in non-NPSLE patients. According to the consistent alteration of FCD and ALFF, region of interests were identified including the right inferior temporal gyrus, bilateral hippocampus-parahippocampus (H-PH), left posterior cingulate cortex, superior parietal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, and bilateral precuneus. Across-voxel correlation analysis showed decreased coupling strengths in some brain regions. Correlations between FCD, ALFF, and coupling strength in H-PH and C3/C4/MoCA were found. The imaging coupling between FCD and ALFF was decreased in non-NPSLE patients, indicating brain function alteration in non-NPSLE patients, especially the abnormal coupling between FCD and ALFF of the hippocampus-parahippocampus might be an imaging biomarker of brain dysfunction in non-NPSLE patients.
