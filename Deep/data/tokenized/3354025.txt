We studied energy metabolism after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. Four different cerebral areas were tested: frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem. Vmax of the following enzymatic activities was evaluated: in the homogenate: hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase for the glycolytic pathway, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for the hexose monophosphate shunt; in the purified nonsynaptic mitochondria: NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase for the Krebs cycle, and cytochrome oxidase for the electron transfer chain. We also evaluated some parameters related to the respiration of nonsynaptic mitochondria (State 3, State 4, uncoupled state, respiratory control ratio, and ADP:O ratio). Subarachnoid hemorrhage did not significantly affect Vmax of the enzymatic activities related to anaerobic and aerobic metabolism; however, mitochondrial respiration was affected, particularly in the presence of NADH-producing substrates (glutamate + malate).
