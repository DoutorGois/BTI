We have highlighted some aspects of the action of excitatory amino acid transmission in the hippocampus. Fast epsps can be blocked by CNQX to reveal a component of synaptic transmission which is mediated by NMDA receptors. Extracellular recordings of ionic activities show that NMDA and non-NMDA ionophores are permeable to the major monovalent cations, while NMDA ionophores also appear to be permeable to Ca2+. Interactions of agonists applied by iontophoresis may be correlates of phenomena such as LTP, which can be evoked by appropriate synaptic stimulation.
