In this study we have investigated the presence of immunoreactive calcitonin in the central nervous system and pituitary of sheep. The calcitonin concentrations were determined radioimmunologically by two different antibodies. We have demonstrated calcitonin in extracts of areas of the central nervous system, whole pituitary, thyroid gland and plasma of 21 sheep. The concentrations were (ng/g wet weight, mean values +/- SE): thyroid 16.0 +/- 4.4, pituitary 2.03 +/- 0.34, reticular formation 1.64 +/- 0.25, substantia nigra 1.53 +/- 0.46, dentate nucleus 1.11 +/- 0.27, putamen 1.05 +/- 0.35, hippocampus 0.97 +/- 0.17, fornix 0.96 +/- 0.15, anterior thalamus 0.92 +/- 0.28, mammillary body 0.88 +/- 0.12, cerebellum 0.86 +/- 0.09, caudate nucleus 0.84 +/- 0.11, posterior hypothalamus 0.83 +/- 0.19, epiphysis 0.75 +/- 0.25, thalamus centralis 0.71 +/- 0.10, almond nucleus 0.69 +/- 0.16, medulla oblongata 0.67 +/- 0.15, anterior hypothalamus 0.66 +/- 0.20, precentral gyrus 0.66 +/- 0.16, globus pallidus 0.63 +/- 0.31, postcentral gyrus 0.36 +/- 0.08 and plasma (ng/ml) 0.058 +/- 0.013. Our results demonstrate that immunoreactive calcitonin is present in the central nervous system (CNS) of sheep, compatible with a neurotransmitter function for this hormone.
