Morphological and immunological assays were employed to examine 18 epileptic patients and 40 Krushinskii-Molodkina rats undergoing subconvulsive and convulsive acoustic stimulations. After multiple audiogenic epileptiform convulsive fits the epileptogenic areas of the brain of epileptic patients (biopsy material) and the neocortex of the sensorimotor area, amygdaloid complex and hippocampus of rats manifested vascular alterations in the form of chronic or subacute vasculitis. The changes revealed in the ratio of B and T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of the epileptic patients in combination with pronounced stimulation of cellular and humoral immunity responses to antigens of homologous and autologous brain extracts, more well-defined in marked inflammatory process, may attest to the immune genesis of endo- and perivasculitis.
