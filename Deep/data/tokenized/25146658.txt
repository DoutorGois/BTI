OBJECTIVE: To evaluate hippocampal volume changes and neuropsychological performances in patients with either amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Thirty-eight AD dementia, 22 aMCI patients, and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. Bilateral hippocampal volume was measured concurrently with mini-mental state examination (MMSE), auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), Boston naming test (BNT), and activities of daily living (ADL) test. Baseline and two additional follow-up examinations were conducted. RESULTS: Baseline hippocampal volumes were significantly smaller in AD group than that in aMCI and control groups. MMSE, AVLT, ADL, and BNT scores for the AD group were significantly different from that of both aMCI and control groups. Baseline hippocampal volumes were positively correlated with MMSE and AVLT scores in AD and aMCI patients. At follow-up, left hippocampal volume loss was positively correlated with decreased MMSE and AVLT scores both in AD and aMCI groups, while right hippocampal volume loss was positively associated with decreased AVLT performance only in AD group. Increased ADL and decreased BNT scores were positively associated with left hippocampal volume reduction only in the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings provide evidence of a close relationship between hippocampal volume and cognitive performances in patients with AD and aMCI, both at baseline and over follow-up.
