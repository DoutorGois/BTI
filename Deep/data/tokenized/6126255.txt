The somatostatin content and choline acetyltransferase activity of the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus were examined after lesions to the nucleus basalis, the fornix and the dorsal hippocampus. Lesions of the nucleus basalis caused reductions in cortical choline acetyltransferase activity but had no effect on the concentration of somatostatin. Fornix transection caused a reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity in the dorsal hippocampus, but again was without effect on the somatostatin content. Excitotoxin lesions of the dorsal hippocampus caused a 69% reduction in somatostatin concentration in this structure, with no reduction in choline acetyltransferase activity. The results indicate that somatostatin and choline acetyltransferase are in separate populations of neurons in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
