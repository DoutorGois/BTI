Left and right temporal lobectomy patients, patients with frontal lobe lesions, and healthy control subjects participated in an eyelid conditioning study based on conditional discrimination learning. All groups acquired the first conditioned response at a similar time during learning, but both temporal lobectomy groups showed poorer discrimination than control subjects. The results support models that relate hippocampal function to operation of if-then rules.
