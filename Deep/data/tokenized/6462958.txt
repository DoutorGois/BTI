The regional distribution of imipramine (IMI) and desipramine (DMI) in rat brain after single and chronic oral administration of IMI was studied. The distribution of IMI and DMI in all examined brain regions was similar, except for hippocampus + septum. After chronic administration of IMI the disappearance of the parent drug and its metabolite was slowing down in all investigated brain regions as well as in the plasma. The accumulation of IMI and DMI after chronic treatment of IMI was significantly higher in plasma than in all examined brain regions.
