A clinico-electrophysiological study of epileptic patients demonstrated that a significant part of the so-called primary generalized seizures are focal. It was established that the probability of development of a focal subclinical discharge or a generalized seizure may be determined by the degree of an involvement of the mesencephalic reticular formation. The authors stress the topical diagnostis importance of behavioral phenomena, which are expressed on the remote stage of a generalized epileptic seizure.
