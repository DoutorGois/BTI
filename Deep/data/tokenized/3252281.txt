To determine whether endogenous opiates mediate hyperactivity in food restricted hamsters and serotonergic fibers innervating the hippocampus mediate hypoactivity in obese hamsters, food restriction and high-fat diet supplementation were used to produce significant body fat changes (8 vs. 21%). The levels and pattern of spontaneous running were examined after IP saline or naloxone HCl (20 mg/kg) and following the infusion of vehicle and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine creatine sulfate (4 micrograms/2 microliters) into rostromedial septum of mature female hamsters. Septum-medial preoptic area (POA), hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex were dissected from the three groups as well as from two additional groups of hamsters receiving vehicle or neurotoxin. Concentrations of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine were measured in these tissues by HPLC method. Fat-fed hamsters were hypoactive relative to food-restricted hamsters. Naloxone had no significant effect on running behavior. Serotonin neurotoxin increased the running activity of fat-fed hamsters to the level displayed by control hamsters by increasing the number of runs, the total activity level, the speed of running and by decreasing the duration of pauses. Neurotoxin led to selective deletion of serotonin in the hippocampus (77%) and parietal cortex (50%). Serotonergic fibers innervating the hippocampus thus appear to mediate the hypoactivity that is induced by dietary obesity in mature hamsters. Since serotonin mediates some other manifestations of aging, and slow weight increases characterize mid-portion of hamster life span, we hypothesize that serotonergic mediation of hypoactivity is another manifestation of aging.
