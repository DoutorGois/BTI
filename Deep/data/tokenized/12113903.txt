The AS/AGU rat is a spontaneously occurring mutation which exhibits locomotor abnormalities, reduced tyrosine hydroxylase levels in substantia nigra and lower extracellular levels of dopamine, making it a valuable model for some human locomotor disorders, and spontaneous chronic degeneration. The molecular defect is an absence of protein kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma), an enzyme suggested to play a role in synaptic plasticity. We have therefore examined long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices from the mutant animals compared with the normal control strain of Albino Swiss rat. In the CA1 region, LTP was of the same magnitude in mutant and control animals, and the presynaptic inhibitory effects of adenosine were unchanged in naive slices or following LTP. Paired-pulse inhibition and facilitation were normal. It is concluded that the absence of PKCgamma in this strain does not modify synaptic plasticity or presynaptic sensitivity to adenosine.
