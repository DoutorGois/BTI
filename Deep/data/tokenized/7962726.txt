A rat-specific mouse monoclonal antibody, exclusively reacting with a blood-brain and blood-nerve barrier protein, was employed to assess the post-natal, age-related changes in morphology and intraparenchymal distribution of barrier competent microvessels in normal rat forebrain. Antibody binding first appeared in single cells over the external surfaces of the brain between days 3 and 6 post-partum and increased progressively with age. In mature rats, the cerebral grey matter showed higher vascularization by barrier competent microvessels than white matter. Microvessels in the hippocampus were immunocytochemically more avid but less "networked" than the rest of the neocortex. These features may be related to morphological, metabolic and haemodynamic changes associated with brain growth and development.
