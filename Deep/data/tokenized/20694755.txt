This study aimed to compare the effects of repeated restraint stress alone and the combination with clomipramine treatment on parameters of oxidative stress in cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of male rats. Animals were divided into control and repeated restraint stress, and subdivided into treated or not with clomipramine. After 40 days of stress and 27 days of clomipramine treatment with 30 mg/kg, the repeated restraint stress alone reduced levels of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase in all tissues studied. The combination of repeated restraint stress and clomipramine increased the lipid peroxidation, free radicals and CAT activity as well as decreased levels of NP-SH in the tissues studied. However, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase level decreased in striatum and cerebral cortex and the SOD activity increased in hippocampus and striatum. Results indicated that clomipramine may have deleterious effects on the central nervous system especially when associated with repeated restraint stress and chronically administered in non therapeutic levels.
