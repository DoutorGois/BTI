The Ca2(+)-dependent [3H]5-HT release induced by depolarization or by 0.5 microM d-fenfluramine in rat hippocampal synaptosomes, was significantly reduced (35-42%) by three different P-type Ca2+ channels blockers (omega-Agatoxin-IVA, 100 nM, funnel-web spider toxin, FTX, 0.05 microliters/ml, and its synthetic analogue, sFTX, 1 mM), indicating the major role of these channels in the Ca2+ influx preceding neurotransmitter release.
