The activity of hypoxia-inducible factors-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is regulated by two types of hydroxylases, prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) and aspargynyl-hydroxylase factor inhibiting HIF-1alpha (FIH). Hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha by PHD and FIH causes proteasomal degradation and transcriptional inhibition of HIF-1alpha, respectively. Siah ubiquitin ligases regulate the abundance of PHD via targeting for proteasomal degradation. The present study investigated the role of Siah-1 in the regulation of FIH abundance under normoxic conditions. Immunohistochemical analysis of the rat brains revealed that both Siah-1 and FIH were widely distributed in the central nervous system including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the striatum, the olfactory bulb, the putamen, the thalamus, the celleberum, and the brain stem. In the hippocampus, both Siah-1 and FIH predominantly expressed in neurons. Siah-1 and FIH localized mostly in the cytoplasm. In mammalian cells, FIH expression levels were increased in the presence of a proteasomal inhibitor MG132, suggesting that FIH is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Immunoprecipitation assay and ubiquitination assay revealed that Siah-1 interacted with, and ubiquitinated FIH. Under normoxic conditions, Siah-1 facilitated degradation of FIH. On the other hand, when endogenous Siah-1 expression was suppressed using siRNA, FIH expression levels were increased, as compared to control. These results suggest that Siah-1 might play a role as a regulator of FIH abundance under normoxic conditions.
