OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Dipsacus total saponins on the ability of learning and memory and its mechanism of action. METHODS: Forty rats were randomly divided into blank control group, model group, Dipsacus group and positive control group (n = 10), general situation of rats were observed, the ability of learning and memory of rats was tested by Square water maze, the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) of hippocampus in rats were measured using double antibody sandwich method. RESULTS: During the period of treatment, general situation had no obvious change in model group, but general situation and the ability of activity were gradually improved in Dipsacus group and positive control group. Compared with blank control group, the swimming time was obviously prolonged and the number of mistakes was obviously increased at different time, the activity of AChE was significantly enhanced and the activity of ChAT was significantly decreased in model group. Compared with model group, the swimming time was obviously shortened and the number of mistakes was obviously reduced at different time, the activities of AChE were significantly decreased and the activities of ChAT were significantly enhanced in Dipsacus group and positive control group; Compared with positive control group, the swimming time and the number of mistakes at different time and the activities of AChE and ChAT had no significant difference in Dipsacus group. CONCLUSION: Dipsacus total saponins can improve the ability of learning and memory in Alzheimer' s disease(AD) rats, its mechanism of 'action may be related to regulating ACh metabolism of hippocampus.
