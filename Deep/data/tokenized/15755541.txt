The intrauterine environment has the capacity to mold the prenatal nervous system. Particularly, recent findings show that an adverse prenatal environment produces structural defects of the hippocampus, a critical area sub-serving learning and memory functions. These structural changes are accompanied by a disruption in the normal expression pattern of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its cognate tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor. The important role that the BDNF system plays in neural modeling and learning and memory processes suggests that fetal exposure to unfavorable intrauterine conditions may compromise proper cognitive function in adult life. These findings have implications for disorders that involve a dysfunction in the BDNF system and are accompanied by cognitive deficits.
