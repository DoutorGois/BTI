Maternal stress results in behavioral and anatomical alterations that persist during adult life. Here we demonstrate that hippocampal neurons cultured from embryos of stressed mothers exhibit faster development of their soma and neuritic arbor with an increase in the number of presynaptic terminals compared to cultured neurons from embryos of non-stressed mothers. Therefore, the impact of maternal stress on developing neurons is maintained even when these cells are dissociated from the brain and differentiated in vitro.
