Neuronal unit activity was recorded from several limbic system structures during classical conditioning of the rabbit nictiating membrane response to a tone CS. Air puff to cornea was used as a UCS. The present and past investigations of hippocampal activity using this paradigm show a neuronal plasticity which develops early in training, increases rapidly and shifts forward in time as behavioral conditioning develops. Recordings from the lateral septal region demonstrate the same within-trial pattern of unit discharge seen in hippocampus, indicating a projection of hippocampal plasticity over precommissural fornix pathways. Medial septal neurons, on the other hand, respond in an excitatory manner to the onsets of tone and air puff stimulation. While unit discharges seen in hippocampus and lateral septum occur only during the paired (learning) paradigm, medial septal activity is identical under both paired and unpaired (control) conditions. The latter fact lends support for a sensory interpretation of medial septal responses, and is consistent with anatomical evidence of a major septohippocampal projection originating from this region. In contrast to results for lateral septum, recordings from medial and lateral mammillary nuclei indicate only small, diffuse excitation that exhibits no consistent changes over training, and is not related to activity seen in hippocampal or septal regions. The apparent lack of correspondence between learning dependent unit measures obtained from pre- and postcommissural fornix structures is entirely consistent with current modified descriptions of limbic system anatomy.
