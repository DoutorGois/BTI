Three-month-old rats were injected intraperitoneally with [3H]thymidine (4.3 microcuries per gram of body weight) and allowed to survive for 30 days. Radioautography of 1-micrometer sections revealed labeled cells in the granular layers of dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb; these were confirmed as neurons by electron microscopy of reembedded 1-micrometer sections.
