Spatial cognition is a complex higher function in mammals and is involved in a variety of tasks that can be explored in the laboratory. In this review we will discuss the role of the posterior parietal/anteromedial cortex of rodents, also known as the parietal association cortex, and the hippocampal formation in spatial navigation. We will also discuss other higher associational functions of the posterior parietal/anteromedial cortex as they relate to Dr. Pinto-Hamuy's contribution to understanding behavioral functions.
