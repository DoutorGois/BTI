In hippocampal neurons cultured from brains of newborn rats, the glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate induced the clustering of neuronal perikarya and the fasciculation of neurites. In addition, N-methyl-D-aspartate activated the small GTPase Rac1. Other stimuli of Rac activity, such as the Rho kinase inhibitors Y-27632, H-1152, and H89, as well as the cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 from Escherichia coli, also caused neuronal clustering and neurite bundling. In neurons transiently transfected with dominant negative Rac1N17 neither N-methyl-D-aspartate nor Y-27632 induced clustering and fasciculation. In addition, the PI3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY-294002 prevented these effects, as did a dominant negative form of p110PI3-Kgamma. Time-lapse microscopy showed that lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii, which inhibits Rac, and wortmannin blocked the neuronal migration induced by Y-27632. In contrast, only lethal toxin reversed the clustering and fasciculation induced by pre-treatment with Y-27632. This effect of the toxin may be due to inactivation of Ras, since FTI-277, which prevents the farnesylation of Ras and thereby inactivates the GTPase, also dissolved the preformed clusters. We suggest that active Rac and a PI3-kinase synergistically induce neuronal migration, whereas a Ras isoform is responsible for the lasting attachment of neurons necessary for clustering and neurite fasciculation.
