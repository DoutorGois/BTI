Hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP), originally purified from the young rat hippocampus, enhances the cholinergic phenotype development of the medial septal nucleus in vitro. In this study, we examined the HCNP-antigen distribution and the age-related changes in the number of positive cells in the hippocampus (obtained at autopsy from 74 subjects with no known neurological disorders). Immunohistochemical assay revealed that the immunopositive cells were GABAergic neurons and oligodendrocytes. They were first identified in the fetus at around 25 to 30 weeks and their number increased rapidly with advancing postconceptional age to reach maximal at the perinatal stage and in early postnatal life; it then decreased to the adult level by 10 years old. These results suggest that HCNP-related antigen may play important roles in the development and/or differentiation of the human hippocampus.
