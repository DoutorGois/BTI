Learned associations between the rewarding effect of addictive drugs and drug-paired contexts resist extinction and contribute to the high rate of relapse observed in drug addicts. Although it has been shown that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is modulated by the primary rewarding effect of opiates, little is known as to its role in the morphine-associated contextual memory. In the present study, we investigated the ERK1/2 activity indicated by phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) levels in rats using a morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure. Our results showed that, in rats that had undergone morphine conditioning, after testing (expression phase) pERK1/2 in the NAc shell but not the NAc core or the adjacent caudate putamen was specifically increased. pERK1/2 levels in several other parts of the brain involved in drug-seeking, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala, showed no significant changes. A significant positive correlation was observed between the elevated pERK1/2 level in the NAc shell and the degree of conditioned preference for morphine-associated contexts. Bilateral injection of an inhibitor of ERK activation into the NAc shell attenuated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and prevented the expression of morphine CPP, but injections into the core did not. Selective inhibition of NR2B-containing NMDA receptor in the NAc shell by ifenprodil prevented CPP expression and down-regulated local ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These findings collectively suggest that recall of morphine-associated contextual memory depends specifically upon ERK1/2 activation in the NAc shell and that ERK1/2 phosphorylation is regulated by the upstream NR2B-containing NMDA receptor.
