Transient cerebral ischemia can produce irreversible neuronal damage and permanent learning and memory impairments in humans. This study examined whether ischemia-induced brain damage in rats results in impairments on the delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) task, a nonspatial recognition task analogous to tests on which amnesic patients display impairments. Male Wistar rats received either sham surgery or 20-min forebrain ischemia induced by bilateral carotid occlusion and hypotension. Four weeks after surgery, ischemic rats were significantly impaired in both learning and performing the DNMS task at retention intervals up to 5 min. Extensive presurgical training did not reduce this impairment. Observable cell loss in ischemic rats was limited to CA1 pyramidal neurons and a subset of cells in the dentate gyrus. The results indicate that ischemic damage to the hippocampus in rats results in recognition memory deficits similar to those produced by ischemic damage in humans.
