Intracerebroventricular (icv) amyloid-beta (Abeta)1-40 infusion to mice has been demonstrated to cause neurotoxicty and depressive-like behavior and it can be used to evaluate antidepressant and neuroprotective effect of drugs. Atorvastatin is a widely used statin that has demonstrated antidepressant-like effect in predictable animal behavioral models and neuroprotective effect against Abeta1-40 infusion. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of in vivo atorvastatin treatment against Abeta1-40-induced changes in mood-related behaviors and biochemical parameters in ex vivo hippocampal slices from mice. Atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/kg, p.o., once a day for seven consecutive days) abolished depressive-like and anhedonic-like behaviors induced by Abeta1-40 (400 pmol/site, icv) infusion. Abeta1-40-induced hippocampal cell damage was reversed by atorvastatin treatment. Abeta1-40 infusion decreased glutamate uptake in hippocampal slices, and atorvastatin did not altered it. Glutamine synthetase activity was not altered by any treatment. Atorvastatin also increased hippocampal mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF)/precursor BDNF (proBDNF) ratio, suggesting an increase of proBDNF to mBDNF cleavage. Accordingly, increased tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and p11 genic expression were observed in hippocampus of atorvastatin-treated mice. Atorvastatin displays antidepressant-like and neuroprotective effects against Abeta1-40-induced toxicity, and these effects may involve tPA- and p11-mediated cleavage of proBDNF to mBDNF.
