Cathepsin D-like activity in homogenates of five brain areas of 3-month-old and 24-month-old Fischer 344 rats was measured. With hemoglobin as substrate at pH 3.2, more than 90% of the activity was inhibited by pepstatin. In each area studied, activity was more than twice as high in the old rat brain: 140-160% higher in the cortex, cerebellum, pons-medulla, and striatum and 90-100% higher in the hippocampus and spinal cord. The greatly increased metabolic capacity in the absence of an increase in protein turnover may have a role in age-related pathological degeneration in the brain.
