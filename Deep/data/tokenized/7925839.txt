The effects of two protein synthesis inhibitors, cycloheximide and anisomycin, were tested on seizures induced by coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine to rats. Systemic cycloheximide (2 mg/kg, s.c.) and centrally administered anisomycin (300 micrograms/10 microliters, i.c.v.) doubled the latency to initiation of seizures and to status epilepticus, while peripherally administered anisomycin (50 mg/kg, s.c.) completely blocked lithium-pilocarpine seizures. These results indicate that protein synthesis is required for initiation of seizures.
