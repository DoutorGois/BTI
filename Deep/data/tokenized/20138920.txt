We investigated the effects of chronic administration of vitamin E on nitric oxide (NO)-producing neurons in the brains of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry. We further evaluated the effects of diabetes and vitamin E treatment on experimental anxiety and memory processes using the elevated plus maze (EPM) Trial 1/2 protocol. Wistar rats were divided into four groups: normoglycemics (N), normoglycemics treated with vitamin E (NVE), diabetics (D), and diabetics treated with vitamin E (DVE). Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (35mg/kg). Vitamin E (100mg/kg) or vehicle was administered orally by gavage (1ml/kg) once each day for 7 weeks. After behavioral testing, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG), striatum, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), and dorsolateral periaqueductal grey (DLPAG) were analyzed for NADPH-d histochemistry. STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited decreased locomotor activity and cognitive impairment compared with normoglycemic controls. The number of NADPH-d-positive neurons was increased in the DG, striatum, and DLPAG of diabetic rats. An increase in soma area was detected in all structures analyzed (DG, striatum, PVN, SON, and DLPAG) of STZ-induced diabetic animals. The present study showed that chronic administration of vitamin E ameliorates memory in STZ-induced diabetic rats and revealed that NOS-producing neurons have an increased soma area which can be restored, at least partially, by vitamin E treatment. These results suggest the potential use of vitamin E as an adjuvant therapy for the prevention and treatment of diabetic conditions.
