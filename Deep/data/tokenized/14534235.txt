Consolidation of associative memories appears to require extracellular signal-related kinase2 (ERK2) activation, which is modulated by several factors, including neurotransmitter receptor stimulation. Here we show that in vitro stimulation of either H2 or H3 histaminergic receptors activates ERK2 in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells. In behaving animals, bilateral posttraining injections into the dorsal hippocampus of histamine H2 or H3 receptor agonists improve memory consolidation after contextual fear conditioning. Local administration of U0126, a selective inhibitor of ERK kinase, prevents memory improvements exerted by the agonists, without causing any behavioral effect per se. This is the first evidence of a positive correlation between ERK phosphorylation and memory improvement. Moreover, we demonstrate that the brain histaminergic system regulates hippocampal ERK cascade. Finally, our data indicate that early ERK2 hippocampal activation is not required for the expression of long-term fear memories.
