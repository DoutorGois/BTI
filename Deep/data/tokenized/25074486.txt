Bisphenol A (BPA), one of the most common environmental endocrine disruptors, has been recognized to have wide adverse effects on the brain development and behavior. These adversities are related to its ability to bind estrogen receptor (ER) with subsequent alteration of its expression in the target areas. However, very little is known about whether BPA exposure also affects ER phosphorylation and its translocation to nucleus during postnatal development, two critical steps for its function. Here, we found that during development from postnatal day 7 (P7) to P21, the alpha subtype of ER (ERalpha) in the hippocampus of male rats experienced remarkable alterations in terms of its expression, phosphorylation and translocation to nucleus. Exposure to low level of BPA had bidirectional, development-dependent effects on the expression of ERalpha mRNA and protein, but decreased ERalpha phosphorylation and impaired its translocation to nucleus throughout the period investigated. Treatment with low dose of ICI 182,780 (ICI), an ER antagonist to block the binding of ER with BPA, reversed the altered ERalpha following BPA exposure, highlighting critical involvement of ER. Moreover, ICI treatment rescued the hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits in the adult rats experiencing early-life BPA exposure. Overall, our results indicate that BPA interferes with the ERalpha signaling in the developing hippocampus in an ER-dependent manner, which may underlie its adverse behavioral and cognitive outcomes in adult animals.
