Amino acids released from in vitro rat hippocampal slices following stimulation of the Schaffer's collateral pathway, were collected by micro-perfusion and analysed by chemical ionization mass spectrometry, with isotope ratiodetermination as the quantitative technique, through the use of stable, isotopically labeled internal standards. Stimulation at 10 pulses/sec resulted in a doubling of the release of aspartic acid over the resting level and about a 60% increase in glutamate release, which is in essential agreement with studies utilizing K+ depolarization-evoked release from slices.
