Baboons (Papio papio) with photosensitive have been chronically prepared with guide cannulae and deep electrodes to study the effects of focal injections of opioids. In the hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus (centre median) 50--100 micrograms morphine, 20--100 micrograms Met-enkephalin or 2--10 micrograms FK 33,824 do not induce local or general electrographic or motor signs of epilepsy. The acute epileptogenic effect of morphine and enkephalins observed in rats is not a general phenomenon whereas the anticonvulsant action of opioids acting on mu-receptors is seen in rodents and primates.
