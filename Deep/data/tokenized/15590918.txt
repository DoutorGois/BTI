The perirhinal (PER) and postrhinal (POR) cortices, two components of the medial temporal lobe memory system, are reciprocally connected with the hippocampus both directly and via the entorhinal cortex. Damage to PER or POR before or shortly after training on a contextual fear conditioning task causes deficits in the subsequent expression of contextual fear, implicating these regions in the acquisition or expression of contextual memory. Here, we examined the contribution of PER and POR to the processing of remotely learned contextual information. Male Long-Evans rats were trained in an unsignaled contextual fear conditioning paradigm. After training, rats received bilateral neurotoxic lesions to PER or POR or sham control surgeries at three different training-to-lesion intervals: 1, 28, or 100 d after training. Two weeks after surgery, lesioned and control rats were returned to the training context to assess contextual fear as measured by freezing. Rats with PER or POR damage froze significantly less in the training context than control rats but were not different from each other. The severity of the deficit did not differ across training-to-lesion intervals for any group. This pattern of deficits differs from that of posttraining hippocampal lesions, for which longer training-to-lesion intervals produce significantly more fear-conditioned contextual freezing than shorter training-to-lesion intervals. In the absence of such a retrograde gradient in the present study, our interpretation is that PER and POR have an ongoing role in the storage or retrieval of representations for context. Alternatively, these regions may be involved in a more extended consolidation process that becomes apparent beyond 100 d after learning.
