Groupwise segmentation that simultaneously segments a set of images and ensures that the segmentations for the same structure of interest from different images are consistent usually can achieve better performance than segmenting each image independently. Our main contribution is that we adopt the groupwise segmentation framework to improve the performance of multi-atlas label fusion. We develop a novel statistical model to allow this extension. Comparing to previous atlas propagation and groupwise segmentation work, one key novelty of our method is that the error produced during label propagation is explicitly addressed in the joint label fusion framework. Experiments on hippocampus segmentation in magnetic resonance images show the effectiveness of the new groupwise segmentation technique.
