We have performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the electrophysiological properties of medial septal neurons in the unanesthetized rat. The rat's head was held in a stereotaxic apparatus by a painless head-restrained system that was implanted seven days prior to the recording sessions. Extracellular recordings were made in a mixed population of antidromically identified septohippocampal neurons and unidentified medial septal neurons in different states of arousal and in response to peripheral and reticular stimulations. The spontaneous activity as well as the percentage of rhythmically bursting septal neurons varied significantly according to the state of arousal. Higher values were noted in paradoxical sleep (28 imp/s and 94% of bursting neurons) as compared with wakefulness with hippocampal theta rhythm (17.4 imp/s and 64.2% of bursting neurons) and slow wave sleep (12.3 imp/s and 8% of bursting neurons). The frequency of the bursts was significantly higher during paradoxical sleep. In individual medial septal neurons, arousing stimuli and paradoxical sleep could induce rhythmic bursting activity in previously non-bursting neurons provided that they were fast-firing neurons. No differences were noted in the functional characteristics of neurons in the medial septal nucleus as compared with the diagonal band of Broca. When the unanesthetized rats were compared with a group of urethane-anesthetized rats, the spontaneous activity was higher and more irregular in the absence of anesthesia. The percentage of the bursting neurons was significantly lower in the unanesthetized rats (32.3% vs 43.3%). However, the frequency of the bursts was higher (5.9 +/- 0.1 Hz vs 3.5 +/- 0.1 Hz). Since the patterns of activity of medial septal neurons fluctuate in different physiologically relevant states, previous classifications of these neurons made by ourselves and other authors, in urethane-anesthetized rats, may not be appropriate.
