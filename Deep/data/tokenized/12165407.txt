Prothrombin, protease-activated receptors (PARs) and the specific thrombin inhibitor protease nexin-1 (PN-1) are expressed in the brain. Recent studies have shown that the serine protease thrombin, depending on its concentration, plays an important role in neuronal degeneration or protection after cerebral ischemia. However, it is still uncertain whether a change in prothrombin or alterations in the expression of specific PAR-subtypes or PN-1 are associated with postischemic thrombin effects. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, we show that prothrombin was up-regulated in the hippocampal formation 24 h after transient global ischemia in rats (two-vessel occlusion with hypotension), whereas the expression of PN-1 and the expression of PAR-subtypes 1-3 did not change significantly. Thus, control of the balance between the expression of prothrombin and PN-1 may reflect an important mechanism that underlies postischemic thrombin effects.
