Recent studies have suggested that the caudal medial entorhinal cortex (cMEC) is specialized for path integration and spatial navigation. However, cMEC is part of a brain system that supports episodic memory for both spatial and nonspatial events, and so may play a role in memory function that goes beyond navigation. Here, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to investigate the role of the cMEC in familiarity and recollection processes that underlie nonspatial recognition memory in rats. The results indicate that cMEC plays a critical and selective role in recollection-based performance, supporting the view that cMEC supports memory for the spatial and temporal context in which events occur.
