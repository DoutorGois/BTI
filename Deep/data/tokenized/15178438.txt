Tandem pore domain (2P) K channels constitute the most diverse family of K channels and are responsible for background (leak or baseline) K currents. Of the 15 human 2P K channels, TASK-1, TASK-2, and TASK-3 are uniquely sensitive to physiologic pH changes as well as being inhibited by local anesthetics and activated by volatile anesthetics. In this study polyclonal antibodies selective for TASK-3 have been used to localize its expression in the rat central nervous system (CNS). TASK-3 immunostaining was found in rat cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Double immunofluorescent studies identified a discrete population of TASK-3 expressing neurons scattered throughout cortex. Using immunogold electron microscopy TASK-3 was identified at the cell surface associated with synapses and within the intracellular synthetic compartments. These results provide a more finely detailed picture of TASK-3 expression and indicate a role for TASK-3 in modulating cerebral synaptic transmission and responses to CNS active drugs.
