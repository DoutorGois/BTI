Although gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)C receptor rho1, rho2 and rho3 subunits are reportedly expressed in pyramidal and granule cells in the hippocampus at various developmental stages, it is not clear whether these three rho subunits are coexpressed in a single neuron. To attempt to answer this question, we performed single-cell RT-PCR for rho subunits from neurons of rat brain hippocampus. In hippocampal cultures, pyramidal cells were positive for rho1 mRNA expression in 89%, rho2 in 94% and rho3 in 94%, while granule cells were positive for rho1 mRNA in only 6%, rho2 in 36% and rho3 in 91%. Intensive amplification of the RT-PCR products by the second PCR revealed that all the three rho subunits were coexpressed in a single pyramidal and granule cells from both of the cultures and the slices. These results suggest that all the three GABAC receptor rho1, rho2 and rho3 subunits are present probably in different compositions in pyramidal and granule cells in the rat hippocampus.
