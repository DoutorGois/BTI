OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of acupuncture in treatment of multi-infarct dementia (MID). METHODS: The multi-infarct dementia model was made by injection of emboli into the internal carotid artery. The dementia rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: model group, acupuncture group and non-acupoint acupuncture group, and a normal group and a sham operation group were set up. The expression of CuZnSOD in the hippocampus of the rats were detected by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical assay, and effects of acupuncture were analyzed. RESULTS: The expressions of mRNA and protein of CuZnSOD in the hippocampus of the model group were significantly attenuated as compared with that in the normal control group. Both the parameters above were significantly increased in the acupuncture group as compared with the model control group, but with no significant difference between the acupuncture group and the normal control group. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can up-regulate the expressions of mRNA and protein of CuZnSOD in the rat with MID, so as to strengthen activity of antioxidase and effectively remove free radicals and improve intelligence of MID rats.
