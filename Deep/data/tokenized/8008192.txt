The action of a phorbol ester (phorbol-12,13-diacetate) on the voltage-activated sodium current has been investigated by the voltage-clamp method in acutely isolated pyramidal neurons from rat hippocampus. The intracellular perfusion of isolated pyramidal neurons for 30-40 min induced a gradual 10-15 mV shift in both the current-voltage relationship and voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation to more negative potentials. The application of phorbol ester (1-10 microM) to isolated neurons for the same time increased the amplitude of sodium current by 15-20%, shifted the above-mentioned voltage-dependent parameters for an additional 10-15 mV in the same direction and changed the slope of the steady-state inactivation curve. In contrast, after prolonged incubation of slices in the phorbol ester-containing solution (1-10 microM) for 0.5-3 h, subsequent application of phorbol ester at the same concentration caused neither the addition shift of the voltage-dependent characteristics of sodium channels nor the change of the slope of the steady-state inactivation curve. However, in this case an increase in the amplitude of sodium current by 15-20% during 30-40 min intracellular perfusion was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
