We previously reported a difference in short-term synaptic plasticity between the rat posterior dorsal CA1 (pdCA1)-prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral CA1 (vCA1)-PFC pathways. Here, to determine the effects of hippocampal train stimulation on the local field potential in the medial PFC, we recorded the PFC field potential with brief 250-Hz train stimulation (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 pulses) of pdCA1 or vCA1 in anesthetized rats. Analysis of the gamma-band (40-100 Hz) power revealed stimulation-evoked gamma oscillation in the pdCA1-PFC, but not in the vCA1-PFC. These results indicate that these pathways have different responses to train stimulation. The function of the pdCA1-PFC may differ from that of the vCA1-PFC, a well-known hippocampus-PFC pathway.
