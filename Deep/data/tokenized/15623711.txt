Brains of 41 residents without neurodegenerative diseases in the high-incidence area of ALS/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) of the Kii Peninsula of Japan were neuropathologically examined. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the hippocampal area were present in 11 of the 41 cases, but the frequency of NFT-positive cases in each age group was similar to that of the normal Japanese population and far less than that of Guamanians without ALS/PDC.
