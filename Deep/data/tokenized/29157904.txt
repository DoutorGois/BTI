A fraction composed of an arabinan-rich pectin was extracted from acerola fruit (Malpighia emarginata) and named ACWS. This fraction presented 93% of total carbohydrate, relative molecular weight of 7.5x10(4)g/mol, galacturonic acid, arabinose, galactose, xylose and rhamnose in 52.1:32.4:7.2:4.8:3.5 molar ratio and had its structure confirmed by NMR analysis. The anti-fatigue activity of ACWS was evaluated using the weight load swim test on trained mice. ACWS was orally administered at doses of 50mg/kg, 100mg/kg and 200mg/kg for 28days. Plasma biochemical parameters, respiration of permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers, and GSH levels and lipoperoxidation in the brain (pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus) were determined. ACWS could lengthen the swimming time, increase the plasma levels of glucose, triglycerides, lactate, and the GSH levels in the hippocampus at all tested doses. The mitochondrial respiratory capacity of the skeletal muscle was increased at middle and high ACWS doses. This study provides strong evidence that M. emarginata pectic polysaccharide supplementation has anti-fatigue activity, can modify the kinetics of energy substrates (carbohydrate and fat) mobilization and the respiratory capacity of the skeletal muscle, as well the antioxidant status in the hippocampus of ACWS treated animals.
