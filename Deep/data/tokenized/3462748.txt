The biosynthesis and posttranslational proteolytic processing of proenkephalin was studied in three projection systems in the rat central nervous system--the caudate-putamen to the globus pallidus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to the median eminence, and the mossy fiber system of the granule cells of the hippocampus. By using the techniques of in vivo radiolabeling and sequential high-performance liquid chromatographic purification coupled with chemical modification, the biosynthesis of six radiolabeled [Met]enkephalin-containing peptides--[Met5]enkephalin, [Met5,Arg6,Gly7,Leu8]enkephalin, [Met5,Arg6,Phe7]enkephalin, metorphamide, peptide E, and BAM 18P--was followed. In each projection system, radiolabeled enkephalins were purified to constant radiochemical specific activity. However, the posttranslational processing of proenkephalin was found to differ between these three systems, as judged by the relative ratio of these peptides. These findings imply that specific, different physiologies and behaviors may be elicited by the enkephalins based upon the specific [Met]enkephalin-containing peptides that are cleaved from proenkephalin and released in synaptic terminal fields.
