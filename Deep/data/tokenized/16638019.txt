We studied the lysophosphatidic acid receptor-1 (LPA1) gene, which we found to be expressed endogenously in cultured hippocampal neurons, and in vivo in young (1-week-old) rat brain slices. Overexpressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged, membrane-associated LPA1 accumulated in a punctate manner over the entire dendritic tree and caused an increase in dendritic spine density. About half of the dendritic spines in the LPA1-transfected neurons displayed distinct fluorescent puncta, and this subset of spines was also substantially larger than puncta-free, LPA1-transfected or control GFP spines. This phenotype could also be seen in cells transfected with a ligand-binding, defective mutant and is therefore not dependent on interaction with an ambient ligand. While spontaneous miniature excitatory synaptic currents were of the same amplitudes, they decayed slower in LPA1-transfected neurons compared with GFP controls. We propose that LPA1 may play a role in the formation and modulation of the dendritic spine synapse.
