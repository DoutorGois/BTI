Transient global ischemia caused by 5 min of cardiac arrest induced delayed neuronal cell death (apoptosis) in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. To characterize the molecular mechanisms that regulate apoptosis in vivo, the contributions to cell death of mitogen-activated protein kinase family members were examined in the hippocampal region after brain ischemia-reperfusion. Ischemia-reperfusion led to a strong activation of the JNK/SAPK (c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase/stress activated protein kinase), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), and p38 enzymes. These results with other previous studies suggest that the activation of JNK/SAPK in accordance with p38 contributes to the induction of apoptosis in CA1 neurons.
