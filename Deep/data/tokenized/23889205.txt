Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is associated with silent cerebral infarction (SCI), affecting white and cortical grey matter, but there are few data on subcortical volumes. We analysed retrospective magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in 26 SCA patients and 20 controls, comparing mean subcortical volumes between three groups: controls, SCA with SCI (n = 13) and SCA without visible abnormality (n = 13). Specific volumetric differences were found in the hippocampus, amygdala, pallidum, caudate, putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum. This is the first study to demonstrate subcortical volume change in SCA, with the most severe volumetric deficits occurring in children with SCI seen on MRI.
