The release of D-[3H]aspartate, [3H]noradrenaline, and of endogenous glutamate and aspartate from rat hippocampal slices was significantly increased when the slices were incubated with xanthine oxidase plus xanthine to produce superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals locally. Allopurinol, a specific xanthine oxidase inhibitor, the hydroxyl-radical scavenger D-mannitol, or the superoxide-radical scavenger system formed by superoxide dismutase plus catalase prevented this release. These results suggest that endogenous excitatory amino acids are released consequent to the formation of free radicals. The excess of glutamate and aspartate released by this mechanism could be one of the factors contributing to the death of neurons after anoxic or ischemic injuries.
