The authors assessed whether measures of hippocampal water diffusivity at baseline can predict future progression to Alzheimer disease (AD) in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Higher baseline hippocampal diffusivity was associated with a greater risk of progression to AD in aMCI (p = 0.002). Magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging may help identify patients with aMCI who will progress to AD as well as or better than structural MRI measures of hippocampal atrophy.
