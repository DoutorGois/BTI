Results of investigations of protein phosphorylation and gene expression in the mechanisms of long-term potentiation and kindling was analyzed. It was discussed the participation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, intracellular Ca2+, different protein kinases and immediate-early genes in the induction and maintenance of long-term changes of glutamatergic synaptic efficiency in hippocampus. It was suggested the essential role of the level of intracellular Ca2+ in the induction of the cell program leaded to the trace processes during electrical stimulation of the same hippocampal area.
