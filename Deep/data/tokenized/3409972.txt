The effects of electrical stimulation of the medial amygdala (AMYG) and dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) on the rates of 14C transfer from 14C-1-acetate into ovarian steroids in hypophysectomized and adrenalectomized rats (H-A rats) were investigated. The 14C transfer rates into estrogen were increased by stimulation of AMYG and DHPC. The 14C transfer rates into progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxy-pregn-4-en-3-one (20 alpha-OH-P) were increased by the AMYG stimulation but decreased by the DHPC stimulation. From these results, it might be suggested that these limbic structures were involved in the regulation of ovarian steroidogenesis without participation of pituitary and adrenal.
