The receptor binding specificity and neuroanatomical distribution of [3H]NE-100 (N, N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2- phenylethoxy) phenyl] ethylamine monohydrochloride)-labeled sigma receptor in guinea pig brain were examined using quantitative autoradiography. NE-100 potently inhibited [3H]NE-100 binding to slide-mounted sections of guinea pig brain with the IC50 value of 1.09 nM, therefore, NE-100 apparently has high affinity binding sites. Competition studies, under conditions similar to those used to visualize the receptor, yielded the following rank order of potency: NE-100 > haloperidol > DuP734 > (+)pentazocine >> (-)pentazocine. Non-sigma ligands such as phencyclidine (PCP), MK-801 and (-)sulpiride had negligible affinities for [3H]NE-100 binding sites. High densities of [3H]NE-100 binding sites displaceable by haloperidol were present in the granule layer of the cerebellum, the cingulate cortex, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, the hypothalamus and the pons. The distribution of [3H]NE-100 binding sites was consistent with that of [3H](+)pentazocine, a sigma 1 ligand. These sigma sites may possibly be related to various aspects of schizophrenia.
