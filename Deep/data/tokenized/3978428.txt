Locus coeruleus (LC) fibers in the fornix mainly innervate the septal pole of the dentate gyrus, whereas the cingulum projects to the ventral hippocampal formation to provide LC input to the dentate gyrus. LC fibers in the ventral amygdaloid bundle have a wide-spread distribution, innervating the entire hippocampal gyrus, as well as the mid-septotemporal and temporal regions of the dentate gyrus. The LC fibers of the fornix and ventral amygdaloid bundle do not appear to overlap significantly in the septal pole of the dentate gyrus.
