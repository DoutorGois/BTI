It is well established that physical changes to an environment result in plasticity of hippocampal place cell activity, while in the absence of changes, place fields are remarkably stable. Manipulations of a rat's perception of the environment without physically changing the environment also result in plasticity of place cell firing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a rat's perception of an environment could be changed by introducing an auditory fear-conditioned stimulus (CS) to a previously neutral environment, inducing plasticity of hippocampal place fields. First, stable place fields were isolated for rats exploring a radial-arm maze in one environment, and then the rats were fear-conditioned to an auditory CS in a completely separate environment. Later, the CS was specifically paired once with a location in the previously neutral radial-arm maze, either within the given neuron's place field (in-field) or an area outside of the place field (out-of-field). A single, paired presentation of the CS with a location in-field for a specific place cell disrupted the stability of that neuron's place field, whereas pairing the CS with a location out-of-field did not affect place field stability. We further showed that this place field disruption for a CS presented in-field was mediated by inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Temporarily inactivating the BLA immediately post-CS re-exposure attenuated the CS-induced place field destabilization. Our results show neuron-specific conditional plasticity for actively firing hippocampal place cells, and that the BLA mediates this plasticity when an emotionally arousing or fear-related CS is used.
