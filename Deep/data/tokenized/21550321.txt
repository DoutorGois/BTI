Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that can be actively transported within the cell to satisfy local requirements. They are vital for providing cellular energy, but are also an important endogenous source of reactive oxygen species. The distribution of mitochondria is particularly important for neurons because of the morphological complexity of these cells, and because neural processing is metabolically expensive. Defects in mitochondrial distribution, observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, can result in synaptic dysfunction. We have generated transgenic mice expressing an enzyme in forebrain neurons that causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in the form of abasic-sites, creating mtDNA toxicity. Here, we report that mitochondrial distribution is disturbed in hippocampal neurons of these mice. Moreover, mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial transcription are reduced, and oxidative stress is increased. There is also a loss of receptors at excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the dentate gyrus, and the size of the postsynaptic density in this region is abnormal. We speculate that the loss of synaptic mitochondria caused by accumulation in the neuronal cell body contributes to the observed synaptic abnormalities, as well as the overall loss of mtDNA and diminished mitochondrial transcription. Collectively, these changes lead to mitochondria with reduced function and increased oxidative stress.
