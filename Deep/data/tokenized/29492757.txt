BACKGROUND: Glibenclamide (GBC) improves neurological outcome after cardiac arrest (CA) in rats. In this study, we sought to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects of GBC by using a high-field MRI system. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 10-min asphyxial CA followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as well as conventional T2-weighted imaging was conducted prior to CA and at 24, 48, and 72 h after resuscitation. Afterward, histological examination was performed. RESULTS: Twelve rats were randomized to receive GBC (n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) at 15 min after return of spontaneous circulation, while four rats were set as sham control. Rats that underwent CA/CPR and received vehicle exhibited distinct neurological deficit, which was alleviated by GBC treatment. Marked water diffusion abnormality as demonstrated by hyperintense DWI in vulnerable regions of the brain was detected after CA/CPR, with the most prominent hyperintense DWI observed in the hippocampal CA1 region at 72 h. Consistently, histological examination revealed neuronal swelling, dendritic injury, and activation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampal CA1 region in vehicle-treated rats. Correlation analysis revealed that the ADC values in the hippocampus were significantly correlated with the histological findings (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of GBC after CA was exerted, as least in part, through prevention of water diffusion abnormality, namely brain edema.
