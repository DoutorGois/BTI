In response to a central nervous system trauma surviving neurons reorganize their connections and form new synapses that replace those lost by the lesion. A well established in vivo system for the analysis of this lesion-induced plasticity is the reorganization of the fascia dentata following unilateral entorhinal cortex lesions in rats. After general considerations of neuronal reorganization following a central nervous system trauma, this review focuses on the sprouting of single fibres in the rat hippocampus after entorhinal lesion and the molecular factors which may regulate this process. First, the connectivity of the fascia dentata in control animals is reviewed and previously unknown commissural fibers to the outer molecular layer and entorhinal fibres to the inner molecular layer are characterized. Second, sprouting of commissural and crossed entorhinal fibres after entorhinal cortex lesion is described. Single fibres sprout by forming additional collaterals, axonal extensions, boutons, and tangle-like axon formations. It is pointed out that the sprouting after entorhinal lesion mainly involves unlesioned fibre systems terminating within the layer of fibre degeneration and is therefore layer-specific. Third, molecular changes associated with axonal growth and synapse formation are considered. In this context, the role of adhesion molecules, glial cells, and neurotrophic factors for the sprouting process are discussed. Finally, an involvement of sprouting processes in the formation of neuritic plaques in Alzheimer's disease is reviewed and discussed with regard to the axonal tangle-like formations observed after entorhinal cortex lesion.
