Previous research has revealed that the functional components of spatial cognition are lateralized in the forebrain of birds, including the hippocampal formation (HF). To investigate how HF cells in the left and right avian brain may differentially participate in representations of space, we recorded single-units from the HF of homing pigeons as they ran a plus maze for food. The rate maps of left HF cells often displayed elongated regions of increased activity in the center of the maze and along the maze corridors, whereas right HF cells tended to display patches at the ends of maze arms at/near goal locations. Left HF cells displayed a higher degree of spatial-specificity compared with right HF cells, including higher patch-specificity, higher reliability, and a higher incidence of location-correlated activity. Analysis of speed-correlated and trajectory-dependent activity also revealed significant HF-lateralized differences. Right HF cells tended to display significant negative correlations between spike rate and speed, although speed-dependent rate maps indicate that this relationship did not explain their space-specific activity. Left HF cells displayed a significantly higher incidence of trajectory-dependent space-specific activity than was observed in the right HF, suggesting that left HF cells may participate in navigating among goal locations. Differences in the correlates of left and right pigeon HF cells are consistent with unilateral HF-lesion data suggesting that the functional components of spatial cognition are lateralized in the avian brain, and furthermore, provide a basis for hypotheses regarding how the left and right HF support different aspects of spatial cognition.
