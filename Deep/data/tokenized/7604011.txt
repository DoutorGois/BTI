Hippocampal neurons maintained in primary culture recycle synaptic vesicles and express functional glutamate receptors since early stages of neuronal development. By analyzing glutamate-induced cytosolic calcium changes to sense presynaptically released neurotransmitter, we demonstrate that the ability of neurons to release glutamate in the extracellular space is temporally coincident with the property of synaptic vesicles to undergo exocytotic-endocytotic recycling. Neuronal differentiation and maturation of synaptic contacts coincide with a change in the subtype of calcium channels primarily involved in controlling neurosecretion. Whereas omega-agatoxin IVA-sensitive channels play a role in controlling neurotransmitter secretion at all stages of neuronal differentiation, omega-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive channels are primarily involved in mediating glutamate release at early developmental stages only.
