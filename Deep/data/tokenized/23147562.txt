The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the hydrolysis of adenine nucleotides on synaptosomes and platelets obtained from rats exposed to cadmium (Cd) and treated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Rats received Cd (2 mg/kg) and NAC (150 mg/kg) by gavage every other day for 30 days. Animals were divided into four groups (n = 4-6): control/saline, NAC, Cd, and Cd/NAC. The results of this study demonstrated that NTPDase and 5'-nucleotidase activities were increased in the cerebral cortex synaptosomes of Cd-poisoned rats, and NAC co-treatment reversed these activities to the control levels. In relation to hippocampus synaptosomes, no differences on the NTPDase and 5'-nucleotidase activities of Cd-poisoned rats were observed and only the 5'-nucleotidase activity was increased by the administration of NAC per se. In platelets, Cd-intoxicated rats showed a decreased NTPDase activity and no difference in the 5'-nucleotidase activity; NAC co-treatment was inefficient in counteracting this undesirable effect. Our findings reveal that adenine nucleotide hydrolysis in synaptosomes and platelets of rats were altered after Cd exposure leading to a compensatory response in the central nervous system and acting as a modulator of the platelet activity. NAC was able to modulate the purinergic system which is interesting since the regulation of these enzymes could have potential therapeutic importance. Thus, our results reinforce the importance of the study of the ecto-nucleotidases pathway in poisoning conditions and highlight the possibility of using antioxidants such as NAC as adjuvant against toxicological conditions.
