Multiple unit activity (MUA) was recorded from the adrenocorticotropic area (n. posterior medialis hypothalami, PMH) of unrestrained resting pigeons throughout the 24 h period and compared with plasma corticosterone levels (B). Bilateral electrolytic lesions of the hippocampus suppressed diurnal variations of MUA and B. Both parameters were stabilized at a steady high level whereas complete neural isolation of the basal hypothalamus led to stabilized intermediate plasma B level and MUA pattern.
