The binding of glucocorticoids to CNS receptors results in the modulation of many processes, ranging from neurotransmission to cell birth and death. It is of no surprise, therefore, that the removal of these steroids following adrenalectomy disrupts a variety of physiological functions throughout the brain. It is the aim of this review to briefly describe the findings of research examining some of these glucocorticoid-mediated CNS effects; however, as many of these areas have been reviewed extensively by others, this review will focus on the recently described phenomenon, adrenalectomy-induced hippocampal cell death.
