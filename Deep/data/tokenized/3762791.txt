The sources of afferents to the rostral field CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus in rat were revealed with the help of HRP retrograde transport. After ionophoretic injections of HRP into the above mentioned region of the hippocampus labelled cells were found in the anterodorsal, anteroventral, anteromedial and anterolateral nuclei of thalamus; in the supramammillar and submammillothalamic nuclei of hypothalamus: in stratum griseum centralis of the optic tectum; in the parietal, insular, temporal, retrosplenial and pyriform areas of the neocortex.
