To identify the roles of pyridoxal kinase (PLK) in epileptogenesis and the recovery mechanisms in spontaneous seizure, a chronological and comparative analysis of PLK expression in the gerbil hippocampus was conducted. PLK immunoreactivity in a pre-seizure group of seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils was more strongly detected than that in a seizure resistant (SR) group. The density of PLK immunoreactivity in a 30-min postictal group was significantly lower than that of a pre-seizure group. In a 12 h postictal group, PLK immunodensity recovered to pre-seizure level. The over-expression of PLK in the hippocampus of pre-seizure SS gerbils suggests that PLP play an important role in the modulation of GAD activity and GABA reuptake as mediated by membrane transporter via neurons.
