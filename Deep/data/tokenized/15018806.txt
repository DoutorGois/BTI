The pattern of CREB phosphorylation was investigated in the caudate nucleus and hippocampus 10 min or 3 h after i.p. injection of dopamine or NMDA receptor agonists alone, or in combination with antagonists. Ten minutes after C57BL/6 J mice were injected with either the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF-38393 hydrobromide or NMDA, immunoreactivity of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) was significantly increased in all parts of the caudate nucleus but not in hippocampal regions. However, 3 h after the injection of SKF-38393, pCREB levels in the caudate nucleus did not differ significantly from the pCREB levels in control animals, whereas pCREB levels were still elevated 3 h after NMDA injection. Except for the D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390, which induced CREB phosphorylation in the caudate nucleus, dopamine and NMDA receptor antagonists had little effect on pCREB levels by themselves. However, the NMDA receptor antagonist CGS-19755 injected i.p. blocked both the NMDA- and SKF-38393-induced rise of pCREB levels in the caudate nucleus. Similarly, the D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 inhibited the effects produced by SKF-38393 or NMDA. Interestingly, the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride also blocked the SKF-38393-triggered rise of pCREB. The results demonstrated that NMDA and dopamine receptors modulate pCREB levels in the caudate nucleus and suggest mutual permissive roles for both receptors.
