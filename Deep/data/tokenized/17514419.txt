Doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-associated protein, specifically expresses in neuronal precursors. This protein has been used as a marker for neuronal precursors and neurogenesis. In the present study, we observed differences in DCX immunoreactivity and its protein levels in the hippocampal dentate gyrus between adult and aged dogs. In the adult dog, DCX immunoreactive cells with well-stained processes were detected in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Numbers of DCX immunoreactive cells in the dentate gyrus of the aged dog were significantly decreased compared to those in the adult dog. DCX immunoreactive cells in both adult and aged dog did not show NeuN (a marker for mature neurons) immunoreactivity. NeuN immunoreactivity in the aged dog was poor compared to that in the adult dog. DCX protein level in the aged dentate gyrus was decreased by 80% compared to that in the adult dog. These results suggest that the reduction of DCX in the aged hippocampal dentate gyrus may be involved in some neural deficits related to the hippocampus.
