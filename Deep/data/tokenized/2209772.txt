Rats were trained to lever press and then were given either bilateral lesions of the hippocampus or control operations. Half of the rats in each group received oral nimodipine, a calcium entry blocker, while the remaining rats received vehicle, over a 14-day period that began the evening of surgery. The rats were studied on a DRL 20-s schedule of reinforcement (differential reinforcement of low rates of responding) that required them to withhold a response for at least 20 s after their last lever press in order to earn a reward. Rats with lesions that did not receive the drug performed poorly on the DRL 20-s schedule. In contrast, rats sustaining the same hippocampal lesions but given the drug showed scores that were virtually equivalent to those of the sham-operated control animals. Similar trends were observed when the rats were then tested on a DRL 40-s schedule of reinforcement. These findings suggest that nimodipine may attenuate the effects of acute, focal brain lesions on new learning of even difficult behavioral and cognitive tasks.
