Content of cAMP in the frontal cortex (FC), hippocampus (HP), hypothalamus (HT) and amygdala (A) was determined in 20-month old male Wistar rats with different types of behaviour in "emotional resonance" test. Two groups of rats were selected, i.e., 1--animals which did not demonstrate ER phenomenon and 2--those which did not leave the light part of the chamber. Hippocampal content of cAMP was higher in group 1 than in group 2, in other brain structures no differences were detected. After acute immobilization stress cAMP level increased in FC, HT and A in both groups of animals. When the structures from the left and right hemispheres were analysed separately significant changes were revealed only in group 2 rats. Cross-correlations of cAMP levels between symmetrical FC, HP, HT and A were revealed in control animals of both groups. A number of new intra- and interhemispheric correlations appeared after stress, their pattern being dependent on behavioural type.
