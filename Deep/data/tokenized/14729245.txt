Complete removal of synaptic zinc by the chelator dietyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC; 500 mg/kg i.p.) in rat was followed by convulsive behaviour including wet dog shakes alternating immobility. Histological analysis 1 day after DEDTC administration detected expression of heat shock protein in the hippocampus restricted to hilar cells. These cells colocalize the marker for neurons and the glutamate receptor GluR2/3 showing that they are excitatory neurons. Additionally, they projected to the contralateral dentate gyrus. Therefore, they correspond to hilar mossy cells. These data show that the synaptic zinc has a role in normal hippocampus avoiding overexcitation, that would impair functionality even in absence of pathological or exoexcitotoxic phenomena.
