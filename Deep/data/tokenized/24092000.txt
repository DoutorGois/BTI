The important role of cation-chloride co-transporters in epilepsy is being supported by an increasing number of investigations. However, enormous complexity is involved since the action of these co-transporters has effects on the ionic homeostasis influencing directly the neuronal excitability and the tissue propensity to sustain seizure. To unravel the complex mechanisms involving the co-transporters action during seizure, this paper shows simulations of non-synaptic epileptiform activity and the effect of the blockage of the two different types of cation-chloride co-transporters present in the brain: Na, K and 2Cl co-transporter (NKCC) and K and Cl co-transporter (KCC). The simulations were performed with an electrochemical model representing the non-synaptic structure of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) of the rat hippocampus. The simulations suggest: (i) the potassium clearance is based on the systemic interplay between the Na/K pump and the NKCC co-transporters; (ii) the simultaneous blockage of the NKCC of the neurons and KCC of glial cells acts efficiently suppressing the epileptiform activities; and (iii) the simulations show that depending on the combined blockage of the co-transporters, the epileptiform activities may be suppressed or enhanced.
