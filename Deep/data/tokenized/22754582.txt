Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid accumulation, neuronal death, and cognitive impairments. Yi-Chi-Tsung-Ming-Tang (YCTMT) is a traditional Chinese medicine and has never been used to enhance cognitive function and treat neurodegenerative disorders such as senile dementia. Whether YCTMT has a beneficial role in improving learning and memory in AD patients remains unclear. The present study showed that oral administration of YCTMT ameliorated amyloid-beta- (Abeta(1-40)) injection-induced learning and memory impairments in rats, examined using passive avoidance and Morris water-maze tests. Immunostaining and Western Blot results showed that continuous Abeta(1-40) infusion caused amyloid accumulation and decreased acetylcholine level in hippocampus. Oral administration of medium and high dose of YCTMT 7 days after the Abeta(1-40) infusion decreased amyloid accumulation area and reversed acetylcholine decline in the Abeta(1-40)-injected hippocampus, suggesting that YCTMT might inhibit Abeta plague accumulation and rescue reduced acetylcholine expression. This study has provided evidence on the beneficial role of YCTMT in ameliorating amyloid-induced AD-like symptom, indicating that YCTMT may offer an alternative strategy for treating AD.
