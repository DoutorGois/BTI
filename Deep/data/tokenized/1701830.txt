1. Pharmacologic agents known to modulate long-term potentiation (LTP) at the mossy fiber-to-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapse were tested for their effects on the activity of single voltage-gated calcium channels in adult CA3 pyramidal neurons. 2. Single-channel current recordings of three types of voltage-gated calcium channels were made from acutely exposed CA3 pyramidal neurons of the adult guinea pig hippocampus. 3. The beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 microM), which is known to enhance LTP, increased the activity of the two high-threshold calcium channels (N and L) with no striking effect on the low-threshold (T) channel. 4. The muscarinic agonists carbachol and muscarine (1-10 microM), the latter of which has been shown to inhibit LTP, decreased the probability of opening of L channels, increased the probability of opening of T channels, and had no effect on N channels. The effects were blocked by 0.1 microM atropine. 5. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that neuromodulation of mossy fiber LTP occurs, at least in part, through the modulation of postsynaptic, voltage-gated calcium channels.
