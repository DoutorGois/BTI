The regional brain synthesis of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) was studied in rats after various doses of 5-methoxy-3(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU-24969), a 5-HT1 receptor agonist. The potential anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of the compound were examined as well. RU-24969 0.62 mg/kg significantly reduced 5-HT synthesis in the nucleus accumbens and hypothalamus, while with 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg the effect was also seen in striatum, hippocampus, brainstem and cortex. RU-24969 2.5 and 5 mg/kg had no effect on DA synthesis in the striatum, while 5.0 mg/kg significantly increased it in the nucleus accumbens. At doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg the drug increased the motor activity of rats measured during 1 h in activity cages while 0.625 and 1.25 mg/kg had no effect. Doses ranging from 0.62 to 2.5 mg/kg RU-24969 significantly reduced unpunished responding in a test of conditioned suppression of drinking. Doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg also reduced punished responding. Finally, of various doses only 2.5 mg/kg RU-24969 significantly reduced the duration of immobility of rats in the forced swimming test but the effects were due to running around the cylinder rather than to escape attempts. In conclusion, RU-24969 reduced 5-HT synthesis in all brain areas examined, with a preferential effect for the nucleus accumbens and the hypothalamus. At higher doses, there was also a specific increase in DA synthesis in the nucleus accumbens. The compound raised the level of activity of rats but no clear evidence of any potential anxiolytic or antidepressant properties has been obtained.
