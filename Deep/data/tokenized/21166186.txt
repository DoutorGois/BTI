AIM: To explore the role of novel protein kinases C (nPKCs) in the development of cerebral hypoxic preconditioning. METHODS: By using the mice model of hypoxic preconditioning, which was established before in our lab, the biochemistry techniques of SDS-PAGE and Western blot were applied to observe the effects of repetitive hypoxic exposure (H0-H4) on nPKCs (nPKCepsilon, delta, eta, mu and theta) membrane translocation in hippocampus and cortex. RESULTS: nPKCepsilon membrane translocation was increased in response to the hypoxic exposure times in the hippocampus (H0: 41.6% +/- 1.4% vs. H1-H4: 46.9% +/- 4.5%, 52.7% +/- 3.9%, 58.8% +/- 2.7% and 61.3% +/- 3.7%) and cortex (H0: 38.4% +/- 4.5% vs. 42.4% +/- 5.0%, 48.7% +/- 6.5%, 55.3% +/- 8.9% and 61.2% +/- 10.2%) of mice, and there were statistic significances among H2, H3 and H4 in hippocampus, and H3 and H4 in cortex respectively (P < 0.01). But for nPKCdelta, eta, mu and theta membrane translocation, there were no any significant changes in hippocampus and cortex of hypoxic preconditioned mice. CONCLUSION: nPKCepsilon may play an important role in the development of cerebral hypoxic preconditioning, but it need more evidence to prove.
