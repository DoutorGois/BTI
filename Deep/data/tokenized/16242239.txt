The purpose of the study was to explore the involvement of cell cycle events in the neuronal death induced by repeated seizures. Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling was used as a model of seizure-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Immunohistochemical approach was applied to detect cell cycle markers (cyclins and cycline-dependent kinases) in hippocampus. PTZ-kindling in rats induced moderate neuronal cell loss in hippocampal fields CA1, CA 3, CA 4, and dentate gyrus. The majority of damaged cells in hippocampi of PTZ-kindled rats were cycline B1 positive, while no expression of either other cell cycle markers or TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) nuclei could be revealed. Since cycline B1 expression has been described in hippocampal neurons of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy by [Z. Nagy, M.M. Esiri, Neuronal cyclin expression in the hippocampus in temporal lobe epilepsy, Exp. Neurol. 150 (1998) 240-247], it is suggested that PTZ-kindling may be a suitable model to study the mechanisms of seizure-induced neuronal death.
