Several authors have described the presence of iodinated neuropeptide-Y binding sites on membranes of the mammalian CNS. In the present study we show a mapping of iodinated-NPY binding sites in the rat brain using receptor autoradiography. The sections were incubated with 125I-Bolton-Hunter coupled NPY (0.5-03 nM), in the absence or presence of 1 microM cold NPY. Some autoradiograms are studied by means of an image analyzer (VDC 501 Tesak) equipped with the host computer PDP 11 Digital, in order to enhance the contrast of the labeling. A very high density of NPY receptors is present in the limbic regions (hippocampus, amygdaloid complex, septal nuclei), in the cortex, and in some thalamic nuclei, while in some hypothalamic regions (paraventricular nucleus and median eminence) we detected a lower amount of NPY receptors. At the mesencephalic level, the substantia nigra presents a very high density of NPY receptors.
