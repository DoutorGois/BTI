To assess the role of hippocampal norepinephrine in learning and memory, rats were treated with medial septal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine either prior to or after acquisition of a spatial-memory task. No effect on acquisition learning or retention was observed. However, reversal learning was significantly enhanced in all treated animals regardless of whether treatment was prior to or after acquisition. Our results do not support a role of hippocampal norepinephrine in selective attention, but rather indicate a direct involvement in memory processes.
