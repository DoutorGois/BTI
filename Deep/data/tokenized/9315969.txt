The neurodegeneration in the CA1 subfield of hippocampus exhibited a dorsal-ventral gradient of susceptibility in global ischemia (82% dorsoseptally and only 16% ventrotemporally). Scopolamine (SCOP) did not improve the neuronal damage caused by the global ischemic challenge in rats and did not reduce the infarct area after the focal MCA-occlusion in mice. No differences were observed between saline and SCOP-treated animals in the physiologic parameters, except for a slight increase in rectal temperature. In contrast, treatment of hippocampal cultures with increasing concentrations of SCOP (1 nM to 1 mM) under glutamate incubation had a beneficial effect on neuronal viability. These data show that (1) there is substantial gradient of vulnerability of the hippocampus from dorsal to ventral in global ischemia and (2) that interactions between the NMDA, muscarinic receptors and their corresponding neurotransmitter inputs to hippocampal neurons are evident in vitro and may play a crucial role in neuronal neurodegeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying the high vulnerability of dorsal hippocampus still remain enigmatic.
