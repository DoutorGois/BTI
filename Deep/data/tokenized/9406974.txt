Streptozotocin (STZ)-elicited diabetes reduces central serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) synthesis/metabolism, but whether this reduction leads to decreased release of 5-HT has only scarcely been investigated. We have thus analysed the impact of STZ diabetes on hippocampal extracellular 5-HT levels both under basal conditions and during restraint stress, a procedure known to stimulate hippocampal 5-HT synthesis/metabolism and release. The pretreatment with STZ (3 weeks beforehand) and the 1 h restraint session respectively decreased and increased hippocampal 5-HT metabolism, as assessed by tissue analysis of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. On the other hand, hippocampal microdialysis revealed no difference in basal levels of extracellular 5-HT levels in (conscious) vehicle- and STZ-pretreated rats, but a differential effect of restraint. Thus, extracellular 5-HT levels increased throughout restraint (maximal increase: 194%) in vehicle-, but not in STZ-pretreated rats. In the latter rat group, plasma corticosterone levels were, however, increased, thus indicating a significant aversiveness to stress. Lastly, because anxiety-related behaviours may be affected by hippocampal serotonergic systems, resting and restrained vehicle- and STZ-pretreated rats were compared (immediately after stress) in an elevated plus-maze of anxiety. Pretreatment with STZ reduced the percent number of open arm entries and the number of closed arm entries, indicating increased anxiety and reduced locomotor activity, respectively. Restraint tended to increase anxiety-related behaviours in all rats, but this trend never reached significance. Our results confirm that gross analyses of 5-HT metabolism do not yield information on 5-HT release, and suggest that the prevalence of diabetes among patients suffering affective disorders could be related to the lack of hippocampal serotonergic response to aversive stimuli.
