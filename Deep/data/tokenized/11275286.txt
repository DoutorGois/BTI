Apamin blocks SK channels responsible for long-lasting hyperpolarization following the action potential. Using an olfactory associative task, the effect of an intracerebroventricular 0.3 ng apamin injection was tested on learning and memory. Apamin did not modify the learning of the procedure side of the task or the learning of the odor-reward association. To test reference memory specifically, the rats were trained on a new odor-association problem using the same procedure (acquisition session), and they were tested for retention 24 h later. Apamin injected before or after the acquisition session improved retention of the valence of a new odor pair. Apamin injected before the retention session did not affect the retrieval of the new valence. Thus, the results indicate that the blockage of apamin-sensitive SK channels facilitate consolidation on new-odor-reward association.
