The effects of excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptor antagonists were examined on intracellularly recorded epileptiform discharges in turtle hippocampal (ventromedial cortical) pyramidal neurons in vitro. Afferent synaptic activation of turtle hippocampal neurons evoked monophasic or biphasic GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). In the presence of bicuculline (5 microM) or picrotoxin (100 microM) IPSPs were reduced, and long-lasting ictal-like discharges were transiently observed prior to the establishment of a regular rhythm of discharge of spontaneous paroxysmal depolarization shifts (PDSs). Bicuculline-induced PDSs were reversibly reduced in amplitude and duration, but not abolished by the EAA receptor antagonists kynurenic acid (1 mM), cis-2,3-piperidine dicarboxylic acid (cis-2,3-PDA) (1 mM), or DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-AP-5) (100 microM), revealing a long-lasting hyperpolarizing afterpotential. These results indicate that the blockade of GABAergic inhibition leads to the genesis of epileptiform discharges, and EAA receptor antagonists (particularly those of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype) block the maintained depolarization underlying PDSs, but do not prevent their spontaneous discharge in turtle hippocampus.
