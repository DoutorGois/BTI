The administration of hydrocortisone to rats on the first 5 days of life causes a blockade of the hypophyseal-adrenal system and results in a decrease in the number of corticosterone receptors in the hypophysis, hypothalamus and hippocamp. Such a decrease in the receptor binding of corticosterone in the brain structures involved in the regulation of the hypophyseal-adrenal system by the feedback mechanism, is determined by change in the number of true glucocorticoid receptors.
