The NPAS3 gene encodes a transcription factor with disease roles in neurodevelopment, neoplasia and neurobehaviour. We report the first immunohistochemical findings on NPAS3 protein expression in the developing human fetal brain during the three trimesters (10-41 weeks) of gestational development. In the first trimester, NPAS3 expression is largely confined in the nucleus of cells of the ventricular zone. Similarly, strong nuclear expression in the hippocampus is noted as early as the first trimester, but with progressive increases in expression becoming more apparent in the molecular layer and layer III of the maturing neocortex during the second and third trimesters. In the cerebellum, nuclear expression is seen in basket cells and in Bergmann glia, but some cytoplasmic staining present in the internal granule layer of neurons. Findings from this study will assist in understanding the role of NPAS3 in human gestational brain development and consequently the pathological involvement in human diseases.
