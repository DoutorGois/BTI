Postpartum depression (PPD) affects over 10% of new mothers and adversely impacts the health of offspring. One of the greatest risk factors for PPD is prepregnancy stress but the underlying biological mechanism is unknown. Here we constructed an animal model which recapitulated prepregnancy stress induced PPD and tested the role of Akt-mTOR signaling in the hippocampus. Female virgin Balb/c mice received chronic restraint stress, followed by co-housing with a normal male mouse. We found that the chronic stress led to a transient depressive-like condition that disappeared within two weeks. However, prepregnantly stressed females developed long-term postpartum depressive-like (PPD-like) symptoms as indicated by deficient performance in tests of sucrose preference, forced swim, and novelty-suppressed feeding. Chronic stress induced transient decrease in Akt-mTOR signaling and altered expressions of glutamate receptor subunits NR1 and GluR1, in contrast to long-term deficits in Akt-mTOR signaling, GluR1/NR1 ratio, and hippocampal neurogenesis in PPD-like mice. Acute ketamine improved the molecular signaling abnormality, and reversed the behavioral deficits in PPD-like mice in a rapid and persistent manner, in contrast to ineffectiveness by chronic fluoxetine treatment. Taken together, we find that chronic prepregnancy stress potentiates a long-term PPD, in which Akt-mTOR signaling may play a crucial role.
