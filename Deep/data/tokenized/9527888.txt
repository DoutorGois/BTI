Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator and immune cell modulator. In two studies within the hippocampal formation (HF), CGRP-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) was increased in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus after adrenalectomy and in mossy cells after colchicine-induced destruction of granule neurons. Given the increase in CGRP-LI following damage to the granule cell region of the HF, we investigated another trauma model, ischemia, that targeted different areas of the HF, CA1 region, and subiculum to ascertain the regional expression of this peptide after insult. Following ischemia, light microscopic evaluation showed CGRP-LI in basket cell-like neuronal perikarya within the dorsal subiculum and CA1 region of the hippocampus and in varicose fibers within the CA2 region of the hippocampus. Control rats rarely expressed CGRP-LI within neurons in these regions. In ischemic brains, double-labeled immunocytochemistry with antibodies to various neural markers demonstrated co-localization of CGRP-LI primarily within surviving subicular and CA1 cells resembling interneurons containing parvalbumin-LI or calbindin-LI. Electron microscopic analysis of the CA1 region from ischemic brains showed that CGRP-LI was contained in terminals with numerous small synaptic vesicles that formed symmetric synapses with perikarya and large dendrites of pyramidal cells, some of which were degenerating. Collectively, the data from this study and our previous study indicate that damage induces CGRP-LI expression in interneurons and nonprincipal cells in the area of damage, and we hypothesize that CGRP expression in surviving neurons within damage-related regions of the hippocampus is likely to be an important, and possibly a protective, component of the response of the nervous system to injury.
