The present study describes the effects of sauroine (1), the main alkaloid obtained from Huperzia saururus, on memory retention and learning. To evaluate this, electrophysiological experiments and behavioral tests (step down) were performed on male Wistar rats. The results showed that 1 improved memory retention in the step-down test, significantly increasing hippocampal plasticity. Thus, 1 seems to be a constituent responsible for the activity claimed in folk medicine for H. saururus in Argentina.
