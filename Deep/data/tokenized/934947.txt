The effects of intravenous or intrahippocampal injections of lithium chloride dissolved in bidistilled water were investigated on rabbits with chronically implanted canniulas and electrodes. Bioelectric activity of the limbic structures and behavior were analyzed. Electrical activity was recorded by means of bipolar electrodes implanted chronically in the dorsal hippocampus, the gyrus cinguli, the amygdaloid complex and the medial hypothalamus, LiCl inhibited electric activity of the limbic structures and caused a reduction of spontaneous motor and exploratory activity of rabbits.
