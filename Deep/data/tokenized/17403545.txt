The reconsolidation hypothesis, which predicts that consolidated memories become labile and sensitive to amnestic agents upon reactivation, has been one of the most debated topics in memory research over recent years. One of the main criticisms to this hypothesis is the fact that some studies have shown the effects of "reconsolidation blockade" to be transient. Here we show that muscimol inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus following memory reactivation produces a reversible impairment of step-down inhibitory avoidance memory in rats. Moreover, we show that the reversal of this effect is dependent on the passage of time, and not on repeated testing. The implications of the findings to the interpretation of the phenomenon of transient retrieval impairment induced by post-reactivation pharmacological interventions on memory systems are discussed.
