We report a new approach for the detection of mitochondrial flavins through photo-oxidation of a probe molecule. Probe 1 showed high brightness (epsilon x Phif = 6.50 x 10(3) M(-1) cm(-1)) at long wavelengths (maximum emission wavelength, lambdamax = 600 nm) upon photo-oxidation, assisted by the strong electron accepting ability of the isoalloxazine moiety in flavins. Probe 1 also exhibited high selectivity for flavins over various biological oxidants, remarkable photo-stability, and mitochondrial localization.
