Rabbits with the Brown-Pierce carcinoma have been studied in chronic experiments for dynamics of the permanent potential reflecting bioelectrochemical processes in different structures of the hypothalamic and limbic system: medial preoptic area, ventromedial nucleus, posterior hypothalamic area, basal and lateral amygdalas, hippocampus, nucleus coeruleus as well as in central nucleus of the suture. The space-temporal pattern of neurodynamic changes in the subcortical brain structures has been found. These changes correlated with developmental characteristics of the Brown-Pierce carcinoma.
