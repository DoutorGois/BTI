Although stem cells are likely to improve neurological deficits seen after cerebral ischemia, the effects of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) on cerebral ischemia-induced learning dysfunction remain to be clarified. We tested whether the delayed injection of exogenous NPCs could prevent learning dysfunction after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia was produced by the injection of microspheres into the right hemisphere of each rat. Injection of NPCs obtained from green fluorescent protein transgenic rats into the hippocampus on Day 7 after the induction of cerebral ischemia improved the modified neurological severity score and reduced the prolongation of the escape latency seen in the water maze task. A few of the injected NPCs were positive for mature neuronal markers. In addition, the injected NPCs expressed BDNF on Day 28 after cerebral ischemia. Thus, the exogenous NPCs delivered by injection could act as a source of neurotrophic factors and prevent cerebral ischemia-induced learning dysfunction.
