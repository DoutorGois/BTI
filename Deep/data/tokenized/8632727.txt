It is widely accepted that cerebral acetylcholine is necessary for learning and memory, but little is known about the type of muscarinic receptors involved in these functions. To investigate this problem, [3H]-N-methyl-scopolamine which binds to different types of muscarinic receptors, [3H]-Pirenzepine an M1 receptor antagonist, and [3H]-Oxotremorine-M which binds mainly to M2 receptors, were used as ligands to look for possible changes in muscarinic receptor density in neostriatum (NEO), hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY), and temporo-parietal neocortex (CTX), after testing for retention of inhibitory avoidance, trained with high or low footshock intensities. After low reinforcement there was an M1 postsynaptic receptor up-regulation in NEO, HIP, and CTX, and an M2 presynaptic receptor down-regulation in HIP, which suggests a concerted pre- and postsynaptic cholinergic activation in this area. An up-regulation of both M1 and M2 receptors was detected in CTX of low and high footshocked animals, which indicates the presence of a cortical postsynaptic M2 receptor.
