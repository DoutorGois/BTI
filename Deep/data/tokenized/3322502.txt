In situ hybridization reveals striking regional differences in the expression of constitutive and inducible heat shock genes in the rabbit brain. Fibre tracts throughout the brain show a dramatic induction of heat shock mRNA after hyperthermia, a pattern consistent with a strong glial response to heat shock. While neurons in the cerebellum exhibit a marked induction of heat shock mRNA, neurons of the hippocampus do not. Constitutive expression of a heat shock gene is observed in neuronal laminae of the hippocampus and cerebellum.
