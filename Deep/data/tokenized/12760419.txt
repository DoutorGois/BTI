Botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A and E (BoNT/A and BoNT/E) block neurotransmitter release by cleaving the 206-amino-acid SNARE protein, SNAP-25. For each BoNT serotype, cleavage of SNAP-25 results in the loss of intact protein, the production of an N-terminal truncated protein, and the generation of a small C-terminal peptide. Peptides that mimic the C-terminal fragments of SNAP-25 following BoNT/A or BoNT/E cleavage were shown to depress transmitter release in bovine chromaffin cells and in Aplysia buccal ganglion cells. Similarly, the N-terminal-truncated SNAP-25 resulting from BoNT/A or BoNT/E cleavage has been found to inhibit transmitter exocytosis in various systems. With one exception, however, the inhibitory action of truncated SNAP-25 has not been demonstrated at a well-defined cholinergic synapse. The goal of the current study was to determine the level of inhibition of neurotransmitter release by N-terminal BoNT/A- or BoNT/E-truncated SNAP-25 in two different neuronal systems: cholinergically coupled Aplysia neurons and rat hippocampal cell cultures. Both truncated SNAP-25 products inhibited depolarization-dependent glutamate release from hippocampal cultures and depressed synaptic transmission in Aplysia buccal ganglion cells. These results suggest that truncated SNAP-25 can compete with endogenous SNAP-25 for binding with other SNARE proteins involved in transmitter release, thus inhibiting neurotransmitter exocytosis.
