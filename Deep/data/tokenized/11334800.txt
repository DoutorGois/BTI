Olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) transects the glutamatergic efferents from the olfactory bulbs, and the changes of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated function are though to be involved in the behavioral deficits seen in OBX rats. In the present study, irritability scores in OBX male Wistar rats were correlated with discrete regional effects on NMDA receptor function measured using a [3H] MK-801 binding assay. Irritability scores, measured before and for 2 weeks after OBX, showed a gradual increase in irritability after OBX. A reduction of the NMDA receptor density was observed in the cerebral cortex and amygdala 16 days after OBX, but not in the striatum, olfactory tubercle, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus. These results demonstrate that OBX causes changes in the NMDA receptor system in certain brain regions and suggest that these changes may be responsible for the behavioral deficits of OBX rats.
