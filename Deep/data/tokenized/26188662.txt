Intracellular calcium accumulation is associated with cell death in several neuropathological disorders including brain ischemia, but the exact mechanisms of calcification need to be clarified. We used organotypic hippocampal slice culture - cultures subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) mimicking the in vivo situation to investigate the events underlying ectopic calcification. Alizarin red staining indicating calcium deposition was observed in the cornu ammonis (CA)1 and dentate gyrus regions in control hippocampal slices despite no specific labeling for cell death markers. Electron microscopy using the osmium/potassium dichromate method revealed scattered degenerated cells throughout the normally appearing CA1 region. They contained electron-dense precipitates within mitochondria, and electron probe microanalysis confirmed that they were calcifying mitochondria. Selective calcium deposition was noted within, but not beyond, mitochondria in these mineralized cells. They showed ultrastructural features of non-necrotic, non-apoptotic cell death and retained their compact ultrastructure, even after the majority of mitochondria were calcified. Unexpectedly, no intracellular calcification was noted in necrotic CA1 pyramidal cells after OGD, and there was no progression of calcification in OGD-lesioned slices. In addition, mineralized cells in both control and OGD-lesioned slices were closely associated with or completely engulfed by astrocytes but not microglia. These astrocytes were laden with heterogeneous cytoplasmic inclusions that appeared to be related with their phagocytic activity. These data demonstrate that microcalcification specifically associated with mitochondria might lead to a novel type of cell death and suggest that astrocytes may be involved in the phagocytosis of these mineralized cells and possibly in the regulation of ectopic calcification.
