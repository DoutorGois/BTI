Dopamine is intimately involved in cognitive processes in the brain. Of the several subtypes of dopamine receptors, the possible role of dopamine D1-like receptors in brain functions, especially in learning and memory, has recently generated much interest. However, molecularly the D1-like receptors are comprised of at least two subtypes, namely D-1 and D-5, and it has not been possible to ascertain which of these two receptor classes is responsible for these functions due to the lack of selective ligands. In the present study, utilizing a combined antisense-in vivo dialysis approach, we show that the D-5 subtype is the dopamine D1-like receptor involved in modulating hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release, a transmitter implicated in a variety of cognitive processes. This is one of the first evidence for a functional role for the D-5 receptor.
