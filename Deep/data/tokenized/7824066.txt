Carbamazepine (25 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally to adult male Wistar rats for 45 days and norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels were simultaneously assayed in discrete brain regions by high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. Experimental rats displayed no behavioral abnormalities. Body and brain weights were not significantly different from control group of rats. After exposure it was observed that norepinephrine levels were elevated in motor cortex (P < 0.01) and cerebellum (P < 0.05), while dopamine levels were decreased in these two regions (P < 0.001, P < 0.05). However, dopamine levels were increased in hippocampus (P < 0.01). Serotonin levels were significantly decreased in motor cortex (P < 0.001) and hypothalamus (P < 0.001) but increased in striatum-accumbens (P < 0.001) and brainstem (P < 0.001). These results suggest that carbamazepine may mediate its anticonvulsant effect by differential alterations of monoamine levels in discrete brain regions particularly in motor cortex and cerebellum.
