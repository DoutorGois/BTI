The medial septal/diagonal band complex (MS/DB) is believed to play an important role in the generation and maintenance of the hippocampal theta rhythm, which has been implicated in the mnemonic and information-processing capacity of the brain. Although the physiological and morphological diversity of the septal neurons indicates their different functions, it is not known which cell type within the population contributes most critically to the theta rhythm. Here we review the chemical identity of different cell groups within the MS/DB complex, the anatomical connectivity between them, the electrophysiological properties of immunochemically-defined cell types, and their contribution to theta rhythmicity in the medial septum and the hippocampal theta rhythm. In order to better understand the mechanisms involved in rhythmic burst firing of the MS/DB neurons, a number of relevant theoretical models related to the generation/synchronization in neural networks are discussed.
