PURPOSE: The aim of this article is to discuss the neuronal substrates of sleep oscillations leading to seizures consisting of spike-wave (SW) complexes at 2-4 Hz, mimicking those seen in absence epilepsy, or SW and polyspike-wave (PSW) complexes at 1.5-2.5 Hz, often associated with fast runs at 10-15 Hz, as in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. METHODS: Extracellular recordings were done in permanently implanted animals during the natural waking-sleep cycle. Single and dual simultaneous recordings from cortical neurons, cortical and thalamic neurons, or cortical neurons and glial cells were performed in cats under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. RESULTS: (a) The minimal substrate of SW seizures is the neocortex because such seizures may occur in thalamectomized animals, in which spindles are absent. In intact-brain animals, SW seizures are initiated in neocortex and spread to the thalamus after a few seconds. The majority of thalamocortical (TC) neurons are steadily hyperpolarized throughout the cortical SW seizures. (b) In the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, the paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDSs) associated with the EEG "spike" of SW/PSW complexes contain an important inhibitory component, whereas the hyperpolarization during the EEG "wave" component is not due to gamma-aminobutryic acid (GABA)ergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) but is ascribed to a mixture of disfacilitation and K+ currents. As is also the case with seizures consisting of pure SW complexes, the majority of TC neurons are hyperpolarized during the cortical paroxysms and disinhibited after the cessation of cortical seizures. CONCLUSIONS: Seizures with SW complexes and of the Lennox-Gastaut type preferentially evolve from sleep oscillations. They are initiated in neocortex and spread to the thalamus after a few seconds. The majority of TC neurons are inhibited during these seizures.
