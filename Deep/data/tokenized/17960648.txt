We examined whether alternate systems compensate for deficient ones to process relations in amnesia. Transverse patterning (TP), a test of relating items to one another in memory, is reliably impaired in amnesia and has played a central role in testing hippocampal function. We facilitated successful TP in amnesia by providing familiar stimuli with semantically meaningful relationships. Tapping semantic knowledge allowed TP to be solved via extrahippocampal structures. Our work shows that by framing a situation as meaningful we can engage alternate neural systems to compensate for impairments.
