Postconditioning with inhalational anesthetics can reduce ischemia-reperfusion brain injury, although the cellular mechanisms for this effect have not been determined. The current study was designed to test if TASK channels contribute to their neuroprotective actions. Whole cell recordings were used to examine effects of volatile anesthetic on TASK currents in cortical neurons and to verify loss of anesthetic-activated TASK currents from TASK(-/-) mice. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model was used to establish brain ischemia-reperfusion injury. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that TASK mRNA was reduced by >90% in cortex and hippocampus of TASK(-/-) mice. The TASK(-/-) mice showed a much larger region of infarction than C57BL/6 J mice after tMCAO challenge. Isoflurane or sevoflurane administered after the ischemic insult reduced brain infarct percentage and neurological deficit scores in C57BL/6 J mice, these effect were reduced in TASK(-/-) mice. Whole cell recordings revealed that the isoflurane-activated background potassium current observed in cortical pyramidal neurons from wild type mice was conspicuously reduced in TASK(-/-) mice. Our studies demonstrate that TASK channels can limit ischemia-reperfusion damage in the cortex, and postconditioning with volatile anesthetics provides neuroprotective actions that depend, in part, on activation of TASK currents in cortical neurons.
