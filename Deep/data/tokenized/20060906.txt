Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that is primarily produced by microglia in the brain. IL-1beta inhibits N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced outward currents (I(NMDA-OUT)) through IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI) in hippocampal CA1 neurons (Zhang, R., Yamada, J., Hayashi, Y., Wu, Z, Koyama, S., Nakanishi, H., 2008. Inhibition of NMDA-induced outward currents by interleukin-1beta in hippocampal neurons, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 372, 816-820). Although IL-1RI is associated with mitogen-activated protein kinases, their involvement in the effect of IL-1beta on I(NMDA-OUT) remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that IL-1beta caused activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and that the p38 inhibitor SB203580 significantly blocked the effect of IL-1beta on I(NMDA-OUT) in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Furthermore, the intracellular perfusion of active recombinant p38alpha significantly decreased the mean amplitude of I(NMDA-OUT). In neurons prepared from inflamed hippocampus, the mean amplitude of I(NMDA-OUT) was significantly reduced. In the inflamed hippocampus, IL-1beta and IL-1RI were expressed mainly in microglia and neurons, respectively. These results suggest that IL-1beta increases the excitability of hippocampal CA1 neurons in the p38-dependent inhibition of I(NMDA-OUT).
