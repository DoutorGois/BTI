Brain regions that are structurally connected might become functionally connected by synchronization in the gamma-frequency band. In a recent issue of Nature, Colgin et al. show spatially and temporally fine-grained gamma-band synchronization between different parts of the rat hippocampal formation, suggesting a theta-modulated switching of gamma-mediated communication.
