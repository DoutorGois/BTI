Malignant gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors and have a dismal prognosis due to their infiltrative growth. Gene therapy using viral vectors represents an attractive alternative to conventional cancer therapies. In a previous study, we established lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoproteins (GPs) and demonstrated transduction of human malignant glioma cells in culture. In the current approach, we compared the transduction efficacy of LCMV-GP- and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors for malignant glioma cells and normal brain cells in vitro and in vivo. LCMV-GP pseudotypes transduced almost exclusively astrocytes, whereas VSV-G pseudotypes infected neurons as well as astrocytes. LCMV-GP pseudotypes showed an efficient transduction of solid glioma parts and specific transduction of infiltrating tumor cells. In contrast, VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced only a few tumor cells in solid tumor parts and infected mostly normal brain cells in infiltrating tumor areas. In conclusion, lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with LCMV glycoproteins represent an attractive option for gene therapy of malignant glioma.
