Refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a debilitating condition potentially amenable to resective surgery. However, between 40 and 50% patients continue to experience postoperative seizures. The development of imaging prognostic markers of postoperative seizure outcome is a crucial objective for epilepsy research. In the present study, we performed analyses of preoperative cortical thickness and subcortical surface shape on MRI in 115 of patients with mTLE and radiologically defined hippocampal sclerosis being considered for surgery, and 80 healthy controls. Patients with excellent (International League Against Epilepsy outcome (ILAE) I) and suboptimal (ILAE II-VI) postoperative outcomes had a comparable distribution of preoperative atrophy across the cortex, basal ganglia, and amygdala. Conventional volumetry of whole hippocampal and extrahippocampal subcortical structures, and of global gray and white matter, could not differentiate between patient outcome groups. However, surface shape analysis revealed localized atrophy of the thalamus bilaterally and of the posterior/lateral hippocampus contralateral to intended resection in patients with persistent postoperative seizures relative to those rendered seizure free. Data uncorrected for multiple comparisons also revealed focal atrophy of the ipsilateral hippocampus posterior to the margins of resection in patients with persistent seizures. This data indicates that persistent postoperative seizures after temporal lobe surgery are related to localized preoperative shape alterations of the thalamus bilaterally and the hippocampus contralateral to intended resection. Imaging techniques that have the potential to unlock prognostic markers of postoperative outcome in individual patients should focus assessment on a bihemispheric thalamohippocampal network in prospective patients with refractory mTLE being considered for temporal lobe surgery.
