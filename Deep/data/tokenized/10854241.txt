In the mammalian CNS, aspartate and glutamate are major excitatory amino acids, and their receptors are believed to mediate a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, including neurotransmission, plasticity, excitotoxicity, and various forms of neurodegeneration. The immediate early gene pip92 has been identified in serum-stimulated BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts, activated T lymphocytes treated with cycloheximide, and fibroblast growth factor-stimulated hippocampal cells during neuronal differentiation. In this study we have demonstrated that pip92 is expressed in the mouse brain after a single intraperitoneal injection of NMDA. The distribution of pip92 mRNA levels in the NMDA-treated mouse brain was investigated using in situ RT-PCR. The region-specific activation of pip92 in the CNS was observed 3 h after NMDA injection, and high levels of pip92 mRNA were detected in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and piriform cortex regions. In addition, the activation of pip92 by NMDA was mediated by activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 kinase, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the mouse hippocampus and immortalized rat hippocampal progenitor cells. This study suggests that pip92 is likely to play an important role in neuronal cell death induced by excitotoxic NMDA injury in the CNS.
