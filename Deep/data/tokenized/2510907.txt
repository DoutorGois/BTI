Common marmosets with bilateral ibotenic acid-induced destruction of the neurones of the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, which provide the major cholinergic input to the hippocampal formation, were impaired on the acquisition but not on the retention of a repeated-trial visuospatial discrimination learning task. They were also impaired on serial spatial reversal learning (but not on serial object reversal learning), on acquisition of a trial-independent successive concurrent discrimination using novel objects (but not on acquisition of a comparable discrimination in which two familiar objects had predictable reward value) and were unable to acquire a difficult conditional object discrimination. It is argued that the role of the hippocampus is in the acquisition but not the retention of ruled-based behaviour (which includes spatial responding) in contrast to the acquisition of discriminations based on stimulus-reward association formation.
