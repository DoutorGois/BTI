This paper describes preparation of the isolated brain of hibernating ground squirrel maintained by intraarterial perfusion. This technique allows a long-term survival (about 3 days) of the isolated brain of adult animals. The preparation viability was assessed by extracellular investigation of stability of structure-specific electrical activity. The areas investigated include neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
