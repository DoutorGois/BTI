The hippocampus contains the highest number of glucocorticoid-sensitive neurons in the rat brain and excessive exposure to glucocorticoids can cause damage to hippocampal neurons and impair the capacity of the hippocampus to survive neuronal insults. In this study in situ hybridization combined with quantitative image analysis was used to study preprotachykinin-A mRNA levels after administration of a toxic dose of kainic acid in animals pretreated with glucocorticoids. Kainic acid was injected into dorsal hippocampus CA3 region in animals pretreated with the synthetic glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone and in control animals. Preprotachykinin-A mRNA was not detected in the hippocampus of untreated animals or in animals analysed 30 min after a kainic acid injection. However, 4 h after injection of kainic acid, the level of preprotachykinin-A mRNA increased to 20-times above the detection limit both in the dentate gyrus and the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Treatment of kainic acid-injected animals with dexamethasone 30 min before and 2 h after the injection attenuated the increase in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus by 50%. In contrast, dexamethasone pretreatment had no significant effect on the kainic acid-induced increase of preprotachykinin-A mRNA in pyramidal cells in regions CA3 or CA1. These results show that an excitatory stimulus within the hippocampus causes a substantial increase in the level of preprotachykinin-A mRNA in hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells and suggest that in granule cells of the dentate gyrus this increase can be modulated by glucocorticoids.
