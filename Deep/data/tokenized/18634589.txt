Recent advances in the field of neuron-glia interactions were presented at the 27th International Symposium of the University of Montreal Center de Recherche en Sciences Neruologiques. Topics included synaptogenesis, regulation of synaptic strength by glia at the neuromuscular junction and hippocampus; myelin formation, structure, and maintenance; involvement of glia in nervous-system response to injury, hypoxia, and ischemia; neurogenesis and apoptosis, and microglial involvement in chronic pain.
