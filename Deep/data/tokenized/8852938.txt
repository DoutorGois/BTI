In the present report we describe the anatomical localization of cells expressing tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, in the hippocampal complex of developing rats. We report a development-dependent down regulation of both tenascin-C protein and mRNA. The highest levels of expression of tenascin-C was observed in rat pups from embryonic day 18 to postnatal day 7. Double labelling experiments performed with a tenascin-C antibody or tenascin-C probes combined with specific markers of astrocytes (GFAP) or neurons (MAP2 and Tau) allowed us to demonstrate that tenascin-C is expressed by both immature astrocytes and neurons in immature hippocampus. The temporal and topographic distribution of cells expressing tenascin-C (in the hilus and the stratum oriens of CA3) correlate with the localization and period of migration and maturation of post-mitotic cells. In view of these data we discuss the hypothesis that tenascin-C, as a mediator of neuron-glia interactions, may contribute to the development of hippocampal cells.
