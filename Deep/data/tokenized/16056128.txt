Hippocampal neurogenesis is thought to play a functional role in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. The neurogenic capability of the hippocampus declines with age and may be associated with a decline in cognitive function. In the present study, an established model of ageing in mice was used to test the protective effects of GM1 ganglioside on hippocampal neurogenesis. This model uses D-galactose treatment to cause neuronal injury and reduced neurogenesis. GM1 significantly increased the proliferation, long-term survival and neuronal differentiation of hippocampal progenitors that had been injured with D-galactose. This study demonstrates that GM1 can protect hippocampal neurogenesis from D-galactose injury. Therefore, GM1 may protect neurogenesis in the ageing brain.
