The cluster of differentiation 33 (CD33) has been proved as a susceptibility locus associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) based on recent genetic studies. Numerous studies have shown that multiple neuroimaging measures are potent predictors of AD risk and progression, and these measures are also affected by genetic variations in AD. Figuring out the association between CD33 genetic variations and AD-related brain atrophy may shed light on the underlying mechanisms of CD33-related AD pathogenesis. Thus, we investigated the influence of CD33 genotypes on AD-related brain atrophy to clarify the possible means by which CD33 impacts AD. A total of 48 individuals with probable AD, 483 mild cognitive impairment, and 281 cognitively normal controls were recruited from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We investigated the influence of CD33 SNPs on hippocampal volume, parahippocampal gyrus volume, posterior cingulate volume, middle temporal volume, hippocampus CA1 subregion volume, and entorhinal cortex thickness. We found that brain regions significantly affected by CD33 genetic variations were restricted to hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus in hybrid population, which were further validated in subpopulation (MCI and NC) analysis. These findings reaffirm the importance of the hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus in AD pathogenesis, and present evidences for the CD33 variations influence on the atrophy of specific AD-related brain structures. Our findings raise the possibility that CD33 polymorphisms contribute to the AD risk by altering the neuronal degeneration of hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus.
