A large body of evidence from molecular, cellular and human studies suggests that lithium may enhance synaptic plasticity, which may be associated with its therapeutic efficacy. However, only a small number of studies have directly assessed this. To determine whether lithium treatment alters structural synaptic plasticity, this study examined the effect of 4 wk lithium treatment on the amount and distribution of dendrites in the dentate gyrus (DG) and hippocampal area CA1 of young adult rats. Following 4 wk lithium or control chow feeding, animals were decapitated, the hippocampi were prepared and stained using a rapid Golgi staining technique and the amount and distribution of the dendritic branching was evaluated using Sholl analyses (method of concentric circles). In the DG, lithium treatment increased the amount and distribution of dendritic branches in the proximal half of dendritic trees of the granule cells and reduced branching in the distal half. In area CA1, the same treatment also increased the number of dendritic branches in the proximal half of apical dendritic trees of CA1 pyramidal cells and reduced branching in the distal half of apical dendritic trees but had no effect on basilar dendritic trees. The lithium treatment altered the total density of dendritic trees in neither the DG nor area CA1. These findings suggest that, in the DG and apical CA1, chronic lithium treatment rearranges neuronal morphology to increase dendritic branching and distribution to where major afferent input is received.
