Regulated secretion requires the formation of a fusion complex consisting of synaptobrevin, syntaxin and SNAP 25. One of these key proteins, synaptobrevin, also complexes with the vesicle protein synaptophysin. The fusion complex and the synaptophysin-synaptobrevin complex are mutually exclusive. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation and crosslinking experiments we report here that the synaptophysin-synaptobrevin interaction in mouse whole brain and defined brain areas is upregulated during neuronal development as previously reported for rat brain. Furthermore the synaptophysin-synaptobrevin complex is also upregulated within 10-12 days of cultivation in mouse hippocampal neurons in primary culture. Besides being constituents of small synaptic vesicles in neurons synaptophysin and synaptobrevin also occur on small synaptic vesicle analogues of neuroendocrine cells. However, the synaptophysin-synaptobrevin complex was not found in neuroendocrine cell lines and more importantly it was also absent in the adrenal gland, the adenohypophysis and the neurohypophysis although the individual proteins could be clearly detected. In the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC 12 complex formation between synaptophysin and synaptobrevin could be initiated by adult rat brain cytosol. In conclusion, the synaptophysin-synaptobrevin complex is upregulated in neurons in primary culture but is absent in the neuroendocrine cell lines and tissues tested. The complex may provide a reserve pool of synaptobrevin during periods of high synaptic activity. Such a reserve pool probably is less important for more slowly secreting neuroendocrine cells and neurons. The synaptophysin on small synaptic vesicle analogues in these cells appears to resemble the synaptophysin of embryonic synaptic vesicles since complex formation can be induced by adult brain cytosol.
