The dynamics of the involvement of different brain structures in a pathological process is very important for decoding the mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy. In this work, the experimental model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by lithium chloride and pilocarpine was used. The method of immunochemical detection of the immediate early gene c-fos was used as an indicator of functioning neurons in the brain. The c-fos expression was determined at different time points (30, 60 and 90 min) after the pilocarpine injection. An increase in the c-fos expression was observed in neuronal populations during the development of the status epilepticus, the time and degree of involvement of different brain structures being different. The expression of c-fos was first observed in the piriform cortex, the olfactory tubercle, thalamic nuclei, lateral habenular nuclei, and the caudate putamen. Then the hippocampus, the septal formation, the amygdala, and basal ganglia were involved in the activation process. In the hypothalamic areas, c-fos expression was observed latest. These data contribute to understanding the mechanisms of temporal lobe epilepsy and searching for the ways of its therapy.
