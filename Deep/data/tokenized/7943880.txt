Protein synthesis intensity in the tissue of various portions of the brain of rats pre-exposed to 10 min systemic circulation arrest was studied with the use of 3H-leucin, a protein synthesis labeled precursor, and compared with that in intact animals. Protein synthesis intensity in the brain of resuscitated animals was found to correlate with the degree of their neurologic status recovery. In rapidly recovering animals a significant intensification of protein synthesis is observed on day 4 after resuscitation in the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In the animals whose resuscitation was not so smooth this process develops only in the hippocampus and the intermedial and lateral portions of the cerebellum. In patients with disturbed neurologic status protein synthesis intensity was unchanged in all the examined portions of the brain. The authors suggest that protein synthesis activation phase is an obligatory stage in full-value neurologic recovery of resuscitated animals.
