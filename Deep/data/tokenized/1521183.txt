Sulphonylurea drugs, such as glibenclamide and tolbutamide, are widely used as selective blockers of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K channels. In experiments on hippocampal slices (from Wistar rats) glibenclamide (and possibly gliquidone and tolbutamide) significantly reduced the highly voltage-dependent, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive D-type outward current of CA3 neurons. Judging by these observations, the sulphonylureas may not be as selective as generally believed.
