Rats were tested for their responses to 4 stimuli in order to measure hyperreactivity. Animals with septal lesions emitted the expected hyperreactivity. Lesions of the postcommisural fornix, precommissural fornix, or anterior hippocampus, administered 16 days prior to a septal lesion, blocked the expected hyperreactivity. Lesions localized to the medial or the lateral fibers of the fornix decreased the magnitude the duration of the expected hyperreactivity following septal lesions but did not block it. Lesions of the posterior hippocampus-entorhinal cortex had no reliable effect on the expected hyperreactivity after septal lesions. These data indicate that the appearance of hyperreactivity following a septal lesion depends upon a circuit involving the septum, precommissural fornix, anterior hippocampus, postcommissural fornix, and hypothalamus, and document an important functional relationship between the septum, anterior hippocampus, and hypothalamus.
