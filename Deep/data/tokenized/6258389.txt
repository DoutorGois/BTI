In 40 rats immobilized with gallamine evoked field potentials were elicited in the dorsal hippocampus by stimulation of the septal nuclei. Latency of the septohippocampal evoked potential (SHEP) elicited by stimulation of the medial septal nuclei, the variations of latencies and amplitudes with increasing stimulus intensities as well as the occurrence of frequency potentiation and post-tetanic potentiation allow the conclusion that the SHEP registered in the stratum granulare of dentate gyrus is mainly monosynaptically elicited. Nevertheless some data discussed in the paper point to the existence of a more complicated and not exclusively monosynaptic activation of granular cells caused by septal stimulation.
