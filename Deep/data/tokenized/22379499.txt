Multiple studies demonstrate the influence of the limbic system on the processing of sensory events and attentional guidance. But the mechanisms involved therein are yet not entirely clear. The close connection of handling incoming sensory information and memory retrieval, like in the case of habituation towards insignificant stimuli, suggests a crucial impact of the hippocampus on the direction of attention. In this paper we thus present a neurofunctional forward model of a hippocampal comparator function based on the theory of theta-regulated attention. Subsequently we integrated this comparator model into a multiscale framework for the simulation of evoked responses. The results of our simulations were compared to experimental data on electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of habituation towards familiar stimuli using time-scale analysis. In consequence we are able to present additional evidence for limbic influences on the direction of attention driven by stimulus novelty and a systems neuroscience framework for the statements given in the theta-regulated attention hypothesis.
