There is a net movement of calcium into brain cells during anoxia and ischemia. This communication examines the mechanisms of this movement in rat hippocampal slices by analyzing changes in 45Ca2+ distribution. The CA1 pyramidal cells are the most sensitive to anoxic/ischemic damage; therefore, our measurements of Ca2+ and high-energy nucleotides are restricted to this region. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels during anoxia is not blocked by the Ca2+ channel blocker cobalt, nor is it blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists kynurenic acid, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, or ketamine. Kinetic measurements show that the rate of Ca2+ efflux across the plasmalemma during anoxia is sufficiently decreased to account for the increase in intracellular Ca2+. It thus appears that the net increase in calcium does not result from the opening of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, nor from flux through the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel. Rather, it results from inhibition of the adenosine triphosphate-dependent extrusion mechanism for Ca2+. The relation of this conclusion to mechanisms of anoxic cell damage is discussed.
