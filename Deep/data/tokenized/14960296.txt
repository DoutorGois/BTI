BACKGROUND: Electroconvulsive seizures, an animal model for electroconvulsive treatment, induce a strong increase in neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult rats. Hippocampal neurogenesis has previously been described as occurring in an angiogenic niche. This study examines the effect of electroconvulsive seizures on proliferation of vascular cells in rat hippocampus. METHODS: Rats were injected with bromodeoxyuridine to label proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus after single/multiple electroconvulsive seizures in a dose-response study and at various time points after single electroconvulsive seizures in a time-course study. RESULTS: A dose-response effect on the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled endothelial cells located in the granule cell layer, hilus, and molecular layer was noted, as was the case with the number of neural precursors in the subgranular zone. The time-course study revealed that endothelial cell and neural precursor proliferation occurred in concert in response to a single electroconvulsive seizure. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in response to electroconvulsive seizures, endothelial cell and neural proliferation is coregulated. The increase in endothelial cell proliferation may act to support the increased neural proliferation and neuronal activity or vice versa, possibly leading to structural changes within the hippocampus of importance for the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive seizures.
