Systemic injection of kainic acid in adult rat is accompanied by a large increase in the accumulation of acetylated derivatives of spermidine and spermine in the hippocampus and piriform cortex of animals pretreated with the polyamine oxidase inhibitor, MDL 72527. Furthermore, the activity of the enzyme spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase is increased at 8 and 16 h after kainate injection in piriform cortex and hippocampus. These results indicate that the polyamine interconversion pathway is rapidly activated in limbic areas following kainate-induced seizure activity, and suggest that this pathway might participate in the resulting neuronal damage.
