The performance of normal rats and that of rats with hippocampal system damage were compared on acquisition of different versions of the same two-odor discrimination task that placed different encoding and representational demands on memory. Rats with fornix lesions were impaired when explicit comparisons among multiple odor cues and differential response choices were encouraged. However, when odor-cue comparison was hindered and explicit cues for response choice were eliminated, rats with fornix lesions out performed normal animals. The results support an hypothesis that the hippocampal system is critical to a memory representation based on encoding relations among multiple percepts, and other brain systems support performance adaptations based on encodings of stimuli individually.
