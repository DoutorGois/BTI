Progesterone and its metabolite, allopregnanolone, are neurosteroids that are present at high concentrations in fetal brains that decrease right after birth. Allopregnanolone is a potent positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor function. We examined the effect of exogenous administration of these steroids on hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in immature rats. Progesterone (10mg/kg), allopregnanolone (10mg/kg), or vehicle alone was intraperitoneally administered immediately before and then subcutaneously 6h and 24h after hypoxia-ischemia to postnatal day 7 (P7), day 14 (P14), and day 21 (P21) rats. The effects of the treatments were evaluated using histological analyses (hemispheric volumes and semi-quantitative scoring for neuropathologic injury). Both progesterone and allopregnanolone significantly exacerbated brain injury in P7 and P14 rats, but not in P21 rats. This detrimental effect was similar across the examined brain regions (the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus) and showed no sex differences. Co-administration of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, partially mitigated the exacerbating effect of allopregnanolone. Based on the similarity of the effects of these neurosteroids, we speculate that progesterone accentuates neuronal injury mainly via the activity of allopregnanolone. The present study indicates that the detrimental effects of allopregnanolone were, at least in part, mediated via GABAergic neuroexcitability. This is in line with the notion that GABA is excitatory for immature neurons, while it is inhibitory for mature neurons.
