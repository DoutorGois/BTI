Numerous studies have investigated the expression of various cytokine families in the CNS after brain injury. The gp130 or interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokines have received a great deal of focus, and it is clear that they exhibit an acute and robust upregulation in various brain injury models. We are interested to determine, however, whether endogenously expressed cytokines in the CNS act in a direct neuromodulatory manner. In an accompanying study, we examined the expression of five gp130 cytokines and their receptors in the lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus. We follow up that study here by trying to determine if gp130 signal transduction occurs in hippocampal principal neurons after seizure. Therefore, using the expression of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and -3 as indices of gp130 signal transduction, we performed a detailed in situ hybridization seizure time-course study in the adult rat hippocampus. For comparison, we also examined SOCS-2, which is involved in insulin-like growth factor signaling. We found that while SOCS-1 and -3 were faintly expressed under basal conditions, only SOCS-3 exhibited a rapid, robust, and transient induction. This occurred first in non-principal cells, which appeared to be glial, peaking at approximately 12 h post-seizure. Subsequently, a robust induction of SOCS-3 occurred in pyramidal and granule neurons, peaking at approximately 24 h. SOCS-2 displayed a relatively higher level of basal expression, particularly in CA3, and a mild and transient downregulation by 24 h. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that seizure-induced gp130 cytokines play a direct neuromodulatory role in the hippocampus. Since in our previous study we did not detect cytokine receptor expression in non-principal cells, it is unclear what elicits SOCS-3 expression in this population.
