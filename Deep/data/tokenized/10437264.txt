Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (RSM), a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal herb, has been used to improve blood circulation and resolve blood stasis. We have previously found that RSM has neuroprotective effect on ischemia and/or ischemia-reperfusion rats. The purpose of this study was to obtain further information on the mechanism of the RSM-induced neuroprotection and to examine the neuroprotective effect on neurons exposed to anoxia. The effect of RSM on anoxic damage in cultured hippocampal neurons of neonatal rat was investigated by using morphological changes and heat shock protein 70 kD (HSP70) expression as indicators. RSM given 0.5 h before 2 h-anoxia followed by 48 hours reoxygenation could significantly increase survival rate of hippocampal neurons and number of HSP70 positive cells. The results suggest that RSM has a direct neuroprotective effects on anoxic damage in hippocampal neurons.
