BACKGROUND: Integrated neurological function, behavior, and somatic recovery were studied in 35 rats undergoing 5 to 80 minutes of hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA). METHODS AND RESULTS: A closed extracorporeal circulation system (ECC) consisting of a miniature oxygenator and heat exchanger, primed with 6 mL of asanguinous solution, was connected to a closed-chest rat with cannulae in the right atrium for venous drainage (ID = 1.7 mm) and in the ascending aorta for arterial return (ID = 1.0 mm). The rat was surface- and core-cooled until rectal temperature reached 18 degrees C, when ECC was stopped and cardioplegic solution delivered. After 5, 10, 20, 40 (each n = 5), and 80 minutes (n = 15) of HCA, the rat was reperfused, weaned from ECC, and followed with behavioral scoring, passive avoidance tasks, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing until euthanized for morphological study. Every rat resumed weight gain in the first week after HCA and regained preoperative exercise capacity by the fourth week. Only rats undergoing 80 minutes of HCA showed behavioral abnormalities such as stereotypy and incomplete righting reflex, which eventually disappeared in the fourth week. Learning ability was preserved in all except for rats after 80 min of HCA, who failed to acquire new memory to avoid electric stimuli (n = 10) up to 3 months after HCA, when pyramidal cells were partly replaced by astroglia in the cerebral cortex and CA1 sector of hippocampus. Nonetheless, old memory established before HCA was preserved even after 80 minutes of HCA and allowed rats (n = 5) to avoid electric stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: Homogeneity of animals, miniature ECC system, and an established testing system allowed evaluation of rats after HCA, which disclosed learning disability (functional disorder) and pyramidal cell loss (organic defect) after 80 minutes of HCA despite recovery of somatic function, behavior, and growth.
