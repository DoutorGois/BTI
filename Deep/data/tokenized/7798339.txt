Pretreatment of the gerbil brain with a 2-min period of sublethal ischemia protects against neuronal damage following a subsequent 3-min period of ischemia, which normally destroys pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. To clarify the role of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in this ischemic tolerance, we immunohistochemically investigated the alterations in copper-zinc SOD (CuZnSOD) and manganese SOD (Mn-SOD) in the gerbil hippocampus following 3-min ischemia with or without the first mild ischemia. Normal hippocampus showed an intense CuZnSOD immunostaining in pyramidal neurons but relatively less MnSOD immunostaining. MnSOD, but not CuZnSOD, immunoreactivity increased after the first ischemia. Both CuZnSOD and MnSOD immunoreactivities decreased throughout the hippocampus 4 h after 3 min of ischemia both with and without the first ischemia. The immunostaining recovered in resistant regions (CA3 and dentate gyrus) after 1 day in both groups and in the pretreated CA1 after 2 days. Without pretreatment, however, the immunostaining never recovered in the vulnerable CA1 region. The results suggest that ischemic tolerance is induced in part by enhanced synthesis of MnSOD in the tolerance-acquired hippocampus. Both CuZnSOD and MnSOD immunoreactivities decreased after the second ischemia even in the pretreated hippocampus in the early reperfusion periods, but ischemic tolerance facilitated the recovery from the postischemic reductions in SOD immunoreactivity.
