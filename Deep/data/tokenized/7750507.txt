4-Aminopyridine, a voltage-dependent potassium channel blocker, causes tonic-clonic and electrographic seizures in vivo and evokes epileptiform activity and release of glutamate, aspartate and GABA in vitro. This study examined the effects of 4-aminopyridine (4AP) on de novo synthesis of neuroactive amino acids and a subsequent response to various anticonvulsant compounds (phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, valproate, ethosuximide, diazepam, lamotrigine, felbamate, losigamone, U54494A, CPP, MK801 and CNQX) using a hippocampal slice preparation. 4-Aminopyridine had a minimal effect on total tissue concentrations of glutamate, aspartate, and GABA, but caused a significant increase in their de novo synthesis. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, losigamone and U54494A were the only compounds which were effective in blocking the 4AP-induced increase in all newly synthesized amino acids. It appears that these compounds inhibit 4AP effects in this paradigm by blocking depolarization, probably at use-dependent voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Therefore, this paradigm may be useful in selectively identifying anticonvulsants which act by blocking depolarization.
