To determine the effect of suppression of epileptiform activity that develops after hypoxic-ischemic injury in the immature brain, chronically instrumented near-term fetal sheep (119-133 days) were subjected to 30 minutes of complete cerebral ischemia: 6 were given a 0.3-mg/kg bolus of MK-801 at 6 hours after the insult followed by continuous infusion of 1 mg/kg over the next 36 hours, and were compared to 6 control sheep. Electrocorticographic activity and edema within the parasagittal region of the cortex were quantified with real-time spectral analysis and impedance measurements, respectively. Histological outcome was assessed 72 hours later. The intense epileptiform activity seen from 9 +/- 2 to 30 +/- 3 hours in the control group was completely suppressed in the MK-801-treated group. The onset of secondary cortical edema was delayed from 9.4 +/- 1.1 hours to 14.8 +/- 0.7 hours (p < 0.01). Neuronal damage was reduced, particularly in the lateral cortex and hippocampus (p < 0.05). Infarction of the parasagittal cortex was not prevented. These results suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated epileptiform activity that develops after a global hypoxic-ischemic insult worsens neuronal outcome in the immature brain.
