INTRODUCTION: We studied the hippocampal region using Fluid Attenuation Inversion Recovery (Turbo-FLAIR) sequences to detect signal intensity abnormalities, and volumetric sequences to detect cortical thickness changes, in patients with drug-resistant temporal epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 30 patients with drug-resistant temporal epilepsy with a 1.5 Tesla unit (NT 15 Philips Gyroscan). Conventional SE, Turbo SE, IR, Turbo-FLAIR, volumetric 3D sequences on coronal plane, PD, T2-weighted SE sequences on axial plane, T1-weighted SE on sagittal plane were performed. Signal intensity and volumetric computerized measurements were obtained using the SUN system. RESULTS: Differences in signal intensity values between the two hippocampal regions were found in 18 patients with Turbo-FLAIR sequences. In 6 of these patients no significant differences in computerized evaluation of signal intensity were detected with either conventional or Turbo-SE sequences. Volumetric analysis showed hippocampal cortex thinning in 9 of 18 patients with hippocampal signal intensity abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Turbo-FLAIR were the best sequences for the detection of signal intensity changes in the hippocampal region. Such changes are strongly suggestive of hippocampal sclerosis, especially when associated with cortical atrophy.
