The prolonged maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation depends on de novo protein and RNA synthesis, indicating an involvement of altered gene expression in long-lasting plastic changes in synaptic efficacy. We have used an mRNA differential display technique to identify a set of genes that are induced by neural activity in the rat hippocampus. Sixteen independent cDNAs were isolated whose mRNA level was markedly modulated by convulsive seizure. One of these encodes Krox-20, a zinc finger DNA binding protein. High frequency tetanic stimulation of perforant pathway, which elicited a persistent long-term potentiation (>10 h), rapidly induced expression of krox-20 mRNA in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized rat. The increase in krox-20 mRNA was transient and NMDA receptor-dependent. These results suggest a role for krox-20 in the maintenance of long-term potentiation.
