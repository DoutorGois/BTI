Sampling and analysis programs are implemented on a microcomputer for the computation of autopower, coherence and phase spectra of unit train and EEG. Application to the hippocampus reveals that both theta and fast activity in the EEG are correlated with different phase relationships with unit activity. The estimate of coherence and phase spectra of unit-EEG relationship has not been reported before and is unique for the present method.
