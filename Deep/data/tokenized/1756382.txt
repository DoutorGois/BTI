The brain was transected in eight rats: the transection passed through the posterior pole of the superior colliculi and ended down at midhypothalamic level. The EEG activity in the dorsal hippocampus and cortex showed continuously slow, high amplitude waves. Thus the posterior hypothalamus is critical for the previously described hippocampal theta rhythm found in rats transected at the posthypothalamic level.
