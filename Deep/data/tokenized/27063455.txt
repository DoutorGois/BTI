We investigated the effects of ketamine on both the temporal and spatial profiles of neural precursor cells located in the hippocampus, and on antidepressant-like behaviors in rats. A single dose of ketamine resulted in a significant increase in the number of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine-positive (BrdU(+)) cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of rats at 24h, but not at 28days, after treatment completion. Ketamine caused antidepressant-like behaviors in the forced swim test (FST) and novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT). Viral-mediated hippocampal knockdown of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced depressive-like behaviors in the FST and NSFT, which were partially recovered by ketamine to the level observed in the control group. The behavioral effects of VEGF knock down were accompanied by a decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis, which was also partially recovered by ketamine. Our results suggest that basal hippocampal VEGF expression is necessary for ketamine-induced antidepressant-like behaviors in rats, but ketamine-induced VEGF expression only partially contributes to hippocampal neurogenesis and the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine.
