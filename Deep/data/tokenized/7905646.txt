Mossy fiber nerve endings were isolated from rat hippocampi and used to determine the effects of receptor activation on the production of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha). Glutamate and its agonists had no effect on PGF2 alpha synthesis. Similarly, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, histamine and purinergic receptor agonists did not affect PGF2 alpha accumulation in this preparation. However, norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine exerted receptor-mediated stimulations of PGF2 alpha production. The agonist-evoked increases in PGF2 alpha production were attenuated by phospholipase A2 inhibitors, L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ blockers and a K+ channel activator, but they were insensitive to tetrodotoxin. In addition, a kappa opioid agonist decreased PGF2 alpha synthesis in unstimulated and depolarized synaptosomes. It appeared, therefore, that certain receptor agonists were able to modulate PGF2 alpha synthesis in the hippocampal mossy fiber synaptosomal preparation.
