Several 1,4-disubstituted arylpiperazine derivatives of 3-arylideneindolin-2(1H)-one (Z and E isomers) were tested for their 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor activity in vitro and in vivo. It was shown that introduction of 3-arylidene substituents to indolin-2(1H)-one moiety allowed to change the mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT2A receptor ligands to 5-HT2A ones with antagonistic in vivo activity.
