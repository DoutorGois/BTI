Despite reports implicating disrupted purine metabolism in causing a wide spectrum of neurological defects, the mechanistic details of purine biosynthesis in neurons are largely unknown. As an initial step in filling that gap, we examined the expression and subcellular distribution of three purine biosynthesis enzymes (PFAS, PAICS and ATIC) in rat hippocampal neurons. Using immunoblotting and high-resolution light and electron microscopic analysis, we find that all three enzymes are broadly distributed in hippocampal neurons with pools of these enzymes associated with mitochondria. These findings suggest a potential link between purine metabolism and mitochondrial function in neurons and provide an impetus for further studies.
