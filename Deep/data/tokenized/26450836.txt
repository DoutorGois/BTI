A 9-year-old Golden Retriever dog was presented to the Veterinary Medical Center with a 3-week history of grand mal seizures and was subsequently euthanized. At autopsy, a discrete, firm, expansile mass was found in the right pyriform lobe, which compressed the ipsilateral hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Histologically, the mass was composed of well-differentiated adipose tissue supported by fibrous and mucinous stroma. Adipocytes exhibited strong immunoreactivity for vimentin and were negative for pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3), glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. These findings are most compatible with an intracranial lipomatous hamartoma, which is an extraparenchymal lesion that has been identified in several species. The current report describes an intracerebral lipomatous hamartoma in a veterinary species.
