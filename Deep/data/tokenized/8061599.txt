Time-resolved fluorometric monitoring of rapid changes in intracellular Ca(2+)-concentrations [Ca2+]i was employed to analyze the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on evoked Ca(2+)-signals in rat hippocampal synaptosomes. The inhibitory action of GABA was mimicked by Baclofen, the selective agonist for GABAB-receptors, and also by the nonhydrolyzable GTP-derivative GTP-gamma-S. Preincubation of synaptosomes with GABA or baclofen for up to 250 ms before depolarization resulted in a maximal inhibition. The GABA-induced attenuation of the evoked rise in [Ca2+]i was maximal during the first milliseconds after depolarization. The inhibitory action of GABA apparently does not involve second messengers, such as cAMP or IP3/DAG; the GABA-induced inhibition of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca(2+)-channels may be mediated directly by G-proteins.
