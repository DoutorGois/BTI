A methanolic extract of Agrimonia eupatoria (Rosaceae) significantly attenuated glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 hippocampal cells. A new flavonoid, characterized as kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-(2''-O-acetyl-6''-(E)-p-coumaroyl)-glucopyranoside (2''-acetyl-tiliroside (1), was isolated from the methanolic extract of A. eupatoria stems together with nine known flavonoids. Compounds 4, 7, 8 and 9 all showed a neuroprotective effect on glutamate-induced toxicity in HT22 cells.
