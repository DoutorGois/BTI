Extracellular concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) were determined by microdialysis in rat hippocampus during various amygdaloid kindled stages. The values of GABA and Glu were increased 3-4 times in C2-C3 stages in comparison with the values in control animals. After reaching the C5 stages, these values were increased 3-7 times. However, the concentration of Asp decreased depending on the kindling stage, reaching the lowest value of 33% in comparison with the normal value. The observed changes may be related to kindling induced seizures.
