Dendritic spines are small protrusions that receive synaptic signals in neuronal networks. The actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in regulating spine morphogenesis, as well as in the function of synapses. Here we report the first quantitative measurement of F-actin retrograde flow rate in dendritic filopodia, the precursor of dendritic spines, and in newly formed spines, using a technique based on photoactivation localization microscopy. We found a fast F-actin retrograde flow in the dendritic filopodia but not in the spine necks. The quantification of F-actin flow rates, combined with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements, allowed for a full quantification of spatially resolved kinetic rates of actin turnover, which was not previously feasible. Furthermore we provide evidences that myosin II regulates the actin flow in dendritic filopodia and translocates from the base to the tip of the protrusion upon spine formation. Rac1 inhibition led to mislocalization of myosin II, as well as to disruption of the F-actin flow. These results provide advances in the quantitative understanding of F-actin remodeling during spine formation.
