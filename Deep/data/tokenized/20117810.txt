INTRODUCTION: Patient H.M.'s recent death provides the opportunity to highlight the importance of his contribution to a better understanding of the anterograde amnesic syndrome. The thorough study of this patient over five decades largely contributed to shape the unitary model of declarative memory. This model holds that declarative memory is a single system that cannot be fractionated into subcomponents. As a system, it depends mainly on medial temporal lobes structures. The objective of this review is to present the main characteristics of different modular models that have been proposed as alternatives to the unitary model. It is also an opportunity to present different patients, who, although less famous than H.M., helped make signification contribution to the field of memory. STATE OF THE ART: The characteristics of the five main modular models are presented, including the most recent one (the perceptual-mnemonic model). The differences as well as how these models converge are highlighted. PERSPECTIVES: Different possibilities that could help reconcile unitary and modular approaches are considered. CONCLUSION: Although modular models differ significantly in many aspects, all converge to the notion that memory for single items and semantic memory could be dissociated from memory for complex material and context-rich episodes. In addition, these models converge concerning the involvement of critical brain structures for these stages: Item and semantic memory, as well as familiarity, are thought to largely depend on anterior subhippocampal areas, while relational, context-rich memory and recollective experiences are thought to largely depend on the hippocampal formation.
