Kainic acid induces seizures and a rapid induction of immediate early genes and neuronal death. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is implicated in seizure inhibiting activity. In order to investigate the mechanisms by which NPY inhibits seizure activity, this study was carried out to measure the levels of mRNAs encoding three different immediate early genes, in regions of the hippocampus and relate their induction to the behaviour in the same animals. NPY inhibited both the time spent in seizures, and the number of generalized seizures. However, NPY did not inhibit the induction of c-fos, FosB or junB mRNA in any hippocampal region examined in the same animals, showing lack of correlation between immediate early gene induction and seizure activity.
