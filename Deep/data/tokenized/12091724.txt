A synchrotron infrared (IR) beamline, U2B, dedicated to the biomedical and biological sciences has been constructed and is in operation at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory. The facility is operated by the Center for Synchrotron Biosciences of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in cooperation with the NSLS. Owing to the broadband nature of the synchrotron beam with brightness 1000 times that of conventional sources, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy experiments are feasible on diffraction-limited sample areas at high signal-to-noise ratios and with relatively short data-acquisition times. A number of synchrotron IR microscopy experiments that have been performed in the mid-IR spectral range (500-5000 cm(-1)) are summarized, including time-resolved protein-folding studies in the microsecond time regime, IR imaging of neurons, bone and other biological tissues, as well as imaging of samples of interest in the chemical and environmental sciences. Owing to the high flux output of this beamline in the far-IR region (50-500 cm(-1)), investigations of hydrogen bonding and dynamic molecular motions of biomolecules have been carried out from 10 to 300 K using a custom-made cryostat and an evacuated box. This facility is intended as an international resource for biological IR spectroscopy fully available to outside users based on competitive proposal.
