Microcontact printing, facilitated by silane linker chemistry and high-relief stamps, creates precise patterns of proteins, which in turn control growth of hippocampal neurons in culture. This additive, multi-mask technique permits several different molecules to be patterned on the same substrate. The covalent linker technology permits relatively long-term (two-week) compliance of neurons to the stamped pattern against a polyethylene glycol background. When polylysine was stamped adjacent to a laminin/polylysine mixture, neural somata and dendrites preferred the polylysine while axons prefer the mixture or the border between the two.
