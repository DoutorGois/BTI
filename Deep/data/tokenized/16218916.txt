OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to compare the distributions of three-repeat (3R) and four-repeat (4R) neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) with those of pretangles (p-NFT), intracellular NFT (i-NFT), and extracellular NFT (e-NFT) in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease brains. METHODS: NFT labeling was performed using anti-tau antibodies: pSer262 for p-NFT, pSer422 for i-NFT, AT8 for e-NFT, RD3 for 3R, and RD4 for 4R tau, and Gallyas impregnation for the NFT population. RD4- and pSer422-positive NFT were detected predominantly in sectors from CA2 to CA4, while RD3- and pSer262-positive NFT were predominantly present in CA1, the entorhinal cortex, and the subiculum. The tau epitope recognized by pSer262 belongs to 4R tau but it showed a strong correlation with RD3- and AT8-positive NFT. CONCLUSIONS: Sectors CA2-CA4 showed predominantly 4R-NFT containing the pSer422 epitope. pSer262 may detect the process of transformation from p-NFT to i-NFT, and e-NFT consisted predominantly of 3R tau.
