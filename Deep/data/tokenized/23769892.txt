Maternal deprivation has been associated with physiological and developmental changes that may be related to an increased risk for childhood and adult neuropsychiatric diseases. A growing number of studies demonstrated the importance of childhood experiences in the development of psychosis and schizophrenia in adulthood. Therefore, the present study investigated different behavior responses in rats following maternal deprivation and/or ketamine treatment in adulthood. Male rats were subjected to maternal deprivation for 180 min from postnatal day-01 to postnatal day-10. We evaluated locomotor activity, avoidance task and social interaction of adult male rats deprived or not deprived that were administered with saline or acute subanesthetic doses of ketamine (5, 15 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.). Our results show that only ketamine (25 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment in the adult rats lead to hyperlocomotion but not ketamine (5 and 15 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation alone. However, maternally deprived rats treated with ketamine (5 mg/kg) induced hyperlocomotion. Additionally, ketamine (25 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation alone induced cognitive deficit in the avoidance task. Rats deprived of and treated with ketamine (5, 15 and 25 mg/kg) also lead to memory deficit. Moreover, ketamine (25 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation alone increased latency to start social behavior. However, ketamine (5 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation lead to an increase of latency to start social behavior. Biochemistry data showed that all doses of ketamine and ketamine plus maternal deprivation increased the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. The major doses of ketamine associated with maternal deprivation induced a major increase of AChE activity. Together, our results suggest that animals subjected to maternal deprivation had an increased risk for schizophrenia-like behavior and cholinergic alteration.
