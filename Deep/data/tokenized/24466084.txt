Binswanger's disease (BD) is a common cause of vascular dementia in elderly patients; however, few studies have investigated the medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy in BD, and the differences in the atrophic patterns between BD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely unknown. Such knowledge is essential for understanding the pathologic basis of dementia. In this study, we collected structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 16 normal controls, 14 patients with AD and 14 patients with BD. The volumes of the hippocampus and amygdala, and morphologic parameters (volume, surface area, cortical thickness and mean curvature) of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC) were calculated using an automated approach. Volume reduction of the hippocampus, amygdala and ERC, and disturbance of the PRC curvature was found in both AD and BD patients compared with the controls (p<0.05, uncorrected). There were no significant differences among all the structural measures between the AD and BD patients. Finally, partial correlation analyses revealed that cognitive decline could be attributed to ERC thinning in AD and volume reduction of PRC in BD. We conclude that AD and BD exhibit similar atrophy patterns in the medial temporal cortices and deep gray matter but have distinct pathologic bases for cognitive impairments. Although atrophy of the MTL structures is a sensitive biomarker for AD, it is not superior for discrimination between AD and BD.
