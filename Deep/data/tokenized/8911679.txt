Transient forebrain ischaemia was induced by a two-vessel occlusion method in the domestic chick. One week post-surgery, hippocampal tissue was processed for electron microscopy and synapse density assessed using the disector technique. Hippocampal volume was estimated using image analysis of serial coronal cryostat sections. The density of asymmetric synapses was significantly reduced (27%; P < 0.005) in ischaemic chicks. This appears to be a real reduction as hippocampal volume was not significantly decreased.
