A wide variety of cell types respond to electric fields in culture. Despite evidence for electric fields existing in the mammalian embryo, there are few studies testing the effects electric fields exert on neurons from the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The present study demonstrates orientation responses to focally applied electric fields of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons isolated in culture. The most striking result from this study is that different growth cones of the same neuron can show differential responsiveness to focally applied electric fields: growth cones on the short, straight processes that are destined to become dendrites, oriented toward the cathode, whereas growth cones on the longest process, the presumptive axon, did not orient. The present experiments bring a significant increase in resolution to the study of neuronal growth cone orientation by applied electric fields: a novel examination of the early events leading to orientation. Growth cones on dendrites displayed a spectrum of orientation responses: directed lamellipodial extension, directed filopodial extension and/or reorientation, cytoplasmic swelling of existing filopodia, consolidation of filopodia, and rapid elongation of the entire process. Individual growth cones displayed only one or two of these responses. Additionally, not all growth cones on these short processes sustained their initial orientation response: 35% adapted within 6 min.
