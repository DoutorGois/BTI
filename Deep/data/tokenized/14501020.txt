Calpains modulate processes that govern the function and metabolism of proteins key to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, including tau and amyloid precursor protein. Because activation of the calpain system might contribute to the impairment of synaptic transmission in Alzheimer's disease, we are currently testing the hypotheses that a treatment with calpain inhibitors might restore normal cognition and synaptic transmission in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease, the APP (K670N:M671L)/PS1(M146L) mouse. Findings derived from these studies will provide a novel approach to cognitive enhancement in Alzheimer's disease.
