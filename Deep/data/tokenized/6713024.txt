The impulsive activity of hippocampal neurons during the elaboration and specialisation of switching of the alimentary and defensive classical conditioned reflexes has been studied. The associative changes of the phasic and tonic neurons activity have been shown to be the neurophysiological background of the tonic and phasic mechanisms ensuring the conditioned switching. The differences between the tonic activity and the neuron response to the conditioned stimulus during different conditioned activity have been established. The difference of the neuronal activity to the conditioned stimulus during the change of its signal meaning is due to a great extend of the tonic activity. Motivation is supposed to play a leading role in the changing of the neurons activity under the conditioned switching.
