Cajal-Retzius cell is the prominent neuron of layer I of the cortex, playing a crucial role in cellular development and neuronal circuit formation, by secretion of reelin. In early cases of Alzheimer's disease the morphological and morphometric study of layer I of the temporal isocortex, based on silver impregnation techniques and electron microscopy, revealed a dramatic decline of the number of Cajal-Retzius cells. Because Cajal-Retzius cells and reelin are important factors for the synaptogenesis in the hippocampus and the brain isocortex, their loss may be implicated in the synaptic pathology and the multifactorious pathogenetic pathways of Alzheimer's disease.
