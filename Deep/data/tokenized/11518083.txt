Therapeutic uses of Hypericum extracts have been demonstrated as safe and effective in treating mild to moderate depression in numerous clinical trials. To date, however, no definitive statements on their mode of action can be made, and little information on their electrophysiological effects is available. The present communication summarises the results of our efforts directed towards clarifying the effects of an ethanolic Hypericum extract (HYP) and its hydrosoluble fraction (HYPWS), and two of its constituents hypericin and hyperforin on electrically evoked population spikes in guinea pig hippocampal slices. In higher concentrations (>10 microM), the two extract constituents tested revealed inhibitory effects only, whereas concentration-dependent (between 10(-6) to 10(-4) g/l) excitatory effects were observed for HYP and HYPWS. The excitatory effects were strongly amplified by the GABA(B) antagonist phaclofen, whereas the effects of bicucullin, a GABA(A) antagonist, were marginal. The excitations were completely blocked by the AMPA antagonist CNQX, but not by the NMDA antagonists APV and MK801 or the L-type calcium-channel blocker verapamil. This kind of excitatory effect on the hippocampus is unknown in other antidepressants and; indeed, many of the latter reduce neuronal excitability. We conclude, therefore, that the mechanisms involved in the antidepressant activity of Hypericum extracts are different from those of conventional antidepressants, and that identifying their excitatory components may facilitate their more rational standardisation.
