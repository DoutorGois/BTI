BACKGROUND: The propagation of amygdala-kindled seizures to the dorsal and ventral hippocampus was examined, in rats. The relation of contralateral seizure propagation to the onset of generalized convulsions was also studied. METHODS: In all subjects, electrodes were implanted in the amygdala. Two additional electrodes were implanted (bilaterally) in the dorsal (n = 6) or ventral (n = 8) hippocampus. Kindling stimulations were delivered twice daily (interval 4 h). RESULTS: Initially, triggered after-discharges (ADs) were recorded only in the amygdala. With repeated stimulation, the AD propagated to the hippocampus. Rates of propagation were as follows (mean # of stimulations +/- SEM): ipsilateral ventral hippocampus, 4.0 +/- 0.9; ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus, 6.2 +/- 1.4; contralateral dorsal hippocampus, 7.5 +/- 1.4; contralateral ventral hippocampus, 8.5 +/- 1.0. AD propagation to contralateral sites was significantly slower than to ipsilateral sites. Ipsilateral hippocampal recruitment occurred between stages 1 and 2 (partial seizures), whereas contralateral hippocampal recruitment occurred between stages 2 and 3 (transition to generalized seizures). SUMMARY: These results indicate that during amygdala-kindling, it takes several stimulations before discharge propagates to the hippocampus. The close link between contralateral hippocampus involvement and seizure generalization warrants further study, and may lead to a better understanding of the pathways involved in seizure spread.
