AIM: Orexins/hypocretins (OX/Hcrt) are hypothalamic neuropeptides linking sleep-wakefulness, appetite and neuroendocrine control. Their role and mechanisms of action on higher brain functions, such as learning and memory, are not clear. METHODS: We used field recordings of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP) in acute mouse brain slice preparations to study the effects of orexins and pharmacological inhibitors of multiple kinases on long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. RESULTS: Orexin-A (OX-A) but not orexin-B (OX-B) induces a state-dependent long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission (LTP(OX)) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices from adult (8- to 12-week-old) mice. In contrast, OX-A applied to slices from juvenile (3- to 4-week-old) animals causes a long-term depression (LTD(OX)) in the same pathway. LTP(OX) is blocked by pharmacological inhibition of orexin receptor-1 (OX1R) and plasticity-related kinases, including serine/threonine- (CaMKII, PKC, PKA, MAPK), lipid- (PI3K), and receptor tyrosine kinases (Trk). Inhibition of OX1R, CaMKII, PKC, PKA and Trk unmasks LTD(OX) in adult animals. CONCLUSION: Orexins control not only the bistability of arousal states and threshold for appetitive behaviours but, in an age- and kinase-dependent manner, also bidirectional long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, providing a possible link between behavioural state and memory functions.
