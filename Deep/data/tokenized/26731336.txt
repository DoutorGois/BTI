Excitotoxicity was originally postulated to be a late stage side effect of Alzheimers disease (AD)-related neurodegeneration, however more recent studies indicate that it may occur early in AD and contribute to the neurodegenerative process. Tau and amyloid beta (Abeta), the main components of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid plaques, have been implicated in cooperatively and independently facilitating excitotoxicity. Our study investigated the roles of tau and Abeta in AD-related excitotoxicity. In vivo studies showed that tau knockout (tau(-/-)) mice were significantly protected from seizures and hippocampal superoxide production induced with the glutamate analog, kainic acid (KA). We hypothesized that tau accomplished this by facilitating KA-induced Ca(2+) influx into neurons, however lentiviral tau knockdown failed to ameliorate KA-induced Ca(2+) influx into primary rat cortical neurons. We further investigated if tau cooperated with Abeta to facilitate KA-induced Ca(2+) influx. While Abeta biphasically modulated the KA-induced Cacyt(2+) responses, tau knockdown continued to have no effect. Therefore, tau facilitates KA-induced seizures and superoxide production in a manner that does not involve facilitation of Ca(2+) influx through KA receptors (KAR). On the other hand, acute pretreatment with Abeta (10 min) enhanced KA-induced Ca(2+) influx, while chronic Abeta (24 h) significantly reduced it, regardless of tau knockdown. Given previously published connections between Abeta, group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and KAR regulation, we hypothesized that Abeta modulates KAR via a G-protein coupled receptor pathway mediated by group 1 mGluRs. We found that Abeta did not activate group 1 mGluRs and inhibition of these receptors did not reverse Abeta modulation of KA-induced Ca(2+) influx. Therefore, Abeta biphasically regulates KAR via a mechanism that does not involve group 1mGluR activation.
