A digoxigenin-labeled antisense 42-mer oligonucleotide was used for the localization of the dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in the rat brain. The digoxigenin label was identified with alkaline phosphatase conjugated sheep-anti-digoxigenin. In good analogy with the known terminal fields of the dopaminergic system, various nuclei throughout the brain were labeled. Positive in situ hybridization signals were also found in dopamine cell groups of the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area and in regions where a dopaminergic innervation is controversial, like the cerebellar cortex and the hippocampus. The non-radioactive in situ hybridization procedure described, shows the localization of the dopamine D2 receptor mRNA with a very high contrast and an optimal histological resolution.
