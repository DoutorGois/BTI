On 50 brains of newborns of either sex, the exterior and interior morphology was studied. The exterior morphology of the brain was conformable to the configuration of the skull. The insula is relatively large, but extremely inadequately grooved. The subcortical masses are well pronounced but there is in general a very slight difference between the white and gray matter of the brain. The convolutions and grooves of the cerebellum are very distinctly marked, the nucleus dentatus is large and white matter is prevalent. The brain stem is rather well formed, distinctly plastic, this being particularly true for the region of the rhomboid fossa and medulla oblongata.
