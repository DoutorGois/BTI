The distribution and development of type A and type B monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities in the hippocampal region of the rat was investigated with biochemical microdetermination. Type A MAO is absolutely dominant and unevenly distributed in the hippocampus. The development of type A MAO in the hippocampus seems to be delayed and reachs adult levels by the 30th day after birth.
