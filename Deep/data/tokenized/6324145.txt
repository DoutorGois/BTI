Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor binding levels were compared between groups of genetically obese (fa/fa) and non-obese (Fa/-) Zucker rats of both sexes. The radioligand used was the iodinated octapeptide (CCK-8). Binding was measured in eight brain regions. The relative distribution among different brain regions of specifically bound CCK per mg protein was similar in all groups of animals. High binding levels were present in the olfactory bulb, cortex and caudate nucleus. Moderate levels were seen in hippocampus and hypothalamus, and low levels were observed in hindbrain, midbrain and thalamus. Obese animals of both sexes had significantly higher CCK receptor binding levels in the hippocampus and in the midbrain in comparison to lean controls. The male obese animals also had significantly elevated binding levels in the thalamic sample. These results demonstrate a correlation between genetic obesity and elevated CCK receptor binding levels in specific brain regions.
