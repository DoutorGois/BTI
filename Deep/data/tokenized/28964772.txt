Neurofilaments are a major component of the axonal cytoskeleton in neurons and have been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases due to their presence within characteristic pathological inclusions. Their contributions to these diseases are not yet fully understood, but previous studies investigated the effects of ablating the obligate subunit of neurofilaments, low molecular mass neurofilament subunit (NFL), on disease phenotypes in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy. Here, we tested the effects of ablating NFL in alpha-synuclein M83 transgenic mice expressing the human pathogenic A53T mutation, by breeding them onto an NFL null background. The induction and spread of alpha-synuclein inclusion pathology was triggered by the injection of preformed alpha-synuclein fibrils into the gastrocnemius muscle or hippocampus in M83 versus M83/NFL null mice. We observed no difference in the post-injection time to motor-impairment and paralysis endpoint or amount and distribution of alpha-synuclein inclusion pathology in the muscle injected M83 and M83/NFL null mice. Hippocampal injected M83/NFL null mice displayed subtle region-specific differences in the amount of alpha-synuclein inclusions however, pathology was observed in the same regions as the M83 mice. Overall, we observed only minor differences in the induction and transmission of alpha-synuclein pathology in these induced models of synucleinopathy in the presence or absence of NFL. This suggests that NFL and neurofilaments do not play a major role in influencing the induction and transmission of alpha-synuclein aggregation.
