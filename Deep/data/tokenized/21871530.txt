RATIONALE: Some investigations have shown that the glutamate receptors play a critical role in cognitive processes such as learning and anxiety. OBJECTIVES: The possible involvement of the cholinergic system of the dorsal hippocampus in the anxiolytic-like response induced by MK-801, NMDA receptor antagonist, was investigated in the present study. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were used in the elevated plus maze apparatus to test the parameters: open arm time (%OAT), open arm entries (%OAE), close arm time (%CAT), close arm entries (%CAE) and other exploratory behaviors (locomotor activity, grooming, rearing and defecation) of anxiety-like response. RESULTS: The data indicated that intra-CA1 administration of MK-801 increased %OAT (2mug/rat) and %OAE (1 and 2mug/rat) while decreased %CAT and %CAE and did not alter other exploratory behaviors, indicating an anxiolytic-like effect. Moreover, intra-hippocampal injections of mecamylamine, a cholinergic receptor antagonists (2mug/rat) and scopolamine (4mug/rat), by themselves, 5min before testing, increased %OAT and %OAE but decreased %CAT and %CAE and did not alter locomotor activity and other exploratory behaviors, suggesting an anxiolytic-like effect. On the other hand, intra-CA1 co-administration of an ineffective dose of scopolamine (3mug/rat), but not mecamylamine (1mug/rat), with an ineffective dose of MK-801 (0.5mug/rat) increased %OAT and %OAE and decreased %CAT and %CAE. The data may indicate the possible involvement of the cholinergic system of the CA1 in the anxiolytic-like response induced by MK-801.
