Tremor rat (tm/tm), the parent strain of spontaneously epileptic rat (SER: zi/zi, tm/tm), exhibits absence-like seizures characterized by 5-7 Hz spike-wave-like complexes on cortical and hippocampal electroencephalograms (EEG) after 10 weeks of age, prior to development of convulsive seizures. Recently, this animal model has been demonstrated to display a genomic microdeletion within the critical region of tm, where aspartoacylase hydrolyzing N-acetyl-L aspartate (NAA) is located, besides showing the ability to accumulate NAA in the brain. Therefore, the present study was performed to determine the involvement of NAA in the induction of epileptic seizures. When NAA (4 micromol) was applied intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) to normal Wistar rats, 4-10 Hz polyspikes and/or spike-wave-like complexes followed by absence-like seizure before persistent 1-5 Hz waxing high-voltage after-discharges were observed on cortical and hippocampal EEG. At a higher dose (8 micromol), NAA induced convulsive seizures. The absence-like seizures with polyspikes and/or spike-wave-like complexes on the EEG were also observed with i.c.v. NAA in premature tremor rats without seizures. The NAA-induced seizures in normal rats were antagonized by i.c.v. glutamic acid diethyl ester, a non-selective glutamate receptor antagonist. In addition, NAA applied to the bath rapidly induced a long-lasting depolarization concomitantly with repetitive firings in hippocampal CA3 neurons of normal rat brain slice preparations. These findings suggest that NAA is involved in the induction of absence-like seizures and/or convulsion, probably via glutamate receptors.
