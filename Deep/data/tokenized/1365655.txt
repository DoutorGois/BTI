Long-term effects of chronic treatment with a GABA-T (GABA-transaminase) inhibitor, ethanolamine O-sulphate (EOS) (200 mg/kg/day for the postnatal days 3-21) on the binding parameters of GABAA receptors, hypothalamic monoamines and subsequent behavior were studied in Wistar rats. At the age of 1 month, EOS-treated rats showed reduced activity in the open-field and, at the age of 4 months, their voluntary alcohol consumption was increased. No changes were seen in Porsolt's swim test or in the plus-maze test. Weight gain was significantly retarded in EOS-treated rats. Maximal stimulation of [3H] flunitrazepam binding by GABA was decreased in the cerebral cortex and the EC50-value for the GABA stimulation increased in the hippocampus in the EOS rats at the age of 4 months. EOS treatment did not alter the cerebellar diazepam sensitive and insensitive binding components of the imidazobenzodiazepine [3H]Ro 15-4513. No changes were observed in the hypothalamic monoamine concentrations. The results are in agreement with the idea that GABA-T inhibitor treatment permanently alters GABAA mechanisms. Moreover, altering the CNS GABA level during development increases adult alcohol intake in rat.
