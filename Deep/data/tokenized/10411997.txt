The effects of a newly synthesized cognitive enhancer, (-)-R-alpha-[[2-(diethylamino) ethoxy] methyl] benzo [b] thiophene-5-methanol hydrochloride (T-588), on the membrane properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons were investigated in a rat brain slice preparation. T-588 produced a slow and long-lasting depolarization of CA1 neurons with an increase in membrane resistance; this action showed close similarity to that of acetylcholine (ACh). However, the action of T-588 was not affected by atropine, tetrodotoxin or DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, while the action of ACh was blocked by atropine. The estimated reversal potential of this T-588 effect was near -90 mV which is the reversal potential of potassium ions in CA1 neurons. In the whole-cell voltage-clamp study, T-588 produced a reversible block of the outward potassium current in CA1 neurons. T-588 did not block the afterhyperpolarization evoked by an intracellular current injection, while ACh suppressed it. These results suggest that T-588 has a direct effect on CA1 neurons independent of its cholinergic activity, resulting from blockade of a conductance carried predominantly by potassium ions.
