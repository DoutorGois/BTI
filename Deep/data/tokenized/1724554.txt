The contents of monoamines and their metabolites in rat brains 3 hours after the intracerebroventricular injection of 6 mumol of 2-guanidino-ethanol (GEt) were measured by HPLC. GEt which is a configurational analogue of 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA) induced severe running fits and tonic-clonic convulsions as well as epileptic discharges. In GEt-administered rats, dopamine (DA) decreased in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) increased to about the same level in all brain regions, therefore the distribution of DOPAC appeared to be homogeneous in the brain. The homovanillic acid levels also increased in the striatum and hippocampus. No significant change in the norepinephrine contents was observed in any region. The turnover ratio of DA increased significantly except in the striatum. Serotonin levels increased in the hypothalamus and midbrain by GEt administration, though 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels showed no change in any of the brain regions. These data suggest that the activity of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons are increased by GEt.
