The effects of postnatal development and aging on the concentration of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and their principle metabolites have been studied in the hippocampus of the rat. During development the concentration of dopamine increases 1.5 fold during the first 90 days. 3-methoxytyramine was found in low concentrations. The homovanillic acid and DOPAC concentrations showed no changes apart from a decrease at day 15 and an increase at day 8, respectively. From birth up to 30 months, the noradrenaline concentration increased by a factor of about 10. Their metabolites each showed a different profile. The concentration of tryptophan was always the highest among the compounds studied. It decreased from birth to day 15, while the concentration of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid increased 3 and 5 fold respectively during this time. However, 5-hydroxytryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophol concentrations were very low and unchanged at all stages. These findings led to the conclusion that the neurotransmitters: noradrenaline and serotonin, are developed in the hippocampus during the first three months. During aging, the serotonin concentration is increased without significant change in the other compounds studied.
