Phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, stimulated by 1S,3R-1-amino-cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), an agonist of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), was measured in hippocampal and prefrontal cortical slices obtained from rats which had been trained for 8 days in a Morris water maze and had learned an allocentric spatial task. Brain slices were pre-labeled with myo-3H-inositol and 1S,3R-ACPD (100 microM) stimulation was assessed by measuring the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]IPs) in the presence of Li+. Measurements conducted 24 h following the last training session revealed no differences in 1S,3R-ACPD-stimulated formation of [3H]IPs, either in the hippocampus or in the prefrontal cortex. However, a diminished response to mGluRs stimulation was detected in the hippocampus of animals re-trained after an 11-day interval. The decrease was not evident in the prefrontal cortex. These data indicate a differential involvement of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex in the processing of spatial information and correspond to the functional differences attributed to these areas.
