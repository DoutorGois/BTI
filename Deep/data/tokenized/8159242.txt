Dual intracellular recordings from microscopically identified neurons in the hippocampus reveal that the synaptic terminals of three morphologically distinct types of interneuron act through GABAA receptors. Each type of interneuron forms up to 12 synaptic contacts with a postsynaptic principal neuron, but each interneuron innervates a different domain of the surface of the postsynaptic neuron. Different kinetics of the postsynaptic effects, together with the strategic placement of synapses, indicate that these GABAergic interneurons serve distinct functions in the cortical network.
