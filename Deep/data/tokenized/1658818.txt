The chronic administration of alpha-methylparatyrosine (AMT) caused a reduction of the noradrenaline levels in the hippocampus (at 150 and 300 mg/kg/day) and in the subcortex (at 30, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day). The acetylcholine levels were reduced in the hippocampus and in the olfactory brain at all the tested doses of AMT. An increase of the Bmax of muscarinic and alpha 1-adrenoceptors was observed at 30 mg/kg/day of AMT; only in the subcortex AMT caused no modification of the density of muscarinic receptors. The degree of increase of the receptors density at 30 mg/kg/day was reduced at the higher doses of AMT. AMT 30 mg/kg/day caused a reduction of the errors in the staircase maze after 20 days of interruption of the daily training. These results might suggest a correlation between the behavioral effect and the increase of density, not only of the adrenoceptors, but also of the muscarinic receptors. It is proposed that the behavioral effects caused by chronic AMT are the consequence of complex neurochemical interactions.
