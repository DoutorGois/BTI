To determine the possible role of cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase pathway in the regulation of proenkephalin (proENK) and prodynorphin (proDYN) gene expression induced by kainic acid (KA) in rat hippocampus, the effects of esculetin, aspirin, or phenidone on the seizure activity, proENK and proDYN mRNA levels, and the level of fos-related antigene (Fra) protein induced by KA in rat hippocampus were studied. Esculetin (5 mg/kg), aspirin (15 mg/kg), or phenidone (50 mg/kg) was administered orally five times every 12 h before the injection of KA (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Seizure activity induced by KA was significantly attenuated by phenidone. However, neither esculetin nor aspirin affected KA-induced seizure activity. The proENK and proDYN mRNA levels were markedly increased 4 and 24 h after KA administration. The elevations of both proENK and proDYN mRNA levels induced by KA were inhibited by pre-administration with phenidone, but not with esculetin and aspirin. ProENK-like protein level increased by KA administration was also inhibited by pre-administration with phenidone, but not with esculetin and aspirin. The increases of proENK and proDYN mRNA levels induced by KA were well correlated with the increases of Fra protein level. Additionally, the induction of Fra protein was inhibited by pre-administration with phenidone, but not with esculetin and aspirin. The results suggest that blockade of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways appears to be responsible for increases of proENK and proDYN mRNA levels induced by KA via inhibiting the induction of Fra protein in rat hippocampus.
