Previous studies have demonstrated that in the hippocampus the maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) requires de novo protein synthesis. To investigate the role of protein synthesis in the maintenance of LTP of C-fiber evoked field potentials in spinal dorsal horn, which may be relevant to hyperalgesia, protein synthesis inhibitor (either cycloheximide or anisomycin) was applied locally to the recording segments of spinal cord in anesthetized rats, 30 min prior to tetanic stimulation to the sciatic nerve. We found that both cycloheximide and anisomycin selectively inhibited late-phase maintenance of the spinal LTP but affected neither LTP induction nor baseline responses of C-fiber evoked field potentials. In the presence of cycloheximide, LTP of C-fiber evoked field potentials was 281.5 +/- 16.5% (n = 6) of baseline 1 h after tetanic stimulation and the potentiation significantly decreased to 235.5 +/- 18.5% at 145 min after tetanic stimulation (P < 0.05). Afterward, LTP of C-fiber evoked field potentials decreased continuously and at 270 min after tetanic stimulation reached 130.8 +/- 18.0%, which was no longer different from baseline (P > 0.05). Spinal application of anisomycin at 30 min before tetanic stimulation yielded similar results (n = 6). These results suggest that protein synthesis may be crucial for the late-phase maintenance of LTP of C-fiber evoked field potentials in spinal dorsal horn.
