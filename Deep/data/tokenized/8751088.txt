It has been reported previously that delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol and the synthetic cannabinoid agonist HU-210 [(--)-11-OH-delta 8-dimethylheptyl tetrahydrocannabinol] prevent long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in rat hippocampal slices. In this study we confirm that both WIN55212-2 inverted question markR-(+)-(2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[ inverted question mark4-morpholinyl inverted question mark methyl] pyrol [1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl) (1-naphtalenyl) methanone monomethanesulphonate inverted question mark (3 and 10 microM), another synthetic cannabinoid agonist, and anandamide (10 microM), considered to be the endogenous ligand of cannabinoid receptors, inhibit LTP formation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 field complex. In addition, we show that SR141716A [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4- methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride] at 0.1-10 microM, a potent and selective antagonist of CB1 cannabinoid receptors, concentration-dependently reversed the inhibition of LTP induced by both WIN55212-2 and anandamide. These data indicate that cannabinoid receptor agonists inhibit hippocampal LTP formation through CB1 receptor activation and that anandamide could be a candidate for an endogenous neuromessenger involved in memory processes.
