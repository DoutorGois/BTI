The theory of phase resetting can reveal important information about the dynamic behavior of a periodic system when a single brief stimulus is applied to that system at the appropriate time. Phase resetting studies have revealed the existence in some biological systems of a vulnerable stimulus window generating desynchronization and suppression of the activity. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a "singular" stimulus could annihilate this activity. Perfusion with the high-K solution produced synchronous, quasi-periodic population bursts with inter-burst interval of ~0.8-1.5 seconds. A single 0.1 ms duration anodic pulse of programmable delay and magnitude was applied to the somatic layer of the CA3 pyramidal cells. Three types of phase-resetting behavior were observed: (1) Weak resetting with little or no effect on the timing of the subsequent burst, (2) Strong resetting where the applied current pulse delayed the next event by one time period, (3) Singular behavior where the applied pulse partially or completely suppressed the subsequent bursting. The singular stimulus parameter window, however, was very narrow making it difficult to generate the singular behavior reliably. Nevertheless, the results indicate that singularities exist for high potassium neural activity and that a well timed pulse applied with the right amplitude can suppress this activity. This study suggests that phase resetting of a population of neurons is possible for quasi-periodic interictal activity and similar techniques could be applied to the control of epileptic seizures.
