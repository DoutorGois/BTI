In thin sections of the rat hippocampus, gap junctions were observed between dendrites of non-pyramidal cells in the stratum radiatum and the stratum oriens in CA1 and CA3 regions. Gap junctions were seen on dendritic shafts, sessile and/or pedunculated spine-like appendages, and on varicose parts of dendrites.
