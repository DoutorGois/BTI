Prenatal irradiation is known to damage the developing brain. However, little is known about the consequences of very low dose rate prenatal protracted irradiation over several days on neuron numbers in the offspring brain, and on volumes of the corresponding brain regions. Pregnant Wistar rats were exposed either to a protracted gamma irradiation from embryonic day (E) 13 to E16 (0.7 mGy/min; total cumulative dose approximately 3 Gy) or were sham-irradiated. Thirty months old male and female offspring were then analyzed for alterations in hippocampal and cerebellar morphology. Using design-based stereology and the analysis of sets of sections systematically and randomly sampled to span the entire brain region of interest, a statistically significant decrease in numbers of hippocampal pyramidal and granule cells as well as of cerebellar Purkinje and granule cells (approximately 50%) was found in male and female irradiated offspring. The volumes of these brain regions were comparably altered. The analysis of only a "representative" section per animal yielded mostly non-significant trends. Evaluation of neuron densities showed no differences between prenatally irradiated and sham-irradiated offspring. Most importantly, very low dose rate prenatal protracted gamma irradiation did not result in the same morphologic alterations in the offspring brain as previously observed after prenatal single irradiation such as derangement of the laminar structure of pyramidal cells within the hippocampus or malformation of cerebellar lobules.
