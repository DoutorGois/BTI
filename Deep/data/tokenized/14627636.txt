The presence of Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate (Ca-A/K) channels on hippocampal pyramidal neurons (HPNs) has been controversial, although they are present on many forebrain GABAergic neurons. We combined high-resolution fluorescence Ca2+ imaging with surface AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit immunocytochemistry to examine the expression of functional Ca-A/K channels in dissociated hippocampal neurons at the subcellular level. In GABAergic neurons [identified by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunocytochemistry], focal application of AMPA induced large dendrosomatic intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) rises, consistent with their known strong Ca-A/K channel expression. Surface immunostaining for the AMPAR subunits GluR1 and GluR2 revealed abundant dendritic GluR1 puncta containing little or no GluR2, which, when present, was limited to diffuse staining in the soma and proximal dendrites. In contrast, the majority of HPNs (putatively identified by morphological criteria and lack of GAD labeling) showed little or no AMPA-induced [Ca2+]i rise. Correspondingly, most HPNs showed strong dendritic labeling for both GluR1 and GluR2 that colocalized extensively. A subpopulation of HPNs, however, displayed noticeable [Ca2+]i rises that began and often reached their highest levels in discrete dendritic regions. In these HPNs, levels of GluR1 relative to GluR2 were higher, and GluR1 was often present without overlying GluR2. The present studies, which are the first to directly examine the relationship between the local complement of cell surface AMPAR and the presence of dendritic Ca-A/K channels, clearly indicate that considerable cell surface GluR2 does not preclude the presence of Ca-A/K channels and further show that HPNs display considerable heterogeneity in terms of apparent Ca-A/K channel expression.
