X-ray fluorescence microscopy was applied for topographic and quantitative elemental analysis within the areas of the rat brain that undergo neurodegenerative changes in consequence of pilocarpine-induced seizures. Significant changes in levels of selected elements were observed in epileptic animals. They included an increased tissue content of Ca in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and in the cerebral cortex. The opposite relation was observed for the Cu level in the dentate gyrus and for Zn in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and in the dentate gyrus.
