The dentate gyrus plays critical roles both in cognitive processing, and in regulation of the induction and propagation of pathological activity. The cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying these diverse functions overlap extensively. At the cellular level, the intrinsic properties of dentate granule cells combine to endow these neurons with a fundamental reluctance to activate, one of their hallmark traits. At the circuit level, the dentate gyrus constitutes one of the more heavily inhibited regions of the brain, with strong, fast feedforward and feedback GABAergic inhibition dominating responses to afferent activation. In pathologic states such as epilepsy, a number of alterations within the dentate gyrus combine to compromise the regulatory properties of this circuit, culminating in a collapse of its normal function. This epilepsy-associated transformation in the fundamental properties of this critical regulatory hippocampal circuit may contribute both to seizure propensity, and cognitive and emotional comorbidities characteristic of this disease state.
