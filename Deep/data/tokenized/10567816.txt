A reliable, sensitive and specific sandwich ELISA for the quantitation of paired helical filament (PHF) tau in human brain was developed using well-defined monoclonal antibodies. We examined rapid-autopsy-derived brain tissue from 21 neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 14 nondemented controls, matched for age, sex and postmortem delay times. We demonstrated significant elevations of phosphorylated tau levels in the frontal and parietal cortex as well as in the hippocampus of AD patients as compared to the nondemented controls. No difference was observed in the cerebellum. Phosphorylated tau levels measured by ELISA were significantly correlated with the presence or absence of neurofibrillary tangles.
