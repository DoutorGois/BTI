The effect of zinc on the development and evolution of quinolinic acid-induced alterations in the rat hippocampus in culture was studied ultrastructurally. Zinc, although it possesses intrinsic cytotoxic properties, after application in concentrations comparable with those encountered in vivo, was able to prevent typically observed responses after quinolinic acid exposure, either early or late damage to hippocampal neurons. The results further support the concept of a potential protective effect of zinc against the neurotoxicity of particular excitotoxins.
