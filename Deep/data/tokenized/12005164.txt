Here we describe a computer-assisted method which, based on conventional transmission electron microscopy, renders simulated high-voltage electron micrographs. We perform arithmetic minimum filtering on stacks of aligned serial transmission electron microscopic images. In this way, the structural information of the separate images is fused into one compound image that highlights organization patterns otherwise easily overlooked or impossible to comprehend. Our method, like high-voltage electron microscopy, offers the possibility to build stereo-pairs for high-resolution three-dimensional analysis of tissue layers 1-2 microm thick. The use of background elimination and the development of a depth enhancement routine improved the three-dimensional effect and facilitated the analysis of the interior of objects. As an example, we use the method to display the distribution of axonal organelles at nodes of Ranvier and the shape and contents of a highly branched hippocampal dendritic spine.
