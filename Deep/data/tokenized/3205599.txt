A case of limbic encephalitis associated with recurrent malignant thymoma in a 41-year-old male is described. The patient presented with confusion, loss of memory, hallucinations, abnormal behaviour, tachycardia and profuse sweating. Investigations were unrewarding and the patient's clinical state deteriorated until his death 1 month after presentation. The diagnosis was made at autopsy when bilateral extensive neuronal loss with reactive gliosis, confined to the medial temporal cortex and Ammon's horn, was revealed.
