The aim of the study was to detect brain oedema with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T(2) relaxation time which is an indicator of brain water was measured one day prior to the first ECT and at two hours after second ECT in five depressive patients prescribed right unilateral (RUL) ECT. MRI T(2), relaxation time was measured in hippocampus (He) and thalamus (Th) bilaterally No significant change in T(2) relaxation time following ECT occurred in any of the four regions. EC T did not produce any detectable brain oedema and hence the treatment may be considered safe. The study needs to be replicated in a larger sample and also in bilateral (BL) ECT patient group.
