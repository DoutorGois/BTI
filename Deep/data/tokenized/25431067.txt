Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD ) is widely used as an in vitro model for stroke, showing similarities with the in vivo models of brain ischemia. In order to perform OGD, cell or tissue cultures, such as primary neurons or organotypic slices, and acutely prepared tissue slices are usually incubated in a glucose-free medium under a deoxygenated atmosphere, for example in a hypoxic chamber. Here, we describe the step-by-step procedure to expose cultures and acute slices to OGD, focusing on the most suitable methods for assessing cellular death and/or viability. OGD is a simple yet highly useful technique, not only for the elucidation of the role of key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying brain ischemia, but also for the development of novel neuroprotective strategies.
