The present study concerns an electrophysiological investigation of the responses of entorhinal and subicular neurons to electrical stimulation of the lateral and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei. All the neurons exhibited suppression of cell firing after the stimulation of these amygdaloid nuclei. Initial excitation following by the suppression characterized 91% of the units and 9% showed initial inhibition. The suppression effect was observed in association with an extracellularly recorded positive deflection. These data suggest that this inhibitory response is mediated by an interneuron.
