OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of propofol and dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) on the cognitive abilities the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein of rats after the electroconvulsive therapy. METHODS: Two intervention factors including electroconvulsive shock therapy (ECT) (two levels: not applied and one treatment course) and drug intervention (three levels: intravenous saline,intravenous MK-801, and intravenous propofol). The morris water maze test started within 1 day after ECT to evaluate the learning-memory. The glutamate level in the hippocampus of rats was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The Tau protein that includes Tau5 (total Tau protein), PHF-1 (pSer(396/404)), AT8 (pSer(199/202)), and 12E8 (pSer(262)) in the hippocampus of rats was determined using Western blotting. RESULTS: Propofol, MK-801, and ECT could induce the impairment of learning-memory in depressed rats. The electroconvulsive shock significantly up-regulated the glutamate level, which was reduces by the propofol. The ECT up-regulated the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein in the hippocampus of depressed rats, which was reduced by propofol and MK-801. CONCLUSION: Both propofol and MK-801 could protect against the impairment of learning-memory and reduce the hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein induced by ECT in depressed rats.
