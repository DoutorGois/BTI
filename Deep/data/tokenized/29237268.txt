The previous study indicated sesquiterpenoids from the root of Panax ginseng (SPG) exhibited a significant antidepressant-like effect, which might be mediated by the modification of the dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic systems. This study was to investigate antidepressant effects and mechanisms on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depression-like behavior of SPG. In the tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), SPG (0.25 and 1 mg/kg, i.g.) and fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) effectively reduced the immobility time. SPG treatment significantly reduced serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha and increased suppressed superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the hippocampus. In addition, SPG effectively upregulated the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), and sirtuin type 1 (Sirt 1) expression in the hippocampus and downregulated the inhibitor of kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) phosphorylation. These results suggested that SPG exhibited an antidepressant-like effect through the BDNF/TrkB and Sirt 1/NF-kappaB signaling pathways.
