In the present study we examined the distribution of chemically identified subpopulations of nonprincipal neurons in the rat hippocampus, focusing on the dorsoventral differences in their distributions. The subpopulations analyzed were those immunoreactive for parvalbumin, calretinin, nitric oxide synthase, somatostatin, calbindin D28K, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and cholecystokinin. Using a confocal laser scanning light microscope, we could confirm that the penetration of each immunostaining, except that of calbindin D28K, was complete throughout 50 microns thick sections under our immunostaining conditions. We counted numbers of immunoreactive somata according to the 'dissector' principle, measured areas of hippocampal subdivisions and the thickness of sections, and estimated the approximate numerical densities of these subpopulations, especially for those neurons immunoreactive for nitric oxide synthase, calretinin, somatostatin and parvalbumin. Generally speaking, neurons immunoreactive for parvalbumin showed no significant dorsoventral differences in the numerical densities in any of the subdivisions of the hippocampus, whereas the numerical densities of somata immunoreactive for calretinin, nitric oxide synthase and somatostatin were significantly larger in ventral levels than at dorsal levels of the hippocampus. The numerical density of somatostatin neurons was significantly larger in ventral levels than in dorsal levels of the denate gyrus, and, although not prominent, of the CA1 region. That of nitric oxide synthase positive neurons was significantly larger in ventral levels than in dorsal levels of the CA3 region as well as of the DG but not of the CA1 region. The numerical density of calretinin positive neurons was larger in ventral levels than in dorsal levels of all hippocampal subdivisions. The present study also revealed that dorsal and ventral levels of the hippocampus differ from each other in the composition of their nonprincipal neurons.
