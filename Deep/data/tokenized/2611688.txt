Oxypurinol, an inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, reduced ischemic hippocampal damage and the associated hypermotility in Mongolian gerbils. Cerebral ischemia was induced in unanesthetized gerbils by a bilateral 5-min occlusion of the carotid arteries. Oxypurinol (40 mg/kg, IP), administered 20 min prior to carotid occlusion, prevented the increase in locomotor activity observed in saline-injected ischemic animals and significantly reduced the damage to, and loss of, CA1 hippocampal neurons observed 5 days postischemia. These findings suggest that oxypurinol may be useful for the prevention of cerebral ischemic damage.
