Aging is marked by progressive impairments in the process of adult neurogenesis and spatial memory performance. The underlying mechanisms for these impairments have not been fully established; however, they may coincide with decline of cholinergic signaling in the hippocampus. This study investigates whether augmenting cholinergic neurotransmission, by enhancing the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), influences the age-related decline in the development of newborn hippocampal cells and spatial memory. We found that enhanced VAChT expression in the hippocampus of mice contributes to lifelong increases in the dendritic complexity of newborn neurons. Furthermore, enhanced VAChT expression improved memory acquisition through an increased use of spatially precise search strategies in the Morris water maze through the course of the aging process. These data suggest that VAChT overexpression contributes to increases in dendritic complexity and improved spatial memory during aging.
