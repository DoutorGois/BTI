High affinity choline uptake (HACU) in the hippocampus and striatal concentration of dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) as measures of the in vivo acetylcholine and DA turnover, respectively, were estimated in male rats, Long-Evans, following 6-day administration of various nootropics in clinically relevant doses: piracetam and its derivatives pramiracetam and oxiracetam (100 mg/kg/day), pyritinol (50 mg/kg/day). Piracetam treatment was without effect on HACU, but induced significant increase of HVA in the striatum leaving striatal DA concentration unchanged. On the contrary, pyritinol, pramiracetam and oxiracetam increased HACU, but did not change striatal DA and HVA levels.
