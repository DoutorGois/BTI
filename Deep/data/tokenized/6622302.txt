Intravenous injection of 1 or 10 mg/kg of naloxone did not affect the bioelectrical and behavioral epileptiform activity induced by carbachol application into the dorsal hippocampus in freely moving chronically implanted rabbits. In contrast, naloxone given intravenously (10 mg/kg) or intracaudally (2 micrograms) prolonged the duration and increased the amplitude of bioelectrical epileptiform activity induced by intracaudal carbachol application. The above results indicate that endogenous opioid peptides may inhibit seizure activity in the caudate nucleus.
