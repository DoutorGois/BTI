OBJECT: Delayed (24 hours postinjury) treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) improves functional recovery following experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, the authors tested whether therapeutic effects of delayed EPO treatment for TBI are dose dependent in an attempt to establish an optimal dose paradigm for the delayed EPO treatment. METHODS: Experimental TBI was performed in anesthetized young adult male Wistar rats using a controlled cortical impact device. Sham animals underwent the same surgical procedure without injury. The animals (8 rats/group) received 3 intraperitoneal injections of EPO (0, 1000, 3000, 5000, or 7000 U/kg body weight, at 24, 48, and 72 hours) after TBI. Sensorimotor and cognitive functions were assessed using a modified neurological severity score and foot fault test, and Morris water maze tests, respectively. Animals were killed 35 days after injury, and the brain sections were stained for immunohistochemical analyses. RESULTS: Compared with the saline treatment, EPO treatment at doses from 1000 to 7000 U/kg did not alter lesion volume but significantly reduced hippocampal neuron loss, enhanced angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the injured cortex and hippocampus, and significantly improved sensorimotor function and spatial learning. The animals receiving the medium dose of 5000 U/kg exhibited a significant improvement in histological and functional outcomes compared with the lower or higher EPO dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that delayed (24 hours postinjury) treatment with EPO provides dose-dependent neurorestoration, which may contribute to improved functional recovery after TBI, implying that application of an optimal dose of EPO is likely to increase successful preclinical and clinical trials for treatment of TBI.
