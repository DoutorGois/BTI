In the current study, we found evidence for the existence of binding sites for TRH in synaptic membrane preparations of several regions of the postmortem adult human brain. High levels of specific binding (fmol [3H]Me-TRH/mg protein/2 hr) were found in limbic structures: amygdala (7.1 +/- 0.6, Mean +/- SE), hippocampus (2.8 +/- 0.3), and temporal cortex (2.4 +/- 0.8). Intermediate levels of binding were found in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens whereas binding was low to undetectable in frontal and occipital cortex, cerebellum, pons, medulla and corpus striatum. Binding of the radioligand was linear over protein concentrations of 0.05-1.5 mg, and greater than 6 hr of incubation was required to achieve maximal binding. In the amygdala, binding was inhibited in the presence of TRH and Me-TRH but not in the presence of up to 1 microM concentrations of cyclo (His-Pro), TRH-OH, pGlu-His or peptides unrelated to TRH. Pretreatment of amygdala synaptic membranes with detergents, proteases or phospholipases disrupted [3H]Me-TRH binding; pretreatment with DNase or collagenase had no effect on binding. Saturation and association/dissociation analyses of the binding of [3H]Me-TRH to purified amygdala synaptic membranes revealed the presence of a high affinity (KD = 2.0 nM), low capacity (Bmax = 180 +/- 16 fmoles/mg protein) binding site. These results demonstrate that a highly specific membrane associated receptor for TRH is present in the adult human brain. The specific role that this receptor plays in brain function remains to be elucidated.
