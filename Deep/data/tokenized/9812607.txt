Effects of lead on the release of glutamate neurotransmitter were observed in rat hippocampal slices in vitro to study its neurobiological mechanism of lead-induced impairment in learning and memory function. Results showed that exposure to 3.1 to 50.0 mumol/L of lead could cause a dose-dependent increase in spontaneous release of 3H-DL-glutamic acid in hippocampal slices by 23.2% to 66.2% in the absence of calcium. However, in the presence of calcium, spontaneous release of 3H-DL-glutamic acid decreased by 22.6% to 55.3% with increase of exposure to lead from 1.0 to 50.0 mumol/L, and the release induced by potassium increased by 89.3% to 332.1% with a dose-response relationship. It indicated that exposure to lead could interfere with spontaneous and induced release of glutamate transmitter.
