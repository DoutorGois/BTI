TsTX-I, isolated from Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, causes epileptic-like discharges when injected into the central nervous system. The involvement of excitatory amino acids and cytokines in this activity was investigated. Our results have demonstrated that TsTX-I increases the release of IFN-gamma but does not alter the intracerebral concentration of the excitatory amino acids in rats. Thus, this cytokine seems to be more important in the convulsive process than glutamate.
