Endogenous adenosine in the extracellular space inhibits neuronal activity. The roles of adenosine kinase, S-adenosylhomocysteine-hydrolase and adenosine deaminase activities in the regulation of the adenosine levels were investigated in rat hippocampal slices. Iodotubercidin, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase, added to the perfusion fluid at 5 microM increased the release of adenosine from the slices more than 2-fold. Iodotubercidin treatment caused inhibition of population spike discharges and hyperpolarization of pyramidal cells, mimicking the effects of exogenously applied adenosine. Adenosine dialdehyde, an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (EHNA), an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase had little or no effect on the parameters tested. The action of iodotubercidin was greater during deaminase inhibition. The A1-receptor antagonist DPCPX had actions opposite to those of adenosine and blocked the electrophysiological effects of exogenous adenosine and of iodotubercidin. Thus adenosine kinase activity is a significant factor in the regulation of adenosine levels in the hippocampus.
