There has been controversy regarding the best treatment for acute intracerebral hemorrhage. Early surgical evacuation alone seems to provide only limited amelioration of this condition, and additional therapeutic strategies should be investigated to obtain a better outcome. To test the feasibility of post-evacuation treatment, basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) was administered into the evacuated cavity and its effect was evaluated in terms of the pathological changes around the lesion. A transient (10 min) intracerebral mass lesion was created by inflation of a microballoon in the caudate nucleus in rats. Basic-FGF (500 or 1000 ng) was injected into the evacuated cavity after deflation and removal of the balloon, and then histological changes were evaluated in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus and cavity wall. The results demonstrate a protective effect against the neuronal damage in CA1 pyramidal cells and an increase of angiogenesis in the evacuated cavity wall after b-FGF administration. These observations suggest that local administration of b-FGF after evacuation may prevent secondary neuronal damage in the area surrounding an acute mass lesion and facilitate more rapid repair of the damaged brain.
