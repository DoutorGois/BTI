Cis- and trans-2,4-methanoglutamate were compared with L-glutamate as acidic amino acid ligands. Cis-2,4-methanoglutamate had a Ki of 0.052 microM against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-specific L-[3H]glutamate binding compared with 0.050 microM for L-glutamate. Cis-2,4-methanoglutamate exhibited no significant affinity against [3H]kainate or [3H]alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate ([3H]AMPA) binding. Trans-2,4-methanoglutamate had no significant affinity for any of these sites. Cis-2,4-methanoglutamate increased [3H]N-1[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl-3,4-piperidine [( 3H]TCP) binding with EC50 of 0.35 +/- 0.14 microM. It produced an inward current in rat brain mRNA-injected Xenopus oocytes which was blocked by the NMDA antagonist, D-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate (D-AP7). Cis-2,4-methanoglutamate (EC50 = 15.9 microM) was 100-fold more potent than L-glutamate (EC50 = 1,584 microM) in reducing the excitatory postsynaptic potential in CA1 of hippocampal slices. Cis-2,4-methanoglutamate is the most potent, selective NMDA agonist known.
