BACKGROUND: Memory impairment (MI) is a common symptom of MS. Previous studies were conflicting in respect to the possible existence of early MI and the role of hippocampal atrophy. The objective of this study was to investigate MI and structural MRI correlates in homogenous groups of early and late MS, controlling for a potential information-processing speed (IPS) deficit, and utilizing multiple memory test paradigms. METHODS: 152 individually matched subjects were recruited: early MS (EMS, N = 25, disease duration 1.0 +/- 0.8 years), late MS (LMS, N = 52, 16.5 +/- 5.2 years), and corresponding controls. Five memory tests were utilized to account for differences in learning material (verbal, visual), encoding (incidental, intentional), and retrieval (free recall, recognition, recurring recognition). Performance was related to IPS, memory-specific (hippocampal volumes), and unspecific MRI measures (T1/T2LL, brain volume, cortical thickness). RESULTS: Memory was impaired across all tests in LMS, but not in EMS. LMS-patients were also significantly impaired in IPS which was correlated with several memory scores. Regression analyses revealed IPS and cortical thickness as predictors for visual MI, and IPS, sex, and left hippocampal volume as predictors for verbal MI. CONCLUSION: Additionally to direct destructions in memory specific tracts such as the hippocampus, memory decline in MS may also be related to a general factor comprising slowed information-processing and global tissue loss.
