Synaptotagmin IV (SytIV) is an immediate early gene induced by membrane depolarization in PC12 cells and in rat brain. However, little is known about the function of SytIV or the functional relationship between SytIV and SytI, because SytIV has yet to be localized. Here we show that SytIV was localized at the Golgi and distal part of neurites in nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and cultured hippocampal neurons by immunocytochemistry using an isoform-specific antibody (anti-SytIV). These SytIV signals were not colocalized well with SytI signals. Upon membrane depolarization, SytIV signals were increased at both the Golgi and distal part of neurites within several hours in both types of cells. We further show that the increase of SytIV protein levels results from protein kinase A-dependent gene up-regulation. In hippocampal neurons, SytIV was developmentally regulated. These results suggest that SytIV may play a role at the Golgi and tips of neurites during development and synaptic plasticity.
