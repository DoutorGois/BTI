BACKGROUND: Antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) are associated with symptoms of schizophrenia, leading to the hypothesis that NMDA-R hypofunction leads to the pathogenesis of disease. We evaluated the long-term effect of neuroleptic administration on the NMDA subunits via immunohistochemical analysis. METHODS: Rats received olanzapine, clozapine and haloperidol before evaluation of the expression of the NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunit proteins in the hippocampal areas of the brain, via a densytometric analysis of immunoexpression in the rat hippocampus. RESULTS: All of the neuroleptics examined caused a decrease in the expression of the NR1 subunit, and thus, one can assume that both olanzapine, clozapine and haloperidol decreased the number of NMDA receptors in the CA1 and CA2 areas of the brain. CONCLUSIONS: A decrease in hippocampal glutamatergic signalling after long-term neuroleptic administration may cautiously explain the incomplete effectiveness of these drugs in the therapy of schizophrenia-related cognitive disturbances.
