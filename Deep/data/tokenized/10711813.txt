The aim of the study was to investigate the changes in biochemical mechanisms facilitating cellular damages in the lithium plus pilocarpine treatment and the resulting status epilepticus. The whole brain free fatty acid (FFA) level as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine-aminotransferase, gamma-glutamoyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and pons-medulla region of Hannover-Wistar rats were determined. The control group was intact with no previous experimental history. LiCl (125 mg/kg i.p.) was injected 20 h prior to pilocarpine (30 mg/kg i.p.) and the treated rats were sacrificed 1 or 2 1/2 h after pilocarpine administration. The results show that lithium plus pilocarpine administration and the resulting status epilepticus produced the significant increase of the brain FFA content. Decreased GPX activities were detected in the frontal cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus of the treated rats without the accompanying decrease of SOD activity. Increased AST and LDH activities were observed in the frontal cortex, increased soluble ALP activities in the frontal cortex and pons-medulla region whereas the increased activity of membrane bound ALP was detected in the hippocampus of the rats with status epilepticus. Activities of the other analysed enzymes did not change in the examined brain regions. The presented data indicate clear regional differences of biochemical changes caused by lithium plus pilocarpine treatment and the resulting status epilepticus, frontal cortex being the most affected site.
