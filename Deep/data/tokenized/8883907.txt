The number of NADPH diaphorase-positive cells in the CA1/CA2 and CA3 regions of Ammon's horn and the subiculum of the hippocampal formation of EL mice, an inbred mutant strain of the ddY mouse susceptible to convulsive seizures, was fewer than that of ddY mice. These findings suggest that smaller numbers of nitric oxide producing cells in the hippocampal formations of EL mice is related to their susceptibility to convulsive seizures.
