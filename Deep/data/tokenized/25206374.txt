We investigated the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by examining beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta protein expression in the rat hippocampal CA1 region following acute cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Our results demonstrate that cell apoptosis increases in the CA1 region following ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta protein expression gradually increases, peaking at 48 hours following reperfusion. Dickkopf-1 administration, after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, results in decreased cell apoptosis, and beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta expression, in the CA1 region. This suggests that beta-catenin and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, both components of the Wnt signaling pathway, participate in cell apoptosis following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
