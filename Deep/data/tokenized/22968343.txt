In addition to senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangles, granulovacuolar degeneration is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. A number of tau kinases, such as c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), glycogen-synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), and casein kinase 1 (CK1), have been reported to be markers of granulovacuolar degeneration. In addition, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which phosphorylates tau, has been shown to be abundantly expressed in neurofibrillary tangles in the hippocampus. CDK5 has a unique staining pattern, and therefore, has the potential to be a novel marker for granulovacuolar degeneration. In this study, we investigated the ability of CDK5 to be a marker for granulovacuolar degeneration using immunohistochemical analysis. Four Alzheimer's disease cases, three myotonic dystrophy (MyD) cases, and three control cases were subjected to immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent techniques using anti-CDK5, anti-charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B), anti-pSmad2/3, anti-ubiquitin (Ub), anti-phospho-TDP-43 and AT8 antibodies. Some CDK5-positive granules were morphologically similar to granulovacuolar degeneration intraluminal granules, and these granules overlapped with those immunopositive for pSmad2/3, Ub and phospho-TDP-43 established granulovacuolar degeneration markers. Moreover, CDK5-positive granulovacuolar degeneration and phosphorylated tau colocalized in pyramidal neurons in Alzheimer's disease and MyD cases. The numbers of CDK5-positive granules showed an inverse relationship with the degree of mature neurofibrillary tangles in each cell, as was the case with CHMP2B-positive granulovacuolar degeneration granules and neurofibrillary tangles. The presence of tau kinases including CDK5 in granulovacuolar degeneration might implicate that granulovacuolar degeneration is structurally involved in tau modification.
