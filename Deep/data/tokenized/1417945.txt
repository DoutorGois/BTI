Cytochrome P450 (P450) levels were quantitated in microsomes from human brain regions obtained at autopsy. The reduced carbon monoxide binding spectra of cortical microsomes showed two absorption maxima at 449 and 425 nm. On solubilization of the microsomes, essentially a single peak was observed at 449 nm. The P450 levels in human brain cortical microsomes varied from 0.03 to 0.12 nmol/mg protein among the seven samples examined. The concentration of the hemeprotein present as nmol/g tissue was highest in the brain stem and cerebellum and lowest in the striatum and hippocampus.
