Excitatory synaptic connections between rat hippocampal neurons were established in tissue culture. The electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of these synapses were studied with the use of the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. The excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in a dissociated CA1 neuron evoked by stimulation of an explant from the CA3/CA4 region of the hippocampus had two distinct components in Mg(2+)-free medium. The fast component was abolished by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) (2 microM), whereas the slow component was abolished by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV) (50 microM). In solution containing 1 mM Mg2+, the peak amplitude of the fast component was almost linearly related to the membrane potential. In contrast, the conductance change underlying the slow component of the EPSC was voltage-dependent with a region of negative-slope conductance in the range of -80 to -20 mV. A nootropic drug, aniracetam, increased both the amplitude and duration of the fast component of the EPSC in a concentration-dependent manner in the range of 0.1-5 mM, whereas it had no potentiating effect on the slow component. Aniracetam (0.1-5 mM) similarly increased current responses of the postsynaptic neuron to alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA). Current responses to quisqualate and glutamate in the presence of D-APV were also potentiated by aniracetam. However, neither NMDA- nor kainate-induced current was potentiated by 1 mM aniracetam.
