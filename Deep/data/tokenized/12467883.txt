In this study, we investigated the effect of cyclosporin A on the binding properties of the GABAA receptor in the hippocampus, known to be responsible for the induction of seizures, to clarify the mechanism of cyclosporin A-inhibited GABA neurotransmission in ovariectomized rats, as a climacterium model. The effects of single and subchronic treatments with cyclosporin A were examined on [3H]muscimol binding to hippocampal synaptosomal membranes in sham, ovariectomized, and estradiol/ovariectomized rats. A single treatment with cyclosporin A (40 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to change [3H]muscimol binding in the 3 groups, when compared with each corresponding vehicle-treated group. Subchronic treatment with cyclosporin A (40 mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 5 days) significantly decreased the amount of [3H]muscimol binding in ovariectomized rats. However, this inhibitory effect was not observed in sham or estradiol/ovariectomized rats. These results demonstrated that the binding activity of the GABAA receptor was decreased in ovariectomized rats after subchronic cyclosporin A treatment. This study supports the hypothesis that ovariectomy elevates the susceptibility to cyclosporin A-induced convulsions by accelerating the inhibitory actions of cyclosporin A on GABA neurotransmission in the hippocampus.
