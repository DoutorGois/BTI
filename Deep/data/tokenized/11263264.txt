AIM: To study the effects of batroxobin (Bat) on neurons survival, neurobehavioral test, ATP levels and hydroxyl radical outputs in hippocampus during forebrain ischemia-reperfusion in gerbils. METHODS: The forebrain ischemia was induced by occluding the bilateral common carotid arteries for 10 min in gerbils, and ATP levels and 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) outputs were assayed by HPLC. The neurons survival were assessed by histology, and behavioral tests of gerbils were assessed by open field test. RESULTS: The number of neurons survival in Ir at d 7 postischemic insult were (7 +/- 4)% of sham-operated gerbils, much less than that in Bat (45 +/- 16)%. The levels of explore activities of ischemic gerbils was 175% and 159% of sham-operated gerbils at d 3 and d 6 postischemic insult, much more than that in Bat (120% d 3 and 140% d 6). Hippocampal ATP levels in Ir were 64% of sham-operated gerbils at reperfusion 60 min, much less than that in Bat I and II (82% and 89% respectively). The hippocampal 2,3-DHBA outputs in Ir increased by 4.5 folds of sham-operated gerbils at reperfusion 60 min, but the 2,3-DHBA outputs in Bat I and Bat II were only 2.6 and 2.4 folds respectively. CONCLUSION: Bat possesses the inhibitory effects on DND and OH. production following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in gerbils.
