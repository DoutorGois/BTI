Heritable variation of mossy fiber synapses in hippocampal region CA3 was studied in the two inbred mouse strains C3H and CPB-K. Previous Timm studies had shown a larger mossy fiber projection in C3H mice. In contrast, synaptic boutons of CPB-K mice were larger in size and perimeter and were contacted by more dendritic spines than in C3H mice. These results point to an inverse relationship between the size of the mossy fiber projection and the number of spine synapses formed by an individual mossy fiber bouton. Thus, the fiber density of a projection may be crucial for the actual morphology of the synaptic contacts formed.
