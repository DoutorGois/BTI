We studied anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) tests in male Lewis rats on days 2 and 4 of adjuvant arthritis (AA). In plasma we analyzed C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, ACTH, corticosterone, in the hippocampus the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), corticotrophin releasing factor (CRH), NADPH oxidases NOX1 and NOX2, and inducible NO-synthase (iNOS). EPM tests showed a higher anxiety index in AA rats on days 2 and 4 and reduction of total entries. On days 2 and 4 we found reduced plasma albumin, enhanced CRP, ACTH and corticosterone, and in the hippocampus enhanced mRNA for NOX1 and IL-1beta in AA rats, on day 4 we found enhanced mRNAs for iNOS and IL-6, and reduced mRNA for CRH. The mRNA for NOX2 did not change on any experimental day. These results suggest enhanced anxiety, as well as locomotor impairment during the early phase of AA that correlate with enhanced mRNA expressions of parameters of oxidative stress NOX1, iNOS, and inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 in the hippocampus.
