The expression of CB2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2-Rs) in the brain and their neuronal function has now attracted research interest, since we and others have demonstrated the presence of CB2-Rs in neuronal and glial cells in the brain. In this study, we show the subcellular distribution of CB2-Rs in neuronal, glial, and endothelial cells in the rat hippocampus using immunohistochemical electron microscopy. Brain sections from the hippocampus were immunolabeled for CB2-R, visualized, and analyzed by electron microscopy. We found that in neurons, CB2-R immunoreactivity is present in the cell body as well as in large and medium-sized dendrites. In the soma, the CB2-R labeling is associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus demonstrating that CB2-Rs are synthesized by hippocampal neurons. CB2-R labeling in dendrites was observed in the cytoplasm and associated with the plasma membrane near the area of synaptic contact with axon terminals indicating a postsynaptic distribution of these receptors. In CB2-R immunoreactive glial and endothelial cells, the labeling was also found to be associated with the plasma membrane. These results provide the first ultrastructural evidence that CB2-Rs are mainly postsynaptic in the rat hippocampus.
