To eliminate undesirable memory traces from the short-term memory system, it is a crucial question to reorganize the activity induced synaptic efficiency. Here we suggest a possible solution for this mechanism. In the first part of the paper we demonstrate, that under different physiological conditions even in the case of adult animals, the GABA(A) synapse may mediate a depolarizing effect on the membrane potential. Considering the GABA(A) receptor-mediated complex effects on the membrane potential of adult mammalian central neurons we raised the question of the properties of the network, which has elements in the synaptic weight matrix with changing signs. The second part pinpoints the beneficial learning ability of such a network.
