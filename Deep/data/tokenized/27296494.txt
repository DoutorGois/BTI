BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) increases necrotic neuronal cell death in the CA1 area after induced status epilepticus (SE) in developing rats. However, it remains uncertain whether IL-1beta has a similar effect on the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In this study, we analysed the effects of IL-1beta on 14-day-old Wistar rats experiencing DG neuronal death induced by SE. METHODS: SE was induced with lithium-pilocarpine. Six hours after SE onset, a group of pups was injected with IL-1beta (at 0, 0.3, 3, 30, or 300ng/muL) in the right ventricle; another group was injected with IL-1beta receptor (IL-1R1) antagonist (IL-1Ra, at 30ng/muL) of IL-1RI antagonist (IL-1Ra) alone, and additional group with 30ng/muL of IL-1Ra plus 3ng/muL of IL-1beta. Twenty-four hours after SE onset, neuronal cell death in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus was assessed using haematoxylin-eosin staining. Dead cells showed eosinophilic cytoplasm and condensed and fragmented nuclei. RESULTS: We observed an increased number of eosinophilic cells in the hippocampal DG ipsilateral to the site of injection of 3ng/muL and 300ng/muL of IL-1beta in comparison with the vehicle group. A similar effect was observed in the hippocampal DG contralateral to the site of injection of 3ng/muL of IL-1beta. Administration of both of IL-1beta and IL-1Ra failed to prevent an increase in the number of eosinophilic cells. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IL-1beta increases apoptotic neuronal cell death caused by SE in the hippocampal GD, which is a mechanism independent of IL-1RI activation.
