OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of oligosaccharides of Morinda officinalis (OMO) on beta-amyloid-induced dementia rats, and study its pharmacological mechanism in treatment of dementia. METHOD: The dementia model rats were established by injecting Abeta25-35 10 microLg into bilateral hippocampus. OMO high-dose (60 mg . kg-1 . d-1) group, OMO low-dose (20 mg . kg-1 . d-1 ) groups, the blank group, the sham operation group and the positive donepezil HC1 group (0. 125 mg kg-1 . d-1) were designed for the experiment. They were continuously administered with drugs at the 15th day after operation for 25 days. Kit microplate method was used to detect the contents of super oxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GSH-Px), acetylcholine (ACh) , acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Na+ /K+ -ATPase. RESULT: Compared with the model group, all of administration groups showed higher SOD, CAT and GSH-Px levels, and lower MDA in the brain tissues. Besides, they also showed rise in the activities of ACh and Na+ /K+ -ATPase. CONCLUSION: OMO can ameliorate on beta-amyloid-induced dementia rats by enhancing oxidation resistance, activating brain energy metabolism and improving the injury of cholinergic system.
