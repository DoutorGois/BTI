In adult rats an anterodorsal bilateral hippocampectomy produced an increase in motor activity without modification of the amount of the different sleep stages. In hippocampectomized rats p-chlorophenylalanine produced an insomnia which can be reversed by 5-HTP. These results show that the insomnia produced by brain serotonin depletion is not a result of the hyperactivity produced by the treatments which cause such depletion.
