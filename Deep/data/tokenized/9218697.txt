Carbamazepine administration causes large increases in extracellular serotonin concentration and dose-related anticonvulsant effects in genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs). In order to determine the generality of the effect on serotonin, we determined the anticonvulsant ED50 for carbamazepine against maximal electroshock seizures in outbred, non-epileptic Sprague-Dawley rats. We then administered anticonvulsant carbamazepine doses to Sprague-Dawley rats and observed extracellular serotonin concentration in hippocampi by way of microdialysis. We found that administration of carbamazepine, either systemically or through the dialysis probe, resulted in significant and dose-related increases in extracellular serotonin concentration. Basal serotonin release was decreased by tetrodotoxin administration through the dialysis probe. Tetrodotoxin administration through the dialysis probe did not decrease the effect of systemically or focally administered carbamazepine on extracellular serotonin concentration. Similarly, elimination of Ca2+ from the dialysate did not alter the release of serotonin caused by carbamazepine. These findings suggest that the serotonin releasing effect of carbamazepine does not take place by exocytosis and does not require action potentials in the brain area in which the release takes place. Further they suggest that the effect is mediated by an action of carbamazepine directly on serotonergic nerve terminals.
