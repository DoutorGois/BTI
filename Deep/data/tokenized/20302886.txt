2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a potent toxicant that alters normal brain development and produces cognitive disability and motor dysfunction. However, after decades of intense study, the molecular mechanisms of TCDD-induced neurotoxicity, the signaling pathways involved and its molecular targets in neurons still remain unknown. TCDD acts as an exogenous ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) that becomes a key signaling molecule in the regulation of the toxic and carcinogenic properties of TCDD. We have used NGF-differentiated pheochromocytoma (dPC12) cells to determine the type of cell death that takes place by TCDD toxicity. TCDD induced cell death in dPC12 cultures with an EC(50) of 218+/-24 nM, similar to that obtained in undifferentiated PC12 cells, 171+/-31 nM. Nuclear fragmentation was observed after TCDD incubation in parallel to an increase in caspase-3 activity. Staurosporine, which readily induced apoptosis in dPC12 cells, showed a similar increase in caspase-3 activity and the characteristic pattern of nuclear fragmentation. Flow cytometry measurements showed that dPC12 cells in the presence of TCDD were positive for annexin V labeling but negative for propidium iodide staining. In addition, TCDD increased the area of the peak corresponding to hypodiploid (apoptotic) DNA content. All together these results support the hypothesis that TCDD toxicity in dPC12 cells takes place mainly through an apoptotic process.
