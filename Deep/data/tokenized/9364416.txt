Twenty-two different compounds have been synthesized with the aim of creating new, mixed D2/5HT1A ligands. For this purpose 1-substituted phenylpiperazines attached by the N-4 nitrogen to dopaminergic pharmacophores of the 2-(5-benzimidazole)ethyl-, 2-(5-benztriazole)ethyl-, 2-[5-(benzimidazole-2-thione)]ethyl- and 2-[6-(1,4-dihydroquinoxaline-2,3-dione)]ethyl-type were selected according to known structure-affinity requirements of 1-arylpiperazines. All the new compounds were evaluated for in-vitro binding affinity at the dopamine (D1 and D2) and 5-HT1A receptors. Synaptosomal membranes prepared from fresh bovine caudate nuclei and hippocampi were used as a source of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, respectively. [3H]SCH 23390 (D1 selective), [3H]spiperone (D2 selective) and 8-OH-[3H]DPAT (5-HT1A selective) were employed as the radio-ligands. None of the compounds expressed affinity for binding at D1 dopamine receptors. Compounds 3b and 4b were inactive 8-OH-[3H]DPAT competitors whereas 1b, 2b and 4b were inactive in the [3H]spiperone-binding assay. The other compounds tested showed fair (1c, 1e, 1f, 2c, 2f, 3b, 3c and 4c) to high (1a, 1d, 2a, 1d, 3a, 3d-3f, 4a, and 4d) affinity in the [3H]spiperone-binding assay, the most potent representative being 4-[2-(5-benzimidazole-2-thione)ethyl]-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine, 3a (Ki = 1.7 nM). In the 8-OH-[3H]DPAT-displacement assay compounds 1b, 1d, 1f, 2b, 2f and 3f behaved as moderate competitors and 1a, 1c, 1e, 2a, 2c, 2d, 3a, 3c-3e, 4a, 4c, 4d and 4f as rather strong competitors; 4-[2-(5-benztriazole)ethyl]-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine, 2a had the highest binding affinity at the 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 2.6 nM). Because many antipsychotic and anxiolytic agents behave as mixed dopaminergic and serotonergic ligands, the high affinity of several of these new ligands for binding at both D2 and 5-HT1A receptors make them promising candidates deserving further pharmacological evaluation as antipsychotic or anxiolytic pharmaceuticals.
