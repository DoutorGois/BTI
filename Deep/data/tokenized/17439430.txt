1. There is mounting evidence that a wide range of antidepressants share the common feature of increasing hippocampal neurogenesis. The specificity of this association has suggested that an ability to increase neurogenesis might be a useful paradigm to screen for compounds with antidepressant activity. 2. The hope of developing better antidepressants has stimulated research into the molecular control of neurogenesis and here we summarize some of the recent findings. We also review recent work that highlights 5-HT7 receptor as a promising molecular target in the treatment of depression. 3. In summary, it appears that 5-HT7 antagonism is capable of producing diverse antidepressant-like behavioural effects, alters hippocampal neuronal morphology and synergistically regulates hippocampal neurogenesis.
