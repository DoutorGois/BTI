The role of c-Fos in neurodegeneration or neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia is controversial. To investigate whether early c-Fos induction after ischemia is associated with neuroprotection, rats were subjected to 10 minutes of transient forebrain ischemia and c-Fos expression was examined. Resistant dentate granule cells and neurons in CA2-4 displayed more robust immunoreactivity than vulnerable neurons in the CA1 region of hippocampus during early hours of reperfusion. By 6 hours after reperfusion, c-Fos immunoreactivity was greatly diminished in all areas of the hippocampus. Administration of N-acetyl-O-methyldopamine (NAMDA), a compound previously shown to protect CA1 neurons against ischemia, increased c-Fos immunoreactivity in the CA1 vulnerable region at 6 hours after ischemia and protected SK-N-BE(2)C neurons from oxygen glucose deprivation. Further in vitro study showed that NAMDA potentiated phorbol-12 myristate-13 acetate (PMA)-induced c-Fos expression, AP1 binding activity, and late gene expression determined by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity from AP1 containing tyrosine hydroxylase promoter-CAT fusion gene in SK-N-BE(2)C neurons. In vivo and in vitro results showed that a neuroprotectant, NAMDA, in concert with another stimulus (for example, ischemia or PMA) up-regulates c-Fos expression and suggested that the early rise of NAMDA-induced c-Fos expression in vulnerable CA1 neurons may account for neuroprotection by means of up-regulating late gene expression for survival.
