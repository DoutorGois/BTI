The protein level and the activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) in homogenate from septally kindled rat brains were quantitatively compared with those from paired controls 2 weeks after the final stimulation. The major alpha subunit level was decreased, while the activity was increased in crude homogenate from hippocampus and parietal cortex of kindled animals, indicating an apparent increase in the specific activity of CaM kinase II in these regions of the kindled brains. No such changes were observed in cerebellum. After the separation of crude homogenate into the soluble and particulate fractions, the ratio of CaM kinase II activity recovered in the soluble fraction was increased in hippocampus and parietal cortex, indicating a change in subcellular distribution of CaM kinase II in the kindled state.
