Extracellular proteins were collected continuously from the hippocampus of the rabbit by slow perfusion of a protein-permeable thin tubing. After pulse labelling with radioactive amino acids via the tubing a rapid appearance of labelled proteins was seen in the extracellular fluid. The half-life of the proteins in the extracellular space varied between 15 min and 2 h. Protein fractions were separated with gel electrophoresis or HPLC. The extracellular fraction differed distinctly from intracellular proteins with respect to the labelling pattern.
