In experiments on rats showed that intranasal administration of glutamate antibodies in a dose of 300 microg/kg after 1 h after bilateral injection of neurotoxic fragment of beta-amyloid protein (25-35)--Abeta(25-35)--into the Meynert nuclei restores learning ability in the test of passive avoidance on 3 and 14 days of the experiment. Antibodies to glutamate decrease significantly increasing caspase 3 activity, detected on Day 3 after injection of Abeta(25-35), in samples of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus but not hypothalamus. Intranasal administration of gamma-globulin had no effect on the performance of violations of mnestic functions and caspase 3 activity.
