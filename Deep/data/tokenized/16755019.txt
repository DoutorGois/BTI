The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the marine red alga Neorhodomela aculeate (N. aculeata) Masuda were investigated with neuronal and microglial cells. Extracts of N. aculeata had potent neuroprotective effects on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the murine hippocampal HT22 cell line. Also, extracts of N. aculeata inhibited H2O2-induced lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates. The properties of the extract as an anti-inflammatory agent were investigated in microglial activation by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma): it reduced the inducible nitric oxide synthase that consequently resulted in the reduction of nitric oxide. These results suggest that the marine red alga N. aculeata could be considered as a potential source for reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammation related to neurological diseases.
