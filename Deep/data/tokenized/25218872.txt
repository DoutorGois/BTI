A recent behavioral inhibitory theory proposed that the hippocampus plays an important role in response inhibition to conflicting stimuli composed of simple inhibitory associations between events embedded in concurrent simple excitatory associations. In addition, the theory states that a serial feature negative (FN) task is a hippocampal-dependent task requiring the formation of a simple inhibitory association; on the other hand, a simple discrimination (SD) task is a typical hippocampus-independent task. In the present study, we recorded hippocampal theta activity from rats during FN and SD tasks to identify any potential differences. In the FN (A+, B-->A-) task used in this study, rats were required to press a lever to present stimulus A (A+) and avoid pressing a lever to present a serial compound stimulus (B-->A-). In the simple discrimination task (A+, B-), rats were required to press a lever to present stimulus A (A+) and avoid pressing a lever to present stimulus B (B-). We observed a transient decline of hippocampal theta power during response inhibition for a serial compound stimulus in the FN task. Thus, we conclude that the transient decline in hippocampal theta power reflects response inhibition for a conflicting stimulus. The results of the present study strongly support the behavioral inhibition theory.
