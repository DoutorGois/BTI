We cloned a novel basic helix-loop-helix protein, NDRF (NeuroD-related factor), cDNA. NDRF contains 383 amino acids and exhibits 53.4% and 52.2% sequence identity to NeuroD and MATH-2/NEX-1, respectively. NDRF mRNA appears in the brain of 12-day-old mouse embryos and is localized in certain regions of the adult brain, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus and cerebellum, Thus, the structure and expression patterns of NDRF are similar to but distinct from those of NeuroD and MATH-2/NEX-1, suggesting that NDRF may play distinct roles in neural development and plasticity as a novel member of the NeuroD family.
