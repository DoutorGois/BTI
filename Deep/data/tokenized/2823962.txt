The mast cell-degranulating peptide (MCD) isolated from bee venom has been found previously to have receptor sites in rat brain. Behavioral and electrocorticographic responses following intracerebroventricular injections of various doses of MCD have been analyzed. MCD produced a quasi-permanent hippocampal theta rhythm in the motionless animal alternating with epileptiform spike waves and paroxystic seizures. At a dose of 70 pmol seizures occurred for half of the treated rats. At a dose of 100 pmol generalized paroxystic crises were observed for all the rats. These effects were not antagonized by naloxone, morphine, diazepam and progabide. Rats recovered 24 h after a 100 pmol injection of MCD. A second ipsilateral injection to these rats showed the occurrence of a desensitization phenomenon. Desensitization was not observed when the second injection was contralateral. These physiological responses were studied in relation with a biochemical approach on membrane sites of action of MCD using [125I]MCD and their behavior in the desensitization process. The target of [125I]MCD is the ipsilateral hippocampus. Recovery from MCD effects was not due to MCD degradation. Desensitization was not due to down-regulation of the MCD receptor level.
