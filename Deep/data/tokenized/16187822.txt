Rats with hippocampal or sham lesions were trained to find food on a T maze located at 2 positions. Response rats were required to make a right or left turn. Direction rats were required to go in a consistent direction (east or west). Place rats were required to go to a consistent location, relative to room cues. One place group had distinguishable start points at the 2 maze positions, whereas another place group had start points facing the same side of the room. Controls took longer to solve a place problem than the response and direction problems when the start points were not distinguishable. Rats with hippocampal lesions were not different than controls on the response problem but were impaired on the direction and place problems.
