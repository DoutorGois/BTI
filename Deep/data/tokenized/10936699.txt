Long-term potentiation (LTP) is considered to be associated with an increase in expression as well as activity of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs). LTP-induced and control hippocampal slices were studied by immunohistochemical and electronmicroscopic analyses using anti-CaMK-I, -II and -IV antibodies. All three kinases were demonstrated to increase their expression in CA1 neurons. CaMK-I was shown to mainly localize in the cytoplasm of the control and LTP-induced neurons, and a significant increase of immunoreactivity was observed in the latter neurons. A part of CaMK-I was found to translocate to the nuclei of LTP-induced hippocampal CA1 neurons. Direct evidence of the translocation of CaMK-II from cytoplasm to nuclei in LTP was demonstrated by immuno-electronmicroscopy. A significant increase in expression of CaMK-IV in the nuclei was also observed. Our data suggest that all the three CaMKs were actively involved in nuclear Ca(2+)-signaling in LTP.
