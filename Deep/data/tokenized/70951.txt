Vibratome sections of hippocampus of adult rabbits were stained by a modified Hortega's silver-carbonate method. Impregnated materials were examined by electron microscopy to decide fine-structural characteristics of the resting microglia. Comparing their characteristics with those of macrophages, we came to the following conclusions: (1) Impregnated resting microglia in the hippocampus of adult rabbits can be identified as cells having distinct fine structures. (2) Resting microglia are morphologically different from macrophages or their precursor cells, and, therefore, seem not to be hematogenous cells sojourning in the normal brain parenchyma.
