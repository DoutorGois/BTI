In spite of the large variability of the fraction of bursting cells reported in the subiculum (from 54 to 100%), this structure has been considered as intrinsically bursting. Here, using visually assisted whole-cell recordings and Neurobiotin labeling in vitro, we correlated the electrophysiological firing modes of subicular cells (bursting, regular-spiking and fast-spiking) with their morphological characteristics (somatic size and shape). We then examined how different morphological sampling criteria for patching affect cell classification. We found a dramatic variability in the fraction of bursting cells, which ranged from 30 to 76% depending on the sampling criteria. We discuss the implications of these findings for the notion of the subiculum as an intrinsically bursting structure.
