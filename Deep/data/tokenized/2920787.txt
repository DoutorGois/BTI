Interactions between donor and host tissues following xenogeneic transplantation were studied using the neural cell surface antigen, Thy 1.2, as a marker for the donor tissue. Dissociated septal cells from Thy 1.2-positive fetal mice were transplanted to the dentate gyrus of Thy 1.2-negative adult rats. At post-transplantation survival times between 1 and 5 months, an antibody to Thy 1.2 was used to identify donor tissue. The results demonstrate that the donor tissue was capable of migrating and developing within the host following transplantation. Thy 1.2-positive cells and processes were consistently found within the supragranular, infragranular, and molecular layers of the dentate gyrus, and occasionally within the hilus, suggesting that mechanisms existed within the host which influenced the development of the transplanted tissue. Additionally, the survival and growth of the Thy 1.2-positive neurons differed from previous reports describing the growth of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive fibers from xenogeneic transplants. This finding suggested that in addition to growing within the host, xenogeneic transplants may also stimulate a compensatory sprouting response from the host.
