Glutamine synthetase activity was measured in seven brain areas post-mortem from control patients, and those with Huntington's disease. The activity of the enzyme was reduced in the frontal and temporal cortex, putamen and cerebellum, but not in the hippocampus, thalamus or olivary nucleus. The results do not suggest a generalised deficiency of glutamine synthetase in Huntington's disease. However, as this enzyme is localised to astrocytic cells, the reduction in activity in areas of neuronal devastation, where the ration of astrocytes to neurones is increased, may reflect a greater functional deficit. The enzyme plays a crucial role in cerebral ammonia assimilation and its inhibition in laboratory animals is known to produce neuronal toxicity. A reduction in its activity in Huntington's disease may well contribute to the neuronal pathology in certain areas.
