We investigated the age-related changes of gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T, a GABA degradation enzyme) in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus of the gerbil at postnatal month 1 (PM 1), PM 3, PM 6, PM 12, and PM 24. Age-related changes of GABA-T immunoreactivity were distinct in the hippocampal CA1 region and in the dentate gyrus. GABA-T immunoreactivity was weak at PM 1, but at PM 3, it had increased significantly, and then increased further. Between PM 6 and PM 12, strong GABA-T immunoreactivity was found in nonpyramidal cells (GABAergic) in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region, and at PM 6, strong GABA-T immunoreactivity was found in neurons of the dentate gyrus subgranular zone. At PM 24, CA1 pyramidal cells showed strong GABA-T immunoreactivity. Western blot analysis showed a pattern of GABA-T expression similar to that shown by immunohistochemistry at various ages. In conclusion, our results suggest that the age-related changes of GABA-T provide important information about the aged brain with GABA dysfunction.
