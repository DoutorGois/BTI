We examined the gene expression responses of GABA-B R1A, R1B and R2 receptor subtypes in the hippocampus of perforant pathway-kindled rats at 24 h and 28 days after 15 consecutive daily stimulations. We found R1A expression, but not R1B expression, to be significantly induced in the dentate gyrus at 24 h. No change in the expression of R1A or R1B was observed at 28 days. R2 expression was induced throughout the hippocampus at 24 h, but also returned to control levels by 28 days. Thus, our results show that kindling induces a transient increase in GABA-B receptor mRNA in the hippocampus.
