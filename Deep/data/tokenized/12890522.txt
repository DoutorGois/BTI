Electrophysiological investigation of basal synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was carried out in anesthetized obese Zucker rats (OZR). Comparison of the input/output curves of basal field excitatory postsynaptic potential indicates that these are similar in both the OZR and its lean counterpart suggesting that basal synaptic transmission is intact in the OZR. However, high frequency stimulation evokes long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lean rat but not in the OZR. Since post-tetanic potentiation and paired pulse facilitation, forms of short-term potentiation of presynaptic origin, are also severely impaired in the OZR, the results imply that impairment of CA1 hippocampal LTP in these obese rats may be due, in part, to impaired presynaptic function. The results emphasize the potential deleterious effect of obesity on learning and memory functions of the CNS.
