It has been suggested that memories become more stable and less susceptible to the disruption of reconsolidation over weeks after learning. Here, we test this by targeting the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and test its involvement in the formation, consolidation, and reconsolidation of recent and remote contextual fear memory. We found that inhibiting NMDAR-NR2B activity disrupts memory formation, and that infusion of the protein-synthesis inhibitor anisomycin impairs memory consolidation and reconsolidation of recent and remote memory. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the ACC plays an important role in reconsolidation of contextual fear memory at recent and remote time points.
