The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and is important in learning and memory. NMDARs are influenced by aging and implicated in neurodegenerative disorders. We investigated age-related differences in NMDAR ionic currents and intracellular calcium in embryonic (E18), middle-age (9-10 month) and old (26 month) rat hippocampal neurons cultured in serum-free medium for 7-12 days. Responses to 200 microM NMDA with 50 microM glycine were measured using whole cell voltage clamp and fura-2 fluorescence. Embryonic neurons exhibited significantly larger and faster NMDA responses than adults. Old rats had 1.5 fold greater normalized NMDA peak current compared to middle-age rats, while intracellular calcium rose 1.3 fold higher. Differences in regression slopes generated from the integral of NMDA current versus normalized NMDA current indicate age-related differences are not exclusively due to changes in receptor density but likely influenced by changes in receptor function. Corresponding age-related measures of intracellular calcium by fura-2 fluorescence in response to NMDA showed a strong correlation with peak current (r(2)=0.996). Our data support the hypothesis that NMDAR responsiveness is altered during aging with an enhanced NMDA peak current in both old and embryonic neurons compared to middle-age neurons.
