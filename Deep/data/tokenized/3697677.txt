The morphological plasticity of synaptic junctions was investigated by means of quantitative stereology in the dentate gyrus supragranular layer of young (3 months), adult (12 months) and old (30 months) female Fisher 344 rats. The numerical (Nv) and surface (Sv) density and the average surface area (S) of EPTA-stained synaptic junctions were calculated on 100 EM pictures per age group. We found that Nv significantly increased between the young and adult group and decreased in old animals when compared both to 3 and 12 months of age. Sv was unchanged in young and adult rats, whereas it underwent a significant reduction in the old group. The percentage distribution of S showed that at 3 months of age the majority of the synaptic population had an average size ranging between 0.12 and 0.20 micron 2, whereas during adulthood and aging there was a shift towards smaller and larger synaptic contacts, respectively. Taking into account Nv, Sv and S all together per age group, the present findings demonstrate that the morphological aspect of synaptic plasticity is markedly influenced by time and that during aging it undergoes a serious impairment. The possible involvement in memory and learning processes of these synaptic age-related morphological adaptations and the fact that the investigated junctions are supposed to be cholinergic is discussed.
