The popularization of microwave raised concerns about its influence on health including cognitive function which is associated greatly with dendritic spines plasticity. SNK-SPAR is a molecular pathway for neuronal homeostatic plasticity during chronically elevated activity. In this study, Wistar rats were exposed to microwaves (30mW/cm(2) for 6min, 3 times/week for 6weeks). Spatial learning and memory function, distribution of dendritic spines, ultrastructure of the neurons and their dendritic spines in hippocampus as well as the related critical molecules of SNK-SPAR pathway were examined at different time points after microwave exposure. There was deficiency in spatial learning and memory in rats, loss of spines in granule cells and shrinkage of mature spines in pyramidal cells, accompanied with alteration of ultrastructure of hippocampus neurons. After exposure to 30mW/cm(2) microwave radiation, the up-regulated SNK induced decrease of SPAR and PSD-95, which was thought to cause the changes mentioned above. In conclusion, the microwave radiation led to shrinkage and even loss of dendritic spines in hippocampus by SNK-SPAR pathway, resulting in the cognitive impairments.
