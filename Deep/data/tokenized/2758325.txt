The influence of the interval of the repeated reversible transient cerebral ischemia on the neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 sector was investigated in the rats using a 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model. A single 3-min 4-VO did not produce any significant neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 sector, whereas the rats subjected to three 3-min 4-VO at 1-h intervals revealed a very severe neuronal damage which was much more severe than that in the rats subjected to a single 9-min 4-VO. In contrast, the rats subjected to three 3-min 4-VO at 6-h intervals revealed only a mild neuronal damage. The degree of the neuronal damage in the rats subjected to three 3-min 4-VO at 5-min intervals was similar to that in the rats subjected to a single 9-min 4-VO. The present study indicates that even such a brief, non-lethal ischemia as 3-min 4-VO can produce a severe neuronal damage if it occurs repeatedly at 1-h intervals.
