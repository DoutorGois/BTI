Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the level of antioxidants and oxidants in a cell. Oxidative stress has been shown in brain of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as well Alzheimer's disease (AD). MCI is considered as a transition phase between control and AD. The focus of the current study was to identify nitrated proteins in the hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) brain regions of subjects with amnestic MCI using proteomics. The identified nitrated proteins in MCI brain were compared to those previously reported to be nitrated and oxidatively modified in AD brain, a comparison that might provide an invaluable insight into the progression of the disease.
