Depression represents one of the most disabling comorbidities of epilepsy and impacts profoundly negatively on the quality of life of patients with epilepsy. Some of the clinical features of depression in patients with epilepsy suggest a neurobiological connection, although it is difficult to eliminate psychosocial and iatrogenic factors in human studies. Basic research in animal models has involved the study of depression in a model of absence epilepsy as well as models of limbic epilepsy. In this chapter we focus on studies on animal models with emphasis on discernible mechanistic connections between epilepsy and depression. Depression-like behaviors of despair (immobility in the forced swim test) and anhedonia (loss of preference for sweetened water) have been described in the generalized spike-wave epilepsy model involving the WAG/Rij strain of rats as well as models of limbic epilepsy. The rapid-kindling model of epileptogenesis is not accompanied by discernible injury to the hippocampus or other structures. The lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus (SE)-induced temporal lobe epilepsy displays hippocampal and extra-hippocampal injury and plasticity associated with human temporal lobe epilepsy. Both models produced despair, anhedonia, and alterations in the raphe-hippocampal serotonergic pathways. Pharmacologic studies on the post-SE animals revealed enhanced interleukin-1beta signaling in the hippocampus and augmentation of "gain" in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Chronic infusion of recombinant interleukin receptor antagonist into the hippocampus, as well as infusion of a selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist or selective 5-HT1A blocker into the raphe restored evoked serotonin release and behavior. These studies furnish a model system to serve as a screening platform for developing therapies to manage the comorbidity between epilepsy and depression.
