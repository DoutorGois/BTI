Unilateral damage to the lateral fimbria led to a bilateral gliosis in the septum and hippocampus. The gliosis was manifested by an increase in GFAP staining, accompanied by an increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)(+) cells and GFAP content; the latter however was not visible in the contralateral septum. In general, the contralateral reaction appeared weaker than the ipsilateral one. The pattern of contralateral increase in GFAP-immunoreactivity (IR) matched almost exactly that observed on the ipsilateral side in the hippocampus (the most evident increase was seen in the oriens and pyramidal layers of cornu Ammonis 3 and in polymorphic area of gyrus dentatus). In the septum the bilateral increase in GFAP-IR was mainly visible in the dorsolateral quadrant of the structure; however in the ipsilateral side it spread over the whole half of the structure. The astrocytic responses in the septum and hippocampus were not equivalent: they differed mainly with regard to the increase of GFAP(+) cells (over 300% of control in the anterior part of the septum and only about 120% in the dorsal hippocampus). The differences between the percentage increases of other gliotic indices: GFAP-IR and GFAP content. Various possibilities that may account for the occurrence of contralateral gliosis are discussed, the most plausible being the contribution of interhemispheric and intraseptal links and the action of some diffusible agents. We suggest that bilateral gliosis may have an impact on compensatory postlesion processes, possibly by providing trophic support to impaired neurons.
