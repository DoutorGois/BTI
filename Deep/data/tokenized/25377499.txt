We report the autopsy results of a patient with familial dementia who was diagnosed as having frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) with an R406W mutation in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene. This patient showed Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like clinical manifestations from the age of 59, with reduced beta-amyloid1-42 (Abeta42 ) and elevated total and phosphorylated tau levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. He did not present with any apparent parkinsonism throughout the disease course. His autopsy at age 73 showed atrophy and neurodegeneration in many brain regions, particularly in the antero-medial temporal cortex and hippocampus, followed by the frontal lobes, with abundant neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, a diffuse distribution of Abeta-positive senile plaques, including many neuritic plaques, was observed and classified as stage C according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria. These results suggest that analyzing of the MAPT gene is essential for diagnosing familial dementia, even if amyloid markers such as Abeta42 in the cerebrospinal fluid and amyloid imaging are positive, or if neuropathological findings indicate a diagnosis of AD.
