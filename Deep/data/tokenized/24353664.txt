OBJECTIVE: To discuss the treatment effects and costs of surgery and Gamma Knife on hippocampal sclerosis (HS)-induced intractable epilepsy of children below age 10 years. METHODS: The children below age 10 years who suffered from HS-induced intractable epilepsy from June 2010 to June 2012 were subjected to surgical and Gamma Knife treatments respectively according to their preference. RESULTS: The short-term curative rates of the surgical group and the Gamma Knife group were 93.51% and 54.87%, respectively. The average expenses of the two groups were 10,000 CNY (Chinese Yuan) and 22,000 CNY, respectively. CONCLUSION: The two groups were treated safely and effectively, but the surgical treatment led to better results at a reduced cost.
