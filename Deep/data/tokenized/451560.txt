Implants of embryonic neural tissue from all regions of the neuraxis survive grafting to the brains of adult rats. After implantation, neurogenesis and differentiation continue, and connections are formed with the mature host brain. Thus, the intracephalic implants provide excellent model systems for studying cellular interactions that regulate synaptogenesis and determine the cytoarchitectonic organization of developing neural tissues.
