In several species caloric restriction (CR) extends life span. In this paper we integrate data from studies on CR and other sources to articulate the hypothalamic deregulation hypothesis by which estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) signaling in the hypothalamus and limbic system affects life span under the stress of CR in mammals. ER-alpha is one of two principal estrogen-binding receptors differentially expressed in the amygdala, hippocampus, and several key hypothalamic nuclei: the arcuate nucleus (ARN), preoptic area (POA), ventromedial nucleus (VMN), antero ventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Estradiol signaling via ER-alpha is essential in basal level functioning of reproductive cycle, sexually receptive behaviors, physiological stress responses, as well as sleep cycle, and other nonsexual behaviors. When an organism is placed under long-term CR, which introduces an external stress to this ER-alpha signaling, the reduction of ER-alpha expression is attenuated over time in the hypothalamus. This review paper seeks to characterize the downstream effects of ER-alpha in the hypothalamus and limbic system that affect normal endocrine functioning.
