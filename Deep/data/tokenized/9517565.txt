In the central nervous system (CNS), nitric oxide (NO) is thought to be involved in a variety of functions including synaptic plasticity, long term potentiation, and neurotoxicity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the mouse CNS, following surgical injury to the hippocampus. NOS expression was assessed by histochemical detection of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-diaphorase) activity and immunohistochemistry of the inducible NOS (iNOS). Two days after injury to the CA1 hippocampal field, NADPH-diaphorase activity was detected in pyramidal and granular neurons and also in glial cells in the hippocampus, in contrast to the non-injured one where NADPH-diaphorase staining was observed only in a few interneurons. NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry combined with immunolabelling for GFAP and F4/80 demonstrated that these glial cells were astrocytes and microglia. This pattern of NOS expression is induced specifically after a hippocampal injury since lesion to the prefrontal or cerebellar cortex leads to NOS activity only in monocytes/macrophages like cells. Despite the large expression of NOS detected by NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry after lesioning the hippocampus, immunostaining for iNOS was confined to microglia. The fact that induction of high levels of NOS activity are detected in glial cells after a lesion to the hippocampus could be accounted for by the sensitivity of this structure to a high release of glutamate.
