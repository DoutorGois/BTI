We utilized a model of fluid percussion (FP) brain injury in the rat to examine the hypothesis that alterations in brain neuropeptide Y (NPY) concentrations occur following brain injury. Male rats (n = 44) were subjected to FP traumatic brain injury. One group of animals (n = 38) was killed at 1 min, 15 min, 1 h, or 24 h after brain injury, and regional brain homogenates were analyzed for NPY concentrations using radioimmunoassay. A second group of animals (n = 6) was killed for NPY immunocytochemistry. Concentrations of NPY in the injured left parietal cortex were significantly elevated at 15 min post injury (p less than 0.05). No changes were observed in other brain regions. NPY-immunoreactive fibers were seen at 15 min post injury predominantly in the injured cortex and adjacent hippocampus. These temporal changes in NPY immunoreactivity, together with previous observations concerning posttraumatic changes in regional CBF in these same areas, suggest that an increase in region NPY concentrations after brain injury may be involved in part in the pathogenesis of posttraumatic hypoperfusion.
