The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of pre- and early postnatal social stress on the functioning of hormonal, autonomic and behavioural systems, by studying the distribution of sex hormone receptors in limbic brain systems. Dams had either lived in groups with a constant composition (= stable social environment) or in groups with changing compositions, i.e. every third day, two females from different groups were exchanged (= unstable social environment). The subjects were male offspring of dams who had either lived in a stable social environment during pregnancy and lactation (= control males) or in an unstable social environment during this period of life (= early stressed males). From days 20-80, the spontaneous behaviour of control males and early stressed males was recorded in their home cages. Five control males and five early stressed males were killed at 75 days, and five control males and five early stressed males at 120 days. Blood samples were taken to determine serum concentrations of cortisol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and oestrogen. The adrenals were prepared to determine tyrosine hydroxylase activities and the brains were used to investigate the distribution of sex-hormone receptors in specific hypothalamic and hippocampal brain areas. Early stressed males showed a behavioural infantilization that was accompanied by significantly decreased adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activities and dehydroepiandrosterone levels. Furthermore, early stressed males showed a down-regulation of androgen receptors in the medial preoptic area and the nucleus arcuatus of the hypothalamus, as well as of oestrogen receptor alpha in the hippocampus compared to control males. Thus, the present study provides clear evidence that early social stress induces changes in endocrine, autonomic and limbic brain function, which is mirrored by changes in male social behaviour.
