PyramidaL cells in CA1 hippocampus show two types of increase in the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) during paired pulse stimulation of the afferent fibres in stratum radiatum. For 15-300 ms interstimulus intervals, both the initial slope and the peak amplitude of the EPSP are increased, which is mainly due to an increased excitatory synaptic current. For 300 ms-2 s intervals, the predominant change is an increase in the peak amplitude. The latter type of facilitation is caused by a decrease in a superimposed inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).
