It has been hypothesized that impaired serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission contributes to the pathophysiology of depression. Recently, it was shown in adult animals that antidepressants which influence 5-HT levels increase hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation, suggesting an important role of the 5-HT system in the regulation of adult neurogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of partial 5-HT denervation of the adult rat forebrain caused by a single para-chloroamphetamine (PCA) administration (10 mg/kg, s.c.) on hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation measured by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry over a 3-week time period. Moreover, behavior of rats was analyzed by using the forced swimming test which serves as a so-called animal model of depression. One week after PCA administration, a significant decrease of Ki-67 immunopositive cells and cell clusters (-25% and -53%, respectively) was found which was recovered over the 3-week period. The decrease in progenitor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus per animal was positively correlated with the 5-HT denervation. Behavioral analysis of rats revealed no significant differences between vehicle and PCA-treated animals at any of the examined time points. These findings indicate a regulative role of 5-HT for hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis, but its relation to animal models of depression remains to be elucidated.
