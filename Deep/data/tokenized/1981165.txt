Extracellular recordings of field potentials in area CA1 of the rat hippocampal slice have been used to investigate paired-pulse facilitation. Field potentials were evoked by maximal stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibres. The height of the population spike (PS) in stratum pyramidale (str. pyr.) and the area under the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) following the PS in the stratum radiatum (str. rad.) were quantified. These values were used to describe the time course of paired-pulse facilitation. Facilitation of the PS was maximal 50 ms after the conditioning pulse and was present over a period of about 500 ms. However, facilitation of the late area (LA) of the field EPSP was maximal afer 125 ms and had an overall duration of 1-2 s. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), had no effect on paired-pulse facilitation of either the LA or the PS. The gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) agonist baclofen increased facilitation of the PS. This was mainly due to a reduction of the unconditioned response. Facilitation of the LA was reduced by both baclofen and the GABAB antagonist, 2-OH-saclofen. Baclofen increased the LA of the unconditioned response, while this was unaffected by 2-OH-saclofen. The LA of facilitated responses was decreased by 2-OH-saclofen while the effect of baclofen on these responses was more complex. Baclofen reduced the LA of maximally facilitated responses, while the LA of slightly facilitated responses was increased. The results show that different mechanisms are involved in the facilitation of the LA and the PS. Furthermore, activation of GABAB receptors makes a large contribution to paired-pulse facilitation of the field EPSP. It is also suggested that recording of extracellular fields in str. rad. in response to paired-pulse stimulation provides a simple electrophysiological model for testing the effect of agents which act at the GABAB receptor.
