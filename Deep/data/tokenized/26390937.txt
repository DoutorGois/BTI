An imbalance of intracellular calcium homeostasis induced by amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as deficits in learning and memory. Therefore, regulation of calcium homeostasis may represent a new strategy for treatment of AD. Growing evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and AD are closely related in pathogenesis. Thus, drugs used in treatment of T2DM may modify the pathogenesis of AD. This study demonstrated that Exendin-4, which is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog used as a therapeutic drug for T2DM, significantly antagonized suppression of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by Abeta1-42 in the rat hippocampal CA1 region in vivo. This neuroprotection may be mediated by regulation of calcium homeostasis. Pretreatment with Exendin-4 suppressed Abeta1-42-induced elevation in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) through L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Furthermore, Exendin-4 antagonized the decrease in p-Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha (p-CaMKIIalpha) induced by Abeta1-42 in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of Exendin-4, which likely involve regulation of calcium homeostasis, provide theoretical support for using Exendin-4 to treat and prevent AD in the future.
