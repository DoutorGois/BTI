The effect of glycemic state on status epilepticus (SE) development was studied in animals of different ages, submitted to pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Groups: I- Rats with 9-day-old (P9): IA. Submitted to 1SE; IB. Saline-treated; IC. Induced- hyperglycemia; ID. Induced- hyperglycemia+SE; II- Rats submitted to three consecutive episodes of SE at P7, P8 and P9; III- Rats submitted to 1SE at P17; IV- Rats submitted to 1SE at P21. Hippocampal cell death and the expression of glucose transporter GLUT3 were analyzed in group I. The results demonstrated normoglycemia in the groups IA, IB and II, hypoglycemia in group III and hyperglycemia in group IV, showing that the glycemia during SE is age dependent. Induced hyperglycemia during SE in P9 protected the hippocampal neurons from death and both groups IC and ID presented increased GLUT3 expression, showing high glucose consumption by the hippocampus.
