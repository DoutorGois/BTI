OBJECTIVE: To find out the differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of the rats with genetic epilepsy so as to lay a foundation for exploring the pathogenesis of epilepsy by means of cDNA array technology. METHODS: Gene expression patterns in the hippocampus of the genetic epilepsy-prone P77PMC rats and normal Wistar rats were established using the alpha-32P-labeled cDNA probes hybridized with the Atlas Rat cDNA Expression Array, and then were analyzed by an image analysis instrument to get the differentially expressed genes. RESULTS: Fifteen genes were found having differential expression patterns in hippocampus between the P77PMC rats and the Wistar rats, while there may be many other differentially expressed genes left undiscovered due to having no appropriate image analysis software. And among the fifteen genes, the expression levels of twelve genes in the P77PMC rats were higher than those in the Wistar rats, while the expression levels of the other three genes were lower. The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) have demonstrated the reliability of cDNA arrays method. CONCLUSION: cDNA array is a powerful tool for identifying differential expression genes of epilepsy on large scales. There are several differentially expressed genes in hippocampus of the P77PMC rats and the Wistar rats. All these identified genes could play potentially important roles in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
