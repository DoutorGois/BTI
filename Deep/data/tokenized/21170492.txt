The accumulation of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) plaques is identified as a major pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies show that soluble species of Abeta are involved in the early memory dysfunction long before neurodegenerative changes. However, the mechanism underlying the neurotoxicity of soluble Abeta is still unclear. Long-term potentiation (LTP) has been thought as an important cellular model of synaptic plasticity for many years. The studies on the hippocampal LTP and Abeta, especially those using AD transgenic models, provided more evidence for the Abeta-induced dysfunction of learning and memory. Based on the recent researches on AD, this article reviewed the effects of Abeta, especially soluble Abeta and its active fragments, on the hippocampal LTP. The possible mechanisms by which Abeta impairs hippocampal LTP are also discussed.
