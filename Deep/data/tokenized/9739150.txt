Transport of fragmented DNA in apical dendrites of the CA1 pyramidal neurons of gerbil hippocampus is observed in the apoptotic process following transient forebrain ischemia. The time-course of specific DNA fragmentation was examined after the ischemic insult by in situ nick-end-labeling method and fluorescence detection technique by DAPI. Although the role of the fragmented DNA movement is unclear, the transport mechanism of fragmented DNA is still active in the late phase of apoptotic process.
