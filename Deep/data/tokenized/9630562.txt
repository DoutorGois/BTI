To gain insight into the neurochemical pathologies contributing to AIDS dementia complex, neurotransmitter levels were measured in the brains of mice infected with the LP-BM5 leukemia retrovirus. These mice develop immunologic and cognitive deficits analogous to human HIV-1 infection. Met-enkephalin and substance-P levels declined approximately 50% in the striatum and hypothalamus beginning as early as 4 weeks after infection. Hippocampal met-enkephalin levels were reduced to 50% only at 12 weeks after inoculation. Significant decreases (60-70%) in acetylcholine concentrations were observed in the striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus by 12 weeks after virus inoculation, while striatal GABA concentrations decreased to 50-60% at 8-12 weeks after infection. Striatal somatostatin levels were unchanged. Administration of the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 or LY 274614 ameliorated the decline in striatal met-enkephalin levels observed in mice after 8 weeks of infection. This pattern of neurotransmitter depletion and the ability of NMDA receptor antagonists to attenuate the loss of striatal met-enkephalin are consistent with an excitotoxic lesion. Thus, the elevation of glutamate levels secondary to glial activation may contribute to the contemporaneous development of cognitive deficits observed in mice infected with the LP-BM5 virus.
