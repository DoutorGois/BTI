To understand the molecular actions of status epilepticus at the chromatin level, we studied the effects of kainate-induced status epilepticus on two different histone modifications at amino terminal tails: histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 and histone H4 acetylation. In addition to induction of c-fos and c-jun immediate early genes (IEGs) expression in mouse hippocampus, we also found the upregulation of acetylation and phosphorylation of histones, coupled with status epilepticus after kainate administration. c-fos and c-jun mRNA were sequentially induced in response to kainate, in different hippocampal subpopulations, starting from the dentate gyrus (DG) and spreading to the cornus ammonis regions. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the spatio-temporal distribution of histone H4 hyperacetylation after kainate treatment was well correlated with the expression of c-fos and c-jun genes. Additionally, there was a transient appearance of phosphorylated histone H3 specifically in the DG region. CREB-binding protein or CBP, a well-known transcriptional co-activator with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, was also induced by kainate and its expression pattern well correlated with histone H4 hyperacetylation in the hippocampus. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that both histone modifications were associated with c-fos gene promoter after kainate stimulation, but only histone acetylation with c-jun gene. Pretreatment with curcumin, which has a HAT inhibitory activity specific for CBP/p300, attenuated histone modifications, IEGs expression and also the severity of status epilepticus after kainate treatment. Our findings suggest the involvement of histone modifications induced by kainate not only in IEGs expression but also in the development of epilepsy.
