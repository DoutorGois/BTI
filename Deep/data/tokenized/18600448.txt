In the brain stem glycine is associated with multiple sensory and visceral regulations, being involved in, for instance, cardiovascular, respiratory and auditory functions. We here studied the mechanisms of the release of preloaded [(3)H]glycine from mouse brain stem slices in a superfusion system. A depolarizing concentration of K(+) ions (50 mM) evoked glycine release, but in the absence of Ca(2+) the effect was attenuated, indicating that a part of the evoked release represents Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis. The Ca(2+)-independent release was enhanced by omission of Na(+) and Cl(-). The stimulatory effect of extracellular glycine confirmed the involvement of transporters functioning in a reverse direction. A part of the release is mediated by Na(+) and Cl(-) channels, since it was inhibited by the inhibitors of these, riluzole and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulphonate, respectively. Glycine release was potentiated by the activation of protein kinase C and diminished by increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast. The release was also modulated by the phospholipase inhibitor quinacrine and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. Adenosine A(1) receptors likewise regulate glycine release, since it was enhanced by their agonist R(-)N(6)-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine, which effect was blocked by the antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists N-methyl-D: -aspartate, kainate and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate failed to have any effects contrary to their effects in higher brain regions, e.g., in the hippocampus. The group I and III metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine and O-phospho-L: -serine, respectively, increased the release in a receptor-mediated manner. Glycine release in the brain stem was also markedly enhanced by cell-damaging conditions, including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and ischemia.
