Different mechanisms of neurotransmitter secretion at synapses have been ascribed to quantal, transient signals [4-9] and to continuous, tonic activity [11, 21, 25]. Quantal transmission is imputed to be the release of transmitter packets, or quanta [6], assembled and stored in vesicles present in presynaptic terminals [2,8]. We report that 300 microM Zn2+ rapidly transformed tonic Cl- conductance mediated by the transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into transient synaptic-like signals. After addition of Zn2+, the size of the elementary fluctuations in the Cl- current progressively increased while randomly activated Cl- channel kinetics remained unchanged and accounted for the bi-exponential time course of average transient decay. The results suggest that Zn2+ rapidly transforms tonic GABA secretion into quantal-like transient release.
