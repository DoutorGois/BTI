In order to determine the role of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in free fatty acid (FFA) liberation during cerebral ischemia, we examined the effect of in situ administration of kynurenic acid, a broad-spectrum antagonist of EAA receptors, by microdialysis on the increase in FFA levels during ischemia in the rat hippocampus. A transient rapid increase in FFA levels, superimposed on a continued slow increase, was observed beginning at 1-2 min after ischemia induction. The early rapid increase in FFAs was profoundly inhibited by kynurenic acid, suggesting that EAAs are critically involved in the early phase of FFA liberation. Development of massive ionic shifts during cerebral ischemia can be delayed for several minutes by kynurenic acid administered by the same procedure, suggesting a vital role for EAAs in the early appearance of anoxic depolarization. The observed inhibition of early FFA liberation may thus be attributable to the delay in development of massive ionic shifts and resultant neurotransmitter release which may activate phospholipase A2 and C.
