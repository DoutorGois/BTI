OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Wuling Capsule, a compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on hippocampal neurogenesis by examining the expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and connexin 43 (Cx43) in rats with depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS), and thereby to explore its antidepressant mechanism. METHODS: Forty-five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group (n=15), untreated group (n=15) and Wuling group (n=15). All rats except those in the control group were subjected to 3-week CMS to induce depression. At the same time Wuling Capsule was daily added to the diet of the rats in the Wuling group at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight for 21 days. The degree of depression was determined by sucrose preference test. BDNF expression and neurogenesis were tested by using immunohistochemical staining with BDNF and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) antibodies; and the mRNA and protein expression levels of Cx43 in hippocampus were examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. RESULTS: The numbers of BDNF-positive neurons and BrdU-positive particles in dentate gyrus (DG) were significantly decreased in CMS rats as compared with the normal rats, and the same changes were found in Cx43 mRNA and protein expressions. After Wuling Capsule treatment, the depressed behaviors were improved. Moreover, the reduced expression levels of Cx43 mRNA and protein and fewer newborn neurons induced by CMS were recovered to the normal levels. However, BDNF-positive cells remained low in DG. CONCLUSION: Wuling Capsule can improve the low hippocampal neurogenesis in rats subjected to CMS and the antidepressant effects are related to enhancing the Cx43 expression but not through BDNF mediation.
