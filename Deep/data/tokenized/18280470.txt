The glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) precursor contains several putative sites for prohormone convertase-mediated excision of short peptides. Here, we show that one of the predicted peptides, named BEP (brain excitatory peptide), induces a substantial increase in the synaptic excitability in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons. The excitation is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor.
