It has been well known that magnesium ion (Mg(2+)) plays an important role in biological functions, especially in neural activities and functions. However, not so many researches have been carried to this subject. Here we investigated the Mg(2+)effect on neuronal electrical activities together with NMDA receptor and synaptic glutamate release by using Multi-Electrode Array (MEA) and Enzyme modified MEA-based multi-array sensor.
