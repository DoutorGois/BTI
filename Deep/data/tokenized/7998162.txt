The results from this study provided the first piece of evidence that intrahippocampal transplants of cholinergic-rich spinal grafts derived from a human fetus can ameliorate the performance of fornix lesioned rats in both spatial reference memory and spatial navigation tasks. Although many questions remain to be answered, these results point to the therapeutic potential of human fetus-derived cholinergic-rich grafts in treating spatial memory impairments.
