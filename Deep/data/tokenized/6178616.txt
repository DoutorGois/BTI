Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of des-Tyr1-gamma-endorphin (0.1 and 1.0 microgram) caused a decrease of the serotonin (5-HT) concentration of the hippocampus. The concentration of 5-HIAA and the pargyline-induced alterations in 5-HT and 5-HIAA were not affected. No effects were noticed in other brain regions.
