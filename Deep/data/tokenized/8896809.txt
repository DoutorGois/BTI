The interaction of chronic in vivo lead exposure and acute in vitro ethanol treatment on synaptic neurotransmission and plasticity were studied using extracellular electrophysiological techniques in CA1 region of hippocampal brain slices from adult rats. Neither chronic lead exposure nor acute ethanol treatment had any significant effect on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). In vivo lead exposure enhanced short-term potentiation (STP, potentiation that decays within 30 min) by 21% shortly after 'weak' tetanus, but had no effect on long-term potentiation (LTP, sustained at least 1 h). In vitro bath application of 60 mM ethanol inhibited STP by 35% and blocked LTP induced by 'weak' tetanus in slices from Pb exposed rats (500 ppm lead acetate, 56-70 days), while having no effect on STP or LTP in slices from control counterpart Na-exposed rats (pair-fed 216 ppm sodium acetate). In contrast, 'strong'-tetanus-induced LTP was abolished in Pb-exposed slices, and 60 mM ethanol slightly inhibited STP and blocked LTP in slices from Na-exposed rats. These differences could not be explained by differences in ethanol inhibition of NMDA-mediated field EPSPs because they were similarly reduced in slices from Na-exposed (30%) and Pb-exposed (25%) rats. These findings suggest that the strength of the tetanus used determines whether or not synaptic plasticity is blocked by either chronic lead exposure or acute ethanol treatment, and that even in adult rats, hippocampal synaptic LTP can be compromised by combined exposure to ethanol and lead. More importantly, these findings suggest the consequences of combined lead exposure and alcohol abuse in the adult human population may not be fully recognized yet.
