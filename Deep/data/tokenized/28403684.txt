BACKGROUND: In recent years, a substantial amount of experimental studies have demonstrated that exogenous administration of corticosterone causes anxiety and depressive-like behaviour in rodents which involves hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation. Our present study aimed to explore the neuroprotective potential of mangiferin against corticosterone-induced anxiety and depressive-like behaviour. METHODS: Corticosterone (40 mg/kg; subcutaneously) was administered once daily in swiss albino mice for 21 days. Mice were treated simultaneously with mangiferin (40 mg/kg; p.o.), 30 min prior to the corticosterone injection. RESULTS: Chronic administration of corticosterone caused anxiety and depressive-like behaviour in mice which was significantly alleviated by mangiferin treatment. Biochemical analysis revealed that mangiferin treatment significantly attenuated corticosterone-induced oxido-nitrosative stress and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus region. Furthermore, concomitant treatment with mangiferin significantly enhanced the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level and decreased the serum corticosterone level in the corticosterone-treated animals. Western blotting analysis revealed that corticosterone administration significantly up-regulated the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) protein expression level in the hippocampus which was significantly reduced by mangiferin treatment. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that mangiferin exerts anti-anxiety and antidepressant effect in corticosterone-treated rats, which is probably mediated through up-regulation of BDNF level along with inhibition of oxido-nitrosative stress, neuroinflammation and IDO up-regulation in the hippocampus region.
