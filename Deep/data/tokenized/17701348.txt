In the present study we investigated the effect of chronic hypermethioninemia on rat performance in the Morris water maze task, as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in rat cerebral cortex. For chronic treatment, rats received subcutaneous injections of methionine (1.34-2.68 micromol/g of body weight), twice a day, from the 6th to the 28th day of age; control rats received the same volume of saline solution. Groups of rats were killed 3 h, 12 h or 30 days after the last injection of methionine to AChE assay and another group was left to recover until the 60th day of life to assess the effect of early methionine administration on reference and working spatial memory of rats. AChE activity was also determined after behavioral task. Results showed that chronic treatment with methionine did not alter reference memory when compared to saline-treated animals. In the working memory task, we observed a significant days effect with significant differences between control and methionine-treated animals. Chronic hypermethioninemia significantly increased AChE activity at 3 h, 12 h or 30 days after the last injection of methionine, as well as before or after behavioral test. The effect of acute hypermethioninemia on AChE was also evaluated. For acute treatment, 29-day-old rats received one single injection of methionine (2.68 micromol/g of body weight) or saline and were killed 1, 3 or 12 h later. Results showed that acute administration of methionine did not alter cerebral cortex AChE activity. Our findings suggest that chronic experimental hypermethioninemia caused cognitive dysfunction and an increase of AChE activity that might be related, at least in part, to the neurological problems presented by hypermethioninemic patients.
