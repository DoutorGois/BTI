Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (A beta) fibrils with microglia. In an in vitro microglial culture, we recently found that heat-shock protein-90 (Hsp90) enhanced the microglial phagocytosis and clearance of A beta (1-42) (A beta 42). In this study, we examined the microinjection of A beta 42 in the presence or absence of Hsp90 into the rat hippocampus in vivo. Intrahippocampal injection of A beta 42 alone induced microglial accumulation, and the amount of A beta 42 then gradually decreased. In addition, simultaneous injection with Hsp90 significantly reduced the amount of A beta 42 and increased the production of cytokines. These results suggest that Hsp90 may facilitate microglial A beta 42 clearance in rat brain in vivo.
