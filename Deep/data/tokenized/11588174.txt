The mammalian CNS contains an abundance of chelatable Zn(2+) sequestered in the vesicles of glutamatergic terminals. These vesicles are particularly numerous in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses of the hilar and CA3 regions. Our recent observation of frequency-dependent Zn(2+) release from mossy fiber synaptic terminals and subsequent entry into postsynaptic neurons has prompted us to investigate the role of synaptically released Zn(2+) in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in field CA3 of the hippocampus. The rapid removal of synaptically released Zn(2+) with the membrane-impermeable Zn(2+) chelator CaEDTA (10 mm) blocked induction of NMDA receptor-independent mossy fiber LTP by high-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) in rat hippocampal slices. Mimicking Zn(2+) release by bath application of Zn(2+) (50-100 microm) without HFS induced a long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission that lasted more than 3 hr. Moreover, our experiments indicate the effects of Zn(2+) were not attributable to its interaction with extracellular membrane proteins but required its entry into presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons. Co-released glutamate is also essential for induction of LTP under physiological conditions, in part because it allows Zn(2+) entry into postsynaptic neurons. These results indicate that synaptically released Zn(2+), acting as a second messenger, is necessary for the induction of LTP at mossy fiber-->CA3 synapses of hippocampus.
