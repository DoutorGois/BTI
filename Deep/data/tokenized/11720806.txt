Exposure to impulse noise, i.e. pressure waves, is above a certain intensity, harmful to auditory function. Intense, short-lasting impulse noise of 198 or 202 dB affects the heavy subunit of neurofilament proteins in neuronal perikarya of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. There was as well an increased expression of immediate early gene products and induction of neuronal apoptosis. Here, we show that this range of exposure also affects glial cells. We identified microglial cells with an antibody against the complement receptor type 3 (OX-42) and astrocytes with an antibody against the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The pattern of damage included microglial activation as early as 2 h after exposure to 202 dB. The activation increased further at 18 h. There was a significant increase of the area occupied by microglial cells in the anterior and posterior hypothalamus and in the lateral septal nucleus. Astrogliosis was observed in the cerebral cortex, the dentate gyrus and in the pyramidal cell layers as well as in white matter of the hippocampus. Both the microglial and astrocytic reactivities remained at 21 days. Exposure to 198 dB, caused similar, but less prominent activation in both cell types.
