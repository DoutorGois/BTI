Whole-cell patch-clamp was used to investigate synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. Excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) were facilitated by low (less than or equal to 1 microM) adenosine (Ado) concentrations, while high concentrations had well-known inhibitory effects on the EPSC. When added on the background of preapplied Ado, methylxanthines caused a large potentiation of EPSCs. At saturation, the enhanced EPSC could exceed the control almost by an order of magnitude. Pertussis toxin strongly impaired the ability of Ado to block EPSCs but did not augment the facilitatory effect. The two components of the EPSC mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors were facilitated simultaneously and in equal proportions.
