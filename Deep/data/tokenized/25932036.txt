PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effects of mild hypoxia in the mature and immature brain. METHODS: We prepared organotypic slice cultures of the hippocampus and used hippocampal tissue cultures at 7 and 14 days in vitro (DIV) to represent the immature and mature brain, respectively. Tissue cultures were exposed to 10% oxygen for 60 minutes. Twenty-four hours after this hypoxic insult, propidium iodide fluorescence images were obtained, and the damaged areas in the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) were measured using image analysis. RESULTS: In the 7-DIV group compared to control tissue, hypoxia-exposed tissue showed decreased damage in two regions (CA1: 5.59%+/-2.99% vs. 4.80%+/-1.37%, P=0.900; DG: 33.88%+/-12.53% vs. 15.98%+/-2.37%, P=0.166), but this decrease was not statistically significant. In the 14-DIV group, hypoxia-exposed tissue showed decreased damage compared to control tissues; this decrease was not significant in the CA3 (24.51%+/-6.05% vs. 18.31%+/-3.28%, P=0.373) or DG (15.72%+/-3.47% vs. 9.91%+/-2.11%, P=0.134), but was significant in the CA1 (50.91%+/-5.90% vs. 32.30%+/-3.34%, P=0.004). CONCLUSION: Although only CA1 tissues cultured for 14 DIV showed significantly less damage after exposure to hypoxia, the other tissues examined in this study showed a tendency towards less damage after hypoxic exposure. Therefore, mild hypoxia might play a protective role in the brain.
