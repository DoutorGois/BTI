We examined the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on cholinergic neurons in culture from postnatal rat basal forebrain by assay of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and cytochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE). BDNF was found to increase the ChAT activities but failed to promote the survival of AChE-positive neurons in cultures from neonatal (P3) rats, suggesting that its main role is cholinergic differentiation. In contrast, an enhancement of the survival of AChE-positive neurons and of ChAT activity was observed in cultures from P15-16 rats, suggesting that BDNF's main action is the maintenance of cholinergic neurons. Our results indicate a similarity between BDNF and nerve growth factor effects on the responses of cholinergic neurons of postnatal rat basal forebrain in culture.
