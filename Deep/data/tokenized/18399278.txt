Opposite changes in the content of LPO products and products of oxidative modification of proteins were detected in human brain structures in the course of postnatal development. A clear-cut ontogenetic reduction of LPO products was observed in field 17 of the cortex, archicortex structures, and in the hypothalamus. Age-specific increase in the levels of products of oxidative modification of proteins was recorded in all compartments of the brain; it peaked by the age of 12-21 years and was most pronounced (4-6-fold) in the visual cortex, hippocampus, diencephalic and pontobulbar compartments of the brain.
