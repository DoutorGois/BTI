The data on evoked potentials (EP) in the frog primordial hippocampus during the surface application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), beta-alanine and aminooxyacetic acid in the region of EP recording are presented. These results in the aggregate with the earlier described effects of picrotoxin, bicuculline, muscimol, baclofen (on EP) and GABA (on intracellular potentials) permit to suggest the presence of GABA-ergic inhibitory system and two types of GABA receptors in the frog primordial hippocampus.
