The influence of glucocorticoids and ACTH on the excitability of the hypothalamus and limbic structures of the brain in rabbits was studied in chronic tests with electrochemotrodes preliminarily implanted into the brain. Results bearing proof to a dissimilar effect produced by ACTH and glucocorticoids on the excitability of the anterior and posterior hypothalamus, hippocampus and amygdala are presented. It is suggested that the mechanism of the retroinhibitory action of corticosteroids and ACTH provides for the participation of hypothalamic and limbic structures of the brain.
