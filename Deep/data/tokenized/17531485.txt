We designed and synthesized new analogues containing 1,2-dithiolane-3-alkyl and protected or free catechol moieties connected through heteroaromatic rings such as triazole, 1,2,4-oxadiazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, tetrazole or thiazole in order to explore the influence of the bioisosteric replacement of the amide group on the neuroprotective activity of the lipoic acid/dopamine conjugate. Evaluation of the activity of the new compounds, using glutamate-challenged hippocampal HT22 cells, showed that incorporation of heteroaromatic rings in the alkyl-1,2-dithiolane moieties in conjunction with another antioxidant, in this case catechol, may result in strong neuroprotective activity.
