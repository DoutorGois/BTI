Lowering of [Ca2+]o induces epileptiform activity in hippocampal area CA1, characterized by slow negative field potentials with superimposed trains of population spikes and by rises in [K+]o. In dentate gyrus slow positive field potentials occur simultaneously with the activity in area CA1. The accompanying small rises in [K+]o may stem from spatial K+ redistribution through glial cells from area CA1.
