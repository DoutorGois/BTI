In the article one can find analysis of modern theories about mechanisms of neuroendocrine regulation under stress, influence of steroid hormones and neuropeptides (delta-sleep-inducing peptide) on the functional state of hypothalamic reticular limbic structures of the brain. Special attention is paid to the analysis of mechanisms of creation of integrative processes under aggressive-defensive behaviour and roles of biologically active factors in the regulation of the processes.
