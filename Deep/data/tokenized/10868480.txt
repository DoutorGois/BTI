There is recent evidence that cryoanesthesia, commonly used during neonatal hormone manipulations (e.g., gonadectomy), has deleterious effects on the morphology of the splenium of the corpus callosum and primary visual cortex in adult rats of both sexes. (Nunez and Juraska, 1998; Nunez, Kim, and Juraska, 1998). In the present study, the effect of neonatal cryoanesthesia on the morphology of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus and on performance in the Morris water maze was investigated. Cold exposure for as brief as 30 min (5 degrees C) on Postnatal Day 1 resulted in a significant decrease in the volume of the hippocampus and in brain weight of adults. Performance on the water maze was also impaired in cold-exposed animals. This study indicates that not only morphology but also behavioral performance in adulthood are affected by neonatal cryoanesthesia.
