Direct application of serotonergic of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers to anterior or posterior areas of the hypothalamus induced lordosis in intact estrogen-primed male rats. Such treatment with an alpha-adrenergic blocker or systemic administration of progesterone failed to increase lordosis. Centrally elicited lordosis did not occur without estrogen priming. Anatomical and neurochemical similarity may exist in the brain mechanism mediating lordotic behavior in male and female adult rats.
