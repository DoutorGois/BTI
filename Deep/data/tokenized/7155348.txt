The present study demonstrates distinct distribution patterns of glycoproteins in rat hippocampus, with respect to synthesis from precursors (autoradiography) and endogenous contents (lectin binding). The autoradiographic analysis performed 1, 2, 8 and 24 h after intraventricular injections of tritium-labelled L-fucose. N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-mannose revealed that up to 2 h after application of any of the three precursors, radioactivity occurred in the pyramidal and granular cell layers. Afterwards, however, rapid migration of label proceeded from the cell bodies into the neuropil after application of fucose and acetylglucosamine, while after injection of mannose a considerable amount of radioactivity stayed in the cell body layers, even 24 h after administration of labelled precursor. These findings were consistent with the histochemical visualization of glycoprotein constituents by fluorescent wheat germ lectin (preferentially binding to glucosaminyl residues) and concanavalin A-horseradish peroxidase (preferentially binding to mannosyl residues). These showed a heavy staining predominantly in neuropil and somata, respectively, with concanavalin A-binding giving more distinct patterns than the application of labelled mannose. The usefulness of the three glycoprotein precursors as correlates with functional behavioural changes in discussed.
