RATIONALE: Several second-generation antipsychotics are characterised by a significant antagonistic effect at serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors (5-HT(2A)R), a feature that has been associated with lower incidence of extra-pyramidal symptoms and a putative amelioration of positive and negative symptoms experienced by schizophrenic patients. However, the neurofunctional substrate of 5-HT(2A) antagonism and its exact contribution to the complex pharmacological profile of these drugs remain to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we used pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging to map the modulatory effects of the selective 5-HT(2A)R antagonist Ml00907 on the spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity elicited by acute phencyclidine (PCP) challenge in the rat. PCP is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that induces dysregulation of corticolimbic glutamatergic neurotransmission and produces cognitive impairment and psychotic-like symptoms reminiscent of those observed in schizophrenia. RESULTS: Pre-administration of M100907 produced focal and region-dependent attenuation of PCP-induced response in frontoseptohippocampal areas. As early studies highlighted a permissive role of 5-HT(2A)R on frontal dopamine release, the role of post-synaptic dopamine D(1) receptors on PCP-induced response was examined by using the potent antagonist SCH23390. Interestingly, SCH23390 did not affect PCP's response in any of the regions examined. This finding rules out a significant contribution of dopamine in the functional changes mapped and, indirectly, the inhibitory effect of M100907, in favour of a glutamatergic origin. CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand recent evidence suggesting a key role of 5-HT(2A)R in modulating glutamate-mediated cognitive performance in the prefrontal cortex and highlight the whole frontoseptohippocampal circuit as a key functional substrate of 5-HT(2A)R antagonism in normal and disease states.
