Receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) zeta/beta is a nervous tissue-specific chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. In this study, we investigated the immunohistochemical localization of RPTPzeta/beta in adult rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus at light and electron microscopic levels. Double labeling immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the immunoreactivity of RPTPzeta/beta was observed at MAP2-positive dendrites and PSD-95-positive spines of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Electron microscopic observation demonstrated a strong immunoreactivity of RPTPzeta/beta at the postsynaptic membrane of dendritic spines and shafts, and its moderate immunoreactivity at the dendritic membrane. In cultured cortical neurons, the immunoreactivity of RPTPzeta/beta was observed at some of PSD-95-positive spines. These results demonstrate that RPTPzeta/beta is localized mainly at the postsynaptic membrane of pyramidal neurons in adult cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
