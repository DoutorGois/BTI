1. Anaesthetic agents produce disruption in cognitive function typified by reductions in sensory perception and memory formation. Oscillations within the EEG gamma and beta bands have been linked to sensory perception and memory and have been shown to be modified by anaesthetic agents. 2. Synchronous gamma oscillations generated by brief tetanic stimulation in two regions of hippocampal area CA1 in slices in vitro were seen to potentiate excitatory synaptic communication between the areas. This synaptic potentiation, was seen to contribute to a transition from gamma frequency (30 - 70 Hz) to beta frequency (12 - 30 Hz) oscillations. 3. Four drugs having anaesthetic/hypnotic and amnesic properties were tested on this synchronous gamma-induced beta oscillation. Thiopental 10 - 200 microM, Diazepam 0.05 - 1.0 microM, Morphine 10 - 200 microM, and Ketamine 10 - 200 microM were all added to the bathing medium. Each drug markedly disrupted the formation of beta oscillations in a manner consistent with their primary modes of action. Thiopental and morphine disrupted synchrony of gamma oscillations and prevented potentiation of recurrent excitatory potentials measured in stratum oriens (fEPSPs). Neither diazepam, nor ketamine produced such marked changes in synchrony at gamma frequencies or reduction in potentiation of fEPSPs. However, each disrupted expression of subsequent beta oscillation via changes in the magnitude of inhibitory network gamma oscillations and the duration and magnitude of tetanus-induced depolarization respectively. 4. The degree of disruption of fEPSP potentiation correlated quantitatively with the degree of disruption in synchrony between sites during gamma oscillations. The data indicate that synchronous gamma-induced beta oscillations represent a mode of expression of excitatory synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus, and that anaesthetic/amnesic agents can disrupt this process markedly.
