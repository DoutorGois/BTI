The action of the pallidum on electrically induced afterdischarge of the hippocampus (HAD) was studied. Significant facilitatory influences on HAD duration were observed when pallidal conditional stimulation immediately preceded hippocampal test stimulation. The phenomenon appeared to be into correlation with the interval between conditioning and test stimulation. Experimental data are discussed as strongly presumptive of a functional interrelationship between the inhibitory role played by the caudate on both pallidum and hippocampus; facilitatory influence of the pallidum on HAD duration is discussed too.
