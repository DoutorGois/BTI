The age-related anatomical changes in the rat hippocampus were evaluated in male Sprague-Dawley rats of 3 (young), 12 (mature) and 24 (aged) months by counting the number of nerve cells in the CA1 and CA3 fields and in the dentate gyrus and by measuring the density of Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm of the pyramidal and granule neurons of the above areas. Moreover, the effect of 3 months choline alfoscerate treatment on the anatomical parameters examined was evaluated. The number of pyramidal neurons of the CA1 field and of granule neurons of the dentate gyrus was not significantly changed between young and mature animals, but it was decreased in aged rats. The number of pyramidal neurons of the CA3 field showed a progressive age-dependent reduction. The density of Nissl bodies was the highest in the cytoplasm of pyramidal or granule neurons in mature rats followed in descending order by young and aged animals. Choline alfoscerate treatment counteracted the age-related loss of nerve cells in the 3 hippocampal portions examined and slow-drown the decrease of Nissl bodies in the cytoplasm of pyramidal or of granule neurons in the hippocampus. The significance of changes induced by choline alfoscerate in the hippocampus of aged rats and the possible mechanism of action of the compound are discussed.
