BACKGROUND: Isoflurane postconditioning (ISPOC) plays a neuroprotection role in the brain. Previous studies confirmed that isoflurane postconditioning can provide better protection than preconditioning in acute hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, such as acute craniocerebral trauma and ischemic stroke. Numerous studies have reported that activin A can protect rat's brain from cell injury. However, whether activin A and its downstream ERK1/2 were involved in isoflurane postconditioning-induced neuroprotection is unknown. METHODS: A total of 80 healthy Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 50-70g were randomly divided into 10 groups of 8: normal control, oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), 1.5% ISPOC, 3.0% ISPOC, 4.5% ISPOC, blocker of activin A (SB431542), blocker of ERK1/2 (U0126), 3.0% ISPOC+SB431542, 3.0% ISPOC+U0126, and vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide(DMSO)) group. Blockers (SB431542 and U0126) were used in each concentration of isoflurane before OGD. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, and propidium iodide (PI) staining were conducted to assess the reliability in the brain slices. Immunofluorescence, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR(Q-PCR) were performed to validate the protein expression levels of activin A, Smad2/3, P-Smad2/3, ERK1/2, and phosphorylation ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2). RESULTS: The number of damaged neurons and mean fluorescence intensity(MFI) of PI staining increased, but formazan generation, expression levels of activin A and P-ERK1/2 protein, and mRNA synthesis level of activin A decreased in the OGD group compared with the normal control group (p<0.05). The number of damaged neurons and MFI of PI staining decreased, but formazan production, expression levels of activin A, P-Smad2/3, and P-ERK1/2, and mRNA synthesis level of activin A increased significantly in the 1.5% ISPOC and 3.0% ISPOC groups (p<0.05) compared with the OGD group. The result in the 4.5% ISPOC group, was completely opposite to the 1.5% ISPOC and 3.0% ISPOC groups. The number of damage neuron and MFI of PI staining increased, but formazan production, expression levels of activin A, P-Smad2/3, and P-ERK1/2, and mRNA synthesis level of activin A decreased in the 4.5% ISPOC group. However, the expression levels of activin A, P-Smad2/3, and P-ERK1/2, and mRNA synthesis level of activin A in the 4.5% ISPOC group were higher than the OGD group (p<0.05). The other results were compared between the SB431542 group/the U0126 group and 3.0% ISPOC group. The MFI of PI staining increased, but the expression levels of activin A, P-Smad2/3, and P-ERK1/2 decreased (p<0.05). The expression level of ERK1/2 protein in all groups exhibited no change (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Results of this study showed that 3.0% concentration of isoflurane postconditioning provided better neuroprotection than 1.5% and 4.5% concentrations of isoflurane. Activin A/Smad 2/3 and activin A/ERK1/2 signaling pathway may be involved in ISPOC-induced neuroprotection.
