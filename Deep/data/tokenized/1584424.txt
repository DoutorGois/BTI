Quantitative Golgi study of hippocampal pyramidal neurons of ground squirrels showed rapid and profound transformation of their apical dendrites in the course of hibernation. The dendrites were significantly shorter, less branched and had fewer dendritic spines in the middle of hibernation bout than in the active euthermic ground squirrels between bouts. After arousal from torpor, within 2 h dendrites completely restored their structure. During hibernation, season remodelling of the hippocampal dendrites occurs repeatedly during each torpor-activity cycle.
