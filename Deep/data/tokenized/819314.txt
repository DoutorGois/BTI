In 4 adult monkeys, electrical stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus followed by subsidence in the animal and the ECoG synchronization evoked also an impairment of conditioned reflex activity and a decrease in the test performance during delayed responses. Strong stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus followed by emotional arousal and desynchronization in the ECoG, on the contrary, improved the conditioned reflex activity and increased the level of the test performance. The hypothalamus is then supposed to play a certain role in memory as an emotiogenic structure.
