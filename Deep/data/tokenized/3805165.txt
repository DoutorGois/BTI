We investigated the influence of the adenosine antagonist theophylline on the degree of hippocampal cell damage in the Mongolian gerbil following brief periods of forebrain ischemia. Male gerbils were randomly divided into nine groups. Ten minutes before surgery, four groups, which were later subjected to 1, 2, 3, or 5 min of bilateral carotid occlusion under halothane anesthesia, received theophylline (30 mg/kg, p.o.). Four groups served as nontreated ischemic controls; the ninth group was used to measure theophylline serum concentration. Neurological symptoms were classified by using a behavioral score. Fourteen days after ischemia, the brains were removed, and the hippocampus was histologically examined "blind" for the degree of cell damage in the CA1 sector, which was expressed as a semiquantitative histopathological score. There were no behavioral or histological abnormalities in either the control or theophylline group with 1 min of ischemia. With increasing duration of ischemia, the neurological symptoms worsened and the number of necrotic pyramidal cells increased significantly. The pretreatment with theophylline only moderately aggravated the neurological symptoms, whereas it enhanced the ischemic cell damage significantly. The results are discussed with respect to recent findings that theophylline may block putatively protective effects of endogenous adenosine, whose concentration in the brain is known to rise significantly during ischemia.
