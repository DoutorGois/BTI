Functional modifications of both D-1 and D-2 dopamine (DA) receptor subtypes following repeated administration of lisuride, a DA agonist that acts selectively on D-2 DA receptors were studied. The functional state of D-1 and D-2 DA receptors was evaluated from measurements of SKF 82526-stimulated and bromocriptine-inhibited adenylate cyclase activity in different brain regions of rats treated daily for 26 days with saline or lisuride (100 micrograms/kg i.p.). Persistent stimulation by lisuride of DA receptors in striatum, nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra, frontal cortex, hippocampus and pituitary gland induced a down-regulation of D-2 receptors without changing the functional activity of D-1 receptors.
