Hemodynamic and cerebrovascular factors are crucially involved in secondary damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI). With magnetic resonance imaging, this study aimed to quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) by arterial spin labeling and cerebral blood volume by using an intravascular contrast agent, during 14 days after lateral fluid-percussion injury (LFPI) in rats. Immunohistochemical analysis of vessel density was used to evaluate the contribution of vascular damage. Results show widespread ipsilateral and contralateral hypoperfusion, including both the cortex and the hippocampus bilaterally, as well as the ipsilateral thalamus. Hemodynamic unrest may partly be explained by an increase in blood vessel density over a period of 2 weeks in the ipsilateral hippocampus and perilesional cortex. Furthermore, three phases of perilesional alterations in CBF, progressing from hypoperfusion to normal and back to hypoperfusion within 2 weeks were shown for the first time in a rat TBI model. These three phases were similar to hemodynamic fluctuations reported in TBI patients. This makes it feasible to use LFPI in rats to study mechanisms behind hemodynamic changes and to explore novel therapeutic approaches for secondary brain damage after TBI.
