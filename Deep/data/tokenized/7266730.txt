Age related alterations in mnemonic ability and in the functional status of muscarinic receptors were evaluated and compared to biochemical measures of pre and post-synaptic cholinergic functioning. Retention of a single trial passive avoidance task was considerably disturbed as a function of aging. The functional status of muscarinic receptors, as measured by the ability of microiontophoretically applied acetylcholine to stimulate the firing of hippocampal pyramidal cells, was similarly disturbed in aged rats. A small, but significant decrease in muscarinic receptors was detected in the dorsal hippocampi of these same aged rats, while choline acetyltransferase activity did not change. When considered with prior psychopharmacological studies, these data suggest that specific muscarinic receptor impairments may play a critical role in the memory disturbances associated with old age.
