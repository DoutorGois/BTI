Brain synaptic plasma membranes specifically associated with matrix protein monolayers containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence recognized by integrin-type adhesion receptors. Experiments using fibronectin affinity chromatography to identify the synaptosomal receptors responsible for this interaction led to the purification of a 55 kDa Arg-Gly-Asp recognition protein that is labelled by antibodies against the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin.
