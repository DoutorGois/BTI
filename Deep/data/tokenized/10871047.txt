The effects of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) on cell-to-substratum adhesion and neurite elongation were examined in primary cultures of fetal rat hippocampal neurons using tissue culture dishes coated with GAGs coupled to dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a novel probe for biological functions of GAGs. Both chondroitin sulfate conjugate to PE (CS-PE) and hyaluronic acid conjugate to PE (HA-PE) promoted neurite elongation from neurons in a dose-dependent manner when immobilized onto polylysine-coated dishes at various concentrations up to 1.0 microg/ml. The coating of CS-PE or HA-PE at a concentration higher than 1.0 microg/ml resulted in failure of neurite extension and adhesion of neurons to the substrata. In contrast, heparin conjugate to PE (HP-PE) did not exert any effects on neurite elongation or on cell attachment at these concentrations. These findings suggest that GAGs serve as a modulator for neurite elongation during neuronal network formation in the developing central nervous system.
