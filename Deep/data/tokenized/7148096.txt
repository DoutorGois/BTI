150 hippocampal explants from fetal and neonatal rats were cultivated with semisynthetic media in maximow chambers without movement and in roller tubes by rotation in the virutor up to 3 days. The cultures were fixed in Bouin, cuted 15 microns and coloured with the method of Kluver-Barrera or haemalaun. Histological examination of the explants revealed that hippocampi cultured in maximow chambers without movement possess an organisation similar to that observed in situ. Experiments with rotated explants of hippocampus indicate that the structure of hippocampus in vitro is changed. Especially neurons are degenerated and the migration of cells is altered. Finally the value of these two methodological cultivations for neurobiology is discussed.
