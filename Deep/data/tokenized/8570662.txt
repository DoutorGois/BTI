We have studied the neuropathological characteristics of the brain of rats receiving daily intracerebroventricular administration of freshly dissolved human immunodeficiency virus type 1 recombinant protein gp120 (100 ng per rat per day) given for up to 14 days. Histological examination of serial brain sections revealed no apparent gross damage to the cortex or hippocampus, nor did cell counting yield significant neuronal cell loss. However, the viral protein caused after 7 and 14 days of treatment DNA fragmentation in 10% of brain cortical neurons. Interestingly, reduced neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression along with significant increases in nerve growth factor (NGF) were observed in the hippocampus, where gp120 did not cause neuronal damage. No changes in NGF and NOS expression were seen in the cortex, where cell death is likely to be of the apoptotic type. The present data demonstrate that gp120-induced cortical cell death is associated with the lack of increase of NGF in the cerebral cortex and suggest that the latter may be important for the expression of neuropathology in the rat brain. By contrast, enhanced levels of NGF may prevent or delay neuronal death in the hippocampus, where reduced NOS expression may be a reflection of a subcellular insult inflicted by the viral protein.
