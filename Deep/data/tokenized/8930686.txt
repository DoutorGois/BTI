The expression of the soluble 170 kDa brain protein (BP170) was studied in the developing human brain. Using immunohistochemical methods, it was possible to demonstrate that BP170 was expressed very strongly in the visual cortex up to approximately 27 weeks of gestation. After this time, the level of expression was reduced so that by adulthood the levels of BP170 were negligible. Similarly, BP170 was expressed in the hippocampus at all stages of development; however, unlike in the visual cortex, this protein was still apparent, albeit at low levels, in the adult. In addition, BP170 was co-expressed with tyrosine hydroxylase which suggests its possible role in the dopamine pathway.
