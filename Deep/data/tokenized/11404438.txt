Converging evidence suggests that the hippocampus is essential for goal-directed spatial navigation. Successful navigation requires not only the ability to compute an appropriate path toward the target but is also guided by recognition of places along the trajectory between start and goal. To determine whether the hippocampus contributes to place recognition, we trained rats with hippocampal lesions in an annular water maze with a remotely controlled escape platform at a constant location in the corridor. The platform remained submerged and unavailable until the rat had swum at least one full lap. Probe trials with the platform unavailable for 60 sec were inserted at regular intervals. In these trials, the rat would swim over the platform several times, regardless of its navigational abilities. After a few training sessions, all sham-operated control animals reduced their swim velocity when they approached the platform, indicating that they recognized the target location. Rats with hippocampal lesions, in contrast, swam at the same velocity as elsewhere in the corridor. Preoperative training or prolonged postoperative training did not alleviate the deficit. Rats with hippocampal lesions were able to learn a cued version of the task, which implies that the failure to slow down was not attributable to motor inflexibility. Thus, hippocampal lesions caused a severe but selective deficit in the identification of a location, suggesting that the hippocampus may be essential for image recognition during spatial navigation.
