Nelumbo nucifera semen (NNS) is a traditional herb with anti-diarrheal, anti-ganacratia, and tranquilizer-like pharmacological activities. In this study, we examined the anti-amnesic effect of NNS on rats with scopolamine-induced amnesia. Passive avoidance tests, acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) activity, and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) expression were used to evaluate the NNS anti-amnesic effects. The rats were divided into five groups: the normal group, scopolamine-treated group (1mg/kg; control), NNS (1g/kg) and scopolamine (1mg/kg) co-treatment group, and the ARICEPT (1mg/kg) and scopolamine (1mg/kg) co-treatment group (positive control). The rats were administered the compounds orally for 14 days. The latency time of passive avoidance significantly increased by 54% in the NNS-treated group compared to the scopolamine-treated group. The ACHE activity in the NNS-treated group significantly decreased to 7.35% than that of the control group. CHAT-positive neurons increased by 51.02% in the NNS group compared to the control group. These results suggest that NNS extract improves scopolamine-induced dementia by inhibiting ACHE activity and inducing CHAT expression.
