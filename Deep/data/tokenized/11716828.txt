Adult rat hippocampus-derived neural stem cells are incorporated into neural tissues, and differentiate to neuronal and glial cells. However, the cell surface protein molecules are, to date, undefined. RT-PCR, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry showed the increased expression of N-syndecan, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, in the neural stem cells after the differentiation induced by retinoic acid. Our data indicate that N-syndecan may be involved in the differentiation of neural stem cells.
