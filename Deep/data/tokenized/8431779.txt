The rat hippocampal slice preparation and its electrophysiology were used to assess the toxicity of two sulfur-containing amino acids, L-cysteate (CA) and L-cysteine (CYS). Both compounds were innocuous under normal conditions but became toxic in energy-deprived (lack of oxygen or glucose) slices. CA and CYS toxicity was apparent as both reduced the number of slices that normally recover their neuronal function (evoked CA1 population spike) after a standardized period of hypoxia or glucose deprivation (GD). The competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate blocked the toxicity of both CA and CYS in hypoxic slices, but it was effective only against CYS toxicity in glucose-deprived slices. The glycine antagonist 7-chlorokynurenate blocked CA and CYS toxicity in hypoxic slices but was unable to block their toxicity in glucose-deprived tissue. Perfusing slices with medium containing a high magnesium concentration blocked the toxicity of CA in both hypoxic and glucose-deprived slices, a treatment that was ineffective against CYS toxicity under either condition. Calcium depletion from the perfusion medium completely blocked the damaging effect of both amino acids in hypoxic slices, but it only partially blocked the toxicity of CA and did not block that of CYS in glucose-deprived slices. These results suggest that CA and CYS activate different NMDA receptor subsets and other glutamate receptor subtypes. Moreover, the results indicate a possible difference between the mechanism that lead to hypoxic neuronal damage and the one that lead to hypoglycemic neuronal damage.
