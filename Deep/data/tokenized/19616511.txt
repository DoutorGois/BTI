Cholesterol is a unique molecule in terms of high level of in-built stringency, fine tuned by natural evolution for its ability to optimize physical properties of higher eukaryotic cell membranes in relation to biological functions. We previously demonstrated the requirement of membrane cholesterol in maintaining the ligand binding activity of the hippocampal serotonin(1A) receptor. In order to test the molecular stringency of the requirement of cholesterol, we depleted cholesterol from native hippocampal membranes followed by replenishment with desmosterol. Desmosterol is an immediate biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol in the Bloch pathway differing only in a double bond at the 24th position in the alkyl side chain. Our results show that replenishment with desmosterol does not restore ligand binding activity of the serotonin(1A) receptor although replenishment with cholesterol led to significant recovery of ligand binding. This is in spite of similar membrane organization (order) in these membranes, as monitored by fluorescence anisotropy measurements. The requirement for restoration of ligand binding activity therefore appears to be more stringent than the requirement for the recovery of overall membrane order. These novel results have potential implications in understanding the interaction of membrane lipids with this important neuronal receptor in diseases such as desmosterolosis.
