Chronic IDPN treatment leads to a persistent stereotypic and dyskinetic behavioral syndrome which is reminiscent of that caused by PCP in mammals. Since the neuropharmacological profile of the two syndromes are very similar, the status of the PCP binding site was studied in rats who were suffering from the IDPN-induced syndrome. The characteristics of the receptor were not altered in either the striata or the hippocampi of the animals. These results suggest that the development of chronic stereotypies is not intimately linked to any perturbation of the PCP binding site in rat brain.
