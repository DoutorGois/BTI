Galanin (2000, 1000 ng) administered into the lateral brain ventricle decreased the severity of picrotoxin-kindled convulsions in rats. The bilateral injection (200, 100 and 50 ng) of galanin into the hippocampus also evoked an anticonvulsive effect. When administered into the caudate nuclei or substantia nigra reticulata, galanin exerted anticonvulsive action only in a high dose (200 ng), whereas in the nucleus accumbens it did so in a low dose (50 ng). When administered into the ventral tegmental area in a dose of 50, 100 or 200 ng galanin failed to reduce the manifestations of picrotoxin-kindled seizures.
