Bone marrow stromal cells taken from EGFP transgenic mice were sorted by magnetic beads with surface markers for Sca-1 and Thy-1. The cells were then co-cultured on organotypic hippocampal slice or with neuronal cell feeder in dish. On hippocampus, both Sca-1 and Thy-1 positive cells showed 4- 8 folds higher potential to show neuron-like morphology than negative cells. In dish, negative cells fewly survived but each positive cells survived and showed neuron-like differentiation. In both culture condition, retinoic acid supplement accelerate differentiation. Differentiated Sca-1 and Thy-1 positive cells were immunohistochemically GFAP- and NeuN-negative but nestin-, neurofilament- and NSE-positive. Neuron-like differentiation of bone marrow cells can be enhanced by selection using cell surface proteins.
