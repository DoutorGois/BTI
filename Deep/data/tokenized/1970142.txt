The numbers of silver-stained senile plaques and plaques containing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-like immunoreactivity were counted in the neocortex, amygdala and hippocampus of control subjects and patients with Alzheimer's disease, and compared with the density of TH-positive nerve fibers. The number of silver-stained senile plaques was lowest in the hippocampus and highest in the amygdala, and increased in all three structures in relation to the degree of dementia in the patients. A small proportion of plaques in the hippocampus of the most demented subjects and a large proportion of plaques in the amygdala were TH-positive. No TH-like immunoreactivity was found in plaques in the neocortex, although this structure contained almost as many silver-stained senile plaques and was as densely innervated by TH-positive fibers as the amygdala. The number of plaques containing TH-like immunoreactivity was, therefore, not proportional to the innervation of the structures by TH-positive fibers, nor to the total number of plaques in the structure, suggesting that the dissociation between the proportion of TH-positive plaques in the amygdala and neocortex may be due to differences in the populations of TH-positive fibers innervating the structures.
