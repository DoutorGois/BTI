The effects of beta-alanine, phenibut and muscimol on the activity of the "mirror" (MEF) and primary (PEF) epileptogenic foci were studied in rats on the model of penicillin-induced epilepsy using the direct administration of the drugs into the foci (muscimol only into MEF). All the drugs suppressed the development of electrographic correlates of seizures both in PEF and MEF. The varied characters of the drugs' effects on interseizure epileptiform bursts depending on administration into PEF (provocation) or MEF (no effect) were revealed. Possible dose-dependent mechanisms of the drugs' actions on GABA-A and GABA-B receptors involved in inhibitory control of the activity of epileptogenic foci in the rat hippocamp are discussed.
