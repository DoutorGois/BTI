The synthesis and resolution of 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-6-methoxy-2-methyldibenzo[c,f]pyrazino[1,2-a]azepin (6-methoxymianserin, 6) are described. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo effects of 6 and its enantiomers are presented. 6 displayed high affinity for the 5-HT2A/2C receptors, only moderate affinity for the adrenoceptors, and no affinity for the NA reuptake site. Surprisingly, 6 also showed moderate to high affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor, an effect that resides in the (R)-(-)-enantiomer.
