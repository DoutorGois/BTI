The hippocampus (CA3 field) was studied in rats with different behavioral characteristics. Protein contents in the neuronal cytoplasm and nuclei, as well as the size of neurons in animals predisposed to stress, poorly trained in a shuttle box, and exhibiting low locomotor activity in the open field were lower than in rats resistant to stress and characterized by high learning capacity and locomotor activity. Our results suggest that neuronal differences in the hippocampal CA3 field are associated with variations in learning capacity of animals.
