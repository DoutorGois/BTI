Rate remapping is a conjunctive code that potentially enables hippocampal place cells to jointly represent spatial and nonspatial information. In this issue of Neuron, Renno-Costa et al. introduce a theoretical model wherein the convergence of the medial and lateral entorhinal excitatory inputs, combined with local inhibition, explains hippocampal rate remapping.
