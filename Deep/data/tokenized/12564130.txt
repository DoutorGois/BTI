To investigate the migration of neural stem cells as well as neural plastic changes in epileptic brain, spaciotemporal expression of immunoreactive highly polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) was examined in amygdala kindling development of rat. The neural migration and synaptic remodeling detected with PSA-NCAM staining occurred in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, subventricular zone and pyriform cortex with amygdaloid kindling in generalized seizure but not in partial seizure. Although PSA-NCAM positive dendrite in dentate gyrus was minimally found in the control brain, it extended slightly in animals with partial seizure, and greatly toward the molecular layer with generalized seizure. Thus, the migration of neural stem cells as well as neural plastic changes were specially and temporally different between brain regions depending on different kindling stages. These changes may mainly contribute to the reorganization of neural network in epileptic brain.
