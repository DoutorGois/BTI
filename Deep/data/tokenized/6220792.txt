An electrophysiological study was performed in rat entorhinal cortex. The results confirmed anatomical data on its connections with olfactory structures. Unit analysis has shown that neurons respond to odours. This area thus appears as an important structure for olfactory projections, possibly relaying these informations to the hippocampus.
