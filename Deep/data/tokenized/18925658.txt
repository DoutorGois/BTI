The brainstem raphe nuclei are typically assigned a role in serotonergic brain function. However, numerous studies have reported that a large proportion of raphe projection cells are nonserotonergic. The identity of these projection cells is unknown. Recent studies have reported that the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 is found in both serotonergic and nonserotonergic neurons in both the median raphe (MR) and dorsal raphe (DR) nuclei. We injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B into either the dorsal hippocampus or the medial septum (MS) and used triple labeled immunofluorescence to determine if nonserotonergic raphe cells projecting to these structures contained VGLUT3. Consistent with previous studies, only about half of retrogradely labeled MR neurons projecting to the hippocampus contained serotonin, whereas a majority of the retrogradely labeled nonserotonergic cells contained VGLUT3. Similar patterns were observed for MR cells projecting to the MS. About half of retrogradely labeled nonserotonergic neurons in the DR contained VGLUT3. Additionally, a large number of retrogradely labeled cells in the caudal linear and interpeduncular nuclei projecting to the MS were found to contain VGLUT3. These data suggest the enigmatic nonserotonergic projection from the MR to forebrain regions may be glutamatergic. In addition, these results demonstrate a dissociation between glutamatergic and serotonergic MR afferent inputs to the MS and hippocampus suggesting divergent and/or complementary roles of these pathways in modulating cellular activity within the septohippocampal network.
