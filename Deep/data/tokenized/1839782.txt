Single pyramidal cells in the rat hippocampal slice preparation were stimulated by iontophoretic application of excitatory amino acids and acetylcholine. The purine adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP), applied iontophoretically, readily depressed acetylcholine stimulated cell firing, was less effective on quisqualic acid stimulated cells and virtually ineffective during stimulation by N-methyl-D,L-aspartate (NMA). Inhibition could be restored if the AMP ejection current was increased 3-fold. In contrast, the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) exerted a comparable level of inhibition under all 3 neuroexcitants. These data support previously published results which suggest that purine mediated inhibition may be reduced during NMDA receptor channel activation. This may have important implications for the action of adenosine during seizures and ischaemic events as well as neuronal phenomena such as long term potentiation.
