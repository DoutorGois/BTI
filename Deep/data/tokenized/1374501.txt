Age-related reduction in the steady-state levels of messenger RNA for D2(415) and D2(444), the alternatively spliced form of dopamine D2 receptors, was observed in different rat brain areas using the sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. In both Sprague-Dawley and Wistar aged rats, the decrease was more pronounced in the D2(444) isoform mRNA thus leading to a changed ratio in striatum as well as in the hippocampus.
