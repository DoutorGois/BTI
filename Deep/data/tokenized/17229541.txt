In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal expression patterns of the high-molecular weight (MAP2a and b) and low-molecular weight (MAP2c and d) cytoskeletal microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) isoforms with Western blotting, and the cellular localization of the high-molecular weight MAP2 isoforms with immunocytochemistry in the hippocampi of 1- to 21-day-old rats. Moreover, the temporal profile (from 30 min to 1 week) of MAP2 isoform reactivity to kainic acid-induced status epilepticus was studied in P9 rats. During development, the expression of the high-molecular weight MAP2 isoforms significantly increased, while the low-molecular weight isoforms decreased, the most prominent changes occurring during the second postnatal week. This developmental increase in the high-molecular weight MAP2 expression was also confirmed with immunocytochemistry, which showed increased immunoreactivity, particularly in the molecular layers of the dentate gyrus, and in CA1 and CA3 stratum radiatum. In 9-day-old rats, status epilepticus resulted in a rapid transient increase (about 210%) in the high-molecular weight MAP2 expression, without any effect on the low-molecular weight MAP2. Moreover, disturbed dendritic structure in the CA1 and CA3 stratum radiatum was manifested as formation of varicosities 3h after the kainic acid treatment. The strictly developmentally regulated MAP2 isoform expression suggests different functional roles for these proteins during the postnatal development in the rat hippocampus. Moreover, high-molecular weight MAP2s may play a role in nerve cell survival during cell stress.
