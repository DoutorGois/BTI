OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that repetitive umbilical cord occlusions (UCOs) with worsening acidosis will lead to a fetal inflammatory response. STUDY DESIGN: Chronically instrumented fetal sheep underwent a series of UCOs until fetal arterial pH decreased to <7.00. Maternal and fetal blood samples were taken for blood gases/pH and plasma interleukin (IL)-1B and IL-6 levels. Animals were euthanized at 24 hours of recovery with brain tissue processed for subsequent measurement of microglia and mast cell counts. RESULTS: Repetitive UCOs resulted in a severe degree of fetal acidemia. Fetal plasma IL-1B values were increased approximately 2-fold when measured at maximal fetal acidosis and again at 1-2 hours of recovery. Fetal microglia cells were increased approximately 2-fold in the white matter and hippocampus, while mast cells were increased approximately 2-fold in the choroid plexus and now evident in the thalamus when analyzed at 24 hours recovery. CONCLUSION: Repetitive UCOs leading to severe acidemia in the ovine fetus near term will result in an inflammatory response both systemically and locally within the brain.
