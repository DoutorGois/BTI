We have taken a number of different experimental approaches to address whether long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells is due primarily to presynaptic or postsynaptic modifications. Examination of miniature EPSCs or EPSCs evoked using minimal stimulation indicate that quantal size increasing during LTP. The conversion of silent to functional synapses may contribute to the LTP-induced changes in mEPSC frequency and failure rate that previously have been attributed to an increase in the probability if transmitter release.
