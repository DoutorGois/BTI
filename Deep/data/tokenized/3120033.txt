Exploratory activity in the open field and noradrenaline concentration in the neocortex and brain stem were investigated in intact rats (n = 10) and in the following groups of rats with early postnatal neurotoxic (6-hydroxydopamine) lesion of the catecholaminergic system: (i) rats with embryonal locus coeruleus grafts in the frontal neocortex (n = 5); (ii) rats with the same grafts in lateral ventricles (n = 4); (iii) a control group with intracortical hippocampal tissue grafts (n = 3); (iv) sham-operated rats (n = 3). Experiments were performed by four independent groups of investigators using a double-blind method. In sham-operated rats as well as in rats with hippocampal grafts, and with locus coeruleus grafts in the ventricles, both exploratory activity and noradrenaline content of the forebrain were significantly lowered. In the rats with intracortical locus coeruleus grafts the level of exploratory activity was much higher (almost as in intact controls). This improvement of exploratory behaviour correlated highly with increased noradrenaline concentration in the forebrain. In all animals with locus coeruleus in lateral ventricles a significant increase in noradrenaline level of the brain stem was present, but no change of exploratory behaviour was observed. The grafts with the 3-mm-thick slabs of the adjacent tissue were dissected from the brain and used for histological analysis. The presence of typical locus coeruleus cells was shown in neocortex of all animals which received the grafts of corresponding tissue. The data show the possibility of stable compensation of the forebrain noradrenaline level and exploratory behaviour by embryonic noradrenergic neurons grafted into the neocortex, but not into lateral ventricles.
