The administration of depressant reserpine and antidepressant imipramine in rats is manifested by opposite trends in the chronobiological aspect of behavior. Reserpine disorganizes the circadian locomotion rhythm and increases the rhythmological index of depression in the forced swim test. In contrast, imipramine increases the circadian rhythm contrast and decreases the index of depression. A bilateral lesion of the dorsal hippocampus attenuates both pharmacological effects, but the general trend has an antidepressant character: the effect of reserpine decreases, while the effect of imipramine increases. It is suggested that hippocampus probably plays an important role in the origin of depression and related chronobiological manifestations.
