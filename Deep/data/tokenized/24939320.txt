It is believed that the impact of stress on interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) depends on the ontogenetic age. This study examines the influence of acute or chronic exposure to forced-swim (FS) stress or high-light open-field (HL-OF) stimulation on the expression of IL-1beta. Double immunofluorescence staining was used to reveal the density of IL-1beta/NeuN (NeuN is a neuronal nuclear marker)-immunoreactive (-ir) cells in the hippocampal subfields CA1 and CA3, dentate gyrus (DG), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. Adult postnatal day 90 (P90) and aged (P720) rats were used in this experiment. The data showed a significant increase in the density of IL-1beta/NeuN-ir cells in the CA1, CA3, DG, and PVN in P720 nonstressed rats in relation to P90 control animals. Neither FS nor HL-OF acute stimulation caused alteration in the density of IL-1beta-ir neurons in any of the investigated structures in P90 and P720 rats in comparison with control groups. However, chronic FS caused a significant increase in CA3 and DG of P720 rats, and chronic HL-OF led to a significant increase in the density of IL-1beta-ir neurons in the PVN of P90 rats and in all hippocampal subfields of P720 animals. These results indicate that chronic HL-OF stimulation is a factor that induces changes in the number of IL-1beta-ir neurons in the PVN of adult rats, whereas both chronic FS and HL-OF are aggravating factors for the hippocampus of aged (P720) animals.
