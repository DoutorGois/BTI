Rhythmic behavioral and biochemical changes have been observed in both human and animal models with hepatic insufficiency. The basis of all these alterations is the principal endogenous pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The aim of this work, therefore, is to determine cytochrome c oxidase activity, a marker of neuronal activity and oxidative metabolism, in this nucleus in rats with portacaval shunt. In order to do this, this enzyme was histochemically marked and quantified by computer-assisted optical densitometry. Results show a reduced cytochrome oxidase activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in animals with portacaval shunts and, inversely, an increase in oxidative metabolism in the pineal gland, another circadian structure. However, the activity measured in a noncircadian brain structure, the hippocampus, which served as a control, showed no changes with surgery. Additionally, locomotor activity was assessed by actimeters and revealed a clearly reduced activity in animals with portacaval shunt. We conclude that the suprachiasmatic nucleus is possibly involved in the rhythmic changes associated with hepatic insufficiency.
