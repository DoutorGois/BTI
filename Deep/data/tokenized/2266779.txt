The regional mouse brain distribution of a new carbon-11 labeled derivative of vesamicol, [11C]-5-(N-methylamino)benzovesamicol [( 11C]MABV) is reported. Radiotracer concentrations in vivo are in the rank order of striatum greater than cortex greater than hippocampus greater than hypothalamus greater than cerebellum, consistent with reported distributions of other presynaptic cholinergic neuronal markers. In time course studies, striatum/cerebellum and cortex/cerebellum ratios for (-)-[11C]MABV continue to increase to values of 13 and 5, respectively, 75 min after i.v. injection of [11C]MABV. The specific binding in striatum and cortex is lowered by pretreatment with (+/-)-vesamicol, and shows stereoselectivity with lower uptake and lower ratios for the (+)-enantiomer. (-)-enantiomer. (-)-[11C]MABV is proposed as a positron-emitting radioligand for the in vivo study of presynaptic cholinergic neurons.
