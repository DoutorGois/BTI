The authors have developed a method which makes it possible, for the first time, to visualize the delta sleep-inducing peptide in histological preparations and study it under the light and fluorescence microscope. Their research builds on Monnier 's discovery, in 1963, of a humoral hypnogenic factor in rabbits which was subsequently isolated and identified as a nonapeptide. Dubbed delta sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP), this factor was later detected in rat brain by radioimmunoassay but has eluded histological visualization until recently. In their work, the authors used an anti-DSIP antiserum suitable for immunohistological purposes. Two indirect immunohistological methods (PAP and immunofluorescence) allowed them to visualize, for the first time, structures containing specific DSIP-like immunoreactivity in some areas of the rat brain: indusium griseum, nucleus septi lateralis, hippocampus, striae longitudinales of Lancisi , bandeletta diagnalis of Broca, pallidum, hypothalamus, hypophysis and neocortex. Some DSIP pathways seem likely: (1) indusium griseum - striae longitudinales - hippocampus; (2) nucleus septi lateralis - striae longitudinales , bandeletta diagonalis - hippocampus; (3) neurons of the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus - gyrus dentatus; (4) pallidum - commissura of Ganser - hypothalamus. The possible correlations between DSIP neurons and neurons with other neurotransmitters are discussed. In preliminary clinical trials, DSIP has shown promise for the treatment of insomnia and the opiate and alcohol withdrawal syndromes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
