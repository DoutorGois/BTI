The permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (2VO) in rats has been shown to cause progressive and long-lasting cognitive deficits which may be due to impairment of memory retention and/or memory recall process. To clarify the function of voltage dependent calcium channels and the receptor binding of nimodipine by chronic cerebral ischemia, we examined specific (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding and the effect of oral administration of nimodipine in brain regions and hearts of rats, at 2 weeks to 4 months after permanent 2VO. There was no significant difference in either dissociation constant (Kd) or maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) for (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, corpus striatum and thalamus between 2VO and sham rats. In addition, in vitro inhibitory effect of nimodipine on cerebral cortical (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding in 2VO rats was similar to that in sham rats. Compared to control rats, oral administration of nimodipine to both 2VO and sham rats at 2 months after permanent 2VO brought about a significant increase in Kd values of specific (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 binding in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and myocardium, and the increase in Kd values was much larger in brain regions of 2VO rats than sham rats. However, the increase in Kd values in the myocardium did not differ between 2VO and sham rats. This observation suggests an increased in vivo binding affinity for nimodipine in chronic ischemic brain. In conclusion, the present study has shown that oral administration of nimodipine may cause a greater occupation in vivo of 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonist receptors in brains of permanent 2VO rats than in sham rats. Thus, nimodipine may be pharmacologically effective in preventing brain dysfunction due to cerebral ischemia in vivo.
