The behavioral responses of rats to bilateral microinjections of angiotensin II (ATII) at doses of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 microg into the hippocampal CA1 area of male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. ATII affected locomotor activity (the number of horizontal and vertical movements) in a dose-related U-shaped manner. In the elevated plus-maze experiments, ATII at a dose of 0.1 microg microinjected bilaterally into the CA1 hippocampal area increased the number of entries into the open arms, suggesting some anxiolytic effect.
