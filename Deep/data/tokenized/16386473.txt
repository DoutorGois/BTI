A microbore LC-MS/MS method is developed and validated for the quantification of the anti-epileptic drug oxcarbazepine (OXC) and its active metabolite 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (MHD) in rat brain microdialysates, together with the internal standard for microdialysis probe calibration, 2-methyl-5H-dibenz(b,f)azepine-5-carboxamide (m-CBZ). The benefits of gradient versus isocratic separation are shown, next to the improved sensitivity resulting from the addition of 0.1% formic acid to the mobile phase. The coupling of microdialysis with ESI-MS requires sample desalting for which column switching was applied. Using weighed regression to calculate the calibration curves (1-1000 ng/mL), the assay was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy and precision, yielding a sensitive (limit of quantification is 1 ng/mL) and selective method for quantification of OXC, MHD and m-CBZ. By applying this method, we were able to determine the extracellular concentrations of OXC and MHD during at least 4h after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10 mg/kg OXC.
