Innervation density and morphological aberrations of cholinergic fibers were studied with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunocytochemistry and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry in 30-35 month-old aged rats and rats with long-term bilateral lesions of the magnocellular basal nucleus (MBN). In addition, AChE histochemistry was performed on human cortical sections derived from autopsy brains of normal aged and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. A limited but variable number of morphological alterations were observed in ChAT-immunoreactive fibers in the cortex and the hippocampus of the aged control rats. The aged MBN-lesioned rats displayed a severely reduced number of cholinergic fibers in the denervated areas of the neocortex, whereas the surviving fibers showed a strongly increased number of aberrations. Fiber anomalies were also observed in the cortex of the aged human subjects and Alzheimer patients, the latter showing a higher incidence of such aberrations. Only a part of these distended profiles were seen in close association with senile plaques as detected in the AChE-stained material. These findings suggest that experimental MBN lesions combined with aging share with AD the induction of large quantities of fiber malformations. Implications of possible mechanisms in both conditions are discussed.
