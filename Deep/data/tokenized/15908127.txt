mKirre, a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila kirre, is expressed in bone marrow stromal cells and the brain. Although mKirre has been shown to support the hematopoietic stem cells, little is known about the function of mKirre in the brain. In the present study, to gain insights into the function of mKirre, we investigated the expression pattern of mKirre gene in the developing and adult mouse brain using in situ hybridization. In the adult brain, mKirre mRNA was highly expressed in the olfactory bulb, the piriform cortex, the cochlear nucleus, and the cerebellum. At embryonic day (E) 11.5, we could observe mKirre mRNA in the differentiating zones of various regions, such as the caudate-putamen, the geniculate body, the thalamus, the amygdala, and the brainstem. Its gene expression in these regions at E11.5 also persisted to the adult, in which its expression levels were much less prominent. After birth, we could first observe high expression of mKirre mRNA in the glomerular and mitral layers of the olfactory bulb, the cortical plate of the neocortex, the cochlear nucleus, and the molecular and granule cell layers of the cerebellum. In the hippocampus, its gene expression was first observed in the dentate gyrus at postnatal day 7. The spatiotemporal expression pattern of mKirre mRNA suggests important roles of mKirre in later developmental processes, especially the synapse formation.
