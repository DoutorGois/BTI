Stress causes the release of many transmitters and hormones, including corticosteroids. These molecules enter the brain and exert their effects through the mineralo- and glucocorticoid receptor. The former receptor plays an important role in neuronal stability. However, it also mediates rapid non-genomic corticosteroid effects that in synergy with other stress mediators activate limbic cells and promote behavioral choices allowing the organism to quickly respond to the imminent danger. Glucocorticoid receptors primarily mediate slow genomic effects, for instance in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which are thought to contribute to contextual and higher cognitive aspects of behavioral performance several hours after stress. Rapid and slow effects interact and collectively contribute to successful behavioral adaptation. Long-term disturbances in the release pattern of corticosteroid hormones and in the responsiveness of their receptors give rise to structural and functional changes in neuronal properties which may contribute to the expression of psychopathology.
