Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction and prostaglandin E2 elevation have been reported to occur after cerebral ischemic insult. To evaluate whether the cyclooxygenase-2 reaction product prostaglandin E2 is directly related to induction of apoptosis in neuronal cells, the effect of prostaglandin E2 on cell viability was examined in hippocampal cells. Prostaglandin E2 (5-25 microM) induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner 48 h after addition to the cells, which was characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation or fragmentation and attenuated by a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Neither 17-phenyl trinor-prostaglandin E2 (an EP1 agonist) nor sulprostone (an EP3 agonist) induced cell death, whereas butaprost (an EP2 agonist) induced apoptosis. Prostaglandin E2 increased the intracellular concentration of cAMP, and the selective EP2 agonist butaprost also induced apoptosis accompanied by increasing cAMP levels in hippocampal cells. Moreover, a cell permeable cAMP analog, dibutyryl cAMP also induced apoptosis in hippocampal cells. These findings suggest that prostaglandin E2-induced apoptosis was mediated through a mechanism involving the cAMP-dependent pathway. In addition, prostaglandin E2 activated caspase-3 activity in a dose-dependent manner and a caspase-3 inhibitor prevented the prostaglandin E2-induced apoptosis. We showed in this report that prostaglandin E2 directly induced apoptosis in hippocampal neurons. Moreover, it is likely that the direct effects of prostaglandin E2 on hippocampal neurons were mediated by activation of EP2 receptors followed by elevation of the intracellular cAMP levels.
