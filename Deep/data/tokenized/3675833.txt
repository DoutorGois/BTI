Rats were fed a thiamine-deficient diet for 4 weeks and injected daily with pyrithiamine during the last two weeks of the diet. This regime induced severe neurological anomalies such as ataxia, loss of righting reflex and visual place reflex, and finally full tonic-clonic seizures. These symptoms are reminiscent of the clinical Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Injection of thiamine dramatically reversed these symptoms within one or two hours as seen in Wernicke patients. Six weeks later these rats showed a marked deficit in habituation of exploratory behavior and of the auditory orienting response. To what extent this chronic deficit in habituation contributes to the cognitive dysfunctions seen in Wernicke-Korsakoff patients is discussed. Histological examination of the brains of 6 of the rats revealed a heterogeneous pattern of damage to the brainstem, including mamillary bodies and several thalamic nuclei, reminiscent of that seen in Korsakoff patients. In addition there were many dark abnormal cells in limited fields of hippocampus neocortex and thalamus in almost all animals.
