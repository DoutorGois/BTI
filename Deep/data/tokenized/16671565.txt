In CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, lanthanum ions increased the amplitude of GABA-activated currents and shifted the dose-dependence curve to the left, which attests to increased affinity of GABAA-receptors to GABA. The data made it possible to compare the sensitivity GABAA-receptors of pyramidal neurons and similar receptors of other cells to GABA and lanthanum.
