Rat perinatal (E20-P0) CA1 pyramidal neurons were either synaptically active or silent. We show here that, during this developmental period, active but not silent cells form recurrent axon-collaterals that invade the radiatum and the lacunosum moleculare strata. These recurrents were never observed in adult rats. We propose that these transient recurrent axons may participate in the activity-dependent modulation of the synaptogenesis
