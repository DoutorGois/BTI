Two doses (0.3 and 3 ng peptide/animal) of oxytocin (OXT) and lysine-8-vasopressin (LVP) were earlier found to inhibit the development of tolerance to the hypothermic effect of ethanol in mice upon icv. administration. In the present paper the possible central monoaminergic correlates of the behavioral data were investigated. In tolerant animals the steady-state level of noradrenaline (NA) was increased in the hypothalamus, as was that of dopamine (DA) in the medulla oblongata; the serotonin (5-HT) and DA levels were decreased in the striatum as compared to those in the non-tolerant control. In the peptide-pretreated animals the NA level was increased in the hypothalamus, the DA level in the striatum, and the 5-HT level in the hippocampus and striatum. Opposite changes were observed in the steady-state levels of the monoamines in the hippocampus and striatum as compared to those in the tolerant controls. The data suggest that the central monoamines may be involved in mediating the actions of neurohypophyseal peptides on ethanol tolerance.
