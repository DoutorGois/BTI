The expression of mitochondrial protein UCP2 and cytochrome C-oxidase subunit III genes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was evaluated by real-time PCR 3 and 7 days after microinjection of kainic acid into the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast to cytochrome C-oxidase subunit III mRNA, the level of UCP2 mRNA in the hippocampus increased 1 week after microinjection of kainic acid. The expression of both genes in the prefrontal cortex did not differ from the control. Presumably, activation of UCP2 synthesis in hippocampal injury indicates the neuroprotective effects of this protein.
