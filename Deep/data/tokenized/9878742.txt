Modification of chemical and magnetic extraction techniques has yielded biogenic magnetite/maghemite from human hippocampal tissue. Particles were identified using high resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction and elemental analysis. Though its presence has been inferred from magnetic analyses, this is the first direct observation of magnetic biominerals from the hippocampus.
