The multitubulin hypothesis holds that each tubulin isotype serves a unique role with respect to microtubule function. Here we investigate the role of the alpha-tubulin subunit Tuba1a in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the formation of the dentate gyrus. Employing birth date labelling and immunohistological markers, we show that mice harbouring an S140G mutation in Tuba1a present with normal neurogenic potential, but that this neurogenesis is often ectopic. Morphological analysis of the dentate gyrus in adulthood revealed a disorganised subgranular zone and a dispersed granule cell layer. We have shown that these anatomical abnormalities are due to defective migration of prospero-homeobox-1-positive neurons and T-box-brain-2-positive progenitors during development. Such migratory defects may also be responsible for the cytoarchitectural defects observed in the dentate gyrus of patients with mutations in TUBA1A.
