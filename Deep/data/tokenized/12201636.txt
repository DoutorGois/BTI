The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is the core structure of the declarative memory system, but which specific operation is performed by anatomically defined MTL substructures? One hypothesis proposes that the hippocampus carries out an exclusively mnemonic operation during declarative memory formation that is insensitive to content, whereas the rhinal cortex carries out an operation supporting memory formation indirectly. To explore the interaction between a salient item feature and memory formation, we contrasted neural correlates of memory formation of high- and low-frequency words. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded via depth electrodes from within the MTL in nine epilepsy patients while they memorized single words. To assess memory formation, ERPs to words subsequently recalled in a free recall test were contrasted with ERPs to forgotten words. More high- than low-frequency words were remembered. High-frequency words led to distinct ERP subsequent memory effects in rhinal cortex and hippocampus. Low-frequency words, however, were only associated with the hippocampal ERP effect. The anatomically restricted interaction between word frequency and memory formation might indicate a semantically affected operation in the parahippocampal region supporting memory formation indirectly. By contrast, the missing interaction in hippocampal recordings might suggest a direct correlate of declarative memory formation that is insensitive to item properties.
