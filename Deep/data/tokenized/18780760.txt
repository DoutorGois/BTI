Aside from abnormal angiogenesis, dual endothelin-1/VEGF signal peptide-activated receptor deficiency (DEspR(-/-)) results in aberrant neuroepithelium and neural tube differentiation, thus elucidating DEspR's role in neurogenesis. With the emerging importance of neurogenesis in adulthood, we tested the hypothesis that nonembryonic-lethal DEspR haploinsufficiency (DEspR(+/-)) perturbs neuronal homeostasis, thereby facilitating aging-associated neurodegeneration. Here we show that, in male mice only, DEspR-haploinsufficiency impaired hippocampus-dependent visuospatial and associative learning and induced noninflammatory spongiform changes, neuronal vacuolation, and loss in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and subcortical regions, consistent with autophagic cell death. In contrast, DEspR(+/-) females exhibited better cognitive performance than wild-type females and showed absence of neuropathological changes. Signaling pathway analysis revealed DEspR-mediated phosphorylation of activators of autophagy inhibitor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and dephosphorylation of known autophagy inducers. Altogether, the data demonstrate DEspR-mediated diametrical, sex-specific modulation of cognitive performance and autophagy, highlight cerebral neuronal vulnerability to autophagic dysregulation, and causally link DEspR haploinsufficiency with increased neuronal autophagy, spongiosis, and cognitive decline in mice.
