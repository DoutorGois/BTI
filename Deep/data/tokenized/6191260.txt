The activities of RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase were measured in hippocampus of fast and slow learning Wistar rats. The RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity in the hippocampus of fast learning rats exceeds two-fold that in the slow learning ones, while the rates of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities are similar. A significant increase in RNA-dependent DNA polymerase only was found in the hippocampus of rats 20 min after training for the conditioned food response before the trace consolidation registered 40 min after the training session. The data obtained are consistent with the suggestion that reverse transcription plays an important role in memory consolidation.
