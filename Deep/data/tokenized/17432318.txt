Investigation of changes in the hippocampal EEG produced by GABAergic and cholinergic substances delivered into the medial septum region was performed in awake rabbits. Changes in the threshold of seizure discharges in the hippocampus evoked by perforant path stimulation (model of acute epilepsy) were also examined. Injections of GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin or agonist of cholinergic receptors carbacholine in low doses induced an increase in the power of delta- and theta modulation and appearance of 7-12-Hz oscillations. The threshold of hippocampal seizure afterdischarges decreased. In higher doses, these substances evoked 7-15-Hz oscillations followed by seizures. GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine decreased the power of the theta rhythm and increased the seizure threshold. Picrotoxin or carbacholine injected after muscimol or scopolamine, respectively, did not evoke seizures. Thus, we have shown the possibility to control hippocampal activity by local changes in the GABAergic and cholinergic systems of the medial septum region.
