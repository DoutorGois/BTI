The binding parameters of 5-HT(2A) and levels of its second messenger, 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP(3)), were simultaneously studied in frontal cortex and hippocampus from the brains of 18 control subjects and 18 depressed suicide victims. All suicides met DSM-III-R criteria for depressive symptoms, suffered a violent death and had not taken any antidepressant drugs for at least 6 months prior to death. A significant decrease in the number of 5-HT(2A) binding sites (154+/-22 vs. 254+/-36 fmol/mg), together with a significantly lower apparent affinity constant (1.02+/- 0.08 vs. 1. 36+/-0.09 nM), was detected in hippocampus but not in frontal cortex from the depressed suicides compared to the control subjects. Furthermore, IP(3) concentrations were significantly increased in hippocampus (3.2+/-0.3 vs. 2.1+/-0.3 pmol/g) but not in frontal cortex (1.3+/-0.3 vs. 2.7+/-0.5 pmol/g) from the suicide victims. The reported results may indicate a significant hypersensitivity of the 5-HT(2A) postsynaptic receptor located in the hippocampus from depressed suicide victims, giving rise to an enhancement of its intracellular signaling system with higher IP(3) production.
