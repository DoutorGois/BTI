The effects of the lectins concanavalin A, WGA, ricin, abrin, and the mistletoe lectins from Viscum album MLI, MLII, and MLIII on the binding of ligands of the NMDA and sigma receptors in rat hippocampus synaptic plasma membranes were investigated. Binding of [3H]MK-801, [3H]glutamate, [3H]5,7-DCKA, and [3H]glycine to the membranes was decreased by 40-60% after addition of galactose-specific lectins (mistletoe lectins MLI, MLII, ricin, abrin) at concentrations of 0.01 mg/ml, but was not affected by the glucose- and mannose-specific lectin Con A, an acetylglucosamine-specific lectin WGA, or an acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin MLIII. The binding of [3H]SKF 10047 was decreased only in the presence of MLIII and did not change after addition of the other lectins. It is suggested that lectin-sensitive ligand binding sites of sigma- and NMDA receptors are located separately, and that the carbohydrate side chains of the sigma receptor do not participate in the modulation of the NMDA-receptor.
