Rats aged 7 days were exposed to 3.5 h of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia produced by unilateral common carotid artery ligation combined with hypoxia (8% oxygen). The major inducible heat-shock protein, HSP-68, was synthesized in ipsilateral but not contralateral (control) hippocampus during early recovery (1 and 3 h). HSP-68 synthesis was not detected during longer recovery periods. The presence of HSP-68 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunostaining with a polyclonal antibody to HSP-68.
