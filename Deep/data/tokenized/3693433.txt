An experimental model for repeated ischemic attacks, which allows easy induction of cerebral ischemia of any desired duration and frequency, has been developed in the gerbil. With this procedure, a pronounced cumulative effect on development of edema and tissue injury was observed using 3 separate, 5-min bilateral occlusions of the common carotid arteries spaced at various time intervals. This effect was most evident when the occlusions were carried out at 1-h intervals, i.e., during the period of marked postischemic hypoperfusion. Such animals, killed after 24 h of recirculation, showed significantly more severe edema and brain tissue injury in the areas exposed to ischemia than was observed in animals killed 24 h after single 5- or 15-min occlusions. The changes of regional CBF, assayed with a [3H]nicotine method, indicated a relatively rapid onset of hypoperfusion of similar degree after each release of arterial occlusion. The hypoperfusion recovered significantly within 6 h of recirculation following either single or multiple occlusions, and no residual hypoperfusion was observed in animals which, when killed at 24 h, showed severe edema and brain tissue injury. This model should prove useful in elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms operative in repetitive cerebral ischemia.
