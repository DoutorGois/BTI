An in vitro human neocortical and rodent hippocampus brain slice technique was used under repeated hypoxia to investigate the cerebroprotective effect of hypothermia. As a hallmark of the neuronal hypoxic reaction anoxic terminal negativity (ATN) was registered to test whether hypothermia delays the onset of ATN. The experiments clearly confirm an assumed protective effect of hypothermia in vitro and in vivo and give for the first time evidence of the lack of the protective effect of hypothermia once hypoxia has occurred under normothermic conditions, probably by a critical depletion of cellular ATP-stores. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury and critically low cerebral perfusion pressure mild hypothermia is able to improve clinical outcome.
