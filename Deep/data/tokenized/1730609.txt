Complementary DNAs encoding the mouse GLUT3/brain facilitative glucose transporter have been isolated and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that mouse GLUT3 is composed of 493 amino acids and has 83 and 89% identity and similarity, respectively, to the sequence of human GLUT3. In contrast to human GLUT3 mRNA, which can be readily detected by RNA blotting in all human tissues that have been examined, mouse GLUT3 mRNA was only present at significant levels in brain. In situ hybridization showed differential expression of GLUT3 mRNA in several regions of adult mouse brain. Specific expression was observed in the hippocampus, with GLUT3 mRNA levels being higher in areas CA1 to CA3 than in the dentate gyrus. It was also detected in the Purkinje cell layer of the cerebellum and in the cerebral cortex, with higher expression in the piriform cortex than in other regions of the cortex. Antisera to mouse GLUT3 immunoblotted a series of proteins of 45-50 kDa in mouse brain plasma membranes. These results are consistent with GLUT3 being a neuronal glucose transporter.
