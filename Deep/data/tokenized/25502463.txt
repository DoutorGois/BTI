One major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of senile plaques mainly composed of neurotoxic amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in the patients' brains. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a morphogen critically involved in the embryonic development of the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we tested whether Abeta may induce SHH expression and explored its underlying mechanisms. We found that both Abeta25-35 and Abeta1-42 enhanced SHH expression in the primary cortical neurons derived from fetal rat brains. Immunohistochemistry revealed heightened expression of SHH in the cortex and hippocampus of aged (9 and 12 months old) AD transgenic mouse brains as compared to age-matched littermate controls. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated that Abeta25-35 enhanced binding of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) to the promoter of the Shh gene in primary cortical cultures; consistently, Abeta25-35 induction of SHH was abolished by HIF-1alpha small interfering RNA (siRNA). Abeta25-35 also time-dependently induced inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1) that has been shown to stabilize HIF-1alpha; further, Abeta25-35-mediated induction of HIF-1alpha and SHH was both suppressed by Id1 siRNA. Pharmacological induction of HIF-1alpha by cobalt chloride and application of the cell-permeable recombinant Id1 proteins were both sufficient to induce SHH expression. Finally, both the SHH pathway inhibitor cyclopamine and its neutralizing antibody attenuated Abeta cytotoxicity, albeit to a minor extent. These results thus established a signaling cascade of "Abeta --> Id1 --> HIF-1 --> SHH" in primary rat cortical cultures; furthermore, SHH may in part contribute to Abeta neurotoxicity.
