The olfactory bulb (OB) kindling is a model of limbic secondary generalized epilepsy. Ten days after the completion of OB kindling, we have studied the long term effects of both electrode insertion and kindling on the binding of [3H]diazepam to crude mitochondrial fractions. On the one hand, we have shown that electrode implantation in sham-operated controls induced an obvious increase in benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor density (Bmax) only at the site of the electrode in comparison to sham-unoperated rats. These results might indicate an additional mechanism extending earlier observations reported by others, who have shown that prolonged electrode implantation induced changes in sham-operated and kindled rats. On the other hand, the long lasting effect of OB kindling on the binding parameters of [3H]diazepam was examined in the focus and in the hippocampus. The results indicate a bilateral increase of BZD receptors in the OB and an ipsilateral increase in the hippocampus. These changes might be a regulation phenomenon in response to a hyperexcitability state and to focal stimulations.
