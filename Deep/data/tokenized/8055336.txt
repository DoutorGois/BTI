Two subtypes of arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors (V1 and V2) have been distinguished. In this study, we examined the characteristics of AVP binding in rat hippocampus and the effects of bilateral adrenalectomy and adrenal steroids on its [3H]AVP binding. [3H]AVP binding to rat liver and the hippocampal membranes was strongly inhibited by the V1 antagonist, OPC-21268. ADX resulted in a significant decrease in the Bmax of AVP binding in the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with aldosterone and corticosterone restored the ADX-induced reduction, but treatment with dexamethasone did not. These results suggest that the AVP V1 receptor in the hippocampus is regulated by adrenocortical neuroregulatory functions.
