This paper introduces the use of a new tool based on Morlet wavelet transform to detection the interaction dynamics between two neuronal population oscillations. This toolbox can describe the power spectrum, cross wavelet transform, coherence, bi-coherence, cross phase angle and phase synchronization of two neuronal oscillations. Through a case study of focus epilepsy model, a linear and nonlinear correlation between the neuronal oscillations in the CA1 and CA3 of rat hippocampus are computed. The results show that the tool can be directly applied to analyze and quantify the instantaneous interaction of two neuronal oscillations, which could be a helpful tool to analyze and understand the mechanism of epileptic seizure in EEG recordings.
