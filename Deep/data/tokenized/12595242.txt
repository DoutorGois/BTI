The upregulation of TIMP-1 following an excitotoxic injury has recently been hypothesized to be part of a general neuronal response that mediates long-lasting changes involved in tissue reorganization and possibly neuroprotection. In this study we have shown for the first time that within hours of applying TIMP-1 in recombinant form or by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, neurons are highly protected against excitotoxic injury. Neither TIMP-3 nor a nonsecretable form of TIMP-1 protected neurons. TIMP-1 conferred highly significant protection to hippocampal cells exposed to a wide range of glutamic acid concentrations in both dissociated and organotypic hippocampal cultures. TIMP-1 did not prevent apoptotic cell death or death mediated by chemical ischemia. The observed neuroprotection may be explained by a decrease in calcium influx into neurons following stimulation with glutamate. These findings have a fundamental implication for our understanding of the physiological role of secreted TIMP-1 in the central nervous system.
