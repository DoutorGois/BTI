Experiments were made on rats of two lines during 120-140 days. A study was made of the effect of transplanting the embryonal hippocamp tissue and the septum (E 18) on the phenotypically (mechanical destruction in Wistar rats of the areas CA1 and CA4 of the fields of the hippocamp and dentate gyrus) and genotypically (Krushinskii-Molodkina rats, all responding to graded acoustic stimulations (86 dB) by audiogenic convulsive fits) determined high convulsive activity of the brain. It has been shown that from days 4-6, in 19 out of 23 Wistar rats, the transplantation was followed by a steady increase of the threshold of convulsive activity. As to the threshold of convulsive activity in K-M rats, it was affected by the transplantation to a slightly less measure. Out of 17 K-M rats, 9 stopped reacting to acoustic stimulations by audiogenic convulsive fits from days 39-44. In 5 more animals, convulsive fits failed to occur after every acoustic stimulation, the duration of the clonic and tonic phases of convulsive fit and the duration of the post-paroxysmal motor excitation declined.
