The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), mammillary bodies and their interconnecting fiber tract, the mammillothalamic tract (MTT), are important components of an extended hippocampal circuit for episodic memory. In humans, damage to the MTT or ATN in many disorders is associated with severe anterograde amnesia and it is assumed that their influence on memory is functionally equivalent. The relative influence of these two structures on memory has not, however, been assessed explicitly. Here, a direct comparison found that only ATN lesions impaired spatial reference memory in rats. ATN lesions produced more severe deficits on spatial working memory and reduced zif268 expression to a greater degree and in more corticolimbic sites than did MTT lesions. Conversely, MTT lesions reduced NeuN cell counts in all three subregions of the MB to a greater extent than did ATN lesions, so their relative impact cannot be explained by retrograde neuropathology of the MB. Hence ATN injury causes a more critical dysfunction than would be expected by an emphasis on the indirect influence of brainstem inputs to the extended memory system. The greater ATN lesion deficits found here may represent the consequence of disruption to the direct connections of the ATN with both hippocampal and cortical sites.
