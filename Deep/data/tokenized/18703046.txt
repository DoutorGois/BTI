Evidence that Rho-kinase is involved in cerebral infarction has accumulated. However, it is uncertain whether Rho-kinase is activated in the brain parenchyma in cerebral infarction. To answer this question, we measured Rho-kinase activity in the brain in a rat cerebral infarction model. Sodium laurate was injected into the left internal carotid artery, inducing cerebral infarction in the ipsilateral hemisphere. At 6 h after injection, increase of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and c-Fos was found in the ipsilateral hemisphere, suggesting that neuronal damage occurs. At 0.5, 3, and 6 h after injection of laurate, Rho-kinase activity in extracts of the cerebral hemispheres was measured by an ELISA method. Rho-kinase activity in extracts of the ipsilateral hemisphere was significantly increased compared with that in extracts of the contralateral hemisphere at 3 and 6 h but not 0.5 h after injection of laurate. Next, localization of Rho-kinase activity was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis in sections of cortex and hippocampus including infarct area 6 h after injection of laurate. Staining for phosphorylation of myosin-binding subunit (phospho-MBS) and myosin light chain (phospho-MLC), substrates of Rho-kinase, was elevated in neuron and blood vessel, respectively, in ipsilateral cerebral sections, compared with those in contralateral cerebral sections. These findings indicate that Rho-kinase is activated in neuronal and vascular cells in a rat cerebral infarction model, and suggest that Rho-kinase could be an important target in the treatment of cerebral infarction.
