Using the conflict drinking Vogel test in rats as a model we examined the anxiolytic-like activity of (RS)-alpha-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP) and (RS)-alpha-methylserine-O-phosphate-monophenyl ester (MSOPPE), the antagonists of group III and II of mGluR, respectively, after their intrahippocampal administration. The results indicated that MSOP produced a dose dependent anticonflict effect in rats.
