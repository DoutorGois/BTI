Membrane depolarization leads to changes in gene expression that modulate neuronal plasticity. Using representational difference analysis, we have identified a previously undiscovered cDNA, KID-1 (kinase induced by depolarization), that is induced by membrane depolarization or forskolin, but not by neurotrophins or growth factors, in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. KID-1 is an immediate early gene that shares a high degree of sequence similarity with the family of PIM-1 serine/threonine protein kinases. Recombinant KID-1 fusion protein is able to catalyze both histone phosphorylation and autophosphorylation. KID-1 mRNA is present in a number of unstimulated tissues, including brain. In response to kainic acid and electroconvulsive shock-induced seizures, KID-1 is induced in specific regions of the hippocampus and cortex.
