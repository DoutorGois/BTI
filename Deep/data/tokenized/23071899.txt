This study was designed to analyze the effect of hippocampal neurogenesis on the spatial maps of granule cells. Accordingly, we developed and improved an artificial neural network that was originally proposed by Aimone. Many biological processes were included in this revised model to improve the biological relevance of the results. We proposed a novel learning-testing protocol to analyze the activation of encoding place cells across contexts and over time in the dentate gyrus. We observed that, regardless of the presence of neurogenesis, the quantity and morphology of the place fields were represented in the same manner by granule cells. Additionally, we observed that neurogenesis was an effective mechanism for reducing the degree of rate remapping that occurred in the place fields of the granule cells.
