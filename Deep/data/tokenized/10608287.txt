Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) were investigated in hippocampus of a genetic model of Down syndrome, the segmental trisomy (Ts65Dn) mouse. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded from hippocampal slices and LTP and LTD evoked sequentially. LTP decreased whereas LTD increased significantly in Ts65Dn compared with control hippocampus.
