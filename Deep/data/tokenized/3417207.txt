Effects of lisuride, a central dopamine agonist of the ergot type, on local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) were studied using the autoradiographical 14C-iodoantipyrine and 3H-deoxyglucose method, respectively, in conscious rats. Lisuride significantly stimulated LCBF in the cerebellar gray matter. LCBF in some other regions including the cerebral cortex, caudate-putamen, thalamus, geniculate body and substantia nigra were also stimulated by lisuride. No changes were observed in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and white matter. A close correlation was observed between LCBF and LCGU. Region specificity of the stimulatory effect by lisuride on LCBF and LCGU was coincident. Lisuride shortened the lethal time in the anoxia model. In conclusion, lisuride stimulated not only glucose utilization but also blood flow in local regions of the brain.
