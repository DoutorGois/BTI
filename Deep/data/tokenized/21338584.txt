Single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1997794) in promoter of the prodynorphin gene (PDYN) associated with alcohol-dependence may impact PDYN transcription in human brain. To address this hypothesis we analyzed PDYN mRNA levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl-PFC) and hippocampus, both involved in cognitive control of addictive behavior and PDYN promoter SNP genotype in alcohol-dependent and control human subjects. The principal component analysis suggested that PDYN expression in the dl-PFC may be related to alcoholism, while in the hippocampus may depend on the genotype. We also demonstrated that the T, low risk SNP allele resides within noncanonical AP-1-binding element that may be targeted by JUND and FOSB proteins, the dominant AP-1 constituents in the human brain. The T to C transition abrogated AP-1 binding. The impact of genetic variations on PDYN transcription may be relevant for diverse adaptive responses of this gene to alcohol.
