Although the role of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in calcium homeostasis of bone tissue is clear, evidence of the involvement of vitamin D3 in the central nervous system functions is increasing. In fact, vitamin D3 regulates vitamin D receptor and nerve growth factor expression, modulates brain development, and reverses experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Only few studies, however, address vitamin D3 effect on embryonic hippocampal cell differentiation. In this investigation, the HN9.10e cell line was used as experimental model; these cells, that are a somatic fusion product of hippocampal cells from embryonic day-18 C57BL/6 mice and N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells, show morphological and cytoskeletal features similar to their neuronal precursors. By this model, we have studied the time course of vitamin D3 localization in the nucleus and its effect on proteins involved in proliferation and/or differentiation. We found that the translocation of vitamin D3 from cytoplasm to the nucleus is transient, as the maximal nuclear concentration is reached after 10 h of incubation with (3)H-vitamin D3 and decreases to control values by 12 h. The appearance of differentiation markers such as Bcl2, NGF, STAT3, and the decrease of proliferation markers such as cyclin-1 and PCNA are late events. Moreover, physiological concentrations of vitamin D3 delay cell proliferation and induce cell differentiation of embryonic cells characterized by modification of soma lengthening and formation of axons and dendrites.
