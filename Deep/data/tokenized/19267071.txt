OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of zinc on Uch-L1 expression in hippocampus of growing rats. METHODS: Thirty-six male weanling Wistar rats were randomly assigned to zinc-adequate (ZA), zinc-deficient (ZD) and pair-fed (PF) groups. Rats of ZD group were given free access to a basal diet (Zn 1.5 mg/kg). Rats of other two groups were given the basal diet supplemented with zinc sulfate (Zn 30 mg/kg). PF rats consumed the same intakes as the corresponding ZD partner on the previous day. After 4-wk treatment, plasma zinc concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity were tested. Passive avoidance performance was used to examine learning and memory function. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to assess the expressions of Uch-L1 protein and mRNA in rat hippocampus, respectively. RESULTS: Zinc deprivation dramatically decreased plasma zinc concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity. Significantly shorter latency period in passive avoidance performance in ZD group were observed. Uch-L1 protein and mRNA expression levels in hippocampus significantly reduced in comparison with ZA and PF groups. CONCLUSION: Zinc deficiency could induce downregulation of Uch-L1 expression.
