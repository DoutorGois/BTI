Oxidative injury of tissues involves both accumulation of damage due to persistent oxidative stress and loss of the proper balance of antioxidative enzymes. These events may produce a faster rate of tissue senescence. In this regard, we have assayed the antioxidative enzyme activities (Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and catalase), in various areas of rat brain (prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, mesencephalon and lower brain stem) for the age groups of 3, 6, 12, 24 months. The results obtained show that the levels of antioxidant enzyme activities differed considerably in the various brain parts studied. Furthermore, changes in the specific activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase did not follow the same pattern as a function of aging. In particular, in prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities did not change, while catalase activity decreased. In parietal cortex and mesencephalon, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities increased, but the catalase activity decreased in parietal cortex and did not change in mesencephalon. In lower brain stem, the activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase decreased in 3-12-month-old rats. The activity of glutathione peroxidase was increased in the hippocampus and was decreased in hypothalamus during aging. In this area the catalase activity was also significantly diminished.
