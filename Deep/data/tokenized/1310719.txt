Forebrain ischemia in gerbils, produced by brief bilateral carotid occlusion, induced the dramatic loss of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) as determined by both kinase activity assays and western blot analysis. In cortex and hippocampus, cytosolic CaM-kinase II was completely lost within 2-5 min of ischemia. Particulate CaM-kinase II was more stable and decreased in level approximately 40% after 10 min of ischemia followed by 2 h of reperfusion. CaM-kinase II in cerebellum, which does not become ischemic, was not affected. The rapid loss of CaM-kinase II within 2-5 min was quite specific because cytosolic cyclic AMP kinase and protein kinase C in hippocampus were not affected. These data indicate that cytosolic CaM-kinase II is one of the most rapidly degraded proteins after brief ischemia. Because the multifunctional CaM-kinase II has been implicated in the regulation of numerous neuronal functions, its loss may destine the neuronal cell for death.
