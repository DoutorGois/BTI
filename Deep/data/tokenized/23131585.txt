Aluminum (Al) is a neurotoxic agent with deleterious actions on cognitive processes. Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the neuropathological effects underlying the Al-induced cognitive impairment. We have explored the effects of acute Al citrate intoxication on both hippocampal morphology and mnemonic processes in rodents. Adult male Wistar rats were intoxicated with a daily dose of Al citrate (320 mg/kg) during 4 days by gavage. Animals were perfused at 8 (G2), 17 (G3) and 31 days (G4) after intoxication. Control animals were treated with sodium citrate (G1). Animals were submitted to behavioral tests of open field and elevated T-maze. Immunohistochemistry was performed to label neurons (anti-NeuN) and astrocytes (anti-GFAP) in both CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions. There was an increase in the locomotor activity in open field test for G2 in comparison to control group and other groups (ANOVA-Bonferroni, P<0.05). The elevated T-maze avoidance latency (AL) was higher in all intoxicated groups compared to control (P<0.05) in avoidance 1. These values remained elevated in avoidance 2 (P<0.05), but abruptly decreased in G2 and G3, but not in G1 and G4 animals in avoidance 3 (P<0.05). There were no significant differences for 1 and 2 escape latencies. There were intense neuronal loss and a progressive decrease in GFAP immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of intoxicated animals. The results suggest that Al citrate treatment induces deficits on learning and memory concomitant with neuronal loss and astrocyte impairment in the hippocampus of intoxicated rats.
