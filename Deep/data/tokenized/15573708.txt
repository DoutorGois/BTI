A possible relationship between the amnesia induced by central administration of beta-amyloid (25-35) [Abeta(25-35)] and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus was studied. Male Wistar rats received a single intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta(25-35) at a dose of 15 nmol. One month after the administration, animals were trained in an eight-arm radial maze. After the training, a histopathological investigation of the hippocampus was carried out using brain slices stained with hematoxylin/eosin. Abeta(25-35) induced impairments in reference and working memory in the eight-arm radial maze. A moderate decrease in neuronal cell number was demonstrated in the CA1, but not in the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus. The number of both reference and working errors negatively correlated with the number of neurons in hippocampal CA1. The results are the first evidence for a specific relationship between neurodegeneration in the CA1 subfield of rat hippocampus and impairments of learning and memory induced by Abeta(25-35).
