We recently developed a novel cognitive enhancer, ST101 (spiro[imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3,2-indan]-2(3H)-one), that activates T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Here, we address whether T-type VGCC activation with ST101 mediates its cognitive effects in vivo and the relevance of T-type VGCC activation to acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus. Acute intraperitoneal administration of ST101 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) improved memory-related behaviors in both olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) and scopolamine-treated mice. Effects of ST101 administration were abolished by both intraperitoneal and intracerebroventricular pre-administration of the T-type VGCC inhibitor mibefradil. Acute administration of ST101 enhanced basal and nicotine-induced ACh release in the dorsal hippocampus in both OBX and sham-treated mice. Enhanced ACh release was abolished by infusion with mibefradil (10 muM) but not with the L-type VGCC inhibitor nifedipine (10 muM). As expected, significantly reduced CaMKIIalpha, PKCalpha, and ERK phosphorylation was restored by acute ST101 administration in the OBX mouse hippocampal CA1 region. Enhancement of CaMKIIalpha and PKCalpha but not ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by mibefradil (20 mg/kg, i.p.) preadministration. Increased CaMKIIalpha and PKCalpha phosphorylation was confirmed by increased phosphorylation of GluR1, synapsin I, and NR1. Taken together, stimulation of T-type VGCCs is critical for the enhanced hippocampal ACh release and improved cognitive function seen following ST101 administration.
