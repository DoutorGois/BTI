The monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities and the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were investigated in four brain regions in rats during the acquisition of latent inhibition in one-trial passive avoidance task. 5-HT metabolism was not altered in the hippocampus. Changes of 5-HT metabolism were found in the frontal cortex during testing of latent inhibition and were accompanied by lowering of MAO activity. No change of 5-HT metabolism was observed in this structure at the stage of pre-exposition to conditioned stimulus. 5-HT metabolism was activated at the stage of pre-exposition to conditioned stimulus in the amygdala and striatum and was maintained on high level, in these structures during testing of latent inhibition. The data presented here indicate that serotoninergic system in various brains regions is specifically involved in the formation of different stages of latent inhibition.
