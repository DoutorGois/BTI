The dynamics of spatial-temporal interrelationships in delayed spatial choice and in differentiation between two conditioned reflexes was studied with the aid of a distant synchronization of electrical activity of prefrontal cortex hippocampus, head of the caudate nucleus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus in 6 rhesus monkeys. A comparative neurophysiological analysis revealed the elements of similarity and difference in the trace processes in both behavioral models which were correlated with the animal behaviour.
