Electrical stimulation of the Schaffer-collateral axonal system under conditions which do not elicit detectable seizure activity causes an increase in the activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate limiting enzyme of polyamine synthesis, in the hippocampus, olfactory cortex, neocortex and olfactory bulb. The degree of ODC activation is dependent upon the stimulus parameters. The results support the hypothesis that neuronal activity regulates hippocampal polyamine concentrations.
