The ischaemic changes in the hippocampus reported here were observed during a series of experiments in which the effect of ionized and non-ionized intracortically injected contrast media were investigated. Only the group with ionized contrast medium showed early ischaemic lesions in the hippocampal neurons. Our model is comparable with the final status epilepticus. Generalized spike activity of more than 2 1/2 hours, without a recovery phase, is involved. Our findings thus indicate that under certain conditions, i.e. in this case, generalized activity lasting for a long time, ischaemic lesions can occur. However, in view of the ultrastructural features, the changes can still be considered reversible.
