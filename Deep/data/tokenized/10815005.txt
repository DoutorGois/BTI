This paper reviews the effects of thallophytic glucans on rodent cognitive performance modelled by a combination of behavioural and electrophysiological approaches. Glucans were isolated from thallophytic plants, based on prescriptions used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. In parallel with the already described enhancement of hippocampal synaptic plasticity by disaccharides, polysaccharides isolated from lichens Flavoparmelia caperata and Cetrariella islandica, enhanced hippocampal plasticity and behavioural performance in rats.
