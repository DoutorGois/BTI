Declarative memory enables conscious recollection of the past and has been proposed to be distinct from priming, a perceptual form of memory that operates nonconsciously and improves the ability to detect or identify recently presented stimuli. Yet, it has been difficult to obtain unambiguous evidence for the independence of declarative memory and priming. The authors report the first demonstration, using matched tests, of fully intact perceptual memory (priming) in a profoundly amnesic patient (E.P.), despite at-chance recognition memory. The priming and recognition tests included tests that were matched with respect to test materials, length of the study and test lists, and the kind of cues available at test. Priming appears to reflect neural changes within perceptual processing systems that occur before information reaches the brain systems that transform visual perception into conscious visual memory.
