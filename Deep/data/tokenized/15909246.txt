Yawning is a physiological event that can be divided into three distinct phases: a long inspiratory phase, a brief acme and a rapid exspiration. The reason for yawning is not yet well defined. However this semi-voluntary event increases vigilance and aims to alert when drowsiness occurs. Yawning may have an important role for social communication. The neuropharmacology of yawning is complex and knowledge of its mechanisms is incomplete. While under the control of several neurotransmitters, yawning is largely affected by dopamine. Dopamine may activate oxytocin production in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, oxytocin may then activate cholinergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, and finally acetylcholine might induce yawning via the muscarinic receptors of the effectors. In fact, this scheme is simplified. Many other molecules can modulate yawning, such as nitric oxide, glutamate, GABA, serotonin, ACTH, MSH, sexual hormones and opium derivate peptides.
