Chronic administration of lithium led to a decreased number of benzodiazepine receptors (ca. 20%) in frontal cortex of rat brain, whereas no change was observed in the binding characteristics in the remaining part of the cortex and in the hippocampus and the cerebellum. Long-term lithium treatment did not change the binding of [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate to membranes of various brain regions in the rat. We concluded that the effect of lithium on the benzodiazepine receptor is brain region specific and cannot be explained as a consequence of a reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic stimulation of benzodiazepine receptor, as the change in receptor binding was due to a change in the number of receptors rather than in the affinity constant.
