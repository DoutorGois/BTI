The senescence accelerated mouse (SAM) is known as a murine model of aging and memory dysfunction. In the cerebral cortical membranes of male 9-month-old SAM mice, the Bmax values of [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]nitrendipine binding, and the values of both Kd and Bmax of [3H]TCP binding in the accelerated aging strain SAM-P/8, were significantly increased compared with the values in the control strain SAM-R/1. In hippocampal membranes, however, the Bmax values of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and [3H]nitrendipine binding were significantly decreased in SAM-P/8 compared with those in SAM-R/1. These results suggest that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, alpha 2-adrenoceptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channels and L-type Ca2+ channels are changed in cerebral cortex and hippocampus in SAM-P/8 at 9 months.
