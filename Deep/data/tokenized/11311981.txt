In brain synapses, nitric oxide synthase activation is coupled to N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated calcium entry at postsynaptic densities through regulatory protein complexes, however a presynaptic equivalent to this signaling mechanism has not yet been identified. Novel evidence indicates that N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors may play a presynaptic role in synaptic plasticity. Thus, we investigated whether ionotropic glutamate receptor activation in isolated nerve terminals regulates neurotransmitter release, through nitric oxide formation. N-Methyl-D-aspartate dose-dependently inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by 4-aminopyridine (IC(50)=155 microM), and this effect was reversed by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid and by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-nitroarginine, in synaptosomes isolated from whole hippocampus, CA3 and CA1 areas, but not from the dentate gyrus. In contrast, the 4-aminopyridine-evoked release of glutamate was reduced by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid or kainate by a nitric oxide-independent mechanism, since it was not blocked by L-nitroarginine, and N-methyl-D-aspartate, but not alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid or kainate, significantly increased cGMP formation. Presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are probably involved since removing extracellular nitric oxide with the scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide did not block the depression of glutamate release by N-methyl-D-aspartate. The mechanism underlying this depression involves the inhibition of synaptic vesicle exocytosis since N-methyl-D-aspartate/nitric oxide inhibited the release of [3H]glutamate and [14C]GABA evoked by hypertonic sucrose. The results also suggest that presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may function as auto- and heteroreceptors.
