After release, neurotransmitters are removed from the extracellular space by high-affinity uptake. Specific sodium-dependent transporters serve this function for the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, it is largely unknown to which proportion GABA is taken up by GABAergic interneurons, glia cells or principal neurons. We analyzed the distribution of mRNA for the main GABA-transporter subtype in the hippocampus, GAT-1, in adult rats. Most interneurons were strongly stained for GAT-1 mRNA, indicating re-uptake by the GABA-releasing cells. Surprisingly, prominent signals for GAT-1 were also found throughout the principal cell layers (granule and pyramidal cells). These data indicate that GABA transporters may be present in non-GABAergic projection cells of the rat hippocampus which contribute to the clearance of GABA from the extracellular space.
