Intracerebroventricular injection of the toxin 192 IgG-saporin (4 micrograms) kills the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain bearing the low affinity NGF receptor (NGFr). The effect of this cholinergic denervation on the hippocampal and cortical electrical activity (EEG) was studied during sleep and wakefulness. EEG was recorded under freely-moving conditions in lesioned (n = 10) and control (n = 6) rats (8-16 days post-injection). In lesioned rats, active (AW) and quiet (QW) wakefulness episode durations were similar to those of controls whereas the REM sleep duration was reduced, 8 days post-lesion (P < 0.01). Bouts of REM sleep were more numerous but shorter. The hippocampal theta activity was still present in lesioned-rats during AW (type 1 theta), QW (type 2 theta) and REM sleep. The frequency was unchanged but the amplitude of the three types of theta was significantly reduced (P < 0.01). Type 2 theta occurred with shorter and less regular bouts (P < 0.05). Abnormal slow waves (2-4 Hz) were observed during wakefulness. Histology showed a dramatic loss of NGFr-positive neurons in the basal forebrain and a decline in hippocampal and cortical acetylcholinesterase activity. These results suggest that the cholinergic septohippocampal input is not the primary pacemaker for the hippocampal theta rhythm.
