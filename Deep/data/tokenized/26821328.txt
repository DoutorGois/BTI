Depression is a chronic mental disorder. Inflammatory reactions have an important function in the pathophysiology of depression. Ikwitang (IW) has been used to treat fever and inflammatory diseases, however, its effect on depression has not been previously investigated. Therefore, the present study evaluated the possible antidepressantlike effect of IW using a forced swimming test (FST) in mice. IW was orally administered for 14 days. On the 14 day, IW was administered 1 h prior to the FST. The immobility durations of the IW groups (0.01, 0.1 and 1 g/kg) were significantly decreased, compared with those of the distilled water (D.W.) groups. The reduction of immobility duration by IW was associated with significant increases in the levels of serotonin, noradrenaline and estrogen receptorbeta in the brain. IW significantly increased the levels of brainderived neurotrophic factor and phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinases, compared with the D.W. groups. In addition, the levels of inflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced following IW administration in the hippocampus and serum. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested that the antidepressant effect of IW may be associated with the modulation of monoaminergic systems and inflammatory reactions.
