Gene linkage and association studies have implicated the region of chromosome 10q containing the calcyon locus with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia susceptibility. In addition, levels of calcyon protein and transcripts are also significantly increased in postmortem tissue from schizophrenic brains. But whether altered calcyon expression might be part of the disease etiology or merely a patho-physiological side effect is not known. To begin to address this issue, we generated a transgenic mouse line (Cal(OE)) using the human calcyon cDNA in which calcyon expression is up-regulated in a number of forebrain structures including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum, and amygdala. Compared to control littermates, the Cal(OE) mice display a range of abnormal behaviors including spontaneous hyperactivity, reduced anxiety, and/or impaired restraint (harm avoidance) that would indicate that calcyon up-regulation leads to deficits in control over behavioral output.
