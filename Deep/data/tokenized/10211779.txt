Fra-1 is a member of the Fos family whose functional role in the central nervous system is little understood. In the present study, Fra-1 immunoreactivity is examined in the rat brain during normal development and after different injuries in adulthood, by using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Western blots show a band at p35 which corresponds to the molecular weight of Fra-1. During postnatal development, Fra-1 immunoreactivity is observed in nerve fibers of all the main fiber tracts in the cerebrum, whereas Fra-1 immunoreactivity in adult rats is restricted to the hippocampus, mainly the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the mossy fiber layer. After administration of colchicine, an axonal transport inhibitor, Fra-1 immunoreactivity accumulates in the perikarya of many cerebral neurons, including those of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala and thalamus. Fra-1 immunoreactivity is also found in the nuclei of reactive astrocytes, as revealed with double-labeling immunohistochemistry to Fra-1 and GFAP, following either intraperitoneal injection of kainic acid at convulsant doses, intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid, or intraventricular injection of colchicine. These results suggest a cytoplasmic role for Fra-1 in the neurons, whereas the localization of Fra-1 in the nuclei of reactive astrocytes suggests a participation of this transcription factor in the activation of the AP-1 sequence of selected genes in the early glial response after different brain lesions.
