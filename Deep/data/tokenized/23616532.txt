The cellular and molecular effects of stress on the amygdala are strikingly different compared with those in the hippocampus. Previous findings on stress-induced plasticity were based primarily on postmortem analysis within individual areas. However, little is known about how stress affects dynamic changes and interactions in neuronal activity between the two areas. Hence, we simultaneously monitored in vivo activity of neuronal populations located in hippocampal areas CA1 and CA3 and the lateral amygdala (LA) in rats during and after chronic immobilization stress. The amplitude of auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in the hippocampus increased transiently only after a single 2 h stress but not when it was repeated for 10 d. In contrast, both acute and chronic stress caused a persistent increase in AEPs in the LA. Chronic stress also elicited a sustained increase in the LA but a decrease in the hippocampus in the evoked power of gamma and beta frequencies. Moreover, beta and gamma synchrony was reduced between areas CA1 and CA3 but enhanced between the LA and hippocampus after chronic stress. Granger causality spectra revealed a strong directional influence from the LA to area CA1 that persisted throughout and even 10 d after chronic stress. However, directional coupling from hippocampal area CA3 to CA1 became weaker at the end of chronic stress. Thus, our findings suggest that the growing dominance of amygdalar activity over the hippocampus during and even after chronic stress may contribute to the enhanced emotional symptoms, alongside impaired cognitive function, seen in stress-related psychiatric disorders.
