Synapsin-I is a vesicular phosphoprotein, which regulates neurotransmitter release, neurite development, and maturation of synaptic contacts during normal development and following various brain lesions in adulthood. In the present study, we have examined by immunohistochemistry possible modifications in the expression of synapsin-I in the hippocampus of Mongolian gerbils after transient forebrain ischemia. The animals were subjected to 5 min of transient forebrain ischemia through bilateral common carotid occlusion, and were examined at different time-points post-ischemia. Transient forebrain ischemia produces cell death of the majority of CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and polymorphic hilar neurons of the dentate gyrus. This is followed by reactive changes, including synaptic reorganization and modifications in the expression of synaptic proteins, which provide the molecular bases of synaptic plasticity. Transient decrease of synapsin-I immunoreactivity was observed in the inner zone of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, thus suggesting denervation and posterior reinervation in this area. In addition, a strong increase in synapsin-I immunoreactivity was observed in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and in the mossy fiber layer of the hippocampus at 2, 4 and 7 days after ischemia. Parallel increases in synaptophysin immunoreactivity were not observed, thus suggesting a selective induction of synapsin-I after ischemia. The present results indicate that synapsin-I participates in the reactive response of granule cells to transient forebrain ischemia in the hippocampus of the gerbil, and suggest a role for this protein in the plastic adaptations of the hippocampus following injury.
