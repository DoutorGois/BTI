PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of continuous magnetic field stimulation after four days of global encephalic ischemia on motor behavior and brain morphology in gerbils. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty Mongolian gerbils were divided into five groups: Control (CG), sham (SG), ischemia (IG), ischemia north (INPG) and south (ISPG) pole. Experimental animals underwent bilateral occlusion of the carotid artery. In groups with magnetic stimulation, a 3200 gauss magnet was fixed to the skull. After brain perfusion, coronal sections of the striatum, motor cortex (M1) and CA1 area of the hippocampus (CA1) were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. RESULTS: In the open field test (OF) we observed an increase in crossing in the IG compared to the CG, INPG and ISPG (F = 20.19), and a reduction in the time spent on the Rota-rod test (RR) with the IG compared to CG, IPNG and ISPG (F = 17.59). Morphometric analysis revealed a reduction in the density of the neurons in the CA1, in the number of M1 and striatal neurons in the IG compared to the CG, INPG and ISPG. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a potential therapeutic application of static magnetic fields for the preservation of motor behavior and neurons in regions analyzed after global cerebral ischemia.
