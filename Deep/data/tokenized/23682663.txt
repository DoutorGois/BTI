This study examines the relationship between episodic memory and hippocampal volume (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] volumetry) in preterm children with uncomplicated neonatal courses (<34 weeks of gestation, birth weight <2,000 g) and controls (7-11 years). To examine episodic memory performance and retrieval processes, neuropsychological tests and a recognition experiment were used. Although preterm children showed reduced hippocampal volumes relative to controls by 12%, episodic memory accuracy was not reduced. However, only in controls hippocampal volume correlated with some measures of episodic memory. Together, behavioral and MRI results indicate a minor functional specificity of the hippocampus regarding episodic memory functions in preterm children.
