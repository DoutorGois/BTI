This study uses Ki-67 and doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry to delineate potential neurogenic zones, migratory pathways, and terminal fields associated with adult neurogenesis in the brains of three microchiropterans. As with most mammals studied to date, the canonical subgranular and subventricular neurogenic zones were observed. Distinct labeling of newly born cells and immature neurons within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was observed in all species. A distinct rostral migratory stream (RMS) that appears to split around the medial aspect of the caudate nucleus was observed. These two rostral stream divisions appear to merge at the rostroventral corner of the caudate nucleus to turn and enter the olfactory bulb, where a large terminal field of immature neurons was observed. DCX immunolabeled neurons were observed mostly in the rostral neocortex, but a potential migratory stream to the neocortex was not identified. A broad swathe of newly born cells and immature neurons was found between the caudoventral division of the RMS and the piriform cortex. In addition, occasional immature neurons were observed in the amygdala and DCX-immunopositive axons were observed in the anterior commissure. While the majority of these features have been found in several mammal species, the large number of DCX immunolabeled cells found between the RMS and the piriform cortex and the presence of DCX immunostained axons in the anterior commissure are features only observed in microchiropterans and insectivores to date. In the diphyletic scenario of chiropteran evolution, these observations align the microchiropterans with the insectivores. Anat Rec, 299:1548-1560, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
