Extended sleep improves sustained attention and reduces sleep pressure in humans. Downregulation of adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R) and modulation of the neurotrophic factor insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-I) in brain structures controlling attentional capacities could be involved. In the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats, we measured adenosine A(1)R and IGF-I protein concentrations after photoperiod-induced sleep extension. Two groups of twelve rats were adapted over 14 days to a habitual (CON) 12:12 light-dark (LD) schedule and an extended (EXT) 16:8 LD schedule. IGF-I content was also measured in plasma, liver, and skeletal muscle. In EXT, compared to CON rats, A(1)R content in the frontal cortex was significantly lower (p < 0.05), while IGF-I content was higher (p < 0.001), and no significant change was observed in the hippocampus. IGF-I content in plasma and muscle was higher (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01), while it was lower in liver (p < 0.001). The absolute weight and weight gain were higher in EXT rats (p < 0.01). These data suggest that 14 days under a 16:8 LD photoperiod respectively down- and upregulated cortical A(1)R and IGF-I levels. This photoperiod induced an anabolic profile with increased weight gain and circulating and muscular IGF-I levels. An extension of sleep duration might favor cerebral and peripheral anabolism, which may help attentional and physical capacities.
