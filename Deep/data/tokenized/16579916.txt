We investigated the effects of a single course of antenatal betamethasone on neonatal somatic and brain development. On day 20 of gestation, pregnant rats were injected with either with 170 microg kg(-1) body weight of betamethasone ("clinically-equivalent dose," equivalent to 12 mg twice, 24 hours apart) or half this dose or vehicle. Pups (8-11 animals per experimental group per timepoint per gender) were analyzed at 1 (P1), 2, and 21 days after birth. We report that betamethasone induced a significant dose-dependent decrease of somatic measurements in both genders. At P1 cell proliferation was affected by the "clinically equivalent dose" only in the subventricular zone in both genders and in the hippocampus in males. In summary, we show for the first time that a lower dose (equivalent to 6 mg) induces fewer and less severe effects on somatic growth, whereas it does not affect cell proliferation within the brain.
