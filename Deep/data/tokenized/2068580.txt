Upon stimulating the lateral septal region, a population spike could be recorded in the stratum pyramidale of hippocampal CA1 together with a recordable EPSP in the apical dendrites (stratum radiatum). After destruction of hippocampal CA3, CA4 pyramidal cells by intraventricular microinjection of kainic acid, electrical stimulation of the lateral septum could no longer evoke EPSP in the apical dendrites. This experiment suggests that the neural connection of the lateral septo-CA1 apical dendrites is mediated by the collaterals of the ipsilateral CA3 pyramidal cells. But after the destruction of CA3, CA4, electric stimulation of lateral septum could still evoke EPSP in the basal dendrites (stratum oriends). The neural connection mediating the response of the lateral septo-CA1 basal dendrites was not reported before, but the neural pathway remains to be investigated.
