Use-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists protect neurons from the lethal consequences of excessive stimulation by excitatory amino acids. Clinical development of high-affinity compounds such as MK801 have been limited due to untoward side effects. Toward this end, the lower-affinity use-dependent NMDA antagonists have greater margins of safety and have advanced to clinical trials for stroke, epilepsy, head trauma and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. AR-R 15896AR is currently in Phase II trials for stroke and has been repeatedly demonstrated to afford neuroprotection in a variety of in vivo and in vitro models associated with ischemia/excitotoxic conditions.
