Hydrocortisone was administered to young adult male or female rats after removal of the entorhinal cortex. Lesion-induced outgrowth of the commissural-associational afferent fibers in the hippocampus was quantitated. The glucocorticoids caused a significant decline in axon sprouting in the male subjects and a significant increase in outgrowth in female subjects. Depending on the sex, the hormonal effects on lesion-induced axonal growth are markedly different in the rat.
