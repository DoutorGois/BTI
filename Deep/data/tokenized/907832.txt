By using the light- and electron microscope methods some morphogenetic properties of rat hippocampus were studied in tissue culture (field CA1--2). Analysis of 5-, 12-, and 21-day cultures showed maturation of hippocampal- pyramid cells, development of protein-synthesizing apparatus and synaptogenesis. The authors consider synchronous development of synaptic structures, protein-synthesizing apparatus and electrogenesis to be interdependent factors.
