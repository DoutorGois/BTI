It has been suggested that the right and left mesial temporal lobes are specialized for processing different types of information for long-term memory (LTM). Although findings have been consistent in regard to the dominant role of the left mesial temporal lobe (MTL) in verbal memory, the role of the right MTL in non-verbal memory remains debatable. Given the existence of two cortical pathways specialized for processing different types of visuospatial information, we examined whether memory processing for these two types of information might also be differentially localized. The effect of unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) was compared for memory for unfamiliar faces and a novel sequence of spatial locations in 86 ATL patients (left ATL (LATL) = 35; right ATL (RATL) = 51) pre- and post-surgery to examine the contributions of right and left MTL structures to LTM for pattern and spatial information. Memory for spatial location was not related to side of ATL or time of testing. On the facial memory task, RATL patients showed impairments relative to LATL patients prior to surgery, which became magnified after surgery. These results extend the proposed dissociation between an occipitotemporal and an occipitoparietal pathway for processing visuospatial information by demonstrating dissociations in LTM systems for these two types of information. Lesions in the right MTL, adjacent to the cortical structures believed to be specialized for facial recognition, specifically impair the memory encoding of new faces, but not spatial locations.
