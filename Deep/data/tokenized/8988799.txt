The structural neuroimaging findings in mood disorders were reviewed, to evaluate evidence for a neuroanatomic model of pathophysiology, involving the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, the amygdala-hippocampus complex, thalamus, and connections among these structures. Global atrophy is not consistently found. The best replicated finding is an increased rate of white matter and periventricular hyperintensities. A smaller frontal lobe, cerebellum, caudate, and putamen appear present in unipolar depression. A larger third ventricle, and smaller cerebellum and perhaps temporal lobe appear present in bipolar disorder. These localized structural changes involve regions that may be critical in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Generalized and localized anatomic alterations may be related to age or vascular disease. The clinical and biological correlates of these changes need to be investigated to allow development of a more complete model of pathophysiology of mood disorders.
