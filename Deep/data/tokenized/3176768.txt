Comparative electrophysiological data are presented on the role of thalamic, hypothalamic and hippocampal structures in organization and activity of different neocortical formations at various steps of evolution. It was shown that higher mammals have double afferent supply of associative zones of the new cortex from the thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, exhibiting significant increase in the degree of their convergence pattern.
