An endogenous hydroxylated form of LHRH, (Hyp) LHRH, is able to displace LHRH bound to pituitary membrane preparations. In parallel, it stimulates release of both LH and FSH from pituitary cells in primary culture. The potency ratio of (Hyp)LHRH is approximately 1:20 and 1:5 with respect to the native decapeptide when peptidasic degradation is or is not inhibited. This correlates with a greater resistance of (Hyp) LHRH towards enzymatic degradation; in contrast to LHRH, the C-terminal (residues 6 to 10) end of (Hyp) LHRH is not degraded and generates C-terminal fragments which account for 64% of the LHRH immunoreactivity in extrahypothalamic areas as the hippocampus. Besides its weak gonadotropin releasing activity and its action or its localization in peripheral organs (placenta, gonads), a major role of the hydroxylated decapeptide may thus be to serve as a precursor of smaller active fragments on targets other than pituitary receptors.
