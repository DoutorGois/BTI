There is growing evidence that the selective neuronal cell death observed in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the result of dysregulation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis. In the present study, L-type voltage sensitive calcium channels (L-VSCCs) were examined in the cerebellum and hippocampus of AD (n = 6; postmortem interval less than 5 h) and age-matched control (n = 6) tissue by homogenate binding techniques and quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography using [3H]isradipine (PN200-110). Saturation analyses of the cerebellum revealed unaltered [3H]isradipine binding parameters (Kd and Bmax) between AD and control subjects. Analysis of AD and control hippocampus demonstrated significant differences as [3H]isradipine binding increased (62%) in AD, whereas hippocampal cell density decreased (29%) in AD, relative to control subjects. Moreover, AD differentially affected L-VSCC in area CA1 and dentate gyrus. The dentate gyrus had greatly increased binding (77%) with little cell loss (16%) in AD brains, whereas area CA1 had increased binding (40%) with significant cell loss (42%) in AD brains, relative to controls. The results of the present study suggest that hippocampal area CA1 may experience greater cell loss in response to increased L-VSCCs in AD relative to other brain regions.
