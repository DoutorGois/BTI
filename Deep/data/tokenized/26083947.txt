The detrimental effects of T-cell-secreted interferon gamma (IFNgamma) on oxidative stress (OS) and demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) are well recognized. Recently, we demonstrated that IFNgamma-mediated damage to myelin also increases susceptibility to spreading depression (SD; the likely basis of migraine with aura). However, before onset of MS, induction of physiological levels of IFNgamma, like that produced by environmental enrichment (EE), protects against demyelination and OS. Accordingly, we focused on the potential for physiological levels of IFNgamma to protect against SD. EE, which occurs with a moderate and phasic increase in proinflammatory cytokines, reduces migraine frequency. Thus, we applied phasic or pulsed IFNgamma to brain slice cultures to emulate EE. This treatment reduced OS, increased myelin basic protein, a marker for myelin, and reduced susceptibility to SD. Building on our research on exosomes in EE-based neuroprotection, we found that IFNgamma stimulation of slice cultures induced release of exosomes, likely from the microglia that produce the same protective effects as IFNgamma treatment when applied to naive cultures. Finally, nasal administration of IFNgamma to rats recapitulated in vitro effects, reducing OS, increasing myelin, and reducing SD. These results support phasic IFNgamma signaling as a therapeutic target for prevention of SD and, by extension, migraine.
