Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neuro-degenerative disorder, and novel therapeutic targets are required for the treatment of PD. Juglanin is a natural compound extracted from the crude Polygonum aviculare, exhibiting anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities. In our study, PD in mice was induced by systemic LPS treatment as evidenced by enhanced alpha-synuclein and reduced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which were reversed by juglanin treatment. Moreover, juglanin administration attenuated LPS-caused behavioral and memory impairments and reduced LPS-induced enhancement of neuro-degenerative markers, including amyloid beta (Abeta) and p-Tau. Additionally, juglanin ameliorated synaptic functionality through promoting the expression of synaptic markers, such as SYP, PSD-95 and SNAP-25. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in brain regulates neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, LPS induced neuroinflammation through the acceleration of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-18 (IL-18) and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), via activating TLR4/nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway in hippocampus of mice and microglia cells. Juglanin significantly reduced LPS-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and blocked TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway. We also found that LPS-induced astrocytes (AST) activity was prevented by juglanin through down-regulating glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Iba1 in vivo and in vitro. Together, our results indicated that juglanin ameliorated neuroinflammation-related memory impairment, and neurodegeneration through impeding TLR4/NF-kappaB, indicating its potential for PD prevention.
