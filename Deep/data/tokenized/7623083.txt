1. We recorded extracellular and intracellular CA3-CA1 synaptic responses in hippocampal slices from neonatal rats [postnatal day (P) 15-21 and P29-35]. Presynaptic function was examined by measuring input-output relationships and paired-pulse facilitation and by quantal analysis of minimally evoked responses. 2. Extracellular recording revealed no difference in excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) threshold or the fiber potential response for a given stimulus intensity between the two age groups. However, the slope of the field EPSP was consistently larger in older animals. The increase in EPSP slope was associated with a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation, suggesting an increase in presynaptic function with postnatal development. 3. Extracellular results were confirmed by intracellular recordings that revealed no difference in the minimal stimulation intensity needed to evoke a response, an increase in mean EPSP amplitude with development, and a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation. Quantal parameters were extracted by three separate methods including method of failures, coefficient of variance, and parameter optimization through noise deconvolution. All methods supported presynaptic mediation of facilitation. Comparison of quantal parameters during development indicated an increase in mean quantal content. 4. The results demonstrate that synaptic strength is altered over the course of development because of, at least in part, changes in presynaptic release mechanisms. Developmental differences in presynaptic function provide an explanation of differences in mechanisms for expression of long-term potentiation. The lower initial probability of transmitter release in neonates may permit increased presynaptic change.
