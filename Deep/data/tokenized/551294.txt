The abuse of phencyclidine [1(1-phencylohexyl)piperidine, PCP], commonly referred to as angel dust or hog, is rapidly reaching epidemic proportions. PCP users often appear violent and increases in PCP-implicated homicides and suicides have been reported. In animal studies PCP has been demonstrated in brain up to 48 h after administration, long after blood levels become undetectable. However, there is little further information on the distribution of PCP within the central nervous system with regard to the possible sites of action. Recently, Sokoloff and associates described a new technique which can be used to visualise possible sites of drug action. The technique is based on the premise that neuronal activity is closely related to energy metabolism. Therefore, by directly monitoring 2-deoxy-D-glucose consumption before and after a pharmacological stimulus, we can obtain autoradiographic evidence of changes in neuronal activity in discrete areas brain as a response to that stimulus. Using this procedure, we now report that PCP causes dramatic changes in glucose metabolism in very specific regions of the rat brain.
