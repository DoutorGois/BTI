Somatostatin (SRIF) content of several brain structures was evaluated by radioimmunoassay in rats bearing various types of hypothalamic transections, as well as lesions of the amygdala. Analysis of the regional changes in SRIF concentrations after surgery suggest the following conclusions: (1) hypothalamic somatostatinergic neurons project to the limbic system, with the exception of the amygdaloid nuclei; (2) the olfactory tubercle, the lateral septal nucleus, the habenula and probably the hippocampus receive somatostatin projections from periventricular SRIF-containing cells; (3) somatostatin-containing fibers take a lateral course after leaving periventricular cells and join the medial forebrain bundle; (4) somatostatin innervation of the amygdala seems to be intrinsic.
