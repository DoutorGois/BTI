Actions of the new antiepileptic drug lamotrigine were characterised using whole cell patch clamp recordings from rat CA1 pyramidal cells in vitro. The results suggest that lamotrigine, besides its previously described effect on the fast sodium inward current and calcium currents, modulates the transient potassium outward current ID. This may be an effective mechanism to inhibit pathological excitation.
