It is now clear that IL-1 beta has profound and complex actions in the CNS. At pathophysiological concentrations it has an inhibitory effect on LTP in many regions of the hippocampus. There is also evidence emerging for a physiological role for IL-1 beta in the brain. Table 1 summarizes the effects of IL-1 beta and some other pro-inflammatory cytokines in the CNS.
