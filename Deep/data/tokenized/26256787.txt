We investigated the utility of sulcal width measures in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sixty-six biologically confirmed AD patients (positive amyloid positron emission tomography [PET] and/or AD cerebrospinal fluid profile) were contrasted to 35 controls with negative amyloid PET. Patients were classified into prodromal or dementia stages as well as into late onset (LOAD, n = 31) or early onset (EOAD, n = 35) subgroups according to their age of onset. An automated method was used to calculate sulcal widths and hippocampal volumes (HV). In EOAD, the greatest ability to differentiate patients from age-matched controls, regardless of severity, was displayed by sulcal width of the temporoparietal cortex. In this region, diagnosis accuracy was better than the HV, especially at prodromal stage. In LOAD, HV provided the best discrimination power from age-matched controls. In conclusion, sulcal width measures are better markers than the HV for identifying prodromal AD in patients aged <65 years. In contrast, in older patients, the risk of over-diagnosis from using only sulcal enlargement is important.
