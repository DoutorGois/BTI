The nerve growth factor (NGF) content in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of chronic ethanol-treated rats was measured and compared with that of control rats, using a two-site enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system. The different time periods of chronic ethanol treatment caused transient elevation of the NGF content in both the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The NGF content in the hippocampus was significantly elevated in rats undergoing ethanol treatment of 2 weeks and 1 month. Nerve growth factor content of the 1 month treatment was higher than that of the 2 week treatment. However, a 3 month administration of ethanol reduced the NGF content to the control level. The NGF content in the frontal cortex increased significantly in the 2 week administration, but decreased to the control level in the 1 month administration. The increase of NGF may be caused by the proliferation of glial cells or the enhancement of neuronal production of NGF.
