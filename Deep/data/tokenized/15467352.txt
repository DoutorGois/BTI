OBJECTIVE: The effects of low-level formaldehyde (FA) inhalation on the amount of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampus of immunized mice were studied. METHODS: Evaluation of NGF in the hippocampus was performed by ELISA and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Exposure to 80 and 400 ppb FA significantly increased the brain NGF levels in the immunized mice. Evaluation of the NGF levels in the hippocampus of immunized mice showed that 400 ppb FA significantly increased the NGF content. The RT-PCR evaluation also showed higher concentrations of hippocampal NGF mRNA in the mice exposed to 80 and 400 ppb FA with immunization. CONCLUSION: Exposure of immunized mice to low levels of FA significantly increases NGF levels in the hippocampus.
