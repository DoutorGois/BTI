Alpha-methyldopa caused inhibition of ejaculation. The cerebral mechanism which induced the inhibition was pursued by determining changes of brain monoamines in dogs. As a result, suppression of the dopaminergic system in the brain by alpha-methyldopa is found to be the origin of the inhibition of ejaculation. This inhibition was recovered by L-dopa with pretreatment with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor.
