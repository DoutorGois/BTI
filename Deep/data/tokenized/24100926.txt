Pentylenetetrazole-kindling induced memory deficit has been validated in our previous study. The present study attempts a neurochemical investigation to reveal possible targets for treatment of memory deficit associated with pentylenetetrazole-kindling. Kindling was induced by administering subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (35 mg/kg; i.p.) at an interval of 48 +/- 2 h. Successfully kindled animals were divided into two groups (interictal and postictal group), while non-kindled (naive) animals served as naive group. In postictal group, animals were challenged with pentylenetetrazole (35 mg/kg) on days 5, 10, 15 and 20. Learning and memory were evaluated in all experimental groups using elevated plus maze and passive shock avoidance paradigm on days 5, 10, 15 and 20. After behavioral evaluations on day 20, all animals were sacrificed to remove their brains. Neurochemical (glutamate, GABA, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin) changes and acetylcholinesterase activity and total nitrite level were estimated using HPLC-FD methods and microplate reader method respectively, in discrete brain parts. The results of the neurochemical estimation demonstrated the imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory tone, reduction in monoamine level, elevated nitrosative and acetylcholinesterase activity in the cortex and hippocampus, as responsible factors for the pathobiology of learning and memory deficit in epilepsy. Restoration of these changes may be targeted for the management of memory deficit in epileptic patients.
