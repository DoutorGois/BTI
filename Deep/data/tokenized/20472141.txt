Accumulating evidence indicates that the ovarian steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone regulate a wide variety of nonreproductive functions in the central nervous system by interacting with several molecular and cellular processes. A growing literature reporting results obtained in rodent models suggests that 17beta-estradiol, the most potent of the biologically relevant estrogens, facilitates some forms of learning and memory, and in particular, those involving hippocampus-dependent tasks. Hippocampal long-term potentiation and long-term depression of synaptic transmission are types of synaptic plasticity that have been extensively studied, as they are considered as cellular models of memory formation in the brain. In this chapter, we review the literature that analyzes and compares the effects of estrogen and progesterone on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in rodents. Understanding the nonreproductive functions of estrogen and progesterone in the hippocampus has far-reaching implications not only for our basic understanding of neuroendocrinology and neurobiology, but also for developing better treatment of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
