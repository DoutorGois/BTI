A model of postsynaptic processes leading to a prolonged posttetanic modification (potentiation and depression) in the efficacy of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the neuron CA3 of the hippocampus was developed. The model enables one to estimate changes in postsynaptic potentials depending on the extent of receptor phosphorylation, which is determined by Ca(2+)-dependent changes in secondary messengers.
