The brain derived peptidergic drug Cerebrolysin has been found to support the survival of neurons in vitro and in vivo. Positive effects on learning and memory have been demonstrated in various animal models and also in clinical trials. In the present study the effects of early postnatal administration of Cerebrolysin (Cere, 10 mg/ml peptides) or an enriched peptide fraction of Cere (E021, 80.6 mg/ml peptides) were investigated in young, young adult, and old adult rats. Rat pups received the drugs or saline for control on postnatal days 1-7. The animals were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM) either in the 5th week, in the 3rd or the 16th month of life for 6 consecutive days (test days 1-6), eight trials per day. In order to prevent the chance finding of the hidden platform, the rigid underwater platform was replaced by a collapsible island, resting at the bottom of the pool. The platform was raised when the animal stayed in the target area for 2 s. In the young and young adult rats both Cere and E021 treated rats showed shorter escape latencies than saline treated controls on all 6 test days. No significant differences in the swimming speed were evaluated for the young rats, although in 3-month-old drug-tested animals a moderate increase of the swimming speed was investigated. For 16-month-old animals no significant differences in either escape latencies or swimming speed was found. Summarizing, early postnatal application of Cere or E021 improved the spatial learning and memory of young rats and led to long-lasting behavioural effects at least up to 3 months after treatment.
