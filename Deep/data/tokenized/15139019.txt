In vitro culture of neural progenitor cells isolated from adult murine hippocampus according to the Percoll density gradient method resulted in formation of round spheres not immunoreactive to microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) or glial fibrillary acidic protein in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor within 12 days in vitro (DIV). Reverse-transcription PCR analysis revealed constitutive expression in these neurospheres of different subunits required for assembly of functional heteromeric N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed expression of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits in neurospheres cultured for 4-12 DIV. Brief (5 min) exposure to NMDA induced marked expression of c-Fos, Fos-B, Fra-2, and c-Jun proteins in neurospheres cultured for 12 DIV 2 hr later. The NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine markedly inhibited expression of both c-Jun and c-Fos proteins in NMDA-exposed neurospheres. Sustained exposure to NMDA not only markedly inhibited neurosphere formation by 12 DIV when exposed from 4-12 DIV, but also resulted in facilitation of subsequent differentiation of neurospheres exposed to all-trans retinoic acid to cells immunoreactive to both neuron-specific enolase and neuronal nuclei, in addition to MAP-2, as revealed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry analyses. These results suggest that functional heteromeric NMDA receptors may be expressed constitutively in neural progenitor cells before differentiation to play a crucial role in commitment and differentiation to neurons in adult murine hippocampus.
