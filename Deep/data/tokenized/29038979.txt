Perturbation of corticohippocampal circuits is a key step in the pathogenesis of transient global amnesia. We evaluated the spatial distribution of altered cerebral metabolism to determine the location of the corticohippocampal circuits perturbed during the acute stage of transient global amnesia. A consecutive series of 12 patients with transient global amnesia who underwent (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography within 3 days after symptom onset was identified. We used statistical parametric mapping with two contrasts to identify regions of decreased and increased brain metabolism in transient global amnesia patients compared with 25 age-matched controls. Transient global amnesia patients showed hypometabolic clusters in the left temporal and bilateral parieto-occipital regions that belong to the posterior medial network as well as, hypermetabolic clusters in the bilateral inferior frontal regions that belong to the anterior temporal network. The posterior medial and anterior temporal networks are the two main corticohippocampal circuits involved in memory-guided behavior. Decreased metabolism in the posterior medial network might explain the impairment of episodic memory observed during the acute stage of transient global amnesia. Concomitant increased metabolism within the anterior temporal network might occur as a compensatory mechanism.
