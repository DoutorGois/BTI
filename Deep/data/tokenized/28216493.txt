OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of high frequency electrotherapy (HFE) on rat hippocampus after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Methods: A rat model of cerebral I/R injury was established. The rats were randomly divided into a sham group, an I/R group and an HFE group. The HFE group received thearapy daily for different sessions for 1, 3, 7 d. Neuronal deficit score,neuron ultra microstructure in the hippocampus and caspase-3 protein expression were measured on 1 st, 3 th and 7th d. Results: Compared with the I/R group, the HFE group showed the decreased neurological deficit scores, with significant differences between the 2 groups (P<0.05). The injury in HFE group was reduced compared with that in the I/R group based on the electron microscope test, with significant difference. Caspase-3 protein in brain tissue in the HFE group also downregulated compared with that in the I/R group (P<0.05). Conclusion: High frequency electrotherapy can improve neural function, suppress caspase-3 expression and apoptosis in nerve cells and improve the ultra microstructure of neurons, displaying a protective effect on cerebral I/R injury in rats.
