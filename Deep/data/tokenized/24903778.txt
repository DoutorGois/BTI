Bone morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) has neuroprotective effects against various neuronal injuries, but its effect on amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity remains unclear. We exposed rat hippocampal neurons to different concentrations of Abeta25-35 to induce neurotoxicity, and then treated cells with BMP6 to assess the neuroprotective effects. In vivo, we bilaterally injected Abeta1-40 into basal forebrain to simulate the neuropathological process of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and explored changes in the expression of BMP6 and LIMK1. Our data demonstrated that BMP6 prevented apoptosis induced by a high dose of Abeta25-35, and inhibited rod formation induced by low dose of Abeta25-35 in hippocampal neurons. Forebrain injection of Abeta1-40 led to a significant downregulation of BMP6, and inactivation of LIMK1 pathway in basal forebrain, whereas the opposite changes were observed in hippocampus. Our results suggest that BMP6 has neuroprotective effects against Abeta25-35. The BMP6 and LIMK1 pathways may have different expression patterns at different stages of AD, and be self-regulating via a negative feedback mechanism between different brain regions.
