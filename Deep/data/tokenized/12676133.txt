The central fragment of cholecystokinin, CCK8, plays a critical role in stress-related changes in behavior and memory. Therefore, we investigated whether the endogenous cholecystokininergic system is involved in the impairment of attention and/or memory induced by stressful conditions. Plasma corticosterone concentrations increased three-fold and plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH); concentrations increased five-fold when rats were maintained in the open arm of an elevated plus maze for 5 min. The same stress conditions impaired spatial recognition in the two-trial memory task. In addition, this stress led to a significant decrease in the extracellular levels of cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity in the dorsal subiculum/CA1 of the hippocampus and partially suppressed the increase obtained during the acquisition phase of memory. This suggests that the cholecystokininergic system in the hippocampus is involved in stress-induced impairment of spatial recognition memory.
