Herein, we report a new series of aliphatic substituted pyridyl-urea small molecules synthesized as potential modulators for amyloid beta (Abeta) induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Their blocking activities against Abeta-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening were evaluated by JC-1 assay which measures the change of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). The inhibitory activity of sixteen compounds against Abeta-induced mPTP opening was superior or almost similar to that of the standard Cyclosporin A (CsA). Among them, 1-(3-(benzyloxy)pyridin-2-yl)-3-(2-(piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)urea (5x) effectively maintained mitochondrial function and cell viabilities on ATP assay, MTT assay, and ROS assay. Using CDocker algorithm, a molecular docking model presented a plausible binding mode for 5x with cyclophilin D (CypD) receptor as a major component of mPTP. Moreover, hERG and BBB-PAMPA assays presented safe cardiotoxicity and high CNS bioavailability profiles for 5x. Taken as a whole, this report presents compound 5x as a new nonpeptidyl mPTP blocker may hold a promise for further development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics.
