OBJECTIVE: To research the mechanism of protective action of TMCZKL on brain, METHOD: Contents of transmitter amino acids in cortex and hippocampus before and after administration of TMCZKL were measured in mice of repetitious cerebral ischemia reperfusion. RESULT: The three doses of TMCZKL raised the content of glutamic acid in cortex and hippocampus the content of aspartic acid in hippocampus and decreased GABA content in cortex significantly. CONCLUSION: TMCZKL might antagonize ischemic injury through regulating contents of transmitter amino acids and sustain the dynamic equilibrium of EAA and IAA.
