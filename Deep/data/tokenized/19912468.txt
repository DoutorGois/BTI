Chronic use of marijuana impairs synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. However, the molecular mechanisms by which marijuana alters long-term synaptic plasticity are largely unknown. Here, we show that repeated in vivo exposures to Delta9-THC for 7 consecutive days significantly impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission. The Delta9-THC exposure-induced decrease in LTP was prevented by pharmacological inhibition or deletion of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R). To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying Delta9-THC-altered LTP, we targeted expression and function of the glutamate receptors (GluR) and phosphorylation status of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Chronic in vivo exposure to Delta9-THC produced CB1R-dependent decreases in expression of hippocampal GluR1, NR2A, and NR2B, the ratio of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)/NMDA receptor-gated currents, and phosphorylation of CREB. Our results suggest that reduced expression and function of the GluR subunits and phosphorylation of CREB may underlie the impaired long-term synaptic plasticity induced by repeated in vivo exposure to Delta9-THC.
