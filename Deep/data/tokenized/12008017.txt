14-3-3 protein is a brain-specific protein discovered by Moore and Perez, but at present is thought to be a multifunctional protein. To clarify the brain-specific function of the protein, we intend constructing a 14-3-3 eta gene knock-out mouse. As the first step of this process, we isolated the mouse 14-3-3 eta chain gene and determined its structure. The mouse gene is about 10 kb long and composed of two exons separated by a long intron. The transcription start site was identified and the polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) were found in exon 2 of the mouse gene. In the 5'-upstream sequence, we found several cis elements including a CRE sequence, a TATA box-like sequence, and a C/EBP element. Furthermore, the distribution of 14-3-3 eta mRNA in the mouse brain was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The highest signals were found in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb neurons of the adult mouse. Neuronal expression of 14-3-3 eta in these regions mRNA may generally increase during postnatal brain development. The distribution of protein kinase C gamma in the mouse brain was also examined by immunohistochemistry. From the distribution of 14-3-3 eta mRNA and protein kinase C gamma in the mouse brain, the involvement of these compounds in the induction and maintenance of LTP was discussed.
