In attempt to discern effects of sex hormones on the development of neurotransmitter systems in the rat brain, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) have been measured at postnatal days 8, 12, 25, and 60 in five regions (amygdala, anterior hypothalamus, hippocampus, olfactory bulbs, and cerebral cortex) of the brains of normal male, normal female, and neonatally androgen-treated female rats. Essentially no association between sex or of neonatal "androgenization" on either enzymol were found. The data, however, provide new information on the relative rates of development of ChAT and GAD in five regions of the rat brain which supplement the limited information already available in the literature. ChAT activity was highest in amygdala and hypothalamus, but developed most rapidly in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. The relative activities and patterns of development of GAD activity were similar to those of ChAT.
