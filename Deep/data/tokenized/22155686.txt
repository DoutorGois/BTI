In this work we investigated how the neurosteroid allopregnanolone can modulate learning and memory processes. For this purpose, we used ovariectomized (OVX) rats subcutaneously injected with oestradiol benzoate (E) alone or E and progesterone (P). Then, rats were injected in dorsal hippocampus with allopregnanolone or vehicle. Animals were tested in inhibitory avoidance task (IA task). After behavioural test hippocampal mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of 3alpha-HOR, the enzyme responsible of allopregnanolone synthesis, were analysed. In IA task OVX-EP rats spent less time on platform, compared to those OVX or OVX-E. Regression analyses revealed that there was a significant negative relationship between E-P infusion and performance in this task. Pre-training allopregnanolone administration to OVX-EP rats increased the time spent on the platform. Interestingly, when enzymatic activity of 3alpha-HOR was tested, OVX-EP rats showed a significant decrease in the enzymatic activity, compared with OVX and OVX-E rats. In addition, OVX-EP group showed a significant increase in the enzymatic activity after intrahippocampal infusion of allopregnanolone. On the other hand, when mRNA expression of 3alpha-HOR was analysed no differences were observed when the hippocampal allopregnanolone injection was done. These results suggest that E and P have amnesic effects on female rats, being reversed by allopregnanolone through its modulation on hippocampal 3alpha-HOR activity.
