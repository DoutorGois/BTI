Electron microscopy immunocytochemical study was performed to clarify ultrastructural localization and role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (EC-NOS) in the endothelial cells (EC) of rat hippocampal vessels after transient cerebral ischemia. EC-NOS immunoreactivity was found in the endothelial cells in association with plasma membrane, sub-plasmalemmal vesicles, basal membrane and in cytosol (cytoplasm free of subcellular organelles). A sharp transient increase in immunoreactivity of NOS was observed at 10 min up to 1 hour after ischemia. The results of the present study indicate that NO, as a potent vasodilator, may play a protective role in ischemic brain damage.
