Apoptosis is a physiological process that can also participate in host immune defense mechanisms, including tumor growth suppression along with homeostasis and maturation of immune cells. Caspases are known to be involved in cellular apoptotic signaling; among them, caspase-8 plays an important role in the initiation phase of the apoptotic death cascade. In the current study, we molecularly characterized a caspase-8 homolog (designated as HaCasp-8) from Hippocampus abdominalis. The HaCasp-8 gene harbors a 1476 bp open reading frame (ORF) that codes for a protein of 492 amino acids (aa) with a predicted molecular mass of 55 kDa. HaCasp-8 houses the typical domain architecture of known initiator caspases, including the death effector domain and the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain. As expected, phylogenetic analysis reflected a closer evolutionary relationship of HaCasp-8 with its teleostean similitudes. The results of our qPCR assays confirmed the ubiquitous expression of HaCasp-8 in physiologically important tissues examined, with pronounced expression levels in ovary tissues, followed by blood cells. HaCasp-8 expression at the mRNA level was found to be significantly modulated by lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, Streptococcus iniae, and Edwardsiella tarda injection. Overexpression of HaCasp-8 could trigger a significant level of cell death in HEK293T cells, suggesting its putative role in cell death. Taken together, our findings suggest that HaCasp-8 is an important component in the caspase cascade, and its expression can be significantly modulated under pathogen stress conditions in the big-belly seahorse.
