Repeated administration of methamphetamine (METH; 2 and 4 mg/kg, s.c. four times every 2 h) caused hyperthermia and a dose-dependent depletion of striatal dopamine levels 3 days after the METH-treatment in both BALB/cAnNCrj (BALB) and DBA/2NCrj (DBA) mice, but these responses were lower in C57BL/6NCrj (C57BL) mice. An acute decrease of striatal dopamine levels 30 min after the last injection of METH (4 mg/kg) was observed in both BALB and DBA mice, while an increase in dopamine was observed in C57BL mice. Striatal 3-methoxytyramine levels were drastically increased in both DBA and C57BL mice after this same treatment. Moreover, pretreatment with the superoxide dismutase inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamate (200 mg/kg, i.p.) exacerbated the METH (4 mg/kg)-induced striatal dopamine-depletion in BALB mice. In addition, pretreatment with an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, benzamide (160 mg/kg, s.c.), significantly attenuated the METH (4 mg/kg)-induced striatal dopamine depletion in both BALB and DBA mice. These results suggest that both BALB and DBA mice possess a higher sensitivity to the METH-induced striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity compared to C57BL mice. In addition, the striatal dopaminergic neurons of BALB mice may be more vulnerable to METH-induced oxidative stress as compared to that in C57BL mice.
