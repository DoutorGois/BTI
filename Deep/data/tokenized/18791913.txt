The purpose of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effect of Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41) combined with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) on daily activity, immunological and neurological alternation in a mouse model of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). CFS was induced by 6 times of repeated injection of Brucella abortus antigen every 2 weeks. Both single TJ-41 and TJ-41 combined with IFN gamma increased running activity and thymus weight of CFS mice, while thicker thymic cortex together with elevation of natural killer cell activity was only found in the combined treatment group. No significant improvement was observed in the atrophic brain and decreased expression level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and Bcl-2 mRNA in hippocampus in both treatment groups. Our results suggest that TJ-41 combined with IFN gamma might have a protective effect on the marked reduction in the activity in a model of CFS via normalization of host immune responses, but not neuroprotection.
