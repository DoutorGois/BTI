Brain plasticity is very sensitive to the environment. Certain neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitter receptors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic adenosine monophosphate response elementbinding protein (CREB), stromal cellderived factor1 (SDF1) and its specific receptor, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), are important in neurogenesis in adult animals. In the present study, the effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ), and the protein expression levels of BDNF, CREB, SDF1 and CXCR4 were investigated. Adult rats were randomly assigned as controls or underwent EE for 30 days. Subsequently, immunofluorescence staining was used to analyze cell proliferation in the DG and SVZ, and the differentiation and survival of newlyformed cells in the hippocampus. The protein expression levels of BDNF, phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), protein kinase A catalytic subunit alpha, SDF1 and CXCR4 in the hippocampus were assayed by western blotting. Cognitive function was assessed in a Morris water maze. EE improved cognitive function, and increased the proliferation, differentiation and survival of newlyformed neurons in the DG of adult rats; however, EE did not activate neurogenesis in the SVZ. Furthermore, EE enhanced the protein expression levels of BDNF, pCREB, SDF-1 and CXCR4 in the hippocampus. These results provide a theoretical basis to explain the beneficial effects of EE on healthy, adult rats.
