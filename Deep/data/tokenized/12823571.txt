PURPOSE: To determine whether a pharmacologic treatment could delay or prevent the epileptogenesis induced by status epilepticus (SE) through the protection of some brain areas, we studied the effects of the long-term exposure to pregabalin (PGB) on neuronal damage and epileptogenesis induced by lithium-pilocarpine SE. METHODS: SE was induced in adult and 21-day-old (P21) rats. At 20 min after pilocarpine, rats received 50 mg/kg PGB (pilo-preg) or saline (pilo-saline). PGB treatment was given daily at the dose of 50 mg/kg for 7 days after SE and at 10 mg/kg from day 8 until killing. Neuronal damage was assessed in hippocampus and piriform and entorhinal cortices in brain sections stained with thionine and obtained from adult and P21 animals killed 6 days after SE. The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-reactive astrocytes was tested by immunohistochemistry in sections adjacent to those used for cell counting. The latency to spontaneous seizures was controlled by visual observation and EEG recording. RESULTS: PGB induced neuroprotection in layer II of piriform cortex and layers III-IV of ventral entorhinal cortex of adult rats, whereas no hippocampal region was protected. In P21 rats, damage was limited to the hilus and similar in pilo-preg and pilo-saline animals. The number of GFAP-positive astrocytes was higher in pilocarpine- than in saline-treated rats. It was decreased in pilo-preg compared with pilo-saline rats in layer II of the piriform cortex. Adult pilo-preg rats became epileptic after a longer latency (39 days) than did pilo-saline rats (22 days). CONCLUSIONS: These data underline the antiepileptogenic consequences of long-term PGB treatment, possibly mediated by the protection of piriform and entorhinal cortices in the lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy.
