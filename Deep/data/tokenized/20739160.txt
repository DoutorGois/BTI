UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is expected to affect more than 22 million people worldwide by 2025, causing devastating suffering and enormous costs to families and society. AD is a multifactorial disease, with a complex pathological mosaic. In rodents, AD-like dementia can be induced by cerebral microinjection of Abeta peptide, leading to amyloid deposits, amnesia and various features of neurodegeneration. Marapuama (Ptychopetalum olacoides) is regarded as a "brain tonic" in the Amazon region and shows a nootropic profile in rodents. AIM OF THE STUDY: Because a specific extract (POEE) of Marapuama was shown to possess promnesic and anti-amnesic properties, the aim of this study was to verify if POEE is also effective against Abeta(1-42)-induced cognitive deficit in mice. Additionally, Abeta deposits (Congo red), GFAP immunoreactivity (immunohistochemistry), and neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampal pyramidal layer (Nissl) were examined as measures of Abeta(1-42)-induced neurodegeneration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CF1 mice were subjected to the experimental Alzheimer model with the Abeta(1-42) i.c.v. administration. The effects of POEE 800 mg/kg were evaluated over 14 consecutive days of treatment. RESULTS: The data show that 14 days of oral treatment with POEE (800 mg/kg) was effective in preventing Abeta-induced cognitive impairment, without altering the levels of BDNF and with parallel reductions in Abeta deposits and astrogliosis. CA1 hippocampus loss induced by Abeta(1-42) was also diminished in POEE-treated mice. CONCLUSION: This study offers evidence of functional and neuroprotective effects of two weeks treatment with a Ptychopetalum olacoides extract against Abeta peptide-induced neurotoxicity in mice. Given the multifactorial nature of neurodegeneration, the considerable potential for an AChE inhibitor displaying associated neuroprotective properties such as here reported warrants further clinic evaluation.
