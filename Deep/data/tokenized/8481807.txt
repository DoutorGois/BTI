When methylazoxymethanol acetate is administered to pregnant rats at gestational day 19, the offspring are greatly impaired in the learning of a two-way active avoidance task and these behavioral changes are paralleled by a change in the phosphorylation of the protein B-50/GAP-43 in hippocampus but not in cortex. The expression of the protein is not altered, indicating that the phosphorylation of B-50 is a sensitive marker of alterations in synaptic plasticity associated with impairments of learning abilities in rats.
