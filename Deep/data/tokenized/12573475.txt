When processing frame-grabbed images from light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM), even a state-of-the-art digital camera is the weakest link between the microscope and the image processor. Details, which can be seen directly in the ocular at LM and in a negative recorded at EM, will not necessarily be represented in the frame-grabbed images. Because of this, there is a tendency to prefer a higher magnification at the expense of overview, i.e. only smaller areas are described. We find that the inadequacy of the camera can be overcome by taking multiple images of the same object, and align, expand, and add them into a more highly resolved image. At the LM level, the method has proved useful for describing the relation of the zinc pattern versus local in vivo oxygen measurements. At the EM level, we show that it is possible to achieve information about the spatial conditions in a given area, and the method may have applications on, e.g., visualization of ultra-small antibody-bound gold particles. The method can be performed on color and black and white images at any magnification and it has been tested in Adobe Photoshop (4.0 and higher) in WINDOWS 95, 98, and 2000.
