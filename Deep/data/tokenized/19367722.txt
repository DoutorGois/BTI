Cognitive enhancement by the GABA (B) antagonist SGS742 has been reported and we decided to search for proteins involved. Hippocampi from OF1 mice were from SGS742- treated animals and three control groups. Proteins were extracted and run on 2DE, and spots were quantified. Significantly different protein spots were identified by two mass spectrometry principles, nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS and by nano-LC-ESI(CID/ETD)-MS/MS. Signaling, chaperone and metabolic enzyme proteins were linked to memory enhancement.
