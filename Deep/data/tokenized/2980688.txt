With respect to the nature of information processing within the hippocampus, it can be concluded that the hippocampus codes spatial attributes, may or may not code sensory-perceptual attributes, appears to code temporal attributes based on spatial and sensory-perceptual cues, but does not code response attributes. The data provide some support for each theoretical view of hippocampal function, but appear to be most consistent with Kesner's views. With respect to how information is coded within the hippocampus, it can be concluded that there is good support for hippocampal involvement in a working or data-based memory system, but not a reference or expectancy-based memory system. These data support the Olton and Kesner views of hippocampal function. With respect to dynamic processes associated with maintaining information within the hippocampus, it appears that spatio-temporal information is processed in the hippocampus across the whole time domain including both short term and intermediate term memory. Even though some information appears to be processed only in an intermediate term memory (Rawlins, 1985), it seems that at least for spatio-temporal information the apparent residual short term memory capacity is a function of remaining hippocampal tissue.
