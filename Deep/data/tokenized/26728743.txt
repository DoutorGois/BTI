The maximum amounts of the thyroliberin in the blood and brain of rats at intranasal and intravenous administration were determined. It is found that rat hippocampal, cortical, and cerebellar membranes contain two types of specific binding sites (high- and low-affinity) for the labeled ligand. It was shown that, at intranasal and intravenous administration, maximum amounts of the thyroliberin were detected in the cerebellum and then in the cortex and hippocampus. The degradation of the thyroliberin in the rat brain and its regions at intranasal and intravenous administration was studied. It is shown that the degree of degradation and the formation of proteolytic products of the thyroliberin is different in different regions of the rat brain.
