Recently, it has been claimed that vesicles recycling spontaneously and during activity belong to different pools. Here we simultaneously measured, using spectrally separable styryl dyes, the release kinetics of vesicles recycled spontaneously or upon stimulation and the effects of the v-ATPase blocker folimycin on the frequency of miniature postsynaptic currents in rat hippocampal neurons. Our results provide evidence as to the identities of the vesicle pools recycling at rest and during stimulation.
