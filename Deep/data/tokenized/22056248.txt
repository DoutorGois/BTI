The effects of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) on energy metabolism in male and female rats were investigated, testing the hypothesis that HI-induced brain mitochondrial dysfunction could present in a dimorphic pattern. Impairment in electron transport chain complex activities at 2 and 18 h after HI was observed in cortex and hippocampus in rats of both sexes, with females presenting an overall activity higher than that of males. Females also showed loss of mitochondrial mass and membrane potential 18 h after HI, while males were only slightly affected. These findings suggest a dimorphism in mitochondrial dysfunction and provide information that may lead to new neuroprotection strategies.
