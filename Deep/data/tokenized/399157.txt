The ultrastructure of interneurons was studied in the cat and it was found to differ from that of the pyramidal and granule cells. The size, shape and topographic situation of the cell body of interneurons were the criteria for approaching their identification with the cells found in Golgi material. Some interneuron dendrites are also described. The varicose and spindle-shaped dendritic profiles belonging to interneurons are different in size. In Golgi material the interneurons have beaded (varicose) or spindle-shaped dendrites. The arrangement of synaptic terminals on the interneuron dendritic surface seems to be their characteristic feature.
