Autoradiography of high affinity uptake of L-glutamate in rat hippocampus after kainic acid lesion of CA3 and CA4 pyramidal cells has been used to identify the neurotransmitter of their ipsilateral connections. Glutamate or aspartate has tentatively been identified as the neurotransmitter of the projection from CA3 pyramidal cells to strata radiatum and oriens of CA1 and the projection from CA4 pyramidal cells to the inner parts of the molecular layer of area dentata.
