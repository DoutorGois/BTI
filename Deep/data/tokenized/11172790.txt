The 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative GYKI 52466 has been well characterized as a negative modulator of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The present study re-examined the effects of GYKI 52466 on AMPA receptor-mediated currents in patches excised from pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 field and found that this drug has positive modulatory effects in addition to its receptor blocking action. A low concentration of GYKI 52466 (10 microM) reliably increased the steady-state current by about three-fold, while the peak current was reduced by 30% only. Higher drug concentrations produced parallel reductions in both the steady-state and peak currents. The increase in the steady-state current was not accompanied by a change in the deactivation time constant and thus, is more likely to result from a change in desensitization than a slowing of channel closing. The results indicate that GYKI 52466 modulates AMPA receptor-mediated currents in a complex manner, perhaps by acting through more than one binding site.
