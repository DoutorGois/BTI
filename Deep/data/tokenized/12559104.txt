The important effects of estrogen on the morphology of hippocampal neurons are well established. The mechanisms leading to such changes, nevertheless, have proved confusingly complex, since interactions between glia and neurons, as well as neuronal influences from other brain fields, are involved. This study addresses the possibility that estrogen-sensitive projections from the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca induce astroglial reactions. Estrogen- and cholesterol-filled (controls) cannulae were implanted into the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca of adult ovariectomized rats. Comparative semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis on the density of the glial fibrillary acidic protein-containing processes and cells were performed on hippocampal slices of locally estrogen-treated and control animals. Rats that received estrogen-filled cannulae showed a lower density of glial processes in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields than animals of the control group. These effects could not be observed in the dentate gyrus. Cell counts revealed no significant difference in the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells in any of the examined areas. Two major conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the data show that estrogen, in fact, has an indirect influence on hippocampal cells through septo-hippocampal projections. Furthermore, estradiol can have an indirect negative effect on hippocampal astrocytes, causing a reduction in the density of their processes.
