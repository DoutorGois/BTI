The varepsilon4 allele of the human apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) is a well-proven genetic risk factor for the late onset form of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the biological mechanisms through which the varepsilon4 allele contributes to disease pathophysiology are incompletely understood. The three common alleles of APOE, varepsilon2, varepsilon3 and varepsilon4, are defined by two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reside in the coding region of exon 4, which overlaps with a well-defined CpG island (CGI). Both SNPs change not only the protein codon but also the quantity of CpG dinucleotides, primary sites for DNA methylation. Thus, we hypothesize that the presence of an varepsilon4 allele changes the DNA methylation landscape of the APOE CGI and that such epigenetic alteration contributes to AD susceptibility. To explore the relationship between APOE genotype, AD risk, and DNA methylation of the APOE CGI, we applied bisulfite pyrosequencing and evaluated methylation profiles of postmortem brain from 15 AD and 10 control subjects. We observed a tissue-specific decrease in DNA methylation with AD and identified two AD-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs), which were also associated with APOE genotype. We further demonstrated that one DMR was completely un-methylated in a sub-population of genomes, possibly due to a subset of brain cells carrying deviated APOE methylation profiles. These data suggest that the APOE CGI is differentially methylated in AD brain in a tissue- and APOE-genotype-specific manner. Such epigenetic alteration might contribute to neural cell dysfunction in AD brain.
