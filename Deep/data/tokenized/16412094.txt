Administration of drugs of abuse can produce long-lasting effects on brain function, which involve modifications at neurotransmitter level as well as changes in proteins important for structural alterations of selected brain regions. The contribution of trophic factors in these events has so far been underestimated. Here, we demonstrate that a single cocaine injection selectively up-regulated fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) mRNA levels in the striatum and prefrontal cortex within 2 h, an effect that vanished by 24 h. However, prolonged exposure (5 or 14 days) to cocaine treatment produced an enduring elevation of FGF-2 mRNA levels that was evident 72 h after the last injection in the prefrontal cortex and could even persist for 14 days in the striatum, raising the possibility that cocaine treatment primes the brain, resulting in longer-lasting FGF-2 up-regulation in regions that are highly innervated by dopaminergic projections. The expression of FGF-2 was also significantly increased in the midbrain following acute or 5-day injection, suggesting that modulation of FGF-2 biosynthesis in dopamine-producing cells occurs only during early stages of cocaine exposure. Our results point to important mechanistic conclusions as to how cocaine alters FGF-2 expression. Whereas cocaine-induced changes in FGF-2 gene expression following a single injection could be ascribed to increased release of transmitters (mainly dopamine), enhanced FGF-2 gene expression following repeated administration identifies the trophic factor as part of the adaptive changes set in motion by cocaine.
