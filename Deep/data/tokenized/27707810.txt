GSG1L is an AMPA receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary subunit that regulates AMPAR trafficking and function in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, its physiological roles in other types of neurons remain to be characterized. Here, we investigated the role of GSG1L in hippocampal dentate granule cells and found that GSG1L is important for the regulation of synaptic strength but is not critical for the modulation of AMPAR deactivation and desensitization kinetics. These data demonstrate a neuronal type-specific role of GSG1L and suggest that physiological function of AMPAR auxiliary subunits may vary in different types of neurons. NEW & NOTEWORTHY: GSG1L is a newly identified AMPA receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary subunit and plays a unique role in the regulation of AMPAR trafficking and function in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, its role in the regulation of AMPARs in hippocampal dentate granule cells remains to be characterized. The current work reveals that GSG1L regulates strength of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission but not the receptor kinetic properties in hippocampal dentate granule neurons.
