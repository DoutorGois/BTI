A cDNA clone (hHLP2) encoding a novel calcium-binding protein structurally related to hippocalcin has been isolated from the human hippocampus cDNA library. The primary structure consists of 193 amino acids, and contains three EF-hand structures and a possible NH2-terminal myristoylation site. A single transcript at a position corresponding to 1.7 kilobases was detected only in the brain. The hHLP2 gene was mapped to human chromosome 2.
