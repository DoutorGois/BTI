This report describes a previously healthy 28 year old patient with a 5 month period of intractable generalised status epilepticus (SE) of unknown aetiology with fatal outcome. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no pre-existing abnormality, but did show progressive cortical and hippocampal atrophy and T2 hyperintensity in both hippocampal formations, suggestive of progressive tissue damage. Post-mortem histopathological analysis revealed substantial neuronal cell loss including CA1 and CA4 sectors of the hippocampus compatible with bilateral hippocampal sclerosis. There was no evidence of systemic complications including arterial hypotension and hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, hyperpyrexia, or other confounding factors to account for these findings. This case provides further evidence of SE induced hippocampal damage in humans.
