NMDA receptor is involved in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory and neurological diseases like epilepsia and it is the major mediator of excitotoxicity. NR2B-containing NMDA receptors may be playing a crucial role in epileptic disorders. In the present study the effect of the convulsant drug 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MP) repetitive administration (4-7 days) on the hippocampal NR2B subunit was studied. A significant decrease in NR2B in the whole hippocampus was observed after MP4 with a tendency to recover to normal values in MP7 by western blot assay. Immunohistochemical studies showed a decrease in several CA1 and CA2/3 strata (21-73%). MP7 showed a reversion of the drop observed at 4 days in stratum oriens, pyramidal cell layer in CA1, CA2/3 and CA1 stratum radiatum. A significant fall in the lacunosum molecular layer of both areas and stratum radiatum of CA2/3 was observed. The immunostaining in MP4 showed a decrease in the granulare layer from dentate gyrus (20%), in hillus (71%) and subicullum (63%) as compared with control and these decreases were similar at MP7 values. Results showed decreases in NR2B subunit expression in different areas following repeated MP-induce seizures, suggesting that NR2B expression is altered depending on the diverse hippocampal input and output signals of each region that could be differently involved in modulating MP-induced hyperactivity.
