We investigated possible involvement of voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs) and several intracellular signaling mechanisms in multiple actions of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), such as survival promotion, induction of calbindin D(28k) expression as well as acceleration of neuritic branch formation of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Immunocytochemical staining with anti-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antibody showed that the promotion of neuron survival by bFGF in high cell-density cultures were exerted exclusively on GABA-negative neurons. Nicardipine (5 microM) attenuated the effect of bFGF on neuronal survival and formation of neurite branches, suggesting that the activity of L-type VDCCs is required for these effects. In contrast, stimulation of calbindin expression by bFGF was not attenuated by nicardipine. A phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 (1 microM) prevented the effect of bFGF on neurite branch formation, but not on neuronal survival or calbindin expression. On the other hand, chronic application of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (1 microM) inhibited the effect of bFGF on neuronal survival, without inhibiting the other bFGF actions. Forskolin (100 microM) attenuated the effect of bFGF on neuronal survival and neurite branch formation, indicating that cyclic AMP plays negative regulatory roles in these actions of bFGF. Taken together, these results suggest that multiple biological actions of bFGF on hippocampal neurons are exerted through, and modulated by, distinct signaling pathways.
