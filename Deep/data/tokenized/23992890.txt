PURPOSE: In this study, we present the results obtained from a series of patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (r-TLE) who underwent hippocampal deep brain stimulation (Hip-DBS). METHODS: Nine consecutive adult patients were studied. Low-frequency and high-frequency stimulation was carried out immediately after the insertion of each electrode. Chronic continuous high-frequency stimulation was used during treatment. The mean follow-up time was 30.1 months. The mean age of the patients was 37.2 years. The MRI scan was normal in three patients; four patients had bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), and two had unilateral MTS. RESULTS: The patients with unilateral MTS received unilateral implantation and experienced a 76% and an 80% reduction in seizure frequency after Hip-DBS. All patients with normal MRI scans were implanted bilaterally. Two of these patients received unilateral activation of the electrodes and experienced a 97% and an 80% reduction in seizure frequency; the third patient had bilateral activation of the device and was a non-responder. All patients with bilateral MTS were implanted bilaterally. Three of these patients received unilateral activation of the device and experienced a 66%, a 66% and a 100% reduction in seizure frequency after Hip-DBS; one patient had bilateral electrode activation, and was a non-responder. Whenever present, generalised tonic-clonic seizures disappeared completely after Hip-DBS. CONCLUSIONS: Although performed on a relatively small number of patients, Hip-DBS was safe and effective in our patients with r-TLE. Seven of the nine patients were considered responders. Hip-DBS might represent a useful therapeutic option in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy who were not candidates for resective surgery or have had previous failed procedures.
