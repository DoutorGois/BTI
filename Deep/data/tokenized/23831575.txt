Intracellular Mg(2)(+) concentration ([Mg(2)(+)]i) and NO regulate cell survival and death. To reveal the involvement of NO in intracellular Mg(2)(+) regulation, we visualized intracellular Mg(2)(+) using the fluorescent Mg(2)(+) indicator KMG-104-AM in rat hippocampal neurons. Pharmacological experiments using SNAP, 8-Br-cGMP, diazoxide and several inhibitors revealed that the NO/cGMP/Protein kinsase G (PKG) signaling pathway triggers an increase in [Mg(2)(+)]i, and that Mg(2)(+) mobilization is due to Mg(2)(+) release from mitochondria induced by mitoKATP channel opening. In addition, Mg(2)(+) release is potentiated by the positive feedback loop including mitoKATP channel opening, mitochondrial depolarization and PKC activation.
