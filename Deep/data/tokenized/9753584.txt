Major goals of research into the neurobiology of learning and memory are to identify (1) brain areas/circuitries that subserve different mnemonic functions and (2) chemistries that encode the memory trace. The discovery that activity modulates neuronal gene expression provided techniques attendant to the first goal and candidates for cellular changes pertinent to the second. Studies in our laboratories have exploited activity-regulated changes in c-fos gene expression to map regions engaged in two-odor discrimination learning, with particular interest in neuronal groups in hippocampus and amygdala. The results of these studies demonstrate that the subdivisions of hippocampus and amygdala do not act in concert across behaviors but are differentially activated depending on task demands. In hippocampus, preferential activation of field CA3 was uniquely associated with initial learning of an odor pair, whereas predominant activation of CA1 occurred with exploration of a novel field and with overtrained responding to odors. The reappearance of precisely the same balance of subfield activation within disparate behavioral contexts was taken to suggest that the hippocampus has basic modes of function that recur in different circumstances and make rather generalized contributions to behavior. Within the amygdala, the basolateral division was most prominently active during task acquisition but not during performance of the well-learned discrimination. Indeed, the amygdala appeared to play the dominant role relative to hippocampus in the early stages of associating positive and negative valences with discriminative cues. These results demonstrate that the balance of neuronal activity both within and between limbic structures changes across sequential stages of odor learning in a fashion that is likely to define behavioral output.
