Few studies have addressed the role of biochemicals of maternal origin on fetal neurodevelopment and behavioural outcome. Thyroid deficiency in the thyroidectomized pregnant rat provides an excellent model to study fetal effects of maternal chemistry, as this condition is known to be associated with deficits in motor and cognitive behaviour in human offspring. Based on evidence that thyroid hormone of maternal origin may be an important determinant in regulating these behaviours, we assessed neurobehaviours and regional brain biogenic amine levels in offspring of rats thyroidectomized (Tx) prior to conception. Cross-fostering techniques were used to isolate fetal effects of maternal thyroid deficiency from possible neonatal effects during nursing by thyroid-deficient dams. The progeny of Tx dams showed significant deficits in maze learning, were less cautious in emotionality testing, and were more active in open-field exploration. Tx females appeared to be more vulnerable to the effects on learning. Learning in Tx males was only slightly impaired. Serotonin and dopamine metabolism was also affected in a brain region-specific manner in Tx progeny. Levels of 5-HIAA were reduced in the olfactory tubercle and cortex. HVA levels were lower in olfactory tubercle, but were elevated in the hippocampus. As these neurotransmitters play a functional role in activity, mood and learning, the findings may be pertinent to the observed behavioural impairments. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that an adequate in utero thyroid hormone environment may be essential for early fetal neurodevelopment even if the fetus is euthyroid.
