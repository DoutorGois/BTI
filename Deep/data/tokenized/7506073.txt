The dynorphin A (1-17), Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 and substance P levels were determined by RIA following Sep-Pak separation in the striatum, hippocampus and spinal cord of three strains of mice (C57Bl10/D1, A/Sn, A. CA). The C57Bl10/D1 mice had high consumption of 10% ethanol at free choice schedule, whereas the A/Sn and A. CA mice had very low one. The Met-enkephalin-Arg6-Phe7 level was found to be decreased only in the spinal cord and striatum of C57Bl10/D1 mice. It is suggested that decreased synthesis or processing of the proenkephalin may at least partly determine the high level of ethanol consumption by this strain of mice.
