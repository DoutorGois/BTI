In the present study, we investigated the effects of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, on repeated cerebral ischemia-induced impairment of spatial memory of the 8-arm radial maze in rats. Repeated ischemia (10 min ischemia x 2 times with 1 h interval) impaired the spatial memory in the 8-arm radial maze test and produced apoptosis in the hippocampus 7 days after final occlusion, and gradually increased the NO(x)(-) levels approximately 30-180 min after the second reperfusion. Post-ischemic administration of L-NAME at a dose of 50 mg/kg, i.p. 30 min following the second occlusion, significantly attenuated the repeated ischemia-induced impairment of spatial memory in the 8-arm radial maze test and suppressed apoptosis in the hippocampus, and also significantly suppressed a delayed increase in the NO(x)(-) levels induced by repeated ischemia. However, pre-ischemic administration of L-NAME at a dose of 50 mg/kg, i.p. 30 min before the first occlusion, caused about 90% mortality (the mortality rate of vehicle-treated group was 10%). These results suggest that the delayed generation of NO(x)(-) may cause spatial memory impairment and induction of apoptosis in the hippocampus in rats subjected to repeated ischemia.
