Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) of the subgranular zone have been implicated in cognitive processes, which represent a potentially important source of regenerative medicine for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In our previous studies, ZY-1, a novel nicotinic analog, improved cognitive function in transgenic mice model of AD. However, the effect of ZY-1 on the NSPCs remains unclear. Here, we show that ZY-1 significantly increased proliferation and migration of NSPCs, but failed to affect NSPCs differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, during the proliferative period, ZY-1 enhanced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Meanwhile, ZY-1 also inhibited the levels of Abeta42-induced ROS. Our data indicate that ZY-1 regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vitro, at least partly due to modulating intracellular ROS levels. These results, taken together with those of our previous studies, suggest that ZY-1 might have a potential therapeutic effect for the treatment of AD.
