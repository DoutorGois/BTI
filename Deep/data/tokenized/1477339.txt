The influence of antioxidant from hindered phenols (U-18) on a hypoxic neurodestructive effect in mouse hippocampal cell cultures was studied. Morphological and biochemical quantitative analysis of neuronal damage showed that U-18 attenuates nerve cell death resultant from 6-7-hour hypoxia and subsequent 12-hour posthypoxic reoxygenation. This antidestructive action of U-18 was observed upon its introduction in nutrient medium both before and immediately after hypoxic period. Thus, our results suggest that peroxidant reactions play a pivotal role in hypoxic neuronal injury and probably participate in this neurodestructive process mainly during posthypoxic reoxygenation period.
