Piracetam at a concentration of 10(-6) M was shown to behave as a noncompetitive inhibitor of 3H-imipramine specific binding to rat brain membranes. At the same time piracetam failed to influence specific binding of 3H-mianserin to membranes of guinea-pig cerebellum, which is indicative of its inability to suppress histamine H1 receptors, a component of 3H-imipramine specific binding sites. At a concentration of 10(-4) M piracetam does not change specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam to rat hippocampal membranes in the absence of GABA, but in the presence of 5 X 10(-5) M GABA, like atypical tranquilizer mebicar, acts as a competitor of 3H-flunitrasepam binding. Though Ro-15 1788 did not suppress anxyolytic piracetam (and mebicar) effect, our results give evidence of a possible involvement of GABA-benzodiazepine supramolecular complex in the anxiolytic activity of piracetam.
