Isolation rearing induces profound behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities in rodents. However there have been many controversies with its anxiogenic-like effects using models like elevated-plus maze. In the current study we aimed to address this by using one novelty-based anxiety paradigm that has been largely overlooked in previous isolation rearing studies. We found that eight-week isolation rearing produced potent anxiogenic-like effects in novelty-induced hypophagia test in mice. We also demonstrated PSD-95 levels were elevated in the hippocampus and amygdala and reduced in the frontal cortex after social isolation. This study provides further behavioral and neurochemical evidence to support that isolation rearing can produce anxiogenic-like effects in rodents.
