We verify the levels of cytokine/chemokine, myeloperoxidase activity, oxidative stress and disruption of BBB in hippocampus and cortex of the neonate Wistar rats after meningitis by S. agalactiae. In the hippocampus the levels were increased of CINC-1 at 6 h and 12 h, IL-1beta at 6, 12 and 24 h, IL-6 at 6, 24 and 96 h, IL-10 at 24, 48 and 96 h and TNF-alpha at 24 h and 96 h. In the cortex the CINC-1 and IL-1beta levels were found increased at 6 h. The MPO activity was significantly elevated at 24, 48 and 98 h in hippocampus and at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h in the cortex. The breakdown of BBB started at 12 h.TBARS levels were elevated in the hippocampus at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h and cortex at 72 and 96 h. Protein carbonyls were elevated in the hippocampus and cortex at 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. There was a decrease of SOD activity in hippocampus and in cortex. Catalase activity was elevated in hippocampus at 6 h and in the cortex at 12 and 96 h. Neonatal bacterial infections of the CNS are severe, the interference with the complex network of cytokines/chemokine, other inflammatory mediators and oxidants tend to aggravate the illness and can be involved in the breakdown of the BBB.
