In a dose of 100 mg/kg and with intravenous administration to rabbits lithium chloride produces a depressing influence on the spontaneous bioelectric activity of the cerebral cortex and its subcortical formations, which extends from the cortex to subcortical structures. The compound brings down the electric excitability of the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, tonsils, reticular formation of the mesensephalic segment and of the thalamus, while in a dose of 300 mg/kg it increases the excitability of the motor cortex. No correlation between the lithium chloride induced electroencephalographic changes in the cerebral structures, on the one hand, and the content therein of biogenic amines and accumulation of lithium ions, on the other, was revealed.
