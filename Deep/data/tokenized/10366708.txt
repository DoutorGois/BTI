Connexin43 (cx43) mRNA and protein were quantified in seven brain regions using RNase protection assays and Western blotting from postnatal day 3, 10, and 17, and adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Increases in cx43 mRNA abundance preceded strong increases in cx43 protein in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striatum, whereas smaller postnatal increases were seen in the cerebellum, brain stem, and olfactory bulbs.
