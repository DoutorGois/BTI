Cognitive functions are influenced by memory and anxiety states. However, a non-linear relation has been shown between these two domains. The important role of the hippocampus in memory and emotional responses may link the pathogenesis of anxiety to memory-related GABAergic and glutamatergic processes in the hippocampus. To investigate the role of GABAA receptors in relation to blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the CA3 region, and balancing the glutamatergic and GABAergic system activities as an approach for the management of related disorders, the elevated plus-maze test-retest paradigm was used to investigate the anxiolytic-like state on the test day and avoidance memory state on the retest day. The data showed that injection of D-AP5, the NMDA receptor antagonist, induced anxiolytic-like behavior and impaired avoidance memory. Injection of GABAA agonist (muscimol), but not the antagonist (bicuculline), induced avoidance memory impairment. Neither muscimol nor bicuculline altered anxiety-like behaviors. Muscimol pretreatment did not change D-AP5-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors but potentiated avoidance memory impairment. Bicuculline pretreatment blocked D-AP5-induced anxiolytic-like behaviors and contradicted its effect on avoidance memory. Our findings indicate that alteration of the CA3 GABAA receptor activity can effectively affect the anxiolytic-like behaviors and avoidance memory deficit induced by D-AP5.
