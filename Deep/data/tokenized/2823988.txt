Early hyperthyroidism induces an aberrant growth of hippocampal mossy fibers both in the fascia dentata (supragranular layer) and in Ammon's horn (infrapyramidal layer of CA3). Using a quantitative autoradiographic method, we found a corresponding increase in kainic acid binding sites supporting previous observations of a very close association between mossy fiber terminals and kainic acid binding sites.
