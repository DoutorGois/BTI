In this study we investigated energy metabolism in the mdx mouse brain.To this end, prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, and cortex were analyzed. There was a decrease in Complex I but not in Complex II activity in all structures. There was an increase in Complex III activity in striatum and a decrease in Complex IV activity in prefrontal cortex and striatum. Mitochondrial creatine kinase activity was increased in hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, cortex, and striatum. Our results indicate that there is energy metabolism dysfunction in the mdx mouse brain.
