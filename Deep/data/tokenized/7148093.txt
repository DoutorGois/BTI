Explants of the hippocampus (rat) were cultivated either in maximow chambers without movement (static) or in movement (dynamic) by rotation in roller tubes. The growth of nerve fibres, the density of cells (matrix, neurons) and the area of cell nuclei was observed. The determination of the index of nerve fibre growth, the procedure for counting cells in a tissue with different densities and the value of the two methodological approaches of cultivation is discussed. Finally it is stated that best results in morphology of explants can only be obtained by cultivation without movement.
