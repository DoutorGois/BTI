The effects of DL-homocysteine, and DL-homocysteate, on extracellular levels of amino acids in the rat hippocampus have been studied using brain microdialysis. Hippocampal electroencephalogram activity was monitored simultaneously using an electrode attached to the dialysis probe. DL-Homocysteine (1200 mg/kg; i.p. injection) produced epileptic activity in hippocampus in an inconsistent manner. Alterations in electroencephalogram activity were not observed in urethane anaesthetized animals, whereas 50% of Hypnorm anaesthetized animals exhibited epileptic activity. DL-Homocysteate (2 mu mol; i.c.v.) induced epileptic activity in a majority of animals anaesthetized using urethane. Dialysate levels of aspartate were significantly elevated by homocysteine in both groups of animals. Conversely, dialysis levels of GABA were reduced. Dialysate levels of other amino acids measured (glutamate, glutamine, taurine, alanine and valine) were not affected significantly. Dialysate levels of taurine were increased significantly in animals injected with homocysteate. These data suggest that the imbalance in excitatory:inhibitory neurotransmission in the hippocampus caused by these alterations in extracellular levels of neuroexcitatory (i.e. aspartate) and neuroinhibitory (i.e. GABA) transmitters could underly the epileptic effect of homocysteine.
