This investigation aimed to isolate neural stem cells from neonatal hippocampus and induce them to differentiate into cholinergic neurons. The isolated neural stem cells were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/F12 medium added with 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor and B27. The cell line isolated from the hippocampal formation of neonatal rats expressed nestin and had the potency to form clones and differentiate into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Embryonic chick skeletal muscle extract was used to induce the differentiation of the neural stem cells into cholinergic neurons. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect the choline acetyltransferase antigen of cholinergic neurons for confirmation. The results showed that embryonic chick skeletal muscle extract could induce isolated neural stem cell to differentiate into a significantly larger number of cholinergic neurons than controls.
