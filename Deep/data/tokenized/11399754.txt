Brain injury-derived neurotrophic peptide (BINP) is a synthetic 13-mer peptide that supports neuronal survival and protects hippocampal neurons in primary cultures from cell death caused by glutamate. We have developed a monoclonal antibody named mAb 6A22 against the 40-kDa BINP-binding protein, p40BBP. mAb 6A22 inhibits binding between BINP and rat brain synaptosomes and abolishes the protective effect of BINP. The antigen of mAb 6A22 should be the BINP-binding protein that mediates the neuroprotective action of BINP. Using an expression cloning approach with mAb 6A22, we isolated a cDNA encoding a novel receptor protein that shows binding activity of BINP. COS7 cells transfected with the cloned cDNA show binding of BINP and cell surfaces that are stained by 6A22. The mRNA for p40BBP is specific for the rat brain and is increased after birth. From immunohistochemical studies using mAb 6A22, p40BBP increased after kainic acid treatment in rat hippocampal neurons.
