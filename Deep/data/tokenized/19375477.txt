Computational models, behavioral data, and electrophysiological data suggest that the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus may support multiple mnemonic processes critical to the formation and subsequent retrieval of spatial memories. Multiple researchers have proposed that the CA3 subregion contains an autoassociative network in which synaptic connections between CA3 neurons that represent different components of a memory are strengthened via recurrent collateral connections. As a result, it has been suggested that the CA3 autoassociative network may support multiple processes including the formation of spatial arbitrary associations, temporary maintenance of spatial working memory, and spatial pattern completion. In addition, the CA3 subregion has been suggested to be involved in spatial pattern separation. The separation of patterns is hypothesized to be accomplished based on the low probability that any two CA3 neurons will receive mossy-fiber input synapses from a similar subset of dentate gyrus cells. The separation of patterns also may be enhanced by competitive inhibition within CA3 and dentate gyrus. This review will focus on the mnemonic processes supported by CA3 neurons and how these processes may facilitate the encoding and retrieval of spatial information. Although there is growing evidence indicating that the hippocampus plays a role in the processing of nonspatial information as well, the scope of the present review will focus on the role of the CA3 subregion in spatial memory.
