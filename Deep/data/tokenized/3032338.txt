Rat brain hippocampal slices were incubated with or without the convulsant 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). From these slices a crude mitochondrial/synaptosomal membrane fraction was prepared and analyzed for endogenous protein phosphorylation. 4-AP (10(-5) M) stimulated the phosphorylation of a 50 kDa protein by 86%. The phosphorylation of this 50 kDa protein is Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent and we suggest that this protein is the lower molecular weight subunit of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II).
