Cullin-5 (Cul-5), a member of the cullin gene family of scaffold proteins of E3 ubiquitin-ligase complexes, has a role in proteolysis and cell cycle regulation. We recently demonstrated that cul-5 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in the central nervous system. The present study used quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting to measure changes in cul-5 mRNA and Cul-5 protein expression, respectively, in the injured CNS in response to traumatic brain injury (TBI). cul-5 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the ipsilateral rat cerebral cortex on Days 1 and 7, but not on Day 3 following TBI. In the ipsilateral hippocampus, cul-5 mRNA was significantly reduced on Day 1 after TBI. Cul-5 protein levels were significantly decreased in the ipsilateral rat cerebral cortex on Days 1-7 post-TBI while levels were significantly lower in the ipsilateral hippocampus on Days 3-7 post-TBI. Since Cul-5 is ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells and is linked to proteasome-mediated protein degradation, it may have a role in CNS cell fate determination under conditions of traumatic stress.
