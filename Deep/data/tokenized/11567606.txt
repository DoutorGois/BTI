In a paper by Schmitz and colleagues in this issue of Neuron, new evidence for the existence of gap junctions between pyramidal cell axons uncovers a mechanism for fast neural communication in the hippocampus. Electrical coupling between axons may be crucial during fast oscillations, which have been proposed to mediate memory consolidation.
