Severe hypoglycemia in vivo is known to slow down the EEG, then to produce complete electrical silence in the brain. To find out why low glucose concentrations reduce electrical activity, synaptic transmission from Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers to CA1 pyramidal cells in the submerged rat hippocampal slice was investigated using extracellular recording techniques. Superfusion for 30 min with 1 mM glucose reversibly reduced population spike amplitude, without affecting the size of the presynaptic volley and the slope of the field EPSP. Lower glucose concentrations also affected the EPSP, although to a lesser extent than the population spike. Antidromic population spikes were not decreased by low glucose. Depolarization with 8-10 mM K+ reduced both presynaptic volley amplitude and EPSP, but enhanced the population spike, an effect clearly different from that of low glucose. The slope of the input/output curve between presynaptic volley and EPSP remained unaltered in 1 mM glucose but the slope between EPSP and population spike was reduced by about 50%. Results suggest that low glucose concentrations interrupt synaptic transmission by reducing, but not abolishing, the excitability of pyramidal cells.
