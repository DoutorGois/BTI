Long-term disabilities are the main outcome of cerebral strokes, though some of the deficits show receding signs in the weeks and months following the "brain attack". Studies show that neurogenesis is induced in the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ) in animal models of ischemia, and that new neurons are generated at the sites of degeneration, where they replace some of the lost nerve cells. The enhanced neurogenesis suggests the involvement of the hippocampus and SVZ in the physiopathology of cerebral strokes, and the generation of new neuronal cells at the sites of degeneration suggests that the central nervous system (CNS) may attempt to repair itself. In this manuscript, we will review the studies on adult neurogenesis in cerebral strokes, discuss the contribution of adult neurogenesis to the physiopathology of strokes, and its underlying mechanisms.
