Passive avoidance learning and retention, as well as locomotor and exploratory behaviors, were assessed in rats after intraventricular 192 immunoglobulin G-saporin injections on either Postnatal Day 1 (PND1) or PND7. PND1-lesioned rats were not significantly impaired on acquisition or retention of passive avoidance. PND7-lesioned rats acquired the task slower than controls, but retention was not affected. PND7-lesioned rats were less exploratory than controls and showed reduced wall rearing. Histological analysis of PND1- and PND7-lesioned rats revealed no neuronal degeneration in hippocampus or cortex. There was a marked reduction of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the hippocampus, cortex, and septum in the PND7-lesioned rats and a slight but significant ChAT depletion in the cortex of PND1-lesioned rats. These data suggest that the cholinergic system is critical for the learning of passive avoidance and exploratory behaviors in the developing rat.
