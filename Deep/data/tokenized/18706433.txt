The effect of in vivo fentanyl treatment on synaptic transmission was studied in the CA1 area of the rat hippocampus. Animals were treated either with saline or fentanyl (4 x 80 microg/kg, s.c./15 min). Intracellular in vitro recordings were obtained, 24 h after treatment, from CA1 pyramidal neurons. No difference in pyramidal neuron basic membrane properties or postsynaptic membrane excitability was observed between neurons from saline- and fentanyl-treated animals. The peak amplitude of fast (f-) and slow (s-) components of IPSPs elicited in standard ACSF and the peak amplitude and rate of rise of isolated f- and s-IPSPs elicited in the presence of antagonists (CNQX, 10 microM; AP-5, 10 microM; CGP 55845, 1 microM; and bicuculline methochloride, 10 microM), in response to various stimulus intensities, was smaller in fentanyl-treated animals. Conversely, the rising slope of excitatory responses was similar in neurons from saline- and fentanyl-treated animals. Furthermore, in fentanyl-treated animals, lower stimulus strengths were required to elicit subthreshold excitatory responses of the same amplitude suggesting that acute exposure to fentanyl increases susceptibility of pyramidal neurons to presynaptic stimulation. GABA immunohistochemistry revealed lower GABA content in processes and neuronal somata suggesting diminished GABA release onto pyramidal neurons. We conclude that acute in vivo exposure to fentanyl is sufficient to induce long-lasting reduction in GABA-mediated transmission, rather, than enhanced excitatory transmission or modulation of the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons. These findings provide evidence regarding the mechanisms involved in the early stages of tolerance development towards the analgesic effects of opioids.
