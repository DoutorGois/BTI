Analysis of neuronal activity of presubiculum was performed in unanaesthetized rabbits. The level of spontaneous activity was high, in 33% of neurones it consisted in high frequency bursts which periodically followed regularly with alternating frequencies from 0.5 cps up to 15.0 cps. Presubicular neurones responded to sensory stimuli of various modalities, but visual stimuli were the most effective. Responses of specific, patterned type dominated over simple phasic and tonic effects. Various types of incremental dynamics were observed with repeated stimulation, habituation was present only in a limited number of neurones (15%). Comparison of presubicular neuronal characteristics with those of other sub-divisions of the hippocampal formation revealed a significant resemblance between presubiculum and the entorhinal cortex and a strong difference from subiculum.
