The period of adolescence is characterized by a high vulnerability to stress and trauma, which might result in long-lasting consequences and an increased risk to develop psychiatric disorders. Using a recently developed mouse model for chronic social stress during adolescence, we studied persistent neuroendocrine and behavioral effects of chronic social stress obtained 12 months after cessation of the stressor. As a reference, we investigated immediate effects of chronic stress exposure obtained at the end of the chronic stress period. Immediately after the 7 week chronic stress period stressed animals show significantly increased adrenal weights, decreased thymus weight, increased basal corticosterone secretion and a flattened circadian rhythm. Furthermore, stressed animals display an increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and the novelty-induced suppression of feeding test. Hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels were significantly decreased. To investigate persistent consequences of this early stressful experience, the same parameters were assessed in aged mice 12 months after the cessation of the stressor. Interestingly, we still found differences between formerly stressed and control mice in important stress-related parameters. MR expression levels were significantly lower in stressed animals, suggesting lasting, possibly epigenetic alterations in gene expression regulation. Furthermore, we observed long-term behavioral alterations in animals stressed during adolescence. Thus, we could demonstrate that chronic stress exposure during a crucial developmental time period results in long-term, persistent effects on physiological and behavioral parameters throughout life, which may contribute to an enhanced vulnerability to stress-induced diseases.
