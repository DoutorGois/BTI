The psychotomimetic drug 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl) piperidine (PCP, phencyclidine) was found to cause a deficit in the gating of the response of the hippocampal neuron to repeated auditory stimuli, which is similar to a particular physiological feature observed in human psychosis. Other drugs, with sigma agonist and/or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist effects, were administered and their ability to cause a loss of auditory gating was compared to that of PCP. The rank order of effectiveness was levoxodrol > PCP and (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) > N-allylnormetazocine (SKF 10047) > dexoxodrol > 3-(+/-)2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP). Further studies of two of the drugs, PCP and MK-801, showed that selective lesioning of the noradrenergic input with the neurotoxin DSP4, as well as less selective depletion of monoamines with reserpine, blocked the loss of gating. Phencyclidine, and other drugs with the same spectrum of action, most likely disrupt gating by increasing noradrenergic activity through a sigma mechanism.
