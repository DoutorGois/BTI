Excitatory amino acids (EAAs), usually glutamate, activate the greatest excitatory system in the vertebrate brain. EAAs mediate synaptic transmission and control the stability and efficiency of synaptic connections. Moreover, EAAs provide the postsynaptic neurone with chemical cues for survival and maturation. Improper activation of EAA receptors can lead to neurotoxicity and be involved in the pathogenesis of certain neurological diseases.
