Quantitative in situ hybridization revealed that following the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats, specific increases in the expression of the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and mGluR1c, a short splice variant of the metabotropic glutamate receptors that are linked intracellularly to phospholipase C (PLC) and protein kinase C (PKC), were seen in the postsynaptic dentate granule cells. There were no changes in the expression of NR2A; NR2C and NR2D NMDA receptor subunits; or mGluR1a, mGluR1b, mGluR5a, and mGluR5b PLC-associated metabotropic receptors. The elevations in NR2B and mGluR1c mRNA were delayed, occurring days after LTP induction. NR2B expression was enhanced significantly by 48 hr after LTP but was starting to decrease toward basal levels by 96 hr. The transient increase in the expression of NR2B mirrored the increase in the expression of PKC-sensitive isoforms of the NR1 subunits of the NMDA receptor we observed previously (Thomas et al. 1994a). The increase in mGluR1c expression was more persistent, showing a significant increase 96 hr after LTP. This study demonstrates that not only are there changes in the expression of individual glutamate receptor subunits but the increases in their expression occur days after the induction of LTP and may reflect so-called late-onset genes that may be important for the maintenance of LTP.
