Immunohistochemical changes of heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were investigated in the gerbil hippocampus 1 h-7 days after 10 min of cerebral ischemia. Transient cerebral ischemia caused HSP 70 expression in GFAP-positive astrocytes in a delayed fashion, as compared with a rapid induction in vulnerable neurons such as hilar neurons. The present results may offer clues to elucidate the mechanisms of ischemic neuronal damage.
