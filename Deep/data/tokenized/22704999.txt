Based on our 3-hydroxy-7-chloroquinazoline-2,4-dione derivatives, previously reported as antagonists at ionotropic glutamate receptors, we synthesized new 3-hydroxyquinazoline-2,4-diones bearing a trifluoromethyl group at the 7-position and different groups at position 6. Glycine/NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptor binding data showed that the 7-trifluoromethyl residue increased AMPA and kainate receptor affinity and selectivity, with respect to the 7-chlorine atom. Among the probed 6-substituents, the 6-(1,2,4-triazol-4-yl) group (compound 8) was the most advantageous for AMPA receptor affinity and selectivity. Derivative 8 demonstrated to be effective in decreasing neuronal damage produced by oxygen and glucose deprivation in organotypic rat hippocampal slices and also showed anticonvulsant effects in pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions. The previously reported kainate receptor antagonist 6-(2-carboxybenzoyl)-amino-7-chloro-3-hydroxyquinazoline-2,4-dione 3 prevented the failure of neurotransmission induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices.
