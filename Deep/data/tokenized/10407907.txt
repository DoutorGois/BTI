23 unselected juvenile firesetters (M age 12.0 yr.) consisted of seven with schizophrenia, three with organic mental disorder, six with posttraumatic stress disorder, two with severe mental retardation, and two with conduct disorders. Three previously nondestructive boys (M age 11.0 yr.), all of them loners, did not fit such traditional diagnoses. Their fleeting (c. 20 min.) symptoms included flat affect, autonomic arousal, and delusions or hallucinations. It appeared that their motiveless, unplanned acts were each preceded by a chance encounter with an individualized stimulus which revived the three boys' repeatedly ruminated memories of intermittently experienced merely moderate stresses associated with fire, smoke, or matches. Such a sequence of events is characteristic of seizure kindling. One boy's abnormal EEG was congruent with seizures in the temporal lobe area, which includes the amygdala, i.e., that part of the limbic system particularly susceptible to seizure kindling. The three boys' consistent symptomatology was very similar to that reported for 17 men with bizarre homicidal acts implicating a kindled partial seizure called "Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction." In primates, too, similar partial nonconvulsive "behavioral seizures" with psychosis-like symptoms can be elicited through experiential kindling.
