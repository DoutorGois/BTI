MRI studies have revealed structural and functional changes in the hippocampus of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients. Previous studies conducted by us in a PTSD animal model found that single prolonged stress (SPS) induced abnormal morphological changes in hippocampal cells. The effects of SPS on cellular organelles of the hippocampal neurons remain unknown; however, these changes have been involved in SPS-induced abnormal hippocampal function. The aim of the present study is to examine ultrastructural changes in cellular organelles, including the lysosomes, mitochondria (Mit), Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), following SPS exposure using transmission electron microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, and enzyme cytochemistry. First, morphological changes of the hippocampal cells and ultrastructural changes in cellular organelles, including lysosomes, ER, and Mit-induced by SPS were observed. Results from histo- and cytochemistry demonstrated that the Mit marker enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase, (ACP), increased following exposure to SPS. SPS induced COX release from Mit and led to a wider distribution of ACP in round lysosomes, NLY, and the Golgi. In addition, we found that SPS increased the presence of autophagosomes and induced changes in the autophagy-related protein, Beclin. These results indicated the differential effects of SPS on cellular organelles, that is, a positive effect on lysosomes as well as a negative effect on the Mit and ER. Increased lysosomal function may serve as protection against SPS-induced cell damage. Structural changes in the Mit and ER may be involved in SPS-induced disorders of energy metabolism and protein synthesis and export.
