Adult neural progenitors have been isolated from diverse regions of the CNS using methods which primarily involve the enzymatic digestion of tissue pieces; however, interpretation of these experiments can be complicated by the loss of anatomical resolution during the isolation procedures. We have developed a novel, explant-based technique for the isolation of neural progenitors. Living CNS regions were sectioned using a vibratome and small, well-defined discs of tissue punched out. When cultured, explants from the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord, hypothalamus, and caudate nucleus all robustly gave rise to proliferating progenitors. These progenitors were similar in behaviour and morphology to previously characterised multipotent hippocampal progenitor lines. Clones from all regions examined could proliferate from single cells and give rise to secondary neurospheres at a low but consistent frequency. Immunostaining demonstrated that clonal cortical progenitors were able to differentiate into both neurons and glial cells, indicating their multipotent characteristics. These results demonstrate it is possible to isolate anatomically resolved adult neural progenitors from small amounts of tissue throughout the CNS, thus, providing a tool for investigating the frequency and characteristics of progenitor cells from different regions.
