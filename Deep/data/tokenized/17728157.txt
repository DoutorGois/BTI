Status epilepticus may cause long-term functional and structural consequences possibly resulting in brain dysfunctions such as chronic epilepsy. In epileptogenesis, the dentate gyrus plays a key role in regulating the excitability of highly vulnerable and potentially epileptogenic downstream structures in the hippocampus proper. One, four and eight weeks after electrically induced status epilepticus, excitability and neuronal degeneration in the rat dentate gyrus were examined with intracerebral electrodes and Fluoro Jade (FJ) staining, respectively. Half of the animals had developed chronic epilepsy by 8 weeks after status epilepticus. Sham-operated controls did not exhibit seizures, and the excitatory parameters remained unchanged. Compared to controls, 8 weeks after status epilepticus the population spike latency in the dentate gyrus was significantly reduced (p<0.05) and substantial neuronal degeneration was seen (p<0.05). In summary, status epilepticus results in functional and morphological alterations in the dentate gyrus likely contributing to epileptogenesis.
