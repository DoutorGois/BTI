Desipramine (DMI), a tricyclic antidepressant drug used in the treatment of depression, has been shown to increase steady-state levels of glucocorticoid receptor type II (GRII) mRNA in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether this effect is secondary to norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibition i.e., increases in synaptic NE induced by DMI, GRII mRNA levels were assayed in rat hippocampus following neurotoxic lesioning of NE neurons with DSP4. Chronic DMI treatment significantly increased GRII mRNA levels to the same degree in lesioned and non-lesioned animals. In contrast to DMI, the non-tricyclic antidepressant fluoxetine had no effect on GRII mRNA. These results provide evidence which demonstrates that a tricyclic antidepressant can regulate steady-state mRNA levels in vivo by a mechanism which is independent of its effects on synaptic monoamine levels.
