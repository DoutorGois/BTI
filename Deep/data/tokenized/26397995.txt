The present study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which electroacupuncture (EA) ameliorates learning and memory in rats with cerebral ischemicreperfusion (I/R) injury. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in adult male SpragueDawley (SD) rats by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Following MCAO surgery, the rats received EA at the Shenting (DU24) and Baihui (DU20) acupoints. The results of the present study demonstrated that treatment with EA significantly ameliorated neurological deficits and reduced cerebral infarct volume (P<0.05). In addition, EA improved the learning and memory ability of the rats, and markedly activated the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response elementbinding protein (CREB) signaling pathway, resulting in the inhibition of cerebral cell apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra. Furthermore, EA increased the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, the protein expression levels of phosphorylatedCREB and Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), and the mRNA expression levels of Bcl2. Conversely, EA decreased the levels of malondialdehyde and inhibited the expression levels of Bcl2associated X protein. The results of the present study suggest that treatment with EA may result in the amelioration of learning and memory ability in rats with cerebral I/R injury.
