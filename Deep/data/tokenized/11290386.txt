It is well established that GABA degradation may play a key role in epileptogenesis. However, whether or not the expression of GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), which catalyzes GABA degradation and participates in the neuronal metabolism via GABA shunt, changes chronologically after on-set of seizure remains to be clarified. To identify the change of GABA-T expression in seizure, GABA-T expression in the gerbil hippocampus, associated with different sequelae of spontaneous seizures, was investigated. The distribution pattern of GABA-T immunoreactive neurons in the hippocampus between the seizure-resistant and pre-seizure group of seizure sensitive gerbils was similar. Interestingly, at 30 min postictal, the enhancement of GABA-T immunoreactivity in the perikarya was apparently observed. This contrasted with the decline in GABA-T immunoreactivity in the granular and pyramidal layer. At 12-24 h postictal, GABA-T immunoreactivity in the hilar neurons had declined significantly. However, the GABA-T immunoreactivity in the granular layer increased. These findings suggest that in the gerbil, the alteration in GABA-T expressions may play an important role in the self-recovery mechanism from seizure attack via both GABA degradation and regulation of neuronal metabolism.
