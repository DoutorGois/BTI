OBJECTIVE: In an effort to address earliest detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we examined hippocampal volumes and atrophy in middle-aged men to explore neuroanatomical support for different neuropsychological definitions of MCI. METHODS: 460 men aged 51-60 years underwent neuropsychological testing and MRI. MCI was defined according to five criteria sets. MRI-derived hippocampal volume and hippocampal occupancy (HOC) were obtained via FreeSurfer. Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Differences in HOC between normal cognitive functioning, amnestic, and non-amnestic MCI were observed using MCI criteria that required one impaired (>1.5 SD) cognitive measure in a given cognitive domain or a cognitive composite score method with a cut-point 2 SD below the mean. Differences in standard hippocampal volume were only found between normal and amnestic presentations and only when using the composite score method. CONCLUSION: Results provide empirical support for detection of pre-MCI in younger cohorts. Convergence of neuropsychological and neuroanatomical data, particularly HOC (as opposed to standard cross-sectional volume), supports early identification of MCI as defined by some neuropsychological criteria.
