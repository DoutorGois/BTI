Administration of 4 mg/kg per day of diazepam in the drinking water for 14 days produced a small, but not significant decrease of benzodiazepine binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. Similar treatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788 resulted in a marked increase in the density of sites for both ligands in the synaptosomal membranes of cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation.
