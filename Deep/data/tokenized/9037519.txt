Several overlapping cDNA clones containing 3995 nucleotides of the human 2C NMDA receptor subunit (NR2C) were isolated from human hippocampal and cerebellar cDNA libraries. The nucleic acid sequence of the overlapping cDNA clones displays 85% identity to that of rat NR2C. The predicted protein sequence is 1233 amino acids long and has 88% identity to the amino acid sequence of the rat NR2C, Northern blot analysis has demonstrated a wide distribution pattern of the NR2C transcript in the brain. While the predominant expression is in the cerebellum, as observed in the rat, readily detectable levels are present in the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, subthalamic nuclei and thalamus. NR2C was also detected in the heart, skeletal muscle and pancreas. Distribution of the mouse NR2C NMDA receptor subunit homologue was investigated in mouse brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry using exonic genomic probes. Expression of the transcript was principally in the cerebellum, but is also detected in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, thalamic and subthalamic nuclei, vestibular nuclei and olfactory bulb. These results demonstrate a widespread expression pattern of the NR2C gene, both in the CNS and in the periphery.
