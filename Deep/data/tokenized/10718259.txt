In Experiment 1, rats discriminated among computer-generated visual displays (scenes) comprising 3 different shapes (objects). One constant scene (unrewarded) appeared on every trial together with a trial-unique variable scene (rewarded). Four types of variable scene were intermingled: (a) unfamiliar objects in different positions from the constant; (b) unfamiliar objects in same positions as the constant; (c) same objects as the constant in different positions; (d) same objects and positions, recombined. Aspiration lesions of perirhinal cortex impaired performance with type (b) only. Experiment 2 tested spatial delayed nonmatching-to-sample. The perirhinal group were impaired nonsignificantly, and less than fornix-transected rats in an earlier study. Rats' perirhinal cortex, like monkeys', subserves object identification in the absence of memory requirement but does not contribute substantially to hippocampal system spatial memory function.
