OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cell proliferation and differentiation in the developing brain of mouse. METHODS: C57/BL6 mice were divided into 3 groups at random. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected into the brains in different development periods once a day for 7 d. The brains were retrieved 4 weeks after the last BrdU injection. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent studies were carried out for detecting cell proliferation (BrdU) and cell differentiation (NeuN, APC, Iba1, and S100beta), respectively. RESULTS: The number of BrdU labeled cells decreased significantly with the development of the brain. Cell proliferation was prominent in the cortex and striatum. A small portion of BrdU and NeuN double labeled cells could be detected in the cortex at the early stage of development, and in the striatum and CA of the hippocampus in all groups. The majority of BrdU labeled cells were neuroglia, and the number of neuroglia cells decreased dramatically with brain maturation. Neurogenesis is the major cytogenesis in the dentate gyrus. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that cell proliferation, differentiation and survival were age and brain region related.
