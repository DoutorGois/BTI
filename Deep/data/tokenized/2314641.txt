There is increasing evidence that an aberrant sprouting response may contribute to some of the neuronal alterations observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we demonstrate that in the rat CNS, sprouting results in the reinduction of the embryonic form of the mRNA for alpha-tubulin. The fetal form of alpha-tubulin mRNA was also elevated in the hippocampus obtained from five AD patients, as compared to five elderly controls. These results suggest that the reexpression of embryonic forms of cytoskeletal proteins, in association with an aberrant sprouting response, may contribute to the neuropathological alterations in AD.
