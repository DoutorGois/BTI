The dorsal and pectoral fins are the primary locomotor organs in seahorses (Hippocampus) and pipefish (Syngnathus). The small dorsal fins beat at high oscillatory frequencies against the viscous medium of water. Both species are able to oscillate their fins at frequencies likely exceeding the point of flicker fusion for their predators, thus enhancing their ability to remain cryptic. High-speed video demonstrated that seahorse dorsal fins beat at 30-42 Hz, while pipefish dorsal fins oscillate at 13-26 Hz. In both species, the movement of the fin is a sinusoidal wave that travels down the fin from anterior to posterior. Mechanical properties of seahorse and pipefish dorsal fin muscles were tested in vitro by the work loop method. Maximum isometric stress was 176.1 kN/m(2) in seahorse and 111.5 kN/m(2) in pipefish. Work and power output were examined at a series of frequencies encompassing the range observed in vivo, and at a number of strains (percent length change during a contractile cycle) within each frequency. At a given strain, work per cycle declined with increasing frequency, while power output rose to a maximum at an intermediate frequency and then declined. Frequency and strain interacted in a complex fashion; optimal strain was inversely related to cycle frequency over most of the frequency range tested. Seahorse dorsal fin muscle was able to generate positive work at higher cycling frequencies than pipefish. Both species produced positive work at higher frequencies than have been reported for axial and fin muscles from other fish.
