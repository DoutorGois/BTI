New work suggests that feedback inhibition of neurons in the hippocampus is mediated by two distinct microcircuits. Interneurons targeting a neuron's soma are triggered by onset of activity, while those targeting distal dendrites are recruited by sustained activity. These circuits may thus convey information about the timing and rate of activity, respectively.
