In this study we have characterized the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA for the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and examined the effects of morphine on the gene transcripts for GHR as well as GH binding protein (GHBP) in the male rat hippocampus and spinal cord. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by cloning and sequencing, we found that the entire coding region of the GHR mRNA in the spinal cord is identical to that previously described in liver. A similar observation was made for the partially sequenced GHR cDNA from hippocampus. Northern blot analysis showed that in both tissues the levels of the transcripts for both GHR and GHBP were significantly decreased 4 h after a single dose of morphine. After 24 h the level of both transcripts did not significantly differ from that of control animals. This result indicates that the opiate does not only affect the receptor protein as shown earlier by binding studies, but also reduces the expression or turnover of the GHR as well as GHBP at the transcription level.
