OBJECT: Anterior temporal lobe resection plus amygdalohippocampectomy can cause damage to the anterior portion of the optic radiation, also known as the Meyer loop, resulting in homonymous superior quadrantanopia. Magnetic resonance diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) of the Meyer loop can help in surgical planning. In this study, the distance of the anterior tip of the Meyer loop to the temporal lobe pole (ML-TP) in the Southern Chinese population was assessed. METHODS: The authors studied 16 Southern Chinese individuals (8 men and 8 women; mean age 45.6 years, range 21-60 years). Diffusion tensor images were obtained with a 3-T MR imaging system using a single-shot spin echo echo planar imaging sequence. Two trained operators, one neurosurgeon (Operator A) and one radiologist (Operator B), carried out the DTT analysis with software iPlan (BrainLAB) and FiberTrak (Philips). RESULTS: For the 32 temporal lobes, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the 2 operators' results using iPlan was 0.96, while that of Operator A using iPlan and Operator B using FiberTrak was 0.75. The ICC of Operator B using iPlan and FiberTrak was 0.81. The ML-TP distance of normal lobes (30 lobes [2 lobes that previously underwent surgery were excluded]) was 36.3+/-5.5 mm (range 26.6-48.9 mm), 36.3+/-5.3 mm (range 26.8-48.2 mm), and 35.9+/-6.4 mm (range 20.8-48.4 mm) for Operator A using iPlan, Operator B using iPlan, and Operator B using FiberTrak, respectively (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The 2 operators reached good agreement on ML-TP distance measurement using DTT. The DDT results can be more software dependent than operator dependent. The measurement with FiberTrak demonstrated larger range and standard deviation than measurement with iPlan.
