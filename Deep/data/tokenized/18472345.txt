Cation chloride cotransporters have been reported to be expressed in neurons in the hippocampus and to regulate intracellular Cl(-) concentration. The neuron-specific K-Cl cotransporter 2 (KCC2) is necessary for maintaining the low intracellular chloride concentration required for the hyperpolarizing actions of GABA. In this study we examined the vulnerability of KCC2-containing neurons as well as the changes in the pattern of KCC2 distribution in the rat hippocampus following 15 min ischemia induced by four-vessel occlusion. Immunostaining for the 72 kDa heat shock protein (HSP-72) was used to investigate the extent of damage in neuronal populations previously shown to be vulnerable to ischemia. At 6-24 h after ischemia, when the pyramidal cells in the CA1 (subfield of cornu Ammonis) region showed no morphological signs of damage, a small rise of KCC2 immunoreactivity was already observed. After 2 days, when the CA1 pyramidal cells started to degenerate, a progressive downregulation of the KCC2 protein was visible. Interestingly, in the same areas, the parvalbumin containing interneurons showed no signs of ischemic damage, and KCC2 immunoreactivity was retained on their membrane surface. In CA1 pyramidal cells, the reduction in KCC2 expression may lead to an elevation of intracellular Cl(-) concentration, which causes a shift in equilibrium potential toward more positive levels. Consequently, the reduction of the inhibitory action of GABA through downregulation of KCC2 function may be involved in the pathomechanisms of delayed neuronal death in the CA1 subfield.
