A series of 7-prenyloxy-2, 3-dihydroflavanone derivatives were synthesized and screened for their antidepressant-like activity. Among them, it was observed that compounds 5j and 5k were found to be the most antidepressant-like activity. In addition, it was found that compounds 5j and 5k significantly increased the concentrations of the main neurotransmitters 5-HT and NE in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cortex. Compounds 5j and 5k also significantly increased the contents of 5-HIAA in the hippocampus and cortex, shut down 5-HT metabolism compared with mice treated with stress vehicle. These results suggested that compounds 5j and 5k displayed potent antidepressant-like properties that were mediated via neurochemical systems.
