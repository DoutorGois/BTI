Dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis in the interstitial fluid of the brain is strongly implicated in causing synaptic dysfunction in many neurological and psychiatric illnesses. In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid beta (Abeta)-mediated disruption of synaptic plasticity and memory can be alleviated by interventions that directly remove glutamate or block certain glutamate receptors. An alternative strategy is to facilitate the removal of excess glutamate from the nervous system by activating peripheral glutamate clearance systems. One such blood-based system, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), is activated by oxaloacetate, which acts as a co-substrate. We report here that synthetic and AD brain-derived Abeta-mediated inhibition of synaptic long-term potentiation in the hippocampus is alleviated by oxaloacetate. Moreover the effect of oxaloacetate was GOT-dependent. The disruptive effects of a general inhibitor of excitatory amino acid transport or TNFalpha, a pro-inflammatory mediator of Abeta action, were also reversed by oxaloacetate. Furthermore, another intervention that increases peripheral glutamate clearance, peritoneal dialysis, mimicked the beneficial effect of oxaloacetate. These findings lend support to the promotion of the peripheral clearance of glutamate as a means to alleviate synaptic dysfunction that is caused by impaired glutamate homeostasis in the brain.
