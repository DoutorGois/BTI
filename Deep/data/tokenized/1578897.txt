Traditional methods for displaying electrophysiological data, that use time as the axis on a plot, are inadequate for displaying data from simultaneous multi-channel recordings. New methods proposed here plot the instantaneous value of the data on a third axis over a 2-dimensional spatial map of the tissue. The resulting 3-D computer-generated surfaces are animated over time to reveal simultaneous coherent waves of activity over the entire slice. This method was implemented for displaying multi-channel evoked potential data from rat hippocampal and human cortical slices. In rat hippocampal slice, stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway in stratum radiatum (SR) near CA2 elicited evoked extracellular responses along the length of CA1 from the alveus to stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM). 3-D plotting and subsequent animation of these responses translated differential latencies of activation elicited across the slice into coherent moving patterns. These evoked waves of extracellular activity appeared to propagate along hippocampal laminae and were not readily visible in the individual plots. Human temporal cortical slices were stimulated in the white matter and evoked responses recorded in an array format. Upon plotting and animation, activity was seen to propagate vertically to the pial surface and thereafter move radially away from the stimulation site. Animation of 3-D plots of electrophysiological activity can provide instantaneous visual information on correlated changes in amplitude and latency over an entire brain slice. This means of displaying data can reduce a large number of complex wave forms to simple events and allow the simultaneous visualization of general patterns of activity in a large group of neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
