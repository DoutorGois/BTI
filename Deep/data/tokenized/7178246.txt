Rats with substantial dorsolateral lesions to the hippocampal formation showed significant latent learning of a complex spatial maze. Their overall maze performance, however, was characteristically impaired. Behavior during the pre-exposure phase of the experiment was useful in predicting test maze behavior. Three measures in particular had predictive value: entrances into the maze alley leading to the final choice point, behavior at that choice point, and goal box entries.
