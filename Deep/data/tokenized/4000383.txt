Synaptic density in hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum was studied in two different strains of rat at 3 and 24-28 months of age. Neither Fischer 344 nor Sprague-Dawley rodents showed any age-related loss of synapses. These data support the contention that synapse loss with age is not a generalized phenomenon in the mammalian CNS.
