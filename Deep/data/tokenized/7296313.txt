Kainic acid was injected just lateral to the dorsal noradrenergic bundle and the axons of this bundle were examined for signs of transmitter buildup which would signify axonal damage. Absence of such signs indicates that noradrenergic terminal depletions caused by these injections are not due to local axonal damage. Kainic acid in this region damages local and distal cells, but spares noradrenergic fibers of passage.
