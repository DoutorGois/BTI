Prions have been extensively studied since they represent a new class of infectious agents, the pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc). However, a central question on the physiological function of the normal prion protein (PrPC) remains unresolved. A cell model which was previously established from Rikn mice (PrP-/-) remains problematic because of its ectopic expression of the doppel (Dpl) which may have a neurotoxic effect. Here we established neuronal cell lines from Zurich I (PrP-/-) which do not express Dpl protein and ICR mice (PrP+/+) by transfecting with plasmid encoding for the large T antigen of SV40. The transformed cells have shown neuronal characteristics and, thus, these cell lines may provide a useful model to explore the function of neuronal PrPC.
