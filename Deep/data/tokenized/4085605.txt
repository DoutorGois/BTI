Hypothalamic or hippocampal slices were taken from adrenolectomized male rats either sham operated or with anterior (AHD) of posterior (PHD) hypothalamic deafferentations and from rats with dorsal hippocampectomy (DHIPP). The slices were incubated in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer in the presence of 10-60 nM 3H-corticosterone (CS) with or without 500 fold excess of unlabeled CS for 30 min. The cell nuclear binding in the hypothalami from either PHD of DHIPP rats were markedly reduced (by 50-70%) as compared to control or AHD rats. The binding of 3H-CS in hippocampi from AHD or PHD rats was not affected. These results suggest that extrahypothalamic structures can modulate the binding of CS in the hypothalamus by neural inputs entering the medio-basal hypothalamus from the caudal direction; such modulation may explain previously observed influences upon hypothalamic sensitivity to the feedback action of glucocorticoids by extrahypothalamic structures.
