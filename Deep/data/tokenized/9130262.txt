Several lines of evidence indicate that protein kinase C (PKC) is involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) and in certain forms of learning. Recently, we found a learning-specific, time-dependent increase in [3H]phorbol dibutyrate binding to membrane-associated PKC in the hippocampus of rats subjected to an inhibitory avoidance task. Here we confirm and extend this observation, describing that a one trial inhibitory avoidance learning was associated with rapid and specific increases in B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation in vitro and in PKC activity in hippocampal synaptosomal membranes. The increased phosphorylation of B-50/GAP-43, was seen at 30 min (+35% relative to naive or shocked control groups), but not at 10 or 60 min after training. This learning-associated increase in the phosphorylation of B-50/GAP-43 is mainly due to an increase in the activity of PKC. This is based on three different sets of data: 1) PKC activity increased by 24% in hippocampal synaptosomal membranes of rats sacrificed 30 min after training; 2) B-50/GAP-43 immunoblots revealed no changes in the amount of this protein among the different experimental groups; 3) phosphorylation assays, performed in the presence of bovine purified PKC or in the presence of the selective PKC inhibitor CGP 41231, exhibited no differences in B-50/GAP-43 phosphorylation between naive and trained animals. In conclusion, these results support the contention that hippocampal PKC participates in the early neural events of memory formation of an aversively-motivated learning task.
