Human brain preparations obtained from either the putamen, thalamus, hippocampus or lateral occipital gyrus p-hydroxylate phenylethylamine to tyramine, a reaction carried out by a microsomal (100,000 xg pellet) membrane bound, NADPH-requiring enzyme. This is a minor metabolic pathway occurring in chronic psychiatric patients, as well as in age-comparable controls.
