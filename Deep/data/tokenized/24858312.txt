AIM: Potassium 2-(1-hydroxypentyl)-benzoate (dl-PHPB) is a new drug candidate for ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dl-PHPB on memory deficits and long-term potentiation (LTP) impairment in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The expression of NMDA receptor subunits GluN1 and GluN2B in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice were detected using Western blot analysis. Memory deficits of the mice were evaluated with the passive avoidance test. LTP impairment was studied in the dentate region of Abeta1-42-injected rats and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. RESULTS: APP/PS1 transgenic mice showed significantly lower levels of GluN1 and p-GluN2B in hippocampus, and chronic administration of dl-PHPB (100 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1), po) reversed the downregulation of p-GluN2B, but did not change GluN1 level in the hippocampus. Furthermore, chronic administration of dl-PHPB reversed the memory deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. In the dentate region of normal rats, injection of dl-PHPB (100 mumol/L, icv) did not change the basal synaptic transmission, but significantly enhanced the high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP, which was completely prevented by pre-injection of APV (150 mumol/L, icv). Chronic administration of dl-PHPB (100 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1), po) reversed LTP impairment in Abeta1-42-injected normal rats and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. CONCLUSION: Chronic administration of dl-PHPB improves learning and memory and promotes LTP in the animal models of Alzheimer's disease, possibly via increasing p-GluN2B expression in the hippocampus.
