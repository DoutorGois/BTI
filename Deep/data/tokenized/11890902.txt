Erythropoietin has recently been studied for its role in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in different models of brain injury. We studied whether neuroprotective effects assessed from the reduction of neuronal loss after transient brain ischemia are associated to the preservation of learning ability. Recombinant human erythropoietin (0.5-25 U) was injected in the lateral cerebral ventricle of gerbils that are subjected to temporary (3 min) bilateral carotid occlusion. Post-ischemic histological evaluation of CA1 area neuronal loss and passive avoidance test were performed. Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin significantly reduced delayed neuronal death in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and prevented cognition impairment in the passive avoidance test. These data indicate that recombinant human erythropoietin neuroprotective effects in brain ischemia are associated with the preservation of learning function.
