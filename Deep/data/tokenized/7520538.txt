Serotonin(5-HT) plays an important role in the seizures of El mice since the seizure threshold of El mice correlates with the 5-HT concentration in the central nervous system. In this study, the anticonvulsant effect of a 5-HT reuptake blocker, citalopram, was evaluated behaviorally and biochemically. El mouse convulsions were inhibited by oral administration of citalopram for 2 weeks. Citalopram increased tryptophan and tyrosine amounts, and decreased the 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, kynurenine, and dopamine amounts in the brain. These findings show that citalopram depresses monoaminergic metabolism. Given the known convulsant effect of kynurenine, it is suggested that its decrease by citalopram may involve attenuation of El mice seizures.
