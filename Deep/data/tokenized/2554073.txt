When pharmacological or basic neurochemical systematic characterization of mitochondrial enzymatic systems correlated to energy transduction processes is attempted, studies must be based on subcellular fractions with a high degree of purity from specific brain areas and from individual animals. Distinct populations of mitochondria heterogenous with respect to biochemical enzyme characteristics from rat brain hippocampus are described. Two mitochondrial populations were derived from synaptosomes by lysis and a third consists of free non-synaptic mitochondria. The maximum rate of some cerebral enzyme activities which are part of energy transduction (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase; total NADH-cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase) and amino acid metabolism (glutamate dehydrogenase) were tested on these mitochondrial populations of 8- and 16-week-old rats. A comprehensive analysis of the data suggests that extensive but highly diversified catalytic expressions of the enzymes studied occur in the hippocampus. This is true even when a short period of the rat life span is studied. Hence the varying pattern of evolution of the differing cerebral mitochondria, probably a consequence of different metabolic functions, should be taken into account in any pharmacological study on these systems.
