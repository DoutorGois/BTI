A study was made in rats of the influence of coagulating the anterior and posterior dorsal, medial and ventral hippocampus on the formation and preservation of electro-defensive and food-procuring conditioned reflexes. Statistical processing of the experimental data by the Student t-criterion showed that coagulation of these hippocampal areas does not influence the formation or preservation of the food-procuring reflex. Coagulation of the anterior dorsal and ventral hippocampus does not affect electro-defensive conditioned reflexes. Coagulation of the posterior dorsal and medial hippocampus delays the elaboration of electro-defensive reflexes and to a lesser extent influences their preservation.
