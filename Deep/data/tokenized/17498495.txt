OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of Ganoderma spores on mitochondria-related molecular substances in hippocampus of young rats birthed by rats with gestational hypertension. METHODS: Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor Nw-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) was intraperitoneally injected into pregnant rats to induce gestational hypertension, and Ganoderma spores were administered orally. The effects of Ganoderma spores on levels of mitochondria-related molecular substances in hippocampus of young rats birthed by the rats with gestational hypertension were evaluated with immunoradiometric assay of cAMP, RT-PCR analysis of related genes, and detection of enzyme activity. RESULTS: In hippocampus of the new-born rats birthed by rats with gestational hypertension, the cAMP level, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) level and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity were decreased, and the expression level of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (pgc1 alpha) was unchanged compared to the normal control group. The cAMP level, mtDNA level, ATPase activity and pgc1 alpha expression level in hippocampus of 30-day post-natal rats were lower than those of the rats in normal control group. After oral administration of Ganoderma spores, the cAMP and mtDNA levels in hippocampus of the new-born rats and 30-day post-natal rats recovered almost to the levels of normal control rats, and the ATPase activity and pgc1 alpha expression level were also increased significantly. CONCLUSION: Ganoderma spores may regulate the levels of mitochondria-related molecular substances in hippocampus of young rats birthed by rats with gestational hypertension.
