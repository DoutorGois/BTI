Object recognition memories (ORM) can incorporate new information upon reactivation. This update initially involves destabilization of the original memory, which is followed by restabilization of the upgraded engram through a reconsolidation process that requires gene expression and protein synthesis in the hippocampus. We found that when given in dorsal CA1 either immediately after training or 15 min before ORM reactivation in the presence of a novel object, the dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist SCH23390 did not affect ORM consolidation, expression or retention but impeded the amnesia caused by the post-retrieval administration of the mRNA synthesis inhibitor alpha-amanitin or the protein synthesis blocker anisomycin. This anti-amnesic effect was not observed when SCH23390 was given immediately after training and again 15 min before memory reactivation. Our results demonstrate that hippocampal D1/D5 receptors are not needed for formation, retrieval or post-retrieval restabilization of the ORM trace but are essential for its destabilization when reactivation occurs together with the incorporation of new information into the original memory. Importantly, they also suggest that reenactment of the animal's post-learning neurochemical milieu at the moment of memory reactivation can be a boundary condition for reconsolidation.
