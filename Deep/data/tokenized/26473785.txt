The authors report a case of multicentric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in which all 4 tumor foci were resected and evaluated using both comparative genomic hybridization array and RNA sequencing. Genetic analysis showed that the tumors shared a common origin, although each had its own unique set of genetic aberrations. The authors note that the genetic heterogeneity of multicentric GBM likely contributes to the failures of current treatments. The case underscores the necessity of increased genetic investigation.
