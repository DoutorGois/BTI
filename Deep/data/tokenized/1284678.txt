The neurotoxin, MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) induces a transient increase of mRNA for the immediate-early gene c-fos in the mouse brain. The c-fos mRNA level is MPTP dose-dependent and is evident in all brain regions tested including striatum, hypothalamus, cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and midbrain. There are regional differences in the time-course for the rise of c-fos mRNA. Pretreatment with deprenyl, a selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, pargyline, a nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or mazindol, a dopamine uptake transport inhibitor, does not prevent the c-fos mRNA increase, suggesting that the elevation is due to the action of MPTP and not its neurotoxic metabolite MPP+.
