The distribution of the limbic system-associated membrane protein in the amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation of cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) was studied with immunohistochemical procedures. A highly complex and heterogeneous staining pattern is encountered in the macaque amygdala. The basal, lateral, and accessory basal nuclei display the most intense immunostaining with local heterogeneities. The lateral division of the central nucleus also stains intensely, whereas the medial division of the central nucleus and the medial nucleus are more weakly stained. The dorsal division of the bed nucleus-amygdala continuum (extended amygdala) is strongly immunoreactive. The hippocampus displays the strongest immunoreactivity encountered so far in the primate brain. The intensity of the immunostaining is highest in the cornu Ammonis (Ammon's horn; CA1-CA3 fields) and gradually decreases toward the dentate gyrus or the subicular area. In the hippocampus proper, the stratum radiatum, the pyramidal layer, the stratum oriens, and the alveus all display intense immunoreactivity. The immunostaining is much less prominent in the dentate gyrus, whose granule cell layer is completely devoid of labeling. In the subicular area, there is a lateromedial decreasing gradient in immunostaining intensity, the subiculum being moderately stained and the parasubiculum weakly stained. These results reveal that the limbic system-associated membrane protein labels structures that form the core of the limbic system in primates. Within each of these structures, however, the labeling is highly heterogeneous and appears to be confined to specific functional domains.
