Recent research has identified in central nervous system neurons the expression of two enzymes from the inflammatory pathway of the metabolism of arachidonic acid, the 5-lipoxygenase (5LOX) and the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2). Expression of both enzymes appears to be upregulated during aging; upregulated 5LOX/COX2 expression in neurons may be responsible for the increased neuronal vulnerability to degeneration. Involvement of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate in aging-associated neurodegeneration has also been suggested. Stimulation of glutamate receptors by kainic acid (kainate) has been shown independently to affect the brain expression of 5LOX or COX2. Using a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to measure the contents of mRNAs we found 3h after kainate injection (intraperitoneally; 10 mg/kg) increased mRNA levels of 5LOX and COX2, but not that of COX1 in the hippocampus of rats. Pretreatment with the COX2 inhibitor NS-398 (9 mg/kg, 1h prior to kainate) inhibited the kainate-stimulated increase of 5LOX and COX2 mRNA levels. Our results indicate that hippocampal expression of both 5LOX and COX2 increases rather promptly when glutamate receptors are stimulated by kainate. The mechanism of how NS-398 inhibits this action of kainate should be further investigated.
