The formation of spatial memories is believed to depend on long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses within the hippocampal network. In this issue of Neuron, Dragoi et al. demonstrate that LTP can cause changes in the hippocampal representation of space without disrupting network dynamics. These results help define the elusive relationship between cellular-level synaptic plasticity and systems-level neural coding.
