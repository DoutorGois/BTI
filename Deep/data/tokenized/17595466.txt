Intraperitoneal injection of para-chlorophenylanine (pCPA) (400 mg/rg) causes changes in the quantitative distribution of biogenic amines (BA), in olfactory bulbs, amygdaloid complex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of the rats. Following 18 hours after injection of pCPA content of serotonine (5-HT) in olfactory bulbs drops and noradrenaline (NA) - 5-HT ratio increases. Abrupt decrease of 5-HT in all the studied structures and increase of NA - 5-HT ratio was also observed 36 hours after the pCPA injection. After 54 hours the drug effect decreased and by 72 hours the ratio was balanced. The biochemical changes taking place 36 hours after the intraperitoneal injection of pCPA in olfactory bulbs and hypothalamus probably cause concentration and ratio changes of BA, within the limits of which rats display their aggressive behavior and become "killers".
