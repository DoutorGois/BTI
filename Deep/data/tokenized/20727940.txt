Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a common type of intractable epilepsy characterized by astroglial gliosis. The S100B was viewed as an astrocyte marker and experimental studies indicated that S100B might be involved in the pathophysiology of temporal lobe epilepsy. In this study, we measured plasma S100B levels by ELISA in 28 patients with MTLE and 28 healthy controls and found that patients showed significantly elevated S100B levels compared with healthy controls (P=0.018). Moreover, S100B levels were significantly higher in female patients than those in male patients (P=0.027). These results suggest that S100B may be a biomarker of MTLE.
