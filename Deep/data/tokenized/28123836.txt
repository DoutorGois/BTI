Ulinastatin [urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI)] plays an important role in the protection of organs against ischemic injury during severe inflammation. The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of UTI on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and protein expression of PIC receptors in the neocortex and hippocampus CA1 region of rats after transient global ischemia induced via cardiac arrest (CA). Specifcally, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were analyzed. CA was induced by asphyxia followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation in rats. ELISA and western blot analysis were employed to determine PICs and their receptors in the neocortex and hippocampus. Our results show that IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly elevated in the neocortex and hippocampal CA1 field after CA. This was accompanied with an increase in PIC receptors, namely IL-1R, IL-6R and TNFR1. Systemic injection of UTI attenuated the amplification of PIC signal pathways in these brain regions. UTI also improved the modified Neurological Severity Score and brain tissue edema in CA rats. Notably, UTI resulted in an increase in survival of CA rats as compared to CA rats without treatment. In conclusion, UTI plays a beneficial role in modulating transient global ischemia induced by CA by altering PIC signal mechanisms, but further studies are needed to draw more firm conclusions.
