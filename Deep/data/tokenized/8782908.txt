We investigated the role of the hippocampal cholinergic neurons during immobilization stress in rats using a microdialysis technique. Blood levels of glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine during immobilization stress were also determined. Acetylcholine release was initially increased by immobilization stress, then gradually decreased. Plasma level of epinephrine increased gradually and reached significance at 30 min after the start of immobilization and remained at the elevated level during immobilization. Plasma level of norepinephrine initially increased and reached significance at 30 min after the start of immobilization and remained at the elevated level during immobilization. Plasma level of glucose increased gradually and reached maximum and significance 45 min after the start of immobilization, then decreased. Fifteen min after immobilization, acetylcholine release increased again, while concentrations of epinephrine and norepinephrine were still elevated. Thus the response of acetylcholine and the other responses to immobilization stress were not parallel.
