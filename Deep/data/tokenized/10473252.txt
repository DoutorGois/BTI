We recently reported that the pretraining induction of long-term potentiation in the lateral septum by fimbrial tetanic stimulation altered contextual fear conditioning in mice. The aim of the present study was to examine at which stage of fear conditioning (i.e. either acquisition or expression) this impairment takes place. Mice implanted with stimulating electrodes in the fimbria and recording electrodes in the lateral septal were conditioned to acquire fear towards a novel context using a footshock procedure. Twenty-four hours after conditioning, animals were re-exposed to the conditioning environment and the level of freezing behavior served as the measure of conditioned fear. The level of fimbrial-lateral septal synaptic neurotransmission was manipulated using either fimbrial tetanic stimulation (which induced septal long-term potentiation) alone, or followed by fimbrial low-frequency stimulation producing depotentiation of the previously established long-term potentiation. The results showed that (i) septal long-term potentiation induced either prior to acquisition or only prior to retention testing impaired conditioned freezing; and (ii) the impairing effect of pretraining induction of long-term potentiation on conditioned freezing was not only abolished by fimbrial low-frequency stimulation administered prior to retention testing but actually produced enhanced conditioned freezing with respect to controls. These data suggest that the level of fimbrial-lateral septal synaptic neurotransmission may influence the expression, but not the acquisition, of contextual fear conditioning.
