The use of normobaric versus hyperbaric (>2 atm) oxygen in the treatment of carbon monoxide intoxication continues to be a matter of debate despite reports of increased efficacy with hyperbaric oxygen. When hyperbaric oxygen is used, immediate treatment is preferred for best results. The therapeutic window of time, however, is unknown. A patient presented with acute confusion and partial retrograde and total anterograde memory loss due to carbon monoxide poisoning. He was initially treated with normobaric oxygen and failed to show appreciable improvement. One month after carbon monoxide exposure the patient underwent treatment with hyperbaric oxygen and showed appreciable symptom relief confirmed by clinical findings and neuropsychological testing. This case shows that hyperbaric oxygen may be efficacious in the recovery of neuropsychiatric function up to 1 month after carbon monoxide induced brain injury.
