The effect of a model of depression using female rats on Na+, K+-ATPase activity in hippocampal synaptic plasma membranes was studied. In addition, the effect of further chronic treatment with fluoxetine on this enzyme activity was verified. Sweet food consumption was measured to evaluate the efficacy of this model in inducing a state of reduced response to rewarding stimili. After 40 days of mild stress, a reduction in sweet food ingestion was observed. Reduction of hippocampal Na+, K+-ATPase activity was also observed. Treatment with fluoxetine increased this enzyme activity and reversed the effect of stress. Chronic fluoxetine decreased the ingestion of sweet food in both groups. This result is in agreement with suggestions that reduction of Na+, K+-ATPase activity is a caracteristic of depressive disorders. Fluoxetine reversed this effect. Therefore it is possible that altered Na+, K+-ATPase activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression in patients.
