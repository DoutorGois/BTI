We sought to determine whether treatment with felbamate was capable to reduce the accumulation of putrescine induced by transient forebrain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil. Gerbils underwent 10 min ligation of common carotid arteries followed by recirculation. Immediately after the release of the arterial occlusion, felbamate (75 and 150 mg kg(-1) i.p.) was administered. Putrescine and polyamine levels were measured in hippocampus and striatum at 1, 8, 24 and 48 h after recirculation. Putrescine levels appeared enhanced already 8 h after the release of the arterial occlusion and kept increasing up to 48 h in the hippocampus and striatum. No significant changes in spermidine levels during recirculation were detected. Conversely, spermine appeared to decrease in the hippocampus while it did not show changes in the striatum. Felbamate significantly reduced the ischemia induced changes in putrescine brain content only at the dose of 150 mg kg(-1) i.p.
