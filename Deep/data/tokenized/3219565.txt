Rats treated with L-cocaine HCl exhibited an increase in hippocampal acetylcholine turnover, as measured by a mass fragmentographic technique. Furthermore, the ratio of hippocampal 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol to norepinephrine increased significantly. Possible mechanisms of the increased cholinergic activity are discussed.
