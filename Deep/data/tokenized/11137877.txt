Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with a progressive dementia, in addition to motor and behavioural deficits. Cognitive deterioration and motor impairments have been observed also in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected monkeys, an animal model for HIV infection. We found recently that choline acetyltransferase activity is markedly reduced in brains of SIV-infected monkeys. We report now that selegiline, completely restores the reduced choline acetyltransferase activity which encourages for a meaningful anti-dementia therapeutic strategy.
