Activity of CA1 neurons was recorded in rat hippocampal slices with a lidocaine-derived QX-572-filled micropipette. The QX compound abolished Na action potentials as reported earlier. In addition it reduced markedly the burst slow afterhyperpolarization seen in these neurons in response to a depolarizing current pulse. It also modified responses to neurotransmitter substances associated with changes in K currents, acetylcholine and serotonin. QX-filled micropipettes can therefore provide some insight into mechanisms of action of certain neurotransmitters in the brain but they cannot be used as selective blockers of Na currents.
