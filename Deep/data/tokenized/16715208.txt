Staurosporin, a specific inhibitor of PKC, is widely used in studies of signal transduction pathways. Previous studies have shown that staurosporin induces neurite outgrowth, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that staurosporin induces neurite outgrowth in HN33 hippocampal cells. Two other PKC inhibitors, Go 6976 (specific for alpha- and beta-isoforms) and rotterlin (a selective inhibitor of PKC delta), have no neuritogenic effect. In addition, staurosporin specifically increases ROS generation. NAC, which inhibits the generation of ROS, suppresses the staurosporin-induced neurite outgrowth in HN33 cells. Further, H(2)O(2) causes neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results confirm a neuritogenic effect of staurosporin and point to ROS as the signal mediator of staurosporin-induced neurite outgrowth in HN33 hippocampal cells.
