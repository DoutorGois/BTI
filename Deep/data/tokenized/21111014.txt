The purpose of this study was to develop tween 80 (T-80) coated polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) nanoparticles that can deliver estradiol to the brain upon oral administration. Estradiol containing nanoparticles were made by a single emulsion technique and T-80 coating was achieved by incubating the re-constituted nanoparticles at different concentrations of T-80. The process of T-80 coating on the nanoparticles was optimized and the pharmacokinetics of estradiol nanoparticles was studied as a function of T-80 coating. The nanoparticles were then evaluated in an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that mimics the postmenopausal conditions. The nanoparticles bound T-80 were found to proportionally increase from 9.72 +/- 1.07 mg to 63.84 +/- 3.59 mg with an increase in the initial concentration T-80 from 1% to 5% and were stable in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). Orally administered T-80 coated nanoparticles resulted in significantly higher brain estradiol levels after 24h (1.969 +/- 0.197 ng/g tissue) as compared to uncoated ones (1.105 +/- 0.136 ng/g tissue) at a dose of 0.2mg/rat, suggesting a significant role of surface coating. Moreover, these brain estradiol levels were almost similar to those obtained after administration of the same dose of drug suspension via 100% bioavailable intramuscular route (2.123 +/- 0.370 ng/g tissue), indicating the increased fraction of bioavailable drug reaching the brain when administered orally. Also, the nanoparticle treated group was successful in preventing the expression of amyloid beta-42 (Abeta42) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus region of brain. Together, the results indicate the potential of nanoparticles for oral delivery of estradiol to brain.
