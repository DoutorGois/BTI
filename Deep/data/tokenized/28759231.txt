Calpain overactivation has been implicated in a variety of pathological disorders including ischemia/reperfusion injury, cataract formation, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein we describe our efforts leading to the identification of ketoamide-based 2-(3-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)nicotinamides as potent and reversible inhibitors of calpain with high selectivity versus related cysteine protease cathepsins, other proteases, and receptors. Broad efficacy in a set of preclinical models relevant to AD suggests that inhibition of calpain represents an attractive approach with potential benefit for the treatment of AD.
