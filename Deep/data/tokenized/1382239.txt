It is now a recognized principle that various neuropeptides are neuronally co-localized with biogenic amine or aminoacid neurotransmitters. In the rat CNS it has previously been shown that TRH is co-localized with 5-HT (and also with substance P) in cell bodies of the posterior raphe that project to the spinal cord. Although TRH cell bodies are known to be widely distributed throughout the forebrain there is no other known co-localization with 5-HT. In this study we further specify the forebrain there is no other known co-localization with 5-HT. In this study we further specify the anatomical relationship of TRH with 5-HT by use of surgical and neurotoxic lesioning with reference to limbic forebrain regions wherein TRH is greatly increased following seizures. In groups of rats, the fimbria-fornix was lesioned alone, or combined with a lesion of the dorsal perforant path or the ventral perforant path. There was a sham lesioned control group. Additional groups were lesioned with 5,7 dihydroxytryptamine, 100 micrograms i.v.t., 45 min. after i.p. desipramine, 25 mg/kg. All rats were sacrificed three weeks after lesions. Indoleamines were determined by HPLC in left anterior cortex, left pyriform/olfactory cortex, left dorsal hippocampus and left ventral hippocampus. TRH was determined by specific RIA in the corresponding right brain regions. The modal n was 7 rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
