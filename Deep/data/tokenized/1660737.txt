The functional state of the angiotensin system (the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme--ACE) was studied in different rat brain regions during disturbance of the integrative activity of CNS after frontal lobectomy. The most prominent increase of the ACE activity (in four times) on the ninth day after lobectomy was detected in crown cortex and hippocamp. Considerable differences were discovered in striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus also. The variations of the ACE activity were not shown in the medulla oblongata and midbrain. It is possible to conclude, that ACE activity alternations have regional disposition and functional dependence.
