Post-mortem brain tissue from 7 patients who died with a diagnosis of senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) was compared with tissue obtained from 7 control patients at routine post mortem. A significant fall in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was apparent in the cerebral cortex of the SDAT cases which was maximal in the temporal lobe. The fall in ChAT activity was not accompanied by changes in cortical vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) measured by radioimmunoassay.
