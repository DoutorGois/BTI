Recent evidence has suggested a role for free radicals in tardive dyskinesia. We, therefore, investigated the effects of chronic administration of fluphenazine decanoate (FLU) and/or vitamin E (VIT E) on regional monoamine metabolism in rat brain. Chronic FLU caused significant increases in dopamine (DA) in nucleus accumbens and brainstem, significant decreases in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus and significant decreases in homovanillic acid (HVA) in nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen and brainstem. Coadministration of FLU and VIT E normalized HVA in caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens and brainstem as well as DOPAC in nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Chronic FLU caused significant increases in norepinephrine (NE) levels in all regions studied. VIT E attenuated FLU-induced increases in NE levels in nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Significant increases in serotonin (5-HT) levels occurred in nucleus accumbens and hippocampus whereas significant decreases in 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid (5-HIAA) occurred in all brain regions after chronic FLU. Coadministration of VIT E attenuated the changes observed in hippocampal 5-HIAA but potentiated the FLU-induced increases in 5-HT in this region. Our data suggest that VIT E can attenuate some of the FLU-induced changes in monoamine metabolism. Results are discussed in relation to possible involvement of free radicals in monoamine metabolism during chronic neuroleptic use.
