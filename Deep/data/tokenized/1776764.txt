Although there is no question that age-related alterations in neural function occur in the central nervous system (CNS) of mammals, these changes tend to be somewhat circumscribed rather than completely global, even in pathological conditions. Examples of this kind of specificity of functional neural change are drawn from experiments on the electrophysiology of the senescent rat hippocampus.
