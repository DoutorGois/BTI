An increase in intracellular calcium during cerebral ischemia has been proposed as a common final pathway underlying the events leading to neuronal death. Intracellular calcium has been measured with ion selective electrodes during energy deprivation (ED) in hippocampal slices and with fluorescent techniques in neuronal cultures. In the present study, we describe a novel method to visualize and quantify changes in intracellular calcium in brain slices using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). CA 1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices were filled by intracellular injection with a 1:2 mixture of the fluorescent dyes Fluo 3 and Fura Red. The neurons were then visualized using CLSM, and the ratio of the fluorescence from each probe used to quantify intracellular calcium concentrations before and during ED. The free intracellular calcium concentration was 60 nM prior to ED and increased to 24 microM during ED. These results demonstrates that CLSM and fluorescent probes can be used in functional neuronal networks in addition to cell cultures as previously described.
