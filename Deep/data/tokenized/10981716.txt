We describe a strategy for generating CNS and retina sub-region-specific mutations using the Cre/loxP system. Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the c-kit promoter were established. Functional Cre expression was predominantly found to be restricted to the CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus, the anterior region of the dentate gyrus, and to the ganglion cell layer of the retina.
