Twelve dogs that were necropsied after sudden unexpected death, sudden episodes of viciousness, or seizure disorder were found to have degeneration of the atrioventricular bundle of the heart. In addition, hypoxic-type degeneration was found in the hippocampus and the dorsal one-half of the midportion of the cerebral cortex of the dogs.
