Epilepsy is characterized by the occurrence of repetitive seizures and can greatly affect a patient's cognition, particularly in terms of learning and memory. Orexin-A is an excitatory neuropeptide produced by the lateral hypothalamus that has been shown to be involved in learning and memory. A reduction in the levels of orexin-A after seizures may underlie the learning and memory impairments induced by epilepsy. Thus, we used pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindled rats to investigate the effects of orexin-A on learning and memory and the involvement of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus in OX1R-mediated ERK1/2 activation. A Morris water maze test revealed reduced escape latencies, prolonged times in the target quadrant and an increased number of platform crossings in PTZ-kindled rats exposed to orexin-A. These ameliorating effects of orexin-A on spatial learning and memory were attenuated by the intracerebroventricular injection of the OX1R antagonist SB334867 or the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126. Further studies using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) revealed that orexin-A increased the number of BrdU-positive cells, doublecortin (DCX)/BrdU levels and the number of NeuN/BrdU double-positive nuclei in the dentate gyrus of PTZ-kindled rats. However, these effects were inhibited by treatment with SB334867 or U0126. Taken together, these data suggest that orexin-A attenuated the impairment of spatial learning and memory in PTZ-kindled rats and that this attenuation involved neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus via OX1R-mediated ERK1/2 activation.
