Higher expression of X-linked genes in females might contribute to brain sexual differentiation. Although X-inactivation is thought to balance gene dosage between the two sexes, some X-linked genes escape X inactivation and therefore are expressed from both X chromosomes in females. Eif2s3x encodes subunit three of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2, which regulates the rate of protein translation, and escapes X-inactivation in both humans and mice. By Northern blot analysis, we found Eif2s3x to be expressed higher in females than in males in developing and adult brains as well as adult liver. Gonadally intact XX mice had a higher level of Eif2s3x mRNA expression than XY mice regardless of whether they had testes or ovaries, suggesting that sexually dimorphic gene expression arises as a consequence of sex chromosome complement. In situ hybridization indicated that Eif2s3x mRNA was expressed preferentially in specific brain regions including the habenula, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. Females had significantly higher levels of Eif2s3x mRNA expression than males in cortex, hippocampus and paraventricular nucleus but not in the habenula. The effect of a sex difference in Eif2s3x transcription, however, could potentially be offset by the additional expression in male brains of its Y-linked homologue Eif2s3y which was found in similar brain regions. The sex difference in Eif2s3x transcript appears not to be preserved at the protein level, since no difference in the levels of Eif2s3 protein was found between (1) males and females (2) XX and XY mice, or (3) XO and XX females.
