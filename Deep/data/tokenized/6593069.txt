In rat hippocampal slices, carbachol and norepinephrine induce an accumulation of [3H]-inositol-1-phosphate which is markedly amplified in the presence of lithium. The tumor-promoting agents phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) and 4 beta phorbol, 12 beta-myristate, 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) have no effect on [3H] inositol-1-phosphate accumulation alone, but when preincubated with hippocampal slices significantly inhibit the accumulation of [3H]-inositol-1-phosphate induced by carbachol and norepinephrine. The IC50 values for PDB and PMA are 0.2 microM and 25 microM respectively. In contrast, the weak tumor promoting agents 4-O-methylphorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate (MPMA) and phorbol 13,20-diacetate (P 13,20 DA) only slightly attenuate the agonist-induced response at concentrations less than or equal to 100 microM, whereas 4 alpha-phorbol (4 alpha-PHR), a biologically inactive phorbol, has no effect. These data suggest that phorbol ester receptor-mediated events may be negatively coupled to agonist-induced phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis.
