1-[(3-chlorophenyl)phenylmethyl]urea--a compound possessing anticonvulsant activity, which has been selected by screening among 100 linear and cyclic urea derivatives, produces synchronization of spontaneous bioelectric activity, increased convulsion threshold in the motor cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and basolateral nuclei of amygdala, increased the index of low-frequency flicker acquisition, and reduced response to high-frequency oscillations in the visual cortex of rabbits. This compound also increased the extracellular content of sodium ions and reduced intracellular content of potassium ions in the motor cortex, dorsal hippocampus, and amygdala.
