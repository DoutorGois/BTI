Previous animal studies have linked white matter damage to certain schizophrenia-like behaviors in cuprizone (CPZ)-exposed mouse. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and oligodendrocyte loss coexist in the brain of such mice. The aim of this study was to examine effects of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on CPZ-induced behavioral changes and concurrent oligodendrocyte loss, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in these animals. Male C57BL/6 mice were given intraperitoneal saline or NAC at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks; animals were fed a CPZ-containing diet (0.2%, w/w) during days 5-14. During days 15-17, the mice were examined in open-field, social recognition, and Y-maze tests (1 test per day). Six mice in each group were then used for biochemical and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses, while the remaining animals were used for immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining. The mice exposed to CPZ for 10 days showed significantly lower spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, lower activity of total superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, but higher levels of malondialdehyde in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, elevated concentrations of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the brain regions mentioned above and caudate putamen, and a decreased number of mature oligodendrocytes, but increased number of microglia in all the brain regions examined. These changes, however, were not seen or effectively alleviated in NAC-treated mice at all three doses. These results demonstrate that NAC protected mature oligodendrocytes against the toxic effects of CPZ, likely via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions.
