OBJECTIVE: To investigate effects of Valeriana amurensis Smir. ex Kom. on the inflammation reaction of cortical neurons and hippocampus neuronsin in Alzheimer's disease model rat's brain. METHODS: The model of Alzheimer's disease was established with multiple factors and the expressions of iNOS, COX-2, IkappaB-alpha of cortical neurons and hippocampus neuronsin in Alzheimer's disease model rats' brain were observed by electron lens using immunohistochemistry method. RESULTS: The extracts of Valeriana amurensis could reduce the expressions of iNOS, COX-2 and IkappaB-alpha of cortical neurons and hippocampus neuronsin in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of 50% ethanol extracts of macroporous resin group were more significant than other groups. CONCLUSION: The 50% ethanol extract of macroporous resin group from Valeriana amurensis can improve the ability of spatial exploratory and effectively control the inflammation reaction, the mechanism maybe relevant to it's effect of decreasing the expressions of iNOS, COX-2 and IkappaB-alpha of cortical neurons and hippocampus neuronsin to inhibit the activity of glia cell and inflammatory injury of cortical neurons and hippocampus neuronsin in Alzheimer's disease model rat's brain.
