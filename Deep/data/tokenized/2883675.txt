Histamine, acting through H2 receptors, increases cAMP formation in homogenates of guinea pig hippocampus. The activities of two H2 antagonists, tiotidine and ICIA 5165, as inhibitors of the histamine-induced increase were investigated. ICIA 5165 and tiotidine were potent antagonists of histamine with a pKi of 8.0 and 7.6, respectively. Similarly, the positive chronotropic response of isolated guinea pig atria to histamine was antagonized by tiotidine and ICIA 5165 with a pKB of 7.8 and 7.9, respectively. These studies suggest that histamine H2 receptors in the CNS and atria are similar.
