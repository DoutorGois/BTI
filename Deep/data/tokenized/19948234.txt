The present study investigates the relationships between hippocampal corticosterone concentrations and memory retrieval performance in stress and non-stress conditions, in both young (6 month-old) and middle-aged (16 month-old) mice. For this purpose, the time-course evolution of stress-induced corticosterone rise in the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) was investigated in both young and middle-aged mice. In parallel, the evolution of memory retrieval patterns was assessed using a contextual serial discrimination task (CSD). Finally, metyrapone (corticosterone synthesis inhibitor) was administered in order to evaluate the stress-induced impact of corticosterone rise on contextual memory retrieval in middle-aged animals. Results showed that: (i) non-stressed middle-aged mice exhibited a memory retrieval pattern opposite to that of non-stressed young animals, but similar to that of stressed young mice; (ii) the impact of stress on memory performance was transient (90 min) in young, as compared to middle-aged mice (120 min); (iii) dHPC basal (non-stress) corticosterone level was significantly increased by ageing; (iv) acute stress induced a rapid (15 min) and transient (90 min) dHPC corticosterone rise in young mice, while exhibiting greater magnitude and duration (120 min) in middle-aged animals; and (v) both the stress-induced endocrinal and memory effects were blocked by metyrapone in young and middle-aged mice. Finally, to our knowledge, the present work is the first study to directly measure the corticosterone rise in the hippocampus following exposure to stress and to directly correlate the corticosterone changes in the hippocampus with memory performance in both young and middle-aged mice.
