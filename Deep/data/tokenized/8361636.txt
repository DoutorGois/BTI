Receptor autoradiography was used to quantify the number of dopamine D2 receptors labeled with [125I]epidepride in the medial temporal lobe of seven cases of Alzheimer's disease in comparison to eight cases of neurologically intact controls. The Alzheimer's disease cases showed the greatest losses of D2 receptors in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the smallest differences from controls in the perirhinal region and subiculum. The loss of D2 receptors in the hippocampus and amygdala of cases with Alzheimer's disease in concert with alterations in dopaminergic innervation could contribute to the clinical symptoms of this disorder.
