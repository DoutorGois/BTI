Neurotropin (Nippon Zoki Co, Ltd) effects on firing patterns of the CA 3 hippocampus neurons in rabbits under a 24-h food deprivation was studied. Neuronal firing was recorded in a state of hunger (40 neurons) and under neurotropin (27 neurons) injected through a catheter implanted into the lateral brain ventricles. Initially, in 20% of neurons histograms had a bimodal interspike interval distribution: 1.5-25 ms and 100-400 ms. Neurotropin (50 microliters) increased the baseline spike rate regularity of hippocampus neurons. Histograms had a monomodal interspike interval distribution. Neurotropin (70 microliters) inhibited firing patterns and histograms, had trimodal interspike interval distribution: 1.5-5 ms; 250-400 ms and 1000 ms. Thus, these data suggested the involvement of neuro-immuno-modulator mechanisms in organization of firing patterns in rabbits.
