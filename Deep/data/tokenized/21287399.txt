In the present study we investigate the effect of homocysteine on glutamate uptake, Na+,K+-ATPase, enzymatic antioxidant defenses, as well as reactive species levels in hippocampus of rats. The influence of vitamin C, a classic antioxidant, on the effects elicited by homocysteine was also tested. Results showed that chronic hyperhomocysteinemia decreased glutamate uptake and the activities of Na+,K+-ATPase, catalase and superoxide dismutase in hippocampus of rats. Reactive species levels were increased by chronic homocysteine administration. Concomitant administration of vitamin C significantly prevented these alterations caused by homocysteine. According to our results, it seems possible to suggest that the reduction in glutamate uptake and Na+,K+-ATPase activity may be mediated by oxidative stress, since vitamin C prevented these effects. We suggest that the administration of antioxidants should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to specific diet in homocystinuria.
