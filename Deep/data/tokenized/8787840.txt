The binding site for 1,4-benzodiazepines in the brain is part of the hetero-oligomeric gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex which regulates a chloride ion channel. The presence of the gamma 2 subunit in the complex is necessary for the binding of benzodiazepines to their binding site. This study demonstrates a reduction of benzodiazepine receptor radioligand binding by 43% compared to control following infusion of phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to gamma 2 subunit into rat hippocampus. Reduction of benzodiazepine binding sites was paralleled by a decrease in [35S]tert-butyl-bicyclo-phosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding (51%) and [3H]muscimol binding (37%), indicating a reduction in the number of GABAA receptors. Changed macroscopic appearance, reduced protein content and severe loss of neurones in antisense-treated hippocampi suggests that the reduced formation of GABAA receptors leads to neuronal cell death.
