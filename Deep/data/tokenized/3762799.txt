The results of anterior cingulate gyrus stimulation and cutting of the main cortical input to hippocampus (the entorhinal cortex) lead to the suggestion that the entorhinal cortex and the limbic thalamic nuclei are involved in the genesis of ventral hippocampus responses to anterior cingulate gyrus stimulation.
