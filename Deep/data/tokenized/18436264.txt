Peri-insular hemispherotomy is a surgical technique used in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy of hemispheric origin. It is based on the exposure of insula and semi-circular sulci, providing access to the lateral ventricle through a supra- and infra-insular window. From inside the ventricle, a parasagittal callosotomy is performed. The basal and medial portion of the frontal lobe is isolated. Projections to the anterior commissure are interrupted at the time of amygdala resection. The hippocampal tail and fimbria-fornix are disrupted posteriorly. We report our experience of 18 cases treated with this approach. More than half of them presented with congenital epilepsy. Neuronavigation was useful in precisely determining the center and extent of the craniotomy, as well as the direction of tractotomies and callosotomy, allowing minimal exposure and blood loss. Intra-operative monitoring by scalp EEG on the contralateral hemisphere was used to follow the progression of the number of interictal spikes during the disconnection procedure. Approximately 90% of patients were in Engel's Class I. We observed one case who presented with transient postoperative neurological deterioration probably due to CSF overdrainage and documented one case of incomplete disconnection in a patient presenting with hemimegalencephaly who needed a second operation. We observed a good correlation between a significant decrease in the number of spikes at the end of the procedure and seizure outcome. Peri-insular hemispherotomy provides a functional disconnection of the hemisphere with minimal resection of cerebral tissue. It is an efficient technique with a low complication rate. Intra-operative EEG monitoring might be used as a predictive factor of completeness of the disconnection and consequently, seizure outcome.
