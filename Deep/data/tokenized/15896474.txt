In the present study, we investigated the role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) and which types of neuronal cells contain CaMK II and phosphorylated CaMK II (p-CaMK II) in the CA3 hippocampal region of mice using confocal immunofluorescence study. KA increased the CaMK II, p-CaMK II, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and complement receptor type 3 (OX-42) immunoreactivities (IR) at 30 min after KA treatment in mouse hippocampal area. In studies, nevertheless KA-induced CaMK II is expressed in neurons or astrocytes or microglia, p-CaMK II is expressed only in neurons. Thus, our results suggest that the activated CaMK II in early time may be performed important roles only in neurons but not in the astrocytes and microglia.
