A monoclonal antibody specific for GluR5-7 (mAb-4F5) has been used to characterize the distribution of kainate class glutamate receptor subunits in monkey hippocampus. Immunolabeled neurons were present in all subfields of the hippocampus as well as the dentate gyrus and subiculum. Quantitative immunofluorescence analysis by confocal microscopy demonstrated differential levels of immunoreactivity such that the highest intensities were in neurons within CA1 and subiculum as compared with those within CA3 or dentate gyrus. The regional differences in levels of subunit immunoreactivity correlate with the relative vulnerability of hippocampal neurons in several neurodegenerative disorders.
