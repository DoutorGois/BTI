Synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) is ubiquitously expressed calcium sensor, involved in neuronal membrane trafficking. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that SYT7 interacts with Synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP). SYNCRIP is a component of mRNA granules, which are transported to dendrites and are prerequisite for synaptic plasticity. Given the potential significance of SYT7 regulation in processes of neurodegeneration, which are characterized by high level of synaptic vulnerability, we aimed to analyse and compare the distribution of SYT7 and SYNCRIP proteins in the adult rat striatum, hippocampus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex. We investigated the degree of SYT7-SYNCRIP co-localization in order to examine possible functional interaction of these two proteins. We found that SYT7 is abundantly distributed in neuropil of all examined anatomical areas of the brain, most prominently in axons. On the contrary, SYNCRIP had cytoplasmic somatodendritic pattern of expression, which was most prominent in the hippocampus and cerebellum. In the striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex SYT7 and SYNCRIP immunofluorescent signals were mutually excluded, thus diminishing the probability for their physiological interaction. In somata of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellar cortex, both SYT7 and SYNCRIP were expressed and partially co-localized suggesting possible functional connection between SYT7 and SYNCRIP proteins in Purkinje neurons.
