In order to test potential links with other stereospecific neurobiological effects of mianserin, the present study explored the stereospecificity for inhibition of depolarization-induced Ca2+ uptake by mianserin. Synaptosomes from rat hippocampus were incubated with 45Ca2+ in either resting or depolarizing (60 mM K+) choline medium, in the absence or presence (0.6-200 microM) of a mianserin enantiomer. The enantiomers were equipotent (IC50 approximating 50 microM) at inhibiting net depolarization-induced Ca2+ uptake. This finding, therefore, cannot help to explain the stereoselective enhancement of noradrenaline release by S(+)-mianserin; it is also not in keeping with the stereospecificity exhibited by mianserin in acute tests predictive of antidepressant activity, thus suggesting that the calcium-channel blocking activity of mianserin is not linked to its antidepressant effect.
