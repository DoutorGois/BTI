From pharmacological studies, platelet-activating factor (PAF) has been proposed as a retrograde messenger for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region. We re-examined a possible contribution of PAF to LTP with a more specific approach using mice deficient in the PAF receptor. The PAF receptor-deficient mice exhibited normal LTP and showed no obvious abnormality in excitatory synaptic transmission. We also performed pharmacological experiments on the wild-type mice. Two structurally different antagonists of PAF receptors had no effects on LTP. Furthermore, the application of PAF itself caused no detectable changes in excitatory synaptic transmission. Thus, we conclude that the PAF receptor is not required for LTP in the CA1 region. Introduction
