The present study attempts to determine which mechanisms underlie the retrograde facilitation of memory induced by microinjection hippocampal melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) on the inhibitory avoidance paradigm. Previous reports using this test on the hippocampus suggest that NMDA receptor-mediated mechanisms are involved in memory processing and are also necessary for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In addition, alterations in expression of synaptic NMDA subunits in the hippocampus have been associated with memory formation of an inhibitory avoidance task. We have studied the effects of the neuropeptide upon the electrophysiological parameters using hippocampal slices from rats injected with the peptide and tested in step-down tests as well as possible changes in the mRNA expression of NMDA receptor subunits. We postulate that the increased facility to induce LTP, and the overexpression of this N-methyl-D-aspartate mRNA receptor subunits induced by MCH, could be behind the retrograde facilitation observed after MCH hippocampal microinjection.
