An important factor in the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) is the tetanization paradigm. This paper presents the changes associated with the induction and maintenance of hippocampal LTP in the freely moving adult male rat, subjected to three different tetanization paradigms. These results indicate that specific LTP measures including (1) synaptic activation, as measured by the slope of the dentate granule cell population excitatory postsynaptic potential, and (2) cellular response, as measured by the dentate population spike amplitude, evoked by single-pulse stimulation of the medial perforant pathway are dependent on the interburst interval of the bursting paradigm commonly used in LTP studies.
