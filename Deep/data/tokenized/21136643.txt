Information about estrous cycle (EC) and sex-dependent protein levels is limited. Cognitive functions vary over the EC and the aim of this study was to investigate rat protein fluctuations in the hippocampus, the main cognitive brain area for learning and memory, in the individual phases of the EC and in males and indeed protein fluctuations may reflect functional variation over the EC. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the studies and estrous phases were determined. Hippocampi were taken, proteins extracted, run on 2-DE, and identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF and nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS; protein levels were quantified using Proteomweaver software. Levels of protein synthetic machinery components transcriptional activator protein PUR(alpha,beta), elongation factor 2, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, chaperones 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, Hsp 105, stress-70 protein, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, prefoldin subunit 2, T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha and subunit delta, and degradation principle proteasome subunit alpha type 1 and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase isozyme L1, were different between sex and phase of the EC. We suggest that differences in the protein synthetic, chaperoning, and degradation machinery indicate different function in the individual EC phases. Results herein are relevant for further design of studies in the hippocampus at the protein level and interpretation of previous studies because EC phases will have to be respected and taken into account.
