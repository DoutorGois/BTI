SUMMARY: The output of an artificial neural network of spiking neurons linked by glutamatergic synapses subject to use-dependent depression was compared with physiologic data obtained from rat hippocampal area CA3 in vitro. The authors evaluated how network burst initiation and termination was affected by activity-dependent depression and recovery under a variety of experimental conditions including neuronal membrane depolarization, altered glutamate release probability, the strength of synaptic inhibition, and long-term potentiation and long-term depression of recurrent glutamatergic synapses. The results of computational experiments agreed with the in vitro data and support the idea that synaptic properties, including activity-dependent depression and recovery, play important roles in the timing and duration of spontaneous bursts of network activity. This validated network model is useful for experiments that are not feasible in vitro, and makes possible the investigation of two-dimensional aspects of burst propagation and termination.
