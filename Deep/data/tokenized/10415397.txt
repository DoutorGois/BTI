The regional distribution of a novel Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK-VI) was examined in the adult rat brain by in situ hybridization. High levels of CaMK-VI mRNA were detected in the hippocampus, piriform cortex and habenula, moderate levels in different thalamic nuclei and cerebral cortex, and low levels in the frontal and parietal cortex. This discrete distribution pattern suggests an important role for CaMK-VI in limbic brain regions.
