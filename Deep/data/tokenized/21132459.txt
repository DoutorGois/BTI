Omi/HtrA2 is a pro-apoptotic mitochondrial serine protease involved in caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent cell death upon various brain injuries. However, the role of Omi/HtrA2 in neuronal death induced by status epilepticus (SE) in the immature brain has not been reported. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of serine protease Omi/HtrA2, its substrate X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and the caspase-3 activation to damage of hippocamplal CA1 cells following lithium-pilocarpine SE in P14 rat pups. Status epilepticus in the immature brain significantly induced translocation of Omi/HtrA2 from mitochondria into the cytosol, increased cytosolic accumulation of Omi/HtrA2, induced appearance of XIAP-breakdown products and enhanced caspase-3 activity in the selectively vulnerable hippocampal CA1-subfield. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that SE in the immature brain results in Omi/HtrA2 accumulation in the cytosol, where it probably promotes neuronal death by neutralizing and cleaving XIAP, one of the most potent endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis.
