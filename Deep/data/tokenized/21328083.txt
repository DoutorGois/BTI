The present study examined the relationship between entorhinal cortex and hippocampal volume with fMRI activation during episodic memory function in elderly controls with no cognitive impairment and individuals with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Both groups displayed limited evidence for a relationship between hippocampal volume and fMRI activation. Smaller right entorhinal cortex volume was correlated with reduced activation in left and right medial frontal cortex (BA 8) during incidental encoding for both aMCI and elderly controls. However, during recognition, smaller left entorhinal cortex volume correlated with reduced activation in right BA 8 for the control group, but greater activation for the aMCI group. There was no significant relationship between entorhinal cortex volume and activation during intentional encoding in either group. The recognition-related dissociation in structure/function relationships in aMCI paralleled our behavioral findings, where individuals with aMCI displayed poorer performance relative to controls during recognition, but not encoding. Taken together, these results suggest that the relationship between entorhinal cortex volume and fMRI activation during episodic memory function is altered in individuals with aMCI.
