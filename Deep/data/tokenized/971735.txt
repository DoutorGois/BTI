Using radio-immuno assays for prostaglandins and prostaglandin metabolites, three prostaglandin metabolizing enzymes were found in the 100,000 X g supernatant of rat brain, 15-hydroxy-prostaglandin-dehydrogenase, delta13-reductase and prostaglandin E-9-keto-reductase. Specific activity of the latter enzyme was highest in striatum and midbrain and lowest in cortex, cerebellum and spinal cord.
