Influence of aluminum little concentrations on rats CNS was carry out in chronic experiments. The increase of beta1- and beta2-power density in visual and sensomotor cortex, hippocampus and n. caudatus EEG during slow wave sleep has been shown after single intramuscular injection of AlCl3 in doses 50, 5 and 3 mg/kg. Such effect was not observed after single injection of the agent (1 mg/kg) as well as after its chronic (10 day) application. The minimal toxic dose was 400 mg/kg. Obtained data shown significant difference between minimal effective and minimal toxic doses of AlCl3. It allow us to conclude, that aluminum salts have the small danger of human health.
