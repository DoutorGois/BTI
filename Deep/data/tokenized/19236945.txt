Hippocampal sclerosis in adults and focal cortical dysplasia in children with epilepsy are frequent lesions, but they are overlooked on standard MRI. Errors in the interpretation of MRI in epilepsy can be attributed mainly to poor technique and perceptual misses, but incomplete knowledge and poor judgment are also possible sources. This review covers what to expect in structural MRI of an adult patient with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and how to find hippocampal sclerosis (HS). It also covers the clinical MRI-based detection of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) in extratemporal lobe epilepsy, mainly in children. In a stepwise approach, first, a typical epilepsy MRI protocol at 1.5 T includes axial and coronal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, T2- and T2 *-weighted images, and a T1-weighted, three-dimensional volume acquisition. Advanced MR techniques (quantitation, new contrasts like diffusion, MR spectroscopy, high-contrast high-resolution imaging on high-field MR scanners > or = 3 T) are used to increase the method's sensitivity to detect a lesion in an individual patient. Exploiting increased sensitivity, we can avoid false-positive results in the light of a clinical hypothesis, possibly isolating a localized brain area by seizure semiology and EEG prior to MR reading.
