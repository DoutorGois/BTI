The dynamic of structural and ultrastructural changes of CA1 area of the hippocampus was examined in rats after 10 or 15 min of global ischemia (4 vessels occlusion, 4VO) followed by reperfusion. In the early period of reperfusion (15 min, 2 h), the structural changes in synaptic terminals were observed, without any significant signs of neuronal damage. These changes consisted in (i) the increase of the relative number of perforated and multiple synapses, and (ii) the synaptic vesicles rearrangement. Clear neuronal damage appeared morphologically at 24 h, and then developed for 3-6 days and resulted in the delayed damage and death of the hippocampal neurons.
