We report two cases of thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) with detailed neuropathologic evaluation. One case was representative of TD type I and the other TD type II. The case with TD type I showed macrocephaly, narrow thoracic cage, pulmonary hypoplasia and bowed limbs. Radiological study showed flat vertebral bodies, short curved appendicular skeleton and flaring of metaphyses. The other case (TD type 2) showed macrocephaly, cleft palate, short limbs and cloverleaf skull. Radiological findings were generalized platyspondy with excessive intervertebral disc space heights and a large head. Microscopic examination of both cases revealed temporal lobe polymicrogyria, abnormalities of the hippocampus and heterotopic neuroglial tissue within the meninges. There were no noticeable differences in CNS abnormalities between TD type I and II.
