Transient forebrain ischemia in rats preferentially causes neuron death in the striatum and hippocampal CA1 area. Prior injection of a low dose (1 microl) of colchicine (1 microM) into the unilateral hippocampus prevented ischemic damage of CA1 neurons in both hippocampal hemispheres, whereas no protection against ischemic damage was seen in the striatum. These results suggest that disconnection of hippocampal neurons by blockade of axoplasmic transport with colchicine specifically protects ischemic damage of CA1 neurons.
