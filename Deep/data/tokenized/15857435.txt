PURPOSE: Seizures induce progressive morphologic and functional changes in particular in the hippocampus, but whether and at what stage the hippocampus is affected in children with focal, temporal, nonintractable epilepsy is poorly known. We have now studied eventual metabolic and volume changes in the hippocampus of children with nonsymptomatic focal epilepsy taking antiepileptic medication (AEDs) but still having infrequent seizures. METHODS: Quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)HMRS) and volumetric MRI were used to study the hippocampal region of 11 pediatric outpatients (age 10 to 17 years) with cryptogenic localization-related epilepsy, and eight healthy volunteers (age 9 to 16 years) served as controls. The spectra were obtained bilaterally from the hippocampi by using the 1.5-T MR imager. The spectral resonance lines of N-acetyl group (NA), creatine and phosphocreatine group (Cr), choline-containing compounds (Cho), and myoinositol (mI) were analyzed quantitatively. The volume of the hippocampus was semiautomatically calculated. RESULTS: The mean concentration of NA was significantly decreased both in the focus side (9.02 +/- 2.00 mM) and in the nonfocus side (8.88 +/- 2.09 mM) of the patients compared with the controls (10.76 +/- 1.86 mM), in particular if the children had a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The mean concentrations of Cho, Cr, and mI did not differ significantly between the patients and controls. Moreover, the mean hippocampal volume of the focus side of patients was significantly reduced compared with that of the controls. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic changes in hippocampi were detected in children with nonsymptomatic localization-related epilepsy and infrequent seizures. Reduced NA could reflect neuronal metabolic dysfunction and/or neuronal damage, as indicated by our volumetric findings.
