The nootropic agents pyracetam, ethymisole, N-5-oxynicotinoyl glutamate and beta-carboline derivative--ambocarb--enhance short-term potentiation of populational EPSP's amplitude of area CA1 pyramidal neurons in the slices of the rat hippocampus, which is evoked by NMDA. The inhibitors of protein kinases diminish the effect of pyracetam and ethymisole (tolbutamide), as well as all the studied nootropic drugs (polymyxin B and trifluoroperazine).
