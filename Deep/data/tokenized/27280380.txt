We describe the synthesis of gramine derivatives and their pharmacological evaluation as multipotent drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. An innovative multitarget approach is presented, targeting both voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, classically studied for neurodegenerative diseases, and Ser/Thr phosphatases, which have been marginally aimed, even despite their key role in protein tau dephosphorylation. Twenty-five compounds were synthesized, and mostly their neuroprotective profile exceeded that offered by the head compound gramine. In general, these compounds reduced the entry of Ca(2+) through VGCC, as measured by Fluo-4/AM and patch clamp techniques, and protected in Ca(2+) overload-induced models of neurotoxicity, like glutamate or veratridine exposures. Furthermore, we hypothesize that these compounds decrease tau hyperphosphorylation based on the maintenance of the Ser/Thr phosphatase activity and their neuroprotection against the damage caused by okadaic acid. Hence, we propose this multitarget approach as a new and promising strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
