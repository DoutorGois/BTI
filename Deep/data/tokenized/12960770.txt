Limbic event-related potentials related to verbal but not to visual recognition memory have been found to be attenuated within the epileptic hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To identify hippocampal contributions to visual processing and memory we recorded intracranial ERPs directly from within the epileptic and the non-epileptic hippocampus in 12 patients with unilateral TLE during a visual object decision and naming task. While the non-epileptic hippocampus differentiated reliably between real and nonsense objects, this effect was completely eliminated within the epileptic mesial temporal lobe. This finding suggests that the hippocampus proper contributes to the semantic processing of visual objects and may help to explain visual memory deficits in TLE.
