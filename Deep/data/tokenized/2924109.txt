Stimulation of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis by norepinephrine or 5-hydroxytryptamine was reduced in hippocampal or cortical slices from rats repeatedly injected with (Asu1.7)eel-calcitonin (2.5 IU/kg i.p.). This effect was specific, as the basal or carbamylcholine-stimulated inositol phospholipid hydrolysis was unchanged in slices from calcitonin-injected animals. The reduced responsiveness to norepinephrine did not reflect a decreased number or affinity of alpha 1-adrenergic recognition sites, suggesting that calcitonin treatment leads to a reduced coupling between alpha 1-adrenoceptors and phospholipase C.
