1. Brofaromine (CGP 11,305 A) belongs to a new generation of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. These compounds induce short, reversible and selective inhibition of brain MAO of type A. 2. The aim of this work is to study monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activities of several rat brain regions after increasing doses of brofaromine. 3. Brofaromine inhibits MAO-A activities in a dose dependent manner in all brain regions examined. 4. The largest reduction was found in hippocampal formation, striatum and prefrontal cortex respectively. ID50 is 2 times lower in hippocampus than in remaining brain. 5. Brofaromine does not inhibit MAO-B activities in the different regions examined. 6. Brofaromine is a very selective inhibitor of rat brain MAO-A with a preferential action on telencephalic monoaminergic nerve terminals.
