Focal epilepsies of the mesial temporal lobe are often associated with a hippocampal sclerosis. Changes in Cl homeostasis and GABAergic signalling in downstream regions, may contribute to the human pathology. A review of changes in cellular and synaptic function and connectivity after de-afferentation suggests this epileptic syndrome may involve a pathological replay of developmental mechanisms.
