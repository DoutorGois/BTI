The growth-associated protein B-50 also termed GAP-43, F1, pp46, P-57 and neuromodulin is a nervous tissue-specific protein kinase C (PKC) substrate that is considered to play a major role in neurite formation, regeneration, and neuroplasticity. We describe the isolation of seven mouse monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) directed against B-50. The Mabs are produced against the bovine B-50, selected by ELISA for cross-reactivity with its human counterpart, and evaluated on Western blots in comparison with the well-characterized affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to rat-B-50. The Western blots show that the Mabs NM1, NM4, and NM6 recognize specifically the B-50 of bovine, human, and rat brain extract and the purified PKC phosphorylated and unphosphorylated rat B-50 isoforms. The Mabs NM2 and NM3 cross-react with bovine B-50 immunoreactive c-kinase substrate (BICKS), a protein sharing a 17 amino acid sequence homology with B-50. Two Mabs are useful for the detection of B-50 immunoreactivity in formalin-fixed human and rat brain tissues. In human specimen of the hippocampus, a characteristic neuropil distribution of B-50 is detected by the Mabs. In human muscle, Mabs reveal B-50 in nerve bundles and in axons at motor end plates. Thus, these Mabs are useful in investigating the function and localization of the B-50 protein.
