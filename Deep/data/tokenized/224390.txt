In experiments on rats the effect of electric coagulation of the tonsil and hippocamp on the functional activity of the pituitary-adrenal axis was studied. The weight of the adenohypophysis after the coagulation of the medial or lateral tonsils proved to decrease; the ACTH content in the hypophysis and the cortocosteroid level in the peripheral blood plasma diminished, and the compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining adrenal gland was intensified in rats with destroyed medial tonsil. The dorsal hippocamp coagulation was accompanied by a decrease in the adenohypophysis ACTH content, and the ventral hippocamp destruction led to reduction of corticosteroid secretion into the adrenal vein; in both cases the reaction to the irritation was potentiated. It was concluded that different parts of the tonsil and hippocamp influenced the pituitary-adrenal function unequally.
