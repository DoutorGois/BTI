Two experiments are described in which groups of rats with bilateral hippocampal lesions, cortical lesions, and operated controls are compared on tests of discrimination learning, retention, and reversal learning. Experiment 1 examined the effects of varying prior training and context on new learning. Experiment 2 used a transfer paradigm to compare extent of original learning by hippocampal and control groups in a discrimination task involving multiple discriminanada . The major findings were that rats with hippocampal damage were less efficient at processing information and were more constrained by contextual influences than control rats.
