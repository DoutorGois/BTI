PEBP2 beta/Cbf beta is the beta subunit of PEBP2/Cbf, which has been demonstrated to have important biological activities in hematopoiesis and osteogenesis. However, PEBP2 beta is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting that PEBP2 has other additionally important physiological activities. In an effort to elucidate other possible functions for PEBP2, we have isolated a novel gene that encodes a PEBP2 beta-interacting protein from a mouse cDNA library. We have called this gene Crl-1 for charged amino acid rich leucine zipper-1 (Crl-1) because it is rich in charged amino acids and contains a putative leucine zipper region. Expression studies in a 17.5 days post-coitum mouse embryo demonstrated Crl-1 expression mainly in the olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex. Post-natally, Crl-1 expression was additionally observed in the cerebellar cortex with strong expression in the hippocampus. These findings show that this novel PEBP2 beta-interacting protein is expressed mainly in subsets of neuronal cells, suggesting that Crl-1 plays some role in the developing mouse brain.
