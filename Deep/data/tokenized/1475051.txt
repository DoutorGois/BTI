We tested in rat hippocampal slices whether kindling causes sprouting of mossy fibers thereby augmenting excitatory coupling and epileptogenicity. Field potentials (fp's) evoked by orthodromic stimulation of the medial perforant path (MPP) and antidromic stimulation of mossy fibers in slices from control, amygdala kindled (AK) and beta-carboline (FG 7142) kindled rats were recorded in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer. Orthodromic paired pulse inhibition was increased in both groups of kindled animals. In contrast, neither in normal medium nor under additional application of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline nor in Mg(2+)-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) there was evidence for an excitatory field EPSP component upon stimulation of mossy fibers in any of the investigated groups. The results indicate that functional mossy fiber sprouting does not occur as an obligatory step in the induction of kindling epilepsy.
