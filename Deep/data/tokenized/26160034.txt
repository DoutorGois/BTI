Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric condition defined as a "trauma and stress-related disorder". Dampened allopregnanolone biosynthesis has been implicated as a possible contributor to PTSD aetiology. Free and Easy Wanderer Plus (FEWP) is a traditional Chinese medicine previously shown to be effective in PTSD treatment. However, little is known about the role of allopregnanolone in the anti-PTSD effects of FEWP. To evaluate this, the single prolonged stress (SPS) model was used in the present study. SPS-induced rats were administered FEWP (at doses of 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg, p.o.) after induction of SPS from days 2 through 15. After exposure to SPS, behavioral assessments were determined, including the open-field test, the contextual fear paradigm, and the elevated plus-maze test. The experimental model rats were decapitated at the end of the behavioral tests and the level of allopregnanolone in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The behavioral deficits of the SPS-induced rats were significantly reversed by FEWP (at doses of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg, p.o.). The level of allopregnanolone was increased by administration of FEWP. In summary, this study indicated that the anti-PTSD effects of FEWP were associated with allopregnanolone biosynthesis.
