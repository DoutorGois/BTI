[3H]Paroxetine binding to particulate membrane from tissue, obtained at autopsy, from the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and caudate nucleus from subjects who had or had not had schizophrenia was measured. The density of [3H]paroxetine binding to membranes from subjects who had or had not had schizophrenia did not differ. Similarly, the affinity of [3H]paroxetine binding in the frontal cortex and caudate nucleus was not different. By contrast, the affinity of [3H]paroxetine binding to hippocampal membrane from subjects who had schizophrenia was significantly lower than the affinity of binding for the nonschizophrenic subjects (0.40 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.26 +/- 0.02; p < 0.05). As [3H]paroxetine binds to the serotonin transporter, these data suggest that the serotonin transporter is altered in the hippocampus in subjects with schizophrenia.
