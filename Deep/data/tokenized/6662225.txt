In acute experiments in unanesthetized immobilized cats, tonic relationships between the contralateral dorsal and ventral hippocampi were studied. The patterns of EEG activity were recorded before and after the alterations induced in the activating level of these structures. The data obtained during the repetitive stimulation of the midbrain RF together with the results of unilateral local application of procaine to different hippocampal areas, revealed the tonic inhibitory relationships between the opposite hippocampi. These data make evident that the dorsal and ventral hippocampi have different functional connections with the integrative brain mechanisms.
