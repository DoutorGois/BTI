The specific activities of NAD-linked isocitric dehydrogenase were determined in hypothalamus, cerebellum, pons and medulla, striatum, midbrain, and cerebral cortex (which included the hippocampus) of the female Wistar rat. In ageing the specific activities of this enzyme were decreased in all regions. Chronic treatment with manganese chloride from conception onwards for a period of over 2 years appeared to counteract there decreases during ageing. However, manganese had no apparent effect on the specific activities of this enzyme in different brain regions of 2-month-old animals.
