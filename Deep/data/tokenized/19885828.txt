Cells are continuously born and incorporated into the adult hippocampus (HP). Adult neurogenesis might act to increase the total number of cells or replace dead cells. Thus, neurogenesis might be a primary factor in augmenting, maintaining, or even recovering functions. In zebra finches, HP injury increases cell proliferation in the HP and stem cell rich subventricular zone (SVZ). It is unknown what effect injury has on a species dependent upon the HP for survival in the wild. In food-storing birds, recovery of caches is seasonal, necessary for survival, dependent upon the HP and is concomitant with a peak in HP neurogenesis. During the fall, food-storing black-capped chickadees (BCCs) and nonstoring dark-eyed juncos (DEJs) were captured and given a unilateral penetrating lesion to the HP one day later. On day 3, birds were injected with the mitotic marker 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and perfused on day 10. If unlesioned, more BrdU-labeled cells were observed in the HP and SVZ of BCCs compared to DEJs, indicating higher innate cell proliferation or incorporation in BCCs. If lesioned, BrdU-labeled cells increased in the injured HP of both species; however, lesions caused larger increases in DEJs. DEJs also showed increases in BrdU-labeled cells in the SVZ and contralateral HP. BCCs showed no such increases on day 10. Thus, during the fall food-storing season, storers showed suppressed injury-induced cell proliferation and/or reduced survival rates of these new cells compared to nonstorers. These species differences may provide a useful model for isolating factors involved in cellular responses following injury.
