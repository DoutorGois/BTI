Many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia has a major developmental component and that environmental factors that disrupt key stages of development, such as maternal stress during pregnancy as a result of infection or malnutrition, can increase the risk of developing schizophrenia in later life. This review examines how non-clinical neurodevelopmental models pertinent to schizophrenia have been evaluated for their ability to reproduce behavioural deficits related to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The more frequently used are the prenatal application of the mitotoxic agent methylazoxymethanol, prenatal immune challenge and the neonatal ventral hippocampus lesion model. In general they have been extensively evaluated in models considered relevant to positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In contrast, very few studies have examined tests related to negative symptoms and, when they have, it has almost exclusively been a social interaction model. Other aspects related to negative symptoms such as anhedonia, affective flattening and avolition have almost never been studied. Further studies examining other components of negative symptomatology are needed to more clearly associate these deficits with a schizophrenia-like profile as social withdrawal is a hallmark of many disorders. Although there are no truly effective treatments for negative symptoms, better characterisation with a broader range of drugs used in schizophrenia will be necessary to better evaluate the utility of these models. In summary, developmental models of schizophrenia have been extensively studied as models of positive symptoms but, given the unmet need in the clinic, the same effort now needs to be made with regard to negative symptoms.
