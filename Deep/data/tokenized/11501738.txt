The past three decades have seen tremendous growth in our understanding of the cerebral underpinnings of schizophrenia. including the neural correlates of the cognitive impairment seen in this syndrome. In this article we review the role that structural and functional neuroimaging has played in elucidating the cerebral basis for the declarative memory deficits associated with schizophrenia. Memory impairment in schizophrenia appears to involve abnormal connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and three regions important in normal learning and memory: the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum.
