Several forms of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) have been identified in the hippocampus. Although these LTDs differ in their methods of induction, it remains unclear whether they converge upon some final common mechanism(s) of expression. In the present paper we review critical aspects of heterosynaptic and homosynaptic LTD induction and consider those findings relevant to the expression of each. In addition, we suggest several experimental approaches which may be of benefit in addressing the commonality of LTD expression mechanisms.
