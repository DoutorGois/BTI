Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia; however, available treatments have had limited success. Therefore AD patients are in tremendous need of new pharmacological approaches that may delay or slow the progression of the disease. In addition to the classical neuropathological features, immunological and inflammatory processes are also involved in AD pathogenesis. Naturally occurring compounds, such as Mangifera indica Linn (MGF) extracts have previously been shown to significantly reduce peripheral inflammatory processes. In order to explore the role of MGF in AD central pathology, we have orally treated APP/PS1 mice for 22 weeks. While MGF did not affect amyloid pathology, tau hyperphosphorylation was significantly reduced in the cortex and hippocampus. Also, inflammatory processes, measured by microglia and astrocyte burdens, were diminished in MGF-treated mice. Moreover, neuronal morphological alterations, such as abnormal neurite curvature and dystrophies, highly increased in APP/PS1 mice, were significantly ameliorated by long-term MGF treatment. Reduction of all these pathological features were accompanied by compelling improvements of episodic and spatial memory in APP/PS1 mice treated with MGF. Altogether our data suggest that MGF may provide a useful tool to target different aspects of AD pathology and could lead to more effective future therapeutic or preventive strategies.
