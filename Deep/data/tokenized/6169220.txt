Explants of the ganglion trigeminale from chick embryos (PNS) and of the hippocampus from fetal rats (CNS) were cultivated in maximow chambers in the presence of synthetic substance P (SP). SP Stimulated the outgrowth of neuronal processes in PNS-culture. In SP-treated CNS cultures a stimulation was not observed. The density of SP-treated medio-dorsal neuroblasts decreased. The possible role of SP as a system in controlling in-vitro-processes of nerve fibre regeneration is discussed.
