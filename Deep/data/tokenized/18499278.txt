The current study reports the impact of different illumination conditions on exploratory activity following global ischemia in rats. Exploratory activity was tested at different post-ischemic intervals under bright (450 lux) or dim (40 lux) light exposure. A 30 min testing period performed 5 days post-reperfusion examined within-session open-field habituation in ischemic and sham-operated animals. Additional animals were tested in the open-field under the two illumination conditions for shorter 10 min tests on days 3, 6, and 9 following reperfusion. Our findings demonstrated illumination-related activity profile in the open-field in ischemic animals. While ischemic rats showed increased activity when tested under bright open-field illumination, reduced activity was observed under dim illumination as compared to sham-operated controls. Further, habituation deficits were not apparent in animals subjected to global ischemia under any illumination condition. Similar behavioral profiles and habituation were observed in ischemic animals when exposed to repetitive open-field tests at days 3, 6, and 9 following reperfusion. CA1 neuronal injury (approximately 75% as compared to sham rats) was comparable in all ischemic groups at day 12 following reperfusion. The present findings suggest that differences in initial behavioral reactivity of sham and ischemic rats to bright versus dimly lighted environments may contribute to differences in open-field exploration reported between these groups. They also challenge the notion that deficits in exploration in ischemic animals are mainly attributable to processes related to habituation, or that hyperactivity represents a reliable predictor of CA1 neuronal injury. These observations may help explain discrepant ischemia-induced behavioral effects reported in the open field.
