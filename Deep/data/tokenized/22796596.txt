Neonatal meningitis is an illness characterized by inflammation of the meninges and occurring within the birth and the first 28 days of life. Invasive infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, meningitis and sepsis, in neonate is associated with prolonged rupture of membranes; maternal colonization/illness, prematurity, high mortality and 50% of cases have some form of disability. For this purpose, we measured brain levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, CINC-1, oxidative damage, enzymatic defense activity and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in neonatal Wistar rats submitted to pneumococcal meningitis. The cytokines increased prior to the BBB breakdown and this breakdown occurred in the hippocampus at 18 h and in the cortex at 12h after pneumococcal meningitis induction. The time-dependent association between the complex interactions among cytokines, chemokine may be responsible for the BBB breakdown and neonatal pneumococcal severity.
