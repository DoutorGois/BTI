The intensity of cytochemical changes of nucleic acids and proteins of neurones in structures of the limbic circle was studied with the method of two-wave visible cytospectrophotometry and histoautoradiography at the early and late stages of conditioned defensive reflex formation. It was shown that at both stages there occurs an intensification (of different degree) of cytochemical changes level in all of the studied limbic structures. A the late stage of reflex elaboration, there is a redistribution of the level of cytochemical changes in the studied brain structures. It is concluded that a specific morphofunctional system of activated brain structures corresponds to each behavioural situation.
