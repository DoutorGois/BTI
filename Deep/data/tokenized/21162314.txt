AIM: To observe the effect of Xiaoyao Powder on the content changes of CRF mRNA in relative brain zone (hypothalamus, pituitary, hippocampus, cortex) in chronic restrained stress rats. METHODS: RT-PCR and graphic analysis methods were applied to test the content changes of CRF mRNA in relative brain zone. RESULTS: The CRF-1 gene expression in hypothalamus was modulated lower in stress group and the difference was significant when compared with control group (P < 0.01). The gene expression of CRF-1 in Xiaoyao Powder group was markedly modulated lower in hypothalamus, but it was markedly modulated higher in cortex as compared with control group (P < 0.01). The gene expression of CRF-2 in Xiaoyao Powder group was higher in hypothalamus than that in stress group (P < 0.01), and it was also higher in hippocampus as compared with that in control and stress group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 respectively). CONCLUSION: The modulation point of Xiaoyao Powder group on central neuropeptide of chronic restrained stress is respectively hypothalamus, pituitary, hippocampus and cortex. The modulating target is hypothalamus, the limbic system and the cortex center. It can be suggested that medicine of smoothing the liver simultaneously have poly-target and dual-modulating action and been involved in the integration function of nerve-endocrine-immune net.
