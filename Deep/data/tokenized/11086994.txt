Cysteine string proteins (CSPs) are secretory vesicle proteins bearing a "J domain" and a palmitoylated cysteine-rich "string" region that are critical for neurotransmitter release. The precise role of CSP in neurotransmission is controversial. Here, we demonstrate a novel interaction between CSP, receptor-coupled trimeric GTP binding proteins (G proteins), and N-type Ca2+ channels. G. subunits interact with the J domain of CSP in an ATP-dependent manner; in contrast, Gbetagamma subunits interact with the C terminus of CSP in both the presence and absence of ATP. The interaction of CSP with both G proteins and N-type Ca2+ channels results in a tonic G protein inhibition of the channels. In view of the crucial importance of N-type Ca2+ channels in presynaptic vesicle release, our data attribute a key role to CSP in the fine tuning of neurotransmission.
