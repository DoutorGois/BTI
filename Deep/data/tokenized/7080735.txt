On the whole brain of rabbits and surviving slices of the hippocamp of mice, studies have been made of the sensitivity and peculiarities of the reaction of hippocampal neurones to hydrocortison administration. In experiments on whole animals, the drug was applied to the hippocampal neurones by means of microionophoretic technique. In experiments with slices, the steroid hormone was injected with a special micropipette directly in to the chamber with the slice. It was shown that there are many nervous cells in the hippocamp which are sensitive to corticosteroids. Possible role of steroid hormones in neurochemical mechanisms of the hippocamp is discussed.
