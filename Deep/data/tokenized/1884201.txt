C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J-rd le Gus-sh mice, congenics at the rd locus, were compared with respect to number of granule cells and presumed pyramidal basket cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Number of both types of neurons were less in rd/rd mice than in +/-/+/- mice. The rd gene may be responsible.
