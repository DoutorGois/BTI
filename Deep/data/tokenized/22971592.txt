Sinapic acid (SA) is a phenylpropanoid compound with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities. The neuroprotective effects of SA in a mouse model of amyloid beta (Abeta)(1-42) protein-induced Alzheimer's disease (AD) were investigated. Mice received a bilateral injection of Abeta(1-42) protein into the hippocampus to verify the efficacy of SA. Mice were treated with SA (10mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 7days beginning immediately after Abeta(1-42) protein injection, and an acquisition trial of the passive avoidance task was conducted 1h after the last administration of SA. Retention trial was conducted 24h after the acquisition trial, and mice were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry immediately after the retention trial. SA rescued neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 region and also attenuated the increase of iNOS expression, glial cell activations and nitrotyrosine expressions induced by Abeta(1-42) protein. SA significantly attenuated memory impairment in the passive avoidance task. These results suggest that SA ameliorated Abeta(1-42) protein-related pathology including neuronal cell death and cognitive dysfunction via its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities, and may be an efficacious treatment for AD.
