Two isoforms of the enzyme heme oxygenase are expressed in distinct populations of neurons in the brain. These enzymes catalyse the oxidative cleavage of heme to the cellular antioxidant biliverdin resulting in the release of carbon monoxide in the process. Both heme and carbon monoxide may play important roles in regulating the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate signal transduction system. Thus we have examined the distributions of both isoforms of heme oxygenase in the rat brain, and compared their localizations with that of nitric oxide synthase determined with the NADPH-diaphorase histochemical technique. Heme oxygenase-1 is highly expressed in a few select populations of neurons including cells in the hilus of the dentate gyrus, in the hypothalamus, cerebellum and brainstem. This enzyme appears to be coexpressed with nitric oxide synthase only in a few cells in the dentate gyrus. Heme oxygenase-2 is much more widely expressed. It is present in mitral cells in the olfactory bulb, pyramidal cells in the cortex and hippocampus, granule cells in the dentate gyrus, many neurons in the thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum and caudal brainstem. However, only some of these labelled neurons also displayed nitric oxide synthase. Instead, many neurons expressing heme oxygenase-2 correspond to those known to express high levels of the hemoprotein soluble guanylyl cyclase. These results suggest that heme oxygenase may play a role in modulating guanylyl cyclase independent of nitric oxide synthase. This may result from regulation of intracellular heme and carbon monoxide levels by the heme oxygenase system.
