In order to determine the role of subregions of the hippocampus in spatial working memory, this study combined selective neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampal subregions with a simple delayed nonmatching-to-place task on a radial maze in rats. Lesions of the dentate gyrus or the CA3, but not the CA1, subregion of the hippocampus induced a deficit in the acquisition of the task with short-term delays (i.e., 10 sec) and impaired performance of the task in a novel environment. All subregional lesions produced sustained impairment in performing the task with intermediate-term delays (i.e., 5 min) when rats were tested in a familiar environment. The results suggest a dynamic interaction among the dorsal hippocampal subregions in processing spatial working memory, with the time window (i.e., delay) of a task recognized as an essential controlling factor.
