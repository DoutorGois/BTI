Various neurobiological studies of aging indicate that elevated levels of circulating glucocorticoids lead to hippocampal vulnerability to stress, though little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying stress vulnerability in the elderly. We have compared the gene expression profiles in the hippocampus of aged (20 months) and adult (3 months) rats in response to repeated variable stress (RVS) for 4 days, using a cDNA array technique and real-time quantitative PCR, to identify putative genes involved in the mechanism of stress vulnerability in the elderly. We found a significant decrease in the levels of amphiphysin 1 mRNA in aged rats subjected to RVS compared with treated and untreated adult rats or to untreated aged rats. Similarly, we found a significant decrease in hippocampal levels of amphiphysin 1 mRNA in aged rats subjected to RVS for 8 days, but not in those subjected to a single VS. These findings suggest that the decrease in the hippocampal levels of amphiphysin 1 mRNA in response to repeated stress may be involved in the stress vulnerability in the elderly, and may lead to the disturbance of learning and memory under stressful conditions in the elderly.
