Omegaconotoxin binding was studied in young (3 months) and old (24 months) male Sprague-Dawley rats. In both groups omegaconotoxin binding displayed high affinity, was specific and saturable. The age-related changes are mainly a decrease in the Bmax in striatum and cortex (-29% and -31%, respectively). Binding parameters were unmodified in hippocampus of the two age groups. These data are consistent with the decrease of calcium uptake and neurotransmitter release observed in the brain of aged rodents.
