Cyclosporine A is the major immunosuppressive agent used for organ transplantation and for the treatment of a variety of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. In this work, we investigated the effect of the cyclosporine A on the acetylcholinesterase activity in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum and pons of the rats experimentally demyelinated by ethidium bromide. Rats were divided into four groups: I control (injected with saline), II (treated with cyclosporine A), III (injected with 0.1% ethidium bromide) and IV (injected with 0.1% the ethidium bromide and treated with cyclosporine A). The results showed a significant inhibition (p<0.05) of acetylcholinesterase activity in the groups II, III and IV in all brain structures analyzed. In the striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and pons the inhibition was greater (p<0.005) when ethidium bromide was associated with cyclosporine A. In conclusion, the present investigation demonstrated that cyclosporine A is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase activity and this effect is increased after an event of toxic demyelination of the central nervous system.
