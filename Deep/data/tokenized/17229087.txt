The arachidonic acid-specific cytosolic phospholipase A(2) alpha (cPLA(2)alpha) has been implicated in the generation of neurological injuries. cPLA(2)alpha-dependent neurological injury has been postulated to be mediated through inflammatory and eicosanoid pathways. We determined if cPLA(2)alpha amplifies the injury of a non-inflammatory, excitotoxic stimulus by modifying a well-described toxicity assay to measure the toxicity of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in the CA1 region of organotypic, mouse hippocampal cultures. Hippocampal cultures from wild-type and cPLA(2)alpha knockout mice were exposed to 5, 7.5 or 10 microm NMDA for 1 h. Toxicity was measured 23 h later. Cultures derived from cPLA(2)alpha(-/-) mice and cultures treated with the selective inhibitor AACOCF(3) were significantly protected from NMDA toxicity, as compared with wild-type cultures. To determine if cPLA(2)alpha-dependent toxicity is cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 dependent, COX-2 and PGE(2) levels were measured 7 and 25 h after NMDA treatment. NMDA treatment failed to induce COX-2 protein or increase PGE(2) in the culture media in either genotype at either time. In contrast, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionophore treatment caused robust induction of COX-2 and PGE(2) in both genotypes. We conclude that cPLA(2)alpha may have a hitherto unrecognized direct effect on excitatory neurotoxicity, suggesting that cPLA(2)alpha inhibition is a therapeutic candidate for treatment of the early, excitotoxic injury observed in stroke.
