The pre- and postsynaptic electrophysiological consequences of a carrier-mediated, Na+ ion transport-coupled removal of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) from the relevant synaptic clefts are discussed. Assuming for the GABA internalization process a stoichiometry like GABAo + 3NA+o + K+i in equilibrium GABAi + 3Na+i + K+o and a synaptic cleft GABA maximal concentration of 100 microM we calculated the presynaptic depolarization associated with GABA removal between 11.5 and 38.2 mV. At the postsynaptic level the effect appears to be less marked.
