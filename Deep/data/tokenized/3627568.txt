Intracellular recordings were made from the CA1 stratum pyramidale region of rat hippocampal slices. Papain was applied to the cells via bath perfusion, and its effects on membrane properties, synaptic potentials and responses to pressure application of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were assessed. Papain did not markedly affect neuronal input resistance, resting potential or action potentials with treatment times lasting over one hour. Synaptic potentials were initially enhanced and then gradually abolished, with the fast inhibitory postsynaptic potential being the most sensitive and the late, potassium-dependent hyperpolarization being the most resistant to enzyme. Responses to GABA were enhanced by papain, the GABA-activated conductance increased, and a slow depolarizing wave appeared which resembled the effect caused by pentobarbital on these neurons. This study indicates that the use of papain in the acutely dissociated neuron preparation is not responsible for the dramatic increase in resting input resistance seen in these neurons. The GABA-activated conductance may be affected by the enzyme.
