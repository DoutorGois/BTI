A number of pharmacological, anatomical, and immunological studies have previously addressed the subtype identity of the hippocampal muscarinic pre-synaptic autoreceptor. A preponderance of findings indicate that it is of the M2 pharmacological type. Both the m2 and m4 molecular subtypes exhibit M2 pharmacology and there are few drugs that differentiate between these receptors. Pharmacological attempts at defining the hippocampal autoreceptor have yielded conflicting results. The basal forebrain is relatively enriched in m2 muscarinic receptor mRNA and protein, and lesions that denervate the hippocampus of its basal forebrain cholinergic input have shown a decrement in m2, but not m4, receptor protein in the hippocampus. Thus, the anatomical data obtained to date tend to support the view that the m2 subtype is expressed as the hippocampal autoreceptor. We have combined in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) with immunocytochemistry to choline acetyltransferase to examine whether mRNA for the m4 subtype of muscarinic receptor is expressed in central cholinergic neurons. The m4 muscarinic mRNA was found at moderate levels in all subdivisions of the cholinergic basal forebrain, including the medial septum/diagonal band complex (MS/DB). The m4 mRNA was also found in striatal cholinergic interneurons, in the cholinergic reticular core of the upper brainstem, and in brainstem cholinergic motor neurons. Muscarinic m4 receptor mRNA was also found in many non-cholinergic cells in the brain. For example, the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, dentate gyrus granule cells, and entorhinal cortical pyramidal neurons express relatively high levels of m4 mRNA, while in the brainstem the dorsal raphe and pontine reticular nuclei express relatively high levels of this mRNA. The finding of m4 mRNA in the MS/DB cholinergic neurons suggests that this receptor protein might be expressed as an autoreceptor in hippocampal cholinergic terminals.
