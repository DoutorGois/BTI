The electrophysiological effects of Boc-D-Asp-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-D-Lys-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2 (compound I) and Boc-gamma-D-Glu-Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-D-Lys-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2 (compound II), two cyclic cholecystokinin analogs with high selectivity for CCK-B receptors, as well as the effects of the linear enzyme-resistant analog Boc-[Nle28,Nle31]-CCK7 (BDNL), were compared with those of CCK8 using extracellular recordings in rat hippocampal slices in vitro. Bath applications of the three synthetic compounds resulted in concentration-dependent and reversible increases in single-unit activity. Comparison of equieffective concentrations yielded the following potency rank order: BDNL greater than CCK8 greater than compound II greater than compound I. There was a close correlation (r = .96, slope = 0.98) between the excitatory activities of the analogs and their potencies in displacing radiolabelled CCK8 from CCK-B receptors on rat brain membranes.
