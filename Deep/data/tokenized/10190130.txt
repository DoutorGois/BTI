The possible involvement of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) receptors in the function of the hippocampus and of pain transmission is discussed. Involvement of these receptors in the function of the hippocampus has been suggested by several reports. In the paper we presented the data that ATP inhibits the glutamate release in cultured hippocampal neurons. This and the report revealing that ATP protected against cell death by glutamate suggest that ATP may be playing a role in the protection of the hippocampus from over-stimulation. Microglia cells are activated by the stimulation of ATP and releases plasminogen which is well known to promote the development of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons and enhance neurite outgrowth from explants of neocortical tissue. Therefore, ATP may have a role in repairing the damaged neuronal networks as well as protection.
