This study examined whether pregnancy-related marginal vitamin A deficiency (MVAD) influences postnatal development of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 1 (NR1) in hippocampus of rat pups. Sixteen female rats were randomized equally into control and MVAD groups. Dams and pups were fed with either a normal control diet or one deficient in vitamin A. Eight female pups in each group were killed at 1 day, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after birth, respectively. Serum retinol levels were monitored. The messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions and subcellular localization of RARalpha, RARbeta and NR1 in postnatal hippocampus were detected. At 1 day, 2 weeks and 8 weeks after birth, serum retinol levels in the MVAD group were significantly lower than those in the control group. Results of Morris water maze test at 7 weeks of age showed that spatial learning and memory in the MVAD group were affected. Vitamin A deficiency resulted in decreased mRNA levels of RARalpha, RARbeta and NR1 (P<.05). The protein level of RARalpha and NR1 in the MVAD group was lower than that of the control group (P<.05). There was no significant difference in RARbeta between the groups (P>.05). A mass of RARalpha and NR1 colocalized in hippocampal cell cytoplasm on postnatal day 1. Our data suggested that vitamin A deficiency in pregnancy may affect the postnatal expression of RARalpha and NR1, affecting learning and memory function in the hippocampus and synaptic plasticity of the calcium signaling pathway.
