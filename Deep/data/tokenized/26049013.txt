Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which dysregulation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like ER-resident kinase (PERK) is considered to play a critical role. Allicin, a garlic extract, has been demonstrated a protective role in AD model. The present study was designed to investigate the possible protective effect of allicin on ER stress-induced cognitive deficits and underlying mechanisms in rats. In this study, 72h of lateral ventricular infusion of tunicamycin (TM), an ER stress stimulator, induced significant cognitive deficits. TM increased tau phosphorylation, Abeta42 deposit, and oxidative stress, and reduced antioxidative enzymes activity in the hippocampus. TM moderately elevated the expression of PERK and its downstream substrate nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) in the hippocampus. All these impaired changes by TM were significantly improved by allicin pretreatment. Allicin markedly increased PERK and Nrf2 expression in the hippocampus. Thus, our data demonstrate the protective role of allicin in ER stress-related cognitive deficits, and suggest that PERK/Nrf2 antioxidative signaling pathway underlies the action mechanism.
