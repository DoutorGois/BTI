Administration of dopamine agonist, apomorphine (2 mg/kg, s.c.), produces cage climbing behavior in mice that exhibit typical dopaminergic stimulation. The present study investigated the pCREB expression level in several brain regions following apomorphine treatment in order to determine whether the increased the dopaminergic activation produced by apomorphine accompanies the changes in pCREB immunoreactivity. A mouse brain was removed at 0 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 7 h, and 24 h after apomorphine treatment. The brain tissue was fixed by an intracardiac perfusion with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Immunohistochemical study was conducted using the ABC-DAB method. The data showed that the immunoreactivity of pCREB increased in the striatum, nucleus-accumbens, piriform cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of a mouse brain 30 min after the apomorphine treatment. Increased immunoreactivity began to diminish 2 h after the apomorphine treatment in all the brain regions measured. The time course for the pCREB immunoreactivity was similar to the behavioral response induced by the apomorphine treatment. These results suggest that activation of the dopamine receptor is accompanied by an increase in pCREB expression in the mouse brain.
