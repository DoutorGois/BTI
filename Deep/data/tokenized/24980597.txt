The hippocampus is an important brain region that is involved in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. Ionotropic glutamate receptors-namely,N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs), and kainic acid (KA) receptors (KARs)-are well known to be involved in these diseases by mediating long-term potentiation, excitotoxicity, or both. To predict the therapeutic efficacy and neuronal toxicity of drug candidates acting on these receptors, physiologically relevant systems for assaying brain region-specific human neural cells are necessary. Here, we characterized the functional differentiation of human fetal hippocampus-derived neural stem/progenitor cells-namely, HIP-009 cells. Calcium rise assay demonstrated that, after a 4-week differentiation, the cells responded to NMDA (EC50= 7.5 +/- 0.4 microM; n= 4), AMPA (EC50= 2.5 +/- 0.1 microM; n= 3), or KA (EC50= 33.5 +/- 1.1 microM; n= 3) in a concentration-dependent manner. An AMPA-evoked calcium rise was observed in the absence of the desensitization inhibitor cyclothiazide. In addition, the calcium rise induced by these agonists was inhibited by antagonists for each receptor-namely, MK-801 for NMDA stimulation (IC50= 0.6 +/- 0.1 microM; n= 4) and NBQX for AMPA and KA stimulation (IC50= 0.7 +/- 0.1 and 0.7 +/- 0.03 microM, respectively; n= 3). The gene expression profile of differentiated HIP-009 cells was distinct from that of undifferentiated cells and closely resembled that of the human adult hippocampus. Our results show that HIP-009 cells are a unique tool for obtaining human hippocampal neural cells and are applicable to systems for assay of ionotropic glutamate receptors as a physiologically relevant in vitro model.
