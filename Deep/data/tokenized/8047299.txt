The hypothesis that dopaminergic denervation is a factor in the development of hippocampal neurofibrillary tangles was tested in the rat with bilateral stereotaxic 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This led to the postsynaptic appearance of cytoplasmic immunoreactivity to ubiquitin in neurons of the dentate gyrus. An additional postsynaptic morphologic abnormality was seen when the animals were pretreated with the D1 dopaminergic antagonist SCH 23390 and the VTA lesions were combined with septal lesions affecting cholinergic and GABAergic neurons projecting to the dentate gyrus. These changes consisted of a loss of dendritic microtubule associated protein (MAP-2) and tau immunoreactivity and a prominence of remaining dendrites in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Additional investigation will be needed to determine if these transynaptic changes in dentate neurons, resulting from denervation, represent a precursor stage to neurofibrillary tangle development.
