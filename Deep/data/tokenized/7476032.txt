To investigate the molecular changes underlying kindling epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampus, the expression levels of the genes encoding for 13 different gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor (GABAAR) subunits were measured in hippocampal principal neurons using in situ hybridization techniques and semi-quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms. Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway kindled rats were investigated at three different stages of kindling acquisition, at 24 h after the last seizure and at long-term (28 days) after termination of kindling stimulations. Changes were distinct for the different subunits in the three analyzed regions (CA1, CA3, fascia dentata) and also different for the various kindling stages. In all hippocampal areas at the early phases of kindling epileptogenesis, before the appearance of generalized seizures, an increase was found of those transcripts that constituted the majority of the expressed variants in control animals (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2/gamma 2L mRNA). In these stages, the increased levels of different variants in the granular neurons of the fascia dentata were more pronounced when compared to the pattern of changes in pyramidal cells of CA1 and CA3. In fully kindled animals, the expression levels of several subunits returned to control levels, whereas beta 3 and gamma 2/gamma 2L mRNA expression was still significantly enhanced in all areas. At long-term, few changes were encountered. The long-splice variant of gamma 2 was decreased within pyramidal and granular neurons while the total level of gamma 2 mRNA was not different from controls. The increased GABAAR subunit expression in the fascia dentata may underly the reported increased GABAAR ligand binding and the increased GABA mediated inhibition. However, the decreased GABAAR binding and the attenuation of GABAergic inhibition in CA1, could not be explained by a decrement of receptor subunit expression.
