Discrete, transverse stereotaxic cuts in th forebrain of the anesthetized lactating rabbit caused spontaneous milk-ejection responses repeated at intervals of 1-5 min. The region of the brain in which cuts were effective included the diagonal band of Broca, the entire rostrocaudal extent of the dorsal medial septum, part of the cingulum and part of the hippocampal fimbria. It is proposed that severance of a septo-hippocampal patway frees the hippocampus from inhibition and allows oxytocin release to occur. It remains to be determined whether the hippocampus itself is directly responsible for periodic activation of neurosecretory cells.
