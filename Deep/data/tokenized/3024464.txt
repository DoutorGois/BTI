Here I have reviewed evidence from electron microscopic studies showing that each of several sustained limbic seizure syndromes is associated with a type of acute brain damage which is ultrastructurally indistinguishable from the brain damage induced by Glu and other excitotoxins. In addition, I have presented evidence that persistent stimulation of specific axonal tracts that use Glu as transmitter results in Glu-like excitotoxic degeneration of postsynaptic neurons innervated by such tracts. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which powerfully block the neurotoxicity of the Glu analog NMA, protect against seizure-related brain damage. This may be explained by either an anticonvulsant or antiexcitotoxic mechanism, or both. Recent evidence suggests that an excitotoxic mechanism (excessive activation of Glu/Asp receptors) may underlie both seizure-mediated and anoxic brain damage. The acute fulminating type of neuronal degeneration induced by Glu is a Na+ and Cl- but not Ca2+ dependent phenomenon. According to a recent study, however, Glu may induce neuronal necrosis not only by an acute Ca2+ independent process but by a more slowly evolving Ca2+ dependent process. If, as these data suggest, an excitotoxic mechanism underlies brain damage associated with anoxia and epilepsy, a better understanding of excitotoxic mechanisms may lead eventually to prophylactic approaches for preventing such forms of brain damage.
