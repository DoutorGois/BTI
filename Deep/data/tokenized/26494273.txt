Whereas hippocampal activity is thought to be driven by precise conjunctions of sensory input, a recent study by Villette and Malvache et al. (Villette et al., 2015, in this issue of Neuron) reveals that neurons imaged in a static sensory environment organize into sequences endowed with intrinsic spatiotemporal properties.
