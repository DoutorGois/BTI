The response of the hippocampal proteome to expression of mutant proteins present in familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was studied using transgenic rats. These animals carry both the amyloid precursor protein Swedish and 717 mutation (APP(SW+717)) as well as the presenilin 1 Finnish mutation (PS1(FINN)). This transgenic rat model displays intracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) in neurons of the neocortex and the hippocampus (CA2 and CA3). The hippocampus was selected as it is one of the first brain regions affected in AD and is involved in the processing of short-term memory and spatial memory. Applying a proteomic approach, we demonstrate that the expression of APP(SW+717) and PS1(FINN) transgenes causes changes in expression of hippocampal proteins, some of which have been previously linked to learning and memory formation. The protein alterations documented here occur in the absence of plaque formation and prior to the onset of cognitive deficits later observed in these transgenic rats. This indicates that molecular changes take place in the hippocampal neurons in response to expression of mutant proteins APP(SW+717) and PS1(FINN), which precede the occurrence of overt extracellular accumulation of extracellular amyloid. The implications of these findings on our understanding of the early stages of AD are discussed.
