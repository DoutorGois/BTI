1. The function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system in certain areas of the rat brain was investigated after baclofen treatment (30 mg/kg for 4 days). 2. Two h after the last dose of baclofen GAD activity was reduced in the hippocampus without changes in GABA levels. 24 h after baclofen, GAD activity was increased and the GABA content was decreased. 3. 48 h after the last dose both parameters returned to control values. 4. These results were not observed in any of the other areas investigated: frontal cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, olfactory bulbs, and medio basal hypothalamus. 5. In conclusion, the present study shows that baclofen 30 mg/kg for 4 days, induces an inhibitory action on hippocampus GABAergic neurones, which begins to disappear after 24 h free of drug.
