Brain edema formation is one of the most important mechanisms of ischemia-evoked cerebral edema. It has been demonstrated that arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of secondary brain damage after focal cerebral ischemia. In a well-characterized animal model of ischemic stroke of Mongolian gerbils, the present study was undertaken to clear the effect of AVP on cortex edema in cerebral ischemia. The results showed that (1) occluding the left carotid artery of Mongolian gerbils not only decreased the cortex specific gravity (cortex edema) but also increased AVP levels in the ipsilateral cortex (ischemic area) including left prefrontal lobe, left parietal lobe, left temporal lobe, left occipital lobe and left hippocampus for the first 6 hours, and did not change of the cortex specific gravity and AVP concentration in the right cortex (non-ischemic area); (2) there were many negative relationships between the specific gravity and AVP levels in the ischemic cortex; (3) intranasal AVP (50 ng or 200 ng), which could pass through the blood-brain barrier to the brain, aggravated the focal cortex edema, whereas intranasal AVP receptor antagonist-D(CH2)5Tyr(ET)DAVP (2 microg) mitigated the cortex edema in the ischemic area after occluding the left carotid artery of Mongolian gerbils; and (4) either intranasal AVP or AVP receptor antagonist did not evoke that edema in the non-ischemic cortex. The data indicated that AVP participated in the process of ischemia-evoked cortex edema, and the cerebral AVP receptor might serve as an important therapeutic target for the ischemia-evoked cortex edema.
