Male Wistar rats were subjected to streptozotocin administration (85 mg/kg i.p.) and to cerebral air embolia with common carotids ligation. Light microscopy studies showed foci of neuronal loss and dark neurons especially in hippocampus, dentate gyrus, amygdaloid, thalamus and hypothalamus in the diabetic rats. Cerebral ischemia aggravated above changes and additionally, small hemorrhagic foci in putamen close to globus pallidus were observed. Our results indicate on chronic, generalized pathologic process in diabetic-rat's brain, which may be related to an oxidative stress and leads to a death of neurons in necrotic or apoptotic way.
