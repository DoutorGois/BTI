Our previous study showed that the expression of miR-181a in memory impairment group of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced epileptic rats was up-regulated, but whether miR-181a influenced the cognitive function of PTZ-induced epileptic rats remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of miR-181a in the cognitive function of PTZ-induced epileptic rats. A model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was induced via PTZ kindling in SD male rats. The epileptic rats were divided into Epilepsy group, Agomir-control group, miR-181a agomir group, 12 rats for each. 12 rats were used as sham group. We found that compared to the sham group, the expression of miR-181a in the Epilepsy group was increased. We also found that escape latency in the 5th day was prolonged and crossing times in the 6th day was reduced via Morris Water Maze test, which may indicate memory impairment. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-181a effectively reduced Bcl-2 protein level and increased apoptosis in hippocampus. Moreover, compared with Agomir-control group, the escape latency of miR-181a agomir group was obviously induced (P<0.05). Our findings suggest that miR-181a may play a role in impairing the cognitive function of PTZ-induced epileptic rats, and miR-181a could decrease the Bcl-2 protein and induce the apoptosis in the hippocampus that might be the way to impair cognitive function.
