Previous studies demonstrate that benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) can affect hippocampal function and cause spatial cognition impairment. However, the mechanism is incomplete. Some evidence implies that B(a)P may cause an oxidative damage linking to the function of the hippocampus and antioxidant can prevent the oxidative damage in rats, but the ATPase and Ca(2+) in the hippocampus and the protective effect of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the damage of toxicity further induced by B(a)P in hippocampus and the protective effect of BHA. Ninety-six male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into four groups (solvent control group, BHA-group, B(a)P-exposed group and B(a)P-BHA-combination group), with daily administration for 90 days. Morris water maze (MWM) was employed to evaluate the learning and memory ability. The levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-Mg(2+)ATPase activity in hippocampus were measured by commercial kits. The concentration of Ca(2+) in rat hippocampus was detected by fluorescent labeling. In behavior test it showed that there was an adverse effect on rats in the B(a)P -group. The levels of MDA content and Ca(2+) content were significantly increased in the B(a)P group, while the activities of SOD and ATPase were significantly decreased. In the B(a)P-BHA group, the change of each index diminished significantly. The results suggested that the neurobehavioral toxicity of B(a)P might have a close relationship with oxidative damage, resulted in decreasing of ATPase activities and increasing of Ca(2+) concentration in the hippocampus. Furthermore, BHA can prevent these damages.
