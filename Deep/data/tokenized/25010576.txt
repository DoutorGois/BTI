PURPOSE: To investigate the mechanism of the anti-epileptic effect of Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (GLP), the changes of intracellular calcium and CaMK II alpha expression in a model of epileptic neurons were investigated. METHOD: Primary hippocampal neurons were divided into: 1) Control group, neurons were cultured with Neurobasal medium, for 3 hours; 2) Model group I: neurons were incubated with Mg(2+) free medium for 3 hours; 3) Model group II: neurons were incubated with Mg(2+) free medium for 3 hours then cultured with the normal medium for a further 3 hours; 4) GLP group I: neurons were incubated with Mg(2+) free medium containing GLP (0.375 mg/ml) for 3 hours; 5) GLP group II: neurons were incubated with Mg(2+) free medium for 3 hours then cultured with a normal culture medium containing GLP for a further 3 hours. The CaMK II alpha protein expression was assessed by Western-blot. Ca(2+) turnover in neurons was assessed using Fluo-3/AM which was added into the replacement medium and Ca(2+) turnover was observed under a laser scanning confocal microscope. RESULTS: The CaMK II alpha expression in the model groups was less than in the control groups, however, in the GLP groups, it was higher than that observed in the model group. Ca(2+) fluorescence intensity in GLP group I was significantly lower than that in model group I after 30 seconds, while in GLP group II, it was reduced significantly compared to model group II after 5 minutes. CONCLUSION: GLP may inhibit calcium overload and promote CaMK II alpha expression to protect epileptic neurons.
