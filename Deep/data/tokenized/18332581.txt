We report a 79-year-old Japanese man with histlogically-diagnosed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) with codon 129 polymorphism and codon 180 point mutation. At the time of the first examination, we diagnosed and treated as Alzheimer's disease with cerebrovascular disease because of laterality of cortex accumulation and an accumulation decrease of perforating branch areas at the SPECT ((123)I-IMP). His status rapidly progressed to an apallic state and died of lung abscess 12 months later. None of the members of his family had neuromuscular disorders. EEG (electroencephalogram) did not reveal periodic synchronous discharges (PSD). Prion protein gene analysis showed Codon 129 polymorphism (Met/Val) and codon 180 point mutation (Val/Ile). The autopsy findings revealed spongiform changes and numerous senile plaque formation in the cerebral cortex. The hippocampus and the cerebellar cortex were well preserved and did not show lacunar infarctions. CJD patients with combination of the codon 180 point mutation and codon 129 polymorphism of the PrP gene have rarely been reported.
