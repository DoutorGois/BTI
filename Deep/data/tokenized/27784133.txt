Amyloid beta protein (Abeta) plays a critical role in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies indicated that the sequence 31-35 in Abeta molecule is an effective active center responsible for Abeta neurotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we prepared a novel antibody specifically targeting the sequence 31-35 of amyloid beta protein, and investigated the neuroprotection of the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody against Abeta1-42 -induced impairments in neuronal viability, spatial memory, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rats. The results showed that the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody almost equally bound to both Abeta31-35 and Abeta1-42 , and pretreatment with the antibody dose-dependently prevented Abeta1-42 -induced cytotoxicity on cultured primary cortical neurons. In behavioral study, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of anti-Abeta31-35 antibody efficiently attenuated Abeta1-42 -induced impairments in spatial learning and memory of rats. In vivo electrophysiological experiments further indicated that Abeta1-42 -induced suppression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity was effectively reversed by the antibody. These results demonstrated that the sequence 31-35 of Abeta may be a new therapeutic target, and the anti-Abeta31-35 antibody could be a novel immunotheraputic approach for the treatment of AD.
