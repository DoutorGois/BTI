The present study was aimed at determining the changes in the 5-HT transporter activity, in different brain structures after pentylenetetrazol induced kindling of seizures. We examined [3H]-citalopram binding in the rat brain structures, and the neurodegenerative effects in the hippocampal formation using autoradiographic and immunohistochemical methods. A statistically significant and selective reduction in the binding of [3H]-citalopram was found in the CA3 field of the hippocampus (P=0.009), and a similar tendency, close to the significance level, in the dentate gyrus (P=0.05). This effect was accompanied by a loss of neurons and activation of microglia in the hippocampal formation. The present data suggest the important role for CA3- serotonergic innervation in pentylenetetrazol induced kindling of seizures.
