Transmembrane acid extruders, such as electroneutral operating Na(+)/H(+)-exchangers (NHE) and Na(+)-dependent Cl(-)/HCO(3)(-)-exchangers (NCHE) are essential for the maintenance and regulation of cell volume and intracellular pH (pH(i)). Both of them are hypothesised to be closely linked to the control of excitability. To get further information about the relation of neuronal pH(i) and activity of cortical neurones we investigated the effect of NHE- and/or NCHE-inhibition on (i) spontaneous action potentials and epileptiform burst-activity (induced by bicuculline-methiodide, caffeine or 4-aminopyridine) and (ii) on pH(i) of CA3-neurones. NHE-inhibition by amiloride (0.25-0.5 mM) or its more potent derivative dimethylamiloride (50 microM) and NCHE-inhibition by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS, 0.25-0.5 mM) induced a biphasic alteration of neuronal activity: an initial, up to 30 min lasting, increase in frequency of action potentials and bursts preceded a growing and partially reversible suppression of neuronal activity. In BCECF-loaded neurones the pH(i), however, continuously decreased during either amiloride- or DIDS-treatment and reached its steady-state (DeltapH(i) up to 0.3 pH-units) when the neuronal activity was markedly suppressed. Combined treatment with amiloride (0.5 mM) and DIDS (0.5 mM) or treatment with harmaline alone (0.25-0.5 mM), which also continuously acidified neurones via inhibition of an amiloride-insensitive NHE-subtype, induced a monophasic and partially reversible suppression of neuronal activity. As an initial excitatory period failed to occur during combined NHE/NCHE-inhibition we speculate that its occurrence during amiloride- or DIDS-treatment resulted rather from disturbances in volume- than in pH(i)-regulation. The powerful inhibitory and anticonvulsive properties of NHE- and NCHE-inhibitors, however, very likely based upon intracellular acidification - as derived from our previous findings that a moderate increase in intracellular free protons is sufficient to reduce membrane excitability of CA3-neurones.
