To study the role of hippocampal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters in epileptogenesis, we induced chronic seizures by ferric cation injection into the rat amygdaloid body. We used western blotting to measure alterations in the expression of hippocampal GABA transporter proteins GAT-1 and GAT-3. GAT-1 increased bilaterally (from 150 to 250%) at 5 to 15 days after injection, but returned to control levels by 30 days. In contrast, GAT-3 also significantly increased bilaterally at 5 days and 15 days, but remained elevated bilaterally at 30 days after injection. Alterations in GAT-1 levels are apparently transient responses to seizure activity that occur during the acute phase of epileptogenesis. However, we propose that regulation of the GAT-3 subtype transporter was chronically elevated (at least 30 days), represents an effect of epileptogenesis induced by ferric ion injected into the amygdaloid body.
