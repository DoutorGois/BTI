The in vitro brain slice preparations have been widely employed for investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying long-term potentiation and long-term depression of synaptic transmission in the rodent hippocampus. The determination of spatiotemporal patterns of activation by means of current source-density analysis of evoked field potentials allows for the use of field potential recording in the research on neocortical synaptic plasticity, in particular in horizontal connections of the motor cortex.
