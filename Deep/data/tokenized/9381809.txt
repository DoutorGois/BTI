Pinealectomy and electrolytic destruction in different directions changed the behaviour of rats in a conflict situation and the temporal organization of forced swimming. Combination of both kinds of surgery decreased the behavioural shifts produced by the hippocampal lesions. It is suggested that the anti-stressor properties of the pineal gland can be realized through changes in the hippocampal function state.
