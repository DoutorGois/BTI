Magnetic field tomography (MFT) provides 3-dimensional estimates of brain activity, from non-contact, non-invasive measurements of the magnetic field generated by coherent electrical activity in the brain. MFT analysis of averaged auditory "odd-ball" data show cortical and deep activation, presumably from the amygdala and hippocampus. These results are compared with MFT estimates obtained from a patient who had undergone lobectomy which removed these structures. The variability from subject to subject is confounded by variability between trials for the same subject; the relationship between the averaged and single trials is probed by bi-hemispheric simultaneous measurements performed under the same odd-ball paradigm and by MFT analysis of auditory evoked data and interictal epileptic activity.
