Sex steroid hormones influence the mammalian brain and modulate its activity during the lifespan. They are involved in regulation of gene transcription, neuronal excitability and neuronal survival. During development, sex hormones produce organizing effects in discrete brain regions. These regions include not only structures regulating sexual behavior but also other brain regions such as substantia nigra, hippocampus, cortex or amygdala. In mature brain, sex hormones have activational effects and modulate brain activity through excitatory or inhibitory mechanisms. Effects of sex hormones on seizure susceptibility and neuroprotective effects of beta-estradiol on status epilepticus-induced hippocampal damage will be discussed.
