The effect of a subtoxic level of quinolinic acid (QUIN) on the morphological picture of the rat hippocampus in dissociated cultures was investigated. Addition of 50 microM of QUIN to the culture medium induced only slight advanced and reversible changes of the postsynaptic elements, whereas the majority of pyramidal neurons were undamaged. The results suggest that subtoxic concentration of QUIN is insufficient to produce stable depolarization of cell membranes and severe neuronal damage.
