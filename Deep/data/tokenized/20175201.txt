Cilostazol is known to be a specific type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor, which promotes increased intracellular cAMP levels. We assessed the effect of cilostazol on production of angioneurins and chemokines and recruitment of new endothelial cells for vasculogenesis in a mouse model of transient forebrain ischemia. Pyramidal cell loss was prominently evident 3-28 days postischemia, which was markedly ameliorated by cilostazol treatment. Expression of angioneurins, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, was up-regulated by cilostazol treatment in the postischemic hippocampus. Cilostazol also increased Sca-1/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 positive cells in the bone marrow and circulating peripheral blood and the number of stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha-positive cells in the molecular layer of the hippocampus, which colocalized with CD31. CXCR4 chemokine receptors were up-regulated by cilostazol in mouse bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells, suggesting that cilostazol may be important in targeting or homing in of bone marrow-derived stem cells to areas of injured tissues. CD31-positive cells were colocalized with almost all bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in the molecular layer, indicating stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation by cilostazol. These data suggest that cilostazol markedly enhances neovascularization in the hippocampus CA1 area in a mouse model of transient forebrain ischemia, providing a beneficial interface in which both bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells and angioneurins influence neurogenesis in injured tissue.
