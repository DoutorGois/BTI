Pathological studies on several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease have revealed common deposition of ubiquitin in many inclusion bodies. This implies a possible association of ubiquitin with neurodegeneration. To address this possibility, we examined histochemically the effect of intraventricular infusion of leupeptin, a thiol proteinase inhibitor, which is known to elevate anti-ubiquitin immunoreactivity in rat Purkinje cells. In the leupeptin-infused rat, an intense anti-ubiquitin immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of neurons occurred not only in cerebellar Purkinje cells but also elsewhere in a wide area of the rat brain. The increase in the immunoreactivity was followed by a gradual depletion of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields. The immunoreactive neurons disappeared concurrently. The number of anti-ubiquitin immunoreactive neurons was negatively correlated with that of surviving neurons when the duration of leupeptin infusion was varied. These results suggest that increased anti-ubiquitin immunoreactivity associates with neuronal death in leupeptin-treated rat brain.
