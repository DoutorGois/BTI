Rats received small bilateral electrolytic or ibotenate lesions of the rostral part of the amygdaloid central (rACE) or lateral (rAL) nuclei, or caudal part of the basolateral nuclei (cBL), or electrolytic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus (HIPP). All groups were tested in a drinking passive avoidance (PA) task that appears less sensitive to deficits in acquisition/retention or activity/spatial perception than are many other PA tasks, and more specifically sensitive to deficits in generation of fear. Consistent with this interpretation, performance in the task was facilitated, not deficient, in the HIPP group. Electrolytic lesions of rAL produced a mild deficit in PA, but ibotenate lesions did not, and neither did the more caudal lesions of the cBL groups. Ibotenate lesions of rACE did produce a deficit in PA, consistent with views of a role of this part of the amygdala in fear. Electrolytic lesions of rACE produced a very profound PA deficit and also blocked the rapid development of gastric erosions by water-restraint stress, effects that were not found with ibotenate lesions in this location. This suggests a particular contribution of fibers passing through rACE to some of the more marked effects of electrolytic lesions of rostrodorsal portions of the amygdala.
