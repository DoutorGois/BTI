We have confirmed that gamma-D-glutamylglycine and the L-isomer of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid, and have shown also that L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric (L-APV) acid, are antagonists of synaptic excitations of dentate granule cells induced from both lateral and medial perforant paths. The N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist D-APV is without effect. The synaptic antagonists reduce the presynaptic fibre volley particularly in the lateral path, suggesting that a reduced transmitter output contributes to their action. NMDA receptors exist upon the granule cells, but they are not involved with these synaptic process.
