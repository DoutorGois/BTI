Depression is a mental disorder of still unknown origin. Currently, much attention is paid to the potential influence of disturbances in the functioning of neurotrophic factors on the onset of this disease. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is one of the most important growth agents affecting processes that are crucial for brain development. To date, there are no data showing the impact of prenatal stress on the family of six IGF binding proteins (IGFBP 1-6) that regulate IGF-1 bioactivity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the decreased expression of IGF-1 in the frontal cortex (FCx) and hippocampus (Hp) of adult male rats following a prenatal stress procedure is related to changes in the IGFBP family. Our results show that rats exposed prenatally to stressful stimuli displayed depression-like behavior based on sucrose preference and elevated plus maze tests. In both cases, in the adult rat brain structures that were examined after the prenatal stress procedure, the IGF-1 protein level was reduced. Moreover, we observed changes of varying degrees in the levels of IGFBPs in stressed animals. A decrease in IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 accompanied by an increase in the IGFBP-4 concentration in the Hp and the FCx was detected. There were no differences in IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-6 brain levels between the stressed and control animals, whereas IGFBP-5 concentration was decreased in the Hp of prenatally stressed animals. This study demonstrated that stress during pregnancy may lead not only to behavioral disturbances but also to a decrease in IGF-1 level and the dysregulation of the IGF-1 binding protein network in adult rat offspring.
