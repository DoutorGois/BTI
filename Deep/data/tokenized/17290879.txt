Possible role of extrahypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin-producing centers in post-stress depression development were studied. We used genetically selected strains: KHA (Koltushi High Avoidance) and KLA (Koltushi Low Avoidance) rats developing different types of depression in the "learned helplessness" paradigm: the model analogues of endogenous (KHA strain) and exogenous (KLA strain) depression. Interstrain differences of control and stress-induced CRH- and vasopressin-expression in hippocampus and neocortex in the course of depression development in KHA and KLA rats were revealed using immuno-histochemical studies. It has been shown that a significant increase of CRH- and vasopressin-immune reactivity in hippocampus and neocortex of KHA rats occurred on the 10th post-stress day. We detected also decreased CRH- and vasopressin-expression in dorsal hippocampus, and increased CRH-immune reactivity in neocortex of KLA rats in the same post-stress period. These findings imply that extrahypothalamic CRH- and vasopressin-ergic systems appear to be involved in pathogenesis mechanisms of model analogues of endogenous and exogenous depression in different ways.
