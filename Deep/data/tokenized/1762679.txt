A variety of fatty acids produced sustained changes in excitability in the guinea-pig hippocampal slice. Although each fatty acid was unique, a general pattern was evident. During a 30-min exposure, the synaptic potential was minimally affected, although population spike amplitude showed significant increases. With wash, synaptic efficacy increased. The increase in the synaptic potential was significant with arachidonic acid (100 microM), oleic acid (100 microM), myristic acid (250 microM) and capric acid (250 microM). Also with wash, the coupling between the synaptic potential and the population spike was reduced significantly for most of the fatty acids tested: arachidonic acid (50 microM, 100 microM), linoleic acid (100 microM) oleic acid (100 microM), stearic acid (100 microM), myristic acid (250 microM) and capric acid (250 microM, 500 microM). The fatty acids may influence neuronal excitability, in part, through a direct membrane action. The observed synaptic enhancement is consistent with a role for a fatty acid in long-term potentiation. In addition, fatty acid exposure mimics the effects of X-radiation. We suggest that free radical-induced release of fatty acids contributes to electrophysiological damage in a number of pathological states.
