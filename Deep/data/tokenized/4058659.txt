Convulsions of E1 mice were completely suppressed by 60 mg/kg of piperine injected intraperitoneally. The ED50 was 21.1 mg/kg. The brain 5-HT, dopamine and norepinephrine levels were estimated 1 hour after the intraperitoneal injection of piperine. The 5-HT level was significantly higher in the cerebral cortex of piperine treated mice than in control mice. This increase may be related directly to the mechanism of inhibition of convulsions by piperine. On the other hand, lower levels of 5-HT were observed in the hippocampus, midbrain and cerebellum. The dopamine level in the piperine treated mice was markedly higher only in the hypothalamus, while the norepinephrine levels were lower in every part of the brain.
