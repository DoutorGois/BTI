The locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic system is activated by a range of arousing and stressful stimuli. The serotonergic inputs to this structure have been shown to attenuate LC activation under some conditions. The present study examined the effect of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) known to be a clinically effective antidepressant, on basal and stress-induced norepinephrine (NE) release. Basal and stress-induced NE efflux in the rat hippocampus were assessed using in vivo microdialysis techniques. The effect of a 30 minute tailpinch stressor on extracellular concentration of NE was compared in rats treated with fluoxetine either once prior to tailpinch or twice daily for 14 days and, respectively, in unhandled controls and vehicle-treated control animals. A single fluoxetine injection prior to tailpinch did not significantly alter the tailpinch-induced increase of extracellular NE as compared to naive controls. However, there was an enhanced NE response to tailpinch in chronic fluoxetine versus chronic vehicle-treated control rats. Thus, acute blockade of 5-HT uptake by fluoxetine does not affect NE release in response to tailpinch stress. Chronic fluoxetine administration, however, results in a potentiated evoked response of the LC-NE system. One action of chronic fluoxetine, which may relate to therapeutic efficacy, is an increase in responsivity of LC neurons.
