Chronic depth electrodes have proven useful in diagnosing primary epilepsy of the limbic system. Five patients had small lesions in the amygdala and hippocampus. There was a 50% reduction of the seizures frequency. No complication were observed and patients were ambulant the day following surgery. It is felt that stereotactic lesions larger than produced by the leucotome used should be performed provided we have proofs that the epileptogenic focus is in a restricted area. Stereotactic lesions may also have a role in interrupting pathways clearly proven as participating in the epileptic discharge. Only under these conditions, will it be possible to say that stereotactic lesions are effective in specific type of epilepsy.
