In immobilized cats, stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus facilitates the activity of vestibular neurons; stimulation of the hypothalamic ventro-medial nucleus and dorsal hippocampus suppresses the unit activity, mainly. The effects of stimulation of the basolateral amygdalar nucleus were excitatory as well as inhibitory. Prevalence of the long-latency tonic responses indicates that the modulating effects of the hypothalamus and limbic structures are fulfilled through either mesencephalic RF or thalamic nuclei.
