We studied auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in 11 surgically treated patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) pre- and postoperatively. ERPs through sphenoidal electrodes (Sp1-T3, Sp2-T4) provided clinically relevant and correctly lateralizing electrophysiologic evidence of temporal lobe dysfunction in 9 of 11 patients, confirmed by EEGs, electrocorticograms, neuroradiologic, and neuropsychological results, and clinical follow-up. Lateralizing asymmetries were noted in P300 amplitude, but latencies were prolonged bilaterally. Sphenoidal ERPs might serve as a new functional indicator of temporal lobe dysfunction in patients evaluated for epilepsy surgery.
