Several lines of evidence have indicated that changes in the structure of neuronal cytoskeleton provide the support for the dramatic morphological changes that occur during neuronal differentiation. It has been proposed that microtubule-associated proteins can contribute to the development of this phenomenon by controlling the dynamic properties of microtubules. In this report we have characterized the effect of the combined suppression of MAP1B and tau, and MAP1B and MAP2 on neuronal polarization in cultured hippocampal cells grown on a laminin-containing substrate. We have taken advantage of the use of a mouse line deficient in MAP1B expression obtained by the gene trapping approach. In addition to this engineered mice line we used the antisense oligonucleotide approach to induce the suppression of tau or MAP2, in wild type and MAP1B-deficient neurons. Together these results show a synergistic role for MAP1B/MAP2 and MAP1B/TAU.
