Integration of synaptic excitation to generate an action potential (excitatory postsynaptic potential-spike coupling or E-S coupling) determines the neuronal output. Bidirectional synaptic plasticity is well established in the hippocampus, but whether active synaptic integration can display potentiation and depression remains unclear. We show here that synaptic depression is associated with an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent and long-lasting depression of E-S coupling. E-S depression is input-specific and is expressed in the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A and B receptor antagonists. In single neurons, E-S depression is observed without modification of postsynaptic passive properties. We conclude that a decrease in intrinsic excitability underlies E-S depression and is synergic with glutamatergic long-term depression.
