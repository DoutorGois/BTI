The goal of this study was to determine whether there are region-specific or time-dependent changes in GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition of principal neurons in the hippocampus during in vivo status epilepticus. Standard whole cell patch clamp electrophysiological techniques were used to characterize miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in recordings from the principal neurons (PNs) of the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3 in acutely-obtained hippocampal slices from control and lithium/pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus(SE)-treated animals. The reduction in mIPSC amplitude was pervasive across the 3 regions examined in hippocampal slices obtained after 60 min (late) or just 15 min after the onset of SE. The mIPSC frequency was reduced in all 3 regions after 60 min and 2 regions (dentate, CA1) after 15 min. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that a rapid modification of the postsynaptic GABAA receptor population leads to a widespread decline in GABA-mediated inhibition that, in part, contributes to both the self-sustaining nature of SE and to the decrease in the efficacy of benzodiazepines.
