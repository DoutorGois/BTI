The correlation due to different topographies was characterized in a large-scale, biologically-realistic, computational model of the rat hippocampus using a spatio-temporal correlation analysis. The effect of the topographical projection between the following subregions of the hippocampus was investigated: the entorhinal to dentate projection, the entorhinal to CA3 projection, and the mossy fiber to CA3 projection. Through this work, analysis was performed on the individual and combined effects of these projections on the activity of the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus and CA3. The simulations show that uncorrelated input transmitted through the entorhinal-to-dentate or entorhinal-to-CA3 projection causes spatio-temporally correlated activity in the principal neurons that manifest as spike clusters. However, if the mossy fiber system provides uncorrelated input to the CA3, then the CA3 activity remains uncorrelated. When considering the transfer of correlation through the dentate, this analysis suggests that the mossy fiber system do not imbue any correlation to the activity as it propagates from the granule cells of the dentate to the CA3. With the spatio-temporal correlation analysis, the influence of each topographical projection on the transfer of correlation can be investigated as additional subregions and neuron types are added to the large-scale model.
