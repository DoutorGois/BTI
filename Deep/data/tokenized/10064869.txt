Choline availability in the diet during pregnancy alters fetal brain biochemistry with resulting behavioral changes that persist throughout the lifetime of the offspring. In the present study, the effects of dietary choline on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in neuronal progenitor cells in the hippocampus and septum were analyzed in fetal brains at different stages of embryonic development. Timed-pregnant rats on day E12 were fed AIN-76 diet with varying levels of dietary choline for 6 days, and, on days E18 or E20, fetal brain sections were collected. We found that choline deficiency (CD) significantly decreased the rate of mitosis in the neuroepithelium adjacent to the hippocampus. An increased number of apoptotic cells were found in the region of the dentate gyrus of CD hippocampus compared to controls (5.5+/-0.7 vs. 1.9+/-0.3 apoptotic cells per section; p<0.01). Using a combination of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling and an unbiased computer-assisted image analysis method, we found that modulation of dietary choline availability changed the distribution and migration of precursor cells born on E16 in the fimbria, primordial dentate gyrus, and Ammon's horn of the fetal hippocampus. CD also decreased the migration of newly born cells from the neuroepithelium into the lateral septum, thus indicating that the sensitivity of fetal brain to choline availability is not restricted to the hippocampus. We found an increase in the expression of TOAD-64 protein, an early neuronal differentiation marker, in the hippocampus of CD day E18 fetal brains compared to controls. These results show that dietary choline availability alters the timing of the genesis, migration, and commitment to differentiation of progenitor neuronal-type cells in fetal brain hippocampal regions known to be associated with learning and memory processes in adult brain.
