Chronic experiments on rabbits with penicillin epilepsy have shown that intravenous injections of the ACHE inhibitor galanthamine (1 mg/kg), and N-cholinergic-blockers, ganglerone (3 mg/kg) and eterofen (8 mg/kg), decreased or suppressed completely epileptogenesis manifestations. Combination of galanthamine with one of the N-cholinergic-blockers markedly increased their anticonvulsive actions. On the contrary, combination of galanthamine with the M-cholinergic-blocker metamizil (0.5 mg/kg) enhanced epileptogenesis activity. It is postulated that both M- and N-cholinergic mechanisms take part in the genesis of penicillin epilepsy. The use of N-cholinergic-blockers and their combinations with M-cholinomimetics as anticonvulsants seems expedient.
