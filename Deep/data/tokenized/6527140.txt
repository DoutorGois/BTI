The sensitivity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons to the depressant action of serotonin was studied in hippocampal slices obtained from rats treated repetitively with clomipramine (10 mg/kg i.p.; 10 days or 4 weeks), with clorgyline 0.3 mg/kg s.c.; 10 days) or with the vehicle. Whereas clorgyline produced a very pronounced subsensitivity to serotonin, a moderate, non-significant reduction in sensitivity was observed with clomipramine. These electrophysiological findings are consistent with previous biochemical studies.
