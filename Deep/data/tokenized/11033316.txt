This study investigated the spatial distribution of vasopressin V(1) and beta(1)-adrenoceptors within hippocampal subfields and lamina in an attempt to localize the site(s) of interaction between these two receptor systems. In addition, the cell types, neuronal and glial, in which the vasopressin-induced neuromodulation occurs, were identified. Lastly, the temporal constraints of the potentiation induced by vasopressin were investigated. Results of these analyses demonstrated multiple sites within the hippocampus where the interaction between vasopressin and norephinephrine could occur. Moreover, vasopressin-induced potentiation of adrenergic stimulated cyclase occurred in both hippocampal neurons and glia whereas it did not occur in undifferentiated neurons. Analysis of the temporal constraints of vasopressin-induced potentiation revealed that pre-activation of the vasopressin V(1) receptor for 1 min yielded greater potentiation than simultaneous exposure to vasopressin and norepinephrine. These data provide insights into the spatial and temporal characteristics for the interaction between the vasopressin receptor and adrenoceptor systems and provide a cellular and biochemical rationale for the behavioral findings of Kovacs and De Wied.
