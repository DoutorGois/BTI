During population spikes in slices of rat hippocampus, transmembrane differential recordings (intracellular minus extracellular) revealed electrical field-effect depolarizations in CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule neurons. The field-effect depolarizations were not seen in single-ended recordings, and were consistently shown to increase neuronal excitability. Therefore, as previously shown for the CA1 area, large population spikes from CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule cells are associated with transmembrane depolarizations that increase neuronal excitability.
