Self-localization requires that information from several sensory modalities and knowledge domains be integrated in order to identify an environment and determine current location and heading. This integration occurs by the convergence of highly processed sensory information onto neural systems in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Entorhinal neurons combine angular and linear self-motion information to generate an oriented metric signal that is then 'attached' to each environment using information about landmarks and context. Neurons in hippocampus use this signal to determine the animal's unique position within a particular environment. Elucidating this process illuminates not only spatial processing but also, more generally, how the brain builds knowledge representations from inputs carrying heterogeneous sensory and semantic content.
