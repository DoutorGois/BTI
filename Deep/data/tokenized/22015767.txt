Hypothermia has been shown to have neuroprotective effects against neurotrauma and cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral ischemia induces the activation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaM-KII), which modulates many enzymes. We have previously demonstrated that CaM-KIIalpha downregulates neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity. However, precise details regarding the neuroprotective mechanism of hypothermia largely remain to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the neuroprotective mechanism of hypothermia, focusing on the association between CaM-KIIalpha and nNOS in CA1 hippocampus after focal cerebral ischemia in mice. The temperature was maintained at normothermia (36.5-37.5 degrees C) or mild hypothermia (31.5-32.5 degrees C) during these procedures. Focal cerebral ischemia induced significant dissociation of CaM-KIIalpha from nNOS in the CA1 hippocampus but not in the cerebral cortex under normothermia. Hypothermia did not change the expression of nNOS, but it significantly induced the colocalization of CaM-KIIalpha with nNOS in CA1 hippocampus immediately after cerebral ischemia. These results presumably result in the attenuation of nNOS activity and could contribute to the tolerance to post-ischemic damage. This effect could be one of the neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia.
