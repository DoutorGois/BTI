Immunocytochemical and electrophysiological evidence suggests that somatostatin may be a transmitter in the hippocampus. To characterize the ionic mechanisms underlying somatostatin effects, voltage-clamp and current-clamp studies on single CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal slice preparation were performed. Both somatostatin-28 and somatostatin-14 elicited a steady outward current and selectively augmented the noninactivating, voltage-dependent outward potassium current known as the M-current. Since the muscarinic cholinergic agonists carbachol and muscarine antagonized this current, these results suggest a reciprocal regulation of the M-current by somatostatin and acetylcholine.
