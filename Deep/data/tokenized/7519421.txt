Injection of kainic acid into rat induced a limbic seizure and increased the activities of two protein kinases with Mrs of 42 kDa and 44 kDa in the hippocampus. These two protein kinases were identified as MAP kinases by an anti-MAP kinase antibody. These MAP kinases were phosphorylated at least at a tyrosine residue. The time course of the MAP kinase activation was roughly parallel with that of the seizure. These results indicate that the kainic acid-induced seizure induces MAP kinase activation in rat hippocampus.
