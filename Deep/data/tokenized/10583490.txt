Studies in slices suggest that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated synaptic currents are not present in CA1 (Cornu ammonis) pyramidal neurons at birth (P0). We have re-examined this issue in the rat intact hippocampal formation (IHF) in vitro. Injections of biocytin or carbocyanine show that the temporo-ammonic, commissural and Schaffer collateral pathways are present at birth in the marginal zone of CA1. Electrical stimulation of these pathways evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the marginal zone of CA1 from embryonic day 19 (E19) to postnatal day 9 (P9). These fEPSPs are mediated by synaptic AMPA receptors as they are reduced or completely blocked by: (i) tetrodotoxin; (ii) high divalent cation concentrations; (iii) the adenosine A1 receptor agonist CPA; (iv) anoxic episodes; (v) the selective AMPA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI-53655) or the mixed AMPA-kainate receptor antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX). The amplitude of the fEPSPs is also reduced by D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-APV) and its duration is increased by bicuculline suggesting the participation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors. Finally, AMPA receptor-mediated fEPSPs are also recorded in P0 slices, but they are smaller and more labile than in the IHF. Our results suggest that in embryonic CA1 neurons, glutamate acting on AMPA receptors already provides a substantial part of the excitatory drive and may play an important role in the activity-dependent development of the hippocampus. Furthermore, the IHF may be a convenient preparation to investigate the properties of the developing hippocampus.
