The pineal hormone melatonin and the tranquilizer diazepam given in an equal dose (0.1 mg/kg) demonstrated an anxiolytic effect on a model of a conflict situation in rats. Damage to the dorsal hippocampus produced a similar effect and the anxiolytic activity of the drugs under study was removed against this background.
