Neurotensin (NT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. Here we studied the effects of a 30-day regimen of haloperidol (1.15 mg/100 g food) and risperidone (1.15 and 2.3 mg/100 g food) on NT-like immunoreactivity (-LI) levels in brain tissue and NT-LI efflux in the ventral striatum (VSTR) of the rat. Haloperidol, but not risperidone, increased NT-LI levels in the striatum. In the occipital cortex, risperidone, but not haloperidol, decreased levels of NT-LI. In the hippocampus and the frontal cortex both haloperidol and risperidone (the higher dose) increased NT-LI levels. In the VSTR, haloperidol and risperidone (the higher dose) decreased NT-LI efflux and abolished the stimulatory effect of d-amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.). Thus, changes in NT occur in response to antipsychotic drugs and psychostimulants that may be relevant for the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia.
