We describe a patient who presented with temporal lobe epilepsy and a seizure onset pattern in the right temporo-occipital area. Structural MRI revealed sclerosis in the right hippocampus. A comprehensive presurgical neuropsychological assessment allowed us to disentangle deficits in visual object recognition and visual imagery from well-preserved spatial capacities. Following a right temporal lobectomy, the patient remained seizure free, and 1 year postsurgery, the patient's scores on object recognition and imagery were in the normal range. Our findings suggest that visual object recognition and visual imagery are sustained by cortical areas located in proximity to the temporo-occipital ventral pathway and that perceptual and imagery spatial processing is subserved as well by anatomically close mechanisms. Furthermore, the results seem to indicate that nonlesional paroxysmal activity in the posterior temporal lobe can cause chronic dysfunctions of the visual system and that it may be reversible with effective seizure control.
