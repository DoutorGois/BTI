The effects of aging on the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation by muscarinic receptors were investigated. There were no detectable changes in the magnitude of maximal inhibition by carbamylcholine or the potency of the agonist in inducing this response in either the striatum or hippocampus obtained from young or old Fisher 344 rats.
