Unusual pathological findings were encountered in a temporal lobectomy specimen from a 9-year-old boy with intractable complex partial seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enlarged left temporal lobe, with diffuse high signal intensity over the cortex and poor gray-white differentiation on T2-weighted imaging; single-photon emission computerized tomography showed decreased blood flow. Active epileptiform discharges were identified in the left temporal lobe with focal slow waves and generalized epileptiform paroxysms. Pathologically, the cortex revealed changes of focal cortical dysplasia with extensive disorganization of neuronal morphology, layering, and orientation as well as focal polymicrogyria. The cortical-white matter junction was indistinct with extensive neuronal heterotopias in the white matter. Large pale balloon cells akin to those seen in tuberous sclerosis were found scattered within the cortex and white matter. The most striking finding was that of a heterotopic nodule in the white matter, which revealed abnormal neurons with penetration of cell bodies by capillaries. Ultrastructurally, there were no degenerative changes in these neurons, and this unusual phenomenon is attributed to a developmental disturbance affecting neuronal, glial, and vascular elements.
