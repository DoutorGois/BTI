PURPOSE: To investigate whether a correct lateralization of the primary epileptogenic area by means of neuronal complexity loss analysis can be obtained from interictal EEG recordings using semi-invasive foramen ovale electrodes. In a previous study with recordings from intrahippocampal depth and subdural strip electrodes it was shown that the dynamics of the primary epileptogenic area can be characterized by an increased loss of neuronal complexity in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHODS: Neuronal complexity loss analysis was applied. This analysis method is derived from the theory of nonlinear dynamics and provides a topological diagnosis even in cases where no actual seizure activity can be recorded. We examined interictal EEG recorded intracranially from multipolar foramen ovale electrodes in 19 patients with unilateral TLE undergoing presurgical evaluation. RESULTS: The primary epileptogenic area was correctly lateralized in 16 of the 19 investigated patients. The misclassification of the side of seizure onset in three patients might be attributed to the larger distance between the foramen ovale electrodes and the mesial temporal structures as compared to intrahippocampal depth electrodes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the previous findings and provide further evidence for the usefulness of nonlinear time-series analysis for the characterization of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the primary epileptogenic area in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.
