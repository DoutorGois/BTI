Ether-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were depleted of brain serotonin (5HT) by intraventricular injections of 50 micrograms 5,7-dihydroxtryptamine (57DHT). Oral pretreatment with 25 mg/kg desmethylimipramine was used to protect brain noradrenergic neurons from 57DHT. Liquid chromatographic assays revealed that this treatment did not significantly alter catecholamine levels but depleted hippocampal 5HT by 92% and striatal 5HT by 45%. Three or eleven days after lesioning, locomotor and exploratory behavior was characterized in separate groups of animals with a behavioral pattern monitor (BPM). On Days 4 and 12, the animals were retested following saline or 1.0 mg/kg amphetamine. Three days after depletion, lesioned rats exhibited a decrease rate of habituation of locomotor activity relative to controls. When challenged with amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg), 5HT-depleted rats exhibited increased corner and decreased center activity, as well as stereotyped patterns of locomotion. Eleven days following lesion, 5HT-depleted rats exhibited habituation rates greater than controls; amphetamine challenge yielded patterns of activity similar to those of control animals. These results show that central serotonergic pathways play an important role in modulating both spontaneous and amphetamine-elicited activity in rats, and that compensatory mechanisms operate over time to alter the behavioral effects of 57DHT-induced depletions of brain 5HT.
