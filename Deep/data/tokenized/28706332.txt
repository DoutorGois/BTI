OBJECTIVE: Elsholtzia communis (Collett and Hemsl.) Diels has been widely distributed and is reported for many therapeutic effects. The present study aims to investigate the antistress activity of the leaf extract and its possible molecular mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydroethanolic extract of leaves of E. communis (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) were administered for 7 days to stress-induced male Wistar rats. The experimental animals were divided into five groups (n = 6). The mRNA/protein profile of few stress responsive chaperones (hspa14), endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (C/EBP homologous protein [CHOP]), antioxidant regulating genes (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like-2 factor [Nrf2]), apoptotic factors (Caspase-3) in rat hippocampus were studied by polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. RESULTS: The stress-related genes such as hspa14, CHOP, antioxidant gene Nrf2, apoptotic gene Caspase-3 which were overexpressed in the stress control group were significantly suppressed following administration of the extract at both the doses and the standard drug Ginseng. Likewise, brain-derived neurotrophic factor which is closely related with stress, was downregulated in the stress control group, was found to be upregulated following treatment with the extract and the standard drug Ginseng. CONCLUSION: Our findings clearly indicate that E. communis was able to counteract stress. Hence, it has the potential to develop as adaptogen and also as a replacement/substitute of the popularly used drug, Ginseng or Ashwagandha, which is on the verge of extinction or becoming endemic due to overuse.
