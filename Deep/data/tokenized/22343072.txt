BACKGROUND: N-terminally truncated and modified pyroglutamate-3 amyloid-beta protein (pE3-Abeta) is present in most, if not all, cerebral plaque and vascular amyloid deposits in human Alzheimer's disease (AD). pE3-Abeta deposition is also found in AD-like transgenic (tg) mouse brain, albeit in lesser quantities than general Abeta. pE3-Abeta resists degradation, is neurotoxic, and may act as a seed for Abeta aggregation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if pE3-Abeta removal by passive immunization with a highly specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) impacts pathogenesis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's amyloidosis. METHODS: APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 tg mice were given weekly intraperitoneal injections of a new anti-pE3-Abeta mAb (mAb07/1) or PBS from 5.8 to 13.8 months of age (prevention) or from 23 to 24.7 months of age (therapeutic). Multiple forms of cerebral Abeta were quantified pathologically and biochemically. Gliosis and microhemorrhage were examined. RESULTS: Chronic passive immunization with an anti-pE3-Abeta mAb significantly reduced total plaque deposition and appeared to lower gliosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum in both the prevention and therapeutic studies. Insoluble Abeta levels in hemibrain homogenates were not significantly different between immunized and control mice. Microhemorrhage was not observed with anti-pE3-Abeta immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Selective removal of pE3-Abeta lowered general Abeta plaque deposition suggesting a pro-aggregation or seeding role for pE3-Abeta.
