A new design for an inexpensive and reliable subminiature microdrive for unit recording in the freely moving animal is presented. The 'Scribe' microdrive is (a) of a small size and low weight, (b) allows for precise advancement of the electrodes, (c) permits stable unit recordings over time, (d) is simple to install, and (e) is economical to construct. These advantages are a result of its simple, single screw-based drive system and the ready availability of component parts. The Scribe microdrive is a small diameter device suitable for multi-site, multi-electrode applications.
