In the model of transient brain ischemia of 6-min duration in gerbils we have estimated: 1. The concentration of brain gangliosides: A significant decrease to about 70% of control was observed selectively in the hippocampus at 3 and 7 d after ischemia. 2. The activity of Na+,K(+)-ATPase: The enzyme activity was not affected in either hippocampus nor in cerebral cortex. 3. The malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration: The levels of MDA had increased at 30 min after ischemia up to 123 and 129% of control in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, respectively. 4. Immunoreactivity of protein kinase C detected by Western blotting: In hippocampus the early translocation toward membranes was followed by a decrease in total enzyme content at 6, 24, 72, and 96 h of postischemic recovery. Also, a sharp increase of 50 kDa isoform (PKM) was noticed immediately and at the early recovery times. The behavior of these biochemical markers of ischemic brain injury in the hippocampus after the short (6 min) insult was contrasted with their reaction in the cerebral cortex as well as after prolongation of the ischemia to 15 min. These results taken together indicate that an early increase in PKC translocation followed by a decrease is the most symptomatic for selective, delayed, postischemic hippocampal injury, resulting from short duration (6 min) ischemia of the gerbil brain.
