Albino mongrel rats were used for the determination of the gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GTF) and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activities in various brain areas (cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, hippocampus, brain stem) during acute (1.5; 4 and 6 g/kg i. p.) and chronic (15 months) alcoholic intoxication and alcohol withdrawal (24-48 h, 4 and 8 days). An increase or a decrease in the activity of these two enzymes in the various rat brain areas depends on the dose of ethanol and the time of its action. The activity of gamma-GTF grew in all brain areas during chronic ethanol intoxication; the activity of AChE was also enhanced in three brain areas but it was diminished in cerebral hemispheres. Alcohol withdrawal caused diverse changes in the activities of these two enzymes in various areas of the brain. A tendency to normalization of the gamma-GTF and AChE activities is manifested 4-8 days after alcohol withdrawal.
