In experiments on rats the emotional-pain stress is studied for its effect on the activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system in the forebrain and stem structures, on GABA catabolism and GABA metabolism-related energy metabolism indices in the hippocamp and frontal cortex neurons. It is shown that the stress effect is accompanied by the GABA level increase and GABA-transaminase inhibition with a simultaneous rise of the succinate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase activity. The pain factor is established to be very important for changes in the activity of GABA-transaminase and succinate dehydrogenase. The found shifts in the GABA activity system are significant for neuromediatory and energy adaptation to the stress.
