An initial decrement followed by a significant recovery of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities in the ipsilateral hippocampus was observed in rats with unilateral, partial transection of the fimbria. Regeneration of hippocampal cholinergic terminals could account for the parallel return towards normal of both the enzyme activities. We suggest that the still intact fimbrial fibres, homologous to those severed, contribute to the observed recovery.
