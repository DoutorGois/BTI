The primary objective of this investigation was to assess the neuroprotective efficacy of lithium in an acrylamide (ACR)-induced neuropathy model in mice. In this study, Kunming male mice were administered ACR (25 mg/kg bw, i.p. once a day) with or without lithium (25 mg/kg bw, i.p. once a day) for 2 weeks. All ACR-administered mice exhibited severe symptoms of neuropathy. We found that treatment with lithium effectively alleviated behavioral deficits in animals elicited by acrylamide. Interestingly, the reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis resulting from ACR injection was promoted by administration of lithium. Further, lithium treatment significantly offset ACR-induced depletion in p-GSK-3beta (Ser9) levels in hippocampus. Collectively our findings suggest the propensity of lithium to attenuate ACR-induced neuropathy. Further studies are necessary to understand the precise molecular mechanism by which the lithium attenuates neuropathy. Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrate the beneficial effects of lithium on ACR-induced neuropathy in mice and suggest its possible therapeutic application as an adjuvant in the management of other forms of neuropathy in humans.
