The regional brain metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) was studied in rats injected with morphine either systemically or in the nuclei raphe medianus (MR) or dorsalis (DR). A subcutaneous injection of 10 mg/kg morphine significantly raised the levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the diencephalon, striatum, nucleus accumbens and cortex with no effect in the hippocampus. Similar changes in 5-HT metabolism were found in animals injected with 5 micrograms/0.5 microliter in the DR whereas morphine injected in the MR raised 5-HIAA levels only in the nucleus accumbens. A subcutaneous or direct injection of morphine in the DR significantly raised the levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens, but injection in the MR was ineffective. All the effects of morphine were blocked by naloxone, injected either intraperitoneally (1 mg/kg) or directly in the raphe nuclei (2 micrograms/0.5 microliter). Pretreatment with parachlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, significantly reduced the effect of morphine injected in the DR on dopamine metabolism in the striatum and nucleus accumbens. The data suggest that a major mechanism by which morphine increases 5-HT metabolism in the rat forebrain is activation of 5-HT cells in the nucleus raphe dorsalis, and this action may contribute to the increased DA metabolism found in the animal injected with morphine in this brain area.
