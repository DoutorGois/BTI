Evidence for different physiological properties along the hippocampal longitudinal axis is emerging. Here, we examined the electrophysiological features of neurons at different dorso-ventral sites of the mouse CA1 hippocampal region. Cell position was defined with respect to longitudinal coordinates of each slice. We measured variations in neuronal excitability, subthreshold membrane properties and neurotransmitter responses along the longitudinal axis. We found that (i) pyramidal cells of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) were less excitable than those of the ventral hippocampus (VH). Resting Membrane Potential (RMP) was more hyperpolarized and somatic Input Resistance (Ri) was lower in DH compared to VH. (ii) The Paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of focally induced synaptic responses was systematically reduced from the DH to the VH; (iii) Long-term-potentiation was most pronounced in the DH and fell gradually in the intermediate hippocampus and in the VH; (iv) the frequency of miniature GABAergic events was higher in the VH than in the DH; (v) the PPR of evoked inhibitory post-synaptic current (IPSC) was higher in the DH than in the VH. These findings indicate an increased probability of both GABA and glutamate release and a reduced plasticity in the ventral compared to more dorsal regions of the hippocampus.
