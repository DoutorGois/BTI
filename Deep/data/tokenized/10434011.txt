Prolonged seizures are associated with injury to vulnerable neurons, particularly in the hippocampus. Identification of compounds that attenuate injury after prolonged seizures could be of value in the management of refractory status epilepticus. We hypothesized that topiramate, an anticonvulsant with multiple mechanisms of action, would attenuate hippocampal neuronal injury when given after experimental status epilepticus. Limbic status epilepticus was induced in adult male Wistar rats for 140 min by unilateral hippocampal electrical stimulation. Rats then received intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle (n=6) or topiramate at 20 mg/kg (n=6), 40 mg/kg (n=7) or 80 mg/kg (n=7). Three days later, hippocampal sections were processed for neuronal degeneration using a silver impregnation stain. Seizure-induced damage was assessed by measuring the density of silver staining in hippocampal regions CA1, CA3 and dentate hilus. Administration of topiramate at each dose was associated with a significant reduction in staining density bilaterally in area CA1 and the dentate hilus. Reduction in staining density in area CA3 was seen contralateral to the side of stimulation at the two higher topiramate doses only. The results indicate that administration of topiramate after experimental status epilepticus can attenuate seizure-induced hippocampal neuronal injury.
