Important stressful events occur at birth or within the few hours that follow this event. To unravel a possible involvement of stress proteins, it is important to determine their levels of expression. Expression of HSP27 protein was determined by Western blotting in several nonneural tissues and in brain regions of the developing pig (fetal to adult). Maximum levels of expression were observed in heart, liver, and lung. In kidney, the expression was reduced during the first hours of life. Brain parts included whole brain, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striatum. HSP27 immunogenicity was observed in all the brain regions studied. In whole brain, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus extracts, the levels of HSP27 were decreased during the first hours of age (4 h to 2 d). In striatum, levels of expression were very low--if detectable--during the early postnatal days of life. Changes in environmental parameters, like temperature and/or hypoxia can be possibly related to differential expressions of HSPs, which can result in severe adverse developmental outcomes. The results are discussed in terms of using the newborn piglet as a model to study different forms of stress on the heat-shock protein postnatal expression.
