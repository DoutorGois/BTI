Neurogenesis continues in the adult brain and is increased in certain pathological states. We reported recently that neurogenesis is enhanced in hippocampus of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We now report that the effect of AD on neurogenesis can be reproduced in a transgenic mouse model. PDGF-APP(Sw,Ind) mice, which express the Swedish and Indiana amyloid precursor protein mutations, show increased incorporation of BrdUrd and expression of immature neuronal markers in two neuroproliferative regions: the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone. These changes, consisting of approximately 2-fold increases in the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells, were observed at age 3 months, when neuronal loss and amyloid deposition are not detected. Because enhanced neurogenesis occurs in both AD and an animal model of AD, it seems to be caused by the disease itself and not by confounding clinical factors. As neurogenesis is increased in PDGF-APP(Sw,Ind) mice in the absence of neuronal loss, it must be triggered by more subtle disease manifestations, such as impaired neurotransmission. Enhanced neurogenesis in AD and animal models of AD suggests that neurogenesis may be a compensatory response and that measures to enhance neurogenesis further could have therapeutic potential.
