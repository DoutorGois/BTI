Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized histopathologically by the presence of senile plaques (SPs), neurofibrillary tangles, and synapse loss. The main component of SPs is amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which has been associated with increased oxidative stress, leading to oxidative modification of proteins and consequently to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is the primary moiety responsible for the efflux of Abeta from the brain to the blood across the blood-brain barrier. Impaired brain-to-blood transport of Abeta by LRP1 has been hypothesized to contribute to increased levels of Abeta in AD brain. The cause of LRP1 dysfunction is unknown, but we have hypothesized that Abeta oxidizes LRP1, thus damaging its own transporter. Consistent with this notion, we report in this study a significant increase in the levels of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal bound to transmembrane LRP1 in AD hippocampus. In contrast, the levels of LRP1-resident 3-nitrotyrosine did not show a significant increase in AD hippocampus compared to age-matched controls. Based on this study, we propose that Abeta impairs its own efflux from the brain by oxidation of its transporter LRP1, leading to increased Abeta deposition in brain, thereby contributing to subsequent cognitive impairment in AD.
