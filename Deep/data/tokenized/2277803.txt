Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), injected into the cerebral ventricles (i.c.v.) of rabbits, induced EEG limbic seizures, behavioural excitability, stereotyped behaviour and the tardive enhancement of hippocampal theta voltage and frequency. The beta-endorphin cleavage derivatives des-tyr-gamma-endorphin (DT gamma E) and des-enkephalin-gamma-endorphin (DE gamma E), when injected i.v. for 4 days prevented the EEG ictal seizures induced by CRF in the hippocampus of rabbits and partly prevented the tardive enhancement of theta wave amplitude and frequency. These results suggest the possibility that these peptides may have antiepileptogenic properties.
