To determine whether androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) regulate glucocorticoid receptors (GR), the effects of a mixture of three commonly abused AAS (testosterone cypionate, nandrolone decanoate and boldenone undecylenate) on GR immunoreactivity (ir), were examined in hippocampi of adrenalectomized male rats. Treatment with AAS for 1 week increased nuclear GRir in pyramidal cells of CA1, and granule cells of the dentate gyrus. These findings suggest a role for GR in the mediation of some of the CNS effects of androgenic-anabolic steroids.
