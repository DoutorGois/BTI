The adult pattern of neural connectivity is shaped by repulsive and attractive factors, many of which are modulated by activity. Although much is known about the actions of these factors when studied in isolation, little is known about how they interact. To address this question, we examined the effects of sequential or coapplication of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Fc-conjugated ephrin-A5 or EphA5 in cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons. BDNF promotes neurite outgrowth and synapse formation, and when applied acutely, it elicits an increase in ongoing synaptic activity. Members of the ephrin family of ligands and receptors can be repulsive and prevent formation of synaptic contacts. Acute exposure to either ephrin-A5-Fc or EphA5-Fc transiently enhanced synaptic activity when applied alone, but when applied prior to BDNF, they dramatically reduced the electrophysiological effects of the neurotrophin. Conversely, BDNF had no effect on subsequently applied ephrin-A5-Fc or EphA5-Fc. Consistent with this, ephrin-A5-Fc also prevented BDNF-induced activation of p42/44 MAPK. The effect of ephrin-A5-Fc appears to be presynaptic, as it prevented the BDNF-induced increase in spontaneous miniature postsynaptic current frequency, whereas EphA5-Fc did not. These results suggest that these factors can be categorized differently, with the contact-mediated activation of EphA receptors by ephrin-A5 overriding the diffusion-mediated effect of BDNF.
