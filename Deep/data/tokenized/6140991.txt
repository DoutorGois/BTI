Administration of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) or prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG) into a lateral cerebral ventricle reduced the magnitude of systolic blood pressure increase (pressor response) induced by electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) in urethane-anesthetized rats. Bilateral destruction of the dorsal hippocampus prevented the action of AVP on the pressor response. However, the effect of PLG was only slightly reduced by hippocampal lesion. Microinjection of AVP in the dentate area of the dorsal hippocampus mimicked the action of intracerebroventricularly administered peptides. The effect of a single injection of AVP lasted at least for 60 min. Neither hippocampal damage nor peptide administrations resulted in changes in mean arterial blood pressure (basal BP). Bradycardiac response accompanied the BP increase during MRF stimulation. Hippocampal damage or intracerebroventricular administration of AVP and PLG failed to affect the cardiac response. Injection of AVP into the hippocampus tended to reduce the magnitude of cardiac responses caused by MRF stimulation. It is suggested that the inhibition by AVP of a pressor response produced by MRF stimulation involves the dorsal hippocampus. The action of PLG or related peptides seems to be, at least in part, through mechanisms not involving the hippocampus.
