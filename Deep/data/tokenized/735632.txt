After intracarotid injection in the rat followed by decapitation 15 s later, the uptake of the RNA precursor [3H] orotic acid by 18 brain region and by the anterior pituitary was measured. Simultaneously injected lysine-8-vasopressin (1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 muU per ml injection solution, respectively) caused a dose-dependent enhancement of tracer uptake by 7 regions, e.g. by the hippocampus. There are indications that especially in this region the blood-brain barrier permeability to the precursor was influenced by the peptide hormone.
