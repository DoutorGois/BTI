Information storage in the brain depends on the ability of neurons to alter synaptic connectivity within key circuitries such as the hippocampus. Memory-associated synaptic plasticity is mediated by a temporal cascade of de novo protein synthesis and altered protein processing. Here, we have used two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) to investigate memory-specific protein changes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus at increasing times following spatial learning. We identified 42 proteins that were significantly regulated in the first 24 h of spatial memory consolidation. Two distinct waves of protein expression regulation were evident, at 3 and 12 h post-learning and this is in agreement with studies employing inhibitors of global translation. Functional classification of the memory-associated proteins revealed that the majority of regulated proteins contributed either to cellular structure or cellular metabolism. For example, actins, tubulins and intermediate filament proteins, core proteins of the three major cytoskeletal components, were dynamically regulated at times that suggest a role in memory-associated synaptic reorganization. Increased proteasome-mediated protein degradation was evident in the early post-training period including the down-regulation of phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 kDa, a key inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. Some of the most substantial protein expression changes were observed for secreted carrier proteins including transthyretin and serum albumin at 6-12 h post-learning, regulations that could serve an important role in increasing the supply of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone, key synaptic plasticity-promoting signals in the adult brain. Together these observations provide further insight into protein level regulations occurring in the hippocampus during spatial memory consolidation.
