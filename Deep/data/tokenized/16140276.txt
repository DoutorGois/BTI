BACKGROUND: Chronic stress has significant effects on hippocampal structure and function. We have previously identified nerve growth factor (NGF), membrane glycoprotein 6a (M6a), the guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein) alpha q polypeptide (GNAQ), and CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK-1) as genes regulated by psychosocial stress and clomipramine treatment in the hippocampus of tree shrews. These genes encode proteins involved in neurite outgrowth. METHODS: To analyze whether regulation of the above-mentioned genes is conserved between different species, stressors, and antidepressant drugs, we subjected mice to repeated restraint stress and tianeptine treatment and measured hippocampal messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Chronically stressed mice displayed a reduction in transcript levels for NGF, M6a, GNAQ, and CLK-1. In addition, other genes implicated in neuronal plasticity, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), protein kinase C (PKC), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and synapsin I were downregulated in stressed mice. Tianeptine treatment reversed the stress effects for the genes analyzed. Alterations in gene expression were dependent on the duration of the stress treatment and, in some cases, were only observed in male mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that genes involved in neurite remodeling are one of the main targets for regulation by chronic stress. The finding that this regulation is conserved in different stress models and antidepressant treatments highlights the biological relevance of the genes analyzed and suggests that they might be involved in stress-related disorders.
