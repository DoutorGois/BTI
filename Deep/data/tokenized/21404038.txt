RATIONALE: Ginkgo biloba extract, EGb761, is widely used as herbal supplements throughout Western society. It has been used in the treatment of various common geriatric complaints including short-term memory loss. Our previous study has shown that acute systemic administration of EGb761 enhanced extinction of fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in rats. Little is known about the behavioral effects of hippocampally administered EGb761 on the extinction of FPS. OBJECTIVE: The current study was performed to evaluate the involvement of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in the EGb761 facilitation effect on the extinction of FPS. METHODS AND RESULT: Male adult SD rats were used. EGb761 (28 ng/side, bilaterally) was infused into DH bilaterally 10 min prior to extinction training. Animals were then tested for FPS 24 h later. Results showed that intra-hippocampal infusion of EGb761 prior to extinction training facilitated extinction, which was not due to impairments of expression of conditioned fear. Intra-hippocampal injection of ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 partially attenuates the above EGb761 effect. Therefore, acute EGb761 administration modulated extinction of conditioned fear, which might be mediated by more than one signal cascade. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that DH may participate in the facilitation effect of EGb761 on the extinction of conditioned fear. In addition to ERK1/2, another signal cascade may also be involved in the EGb761 facilitation effect on extinction.
