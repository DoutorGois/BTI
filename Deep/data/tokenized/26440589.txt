There is a growing awareness of the chronic brain injury that results from the sepsis syndrome. We review experiments in several animal models of sepsis and show in one model, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), that permanent structural pathology matures after the initial event. Specifically, we observed after exposure to CLP significant decreased spine density on the apical tree, but not the basal tree, of dendrites in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus that was accompanied by a significantly diminished arbor of the apical dendrites, by 8 weeks, but not after 2 weeks. These novel data from dendritic arborizations elaborate information about a cohort of mice that had behaved in spatial memory tasks. These results raise questions about the relationship between long-term behavioral consequences and intervention strategies.
