The ganglioside patterns of cerebellum, cortex, pons-medulla, hypothalamus, hippocampus and caudate nucleus of three inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J and BALB/cJ) have been analysed. All brain areas contained both the simple and complex species of gangliosides. GD1a was the major ganglioside in cortex, hippocampus and caudate nucleus whereas GT1b was the major species in cerebellum, hypothalamus and pons-medulla. In hippocampus, the percentages of GT1b and GD1a were quite similar. Pons and medulla exhibited the highest levels of GM1 (which approaches the value of GT1b) and the lowest values of GD1a. A ganglioside, which was present in highest amounts in cerebellum disappeared after alkali treatment. Highly significant differences were observed in the amounts and patterns of gangliosides among brain areas of the three strains. Highly significant differences (p less than 0.001) were also found in the ganglioside distribution of various brain areas among the strains, especially for tri- and tetrasialogangliosides between Balb and DBA. A significant difference of GM1 was observed in the cerebellum when comparing DBA with the two other strains. It is likely that the differences might be related to their relative abundances in certain cell types and for defining synaptic circuits in brain areas of some strains.
