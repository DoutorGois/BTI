The local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) of control and 2 day corticosterone-administered rats was investigated using the method of Sokoloff (labelled 2-deoxy-D-glucose). The overall LCGU of both groups was similar, but discrete areas of the corticosterone-administered rat brains displayed both increases and decreases in their utilization of 2-deoxyglucose. These areas were associated with the limbic cortex and included the hippocampus, the septum and some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. It is well known that these regions are interconnected and that acetylcholine is one of the main neurotransmitters. Some of these pathways (as measured electrophysiologically) have reportedly inhibitory influences, whilst others have excitatory ones within the limbic region. It was therefore striking to observe that these inhibitory or stimulatory effects were corroborated by a selective, corticosterone-induced decrease or increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake, respectively. This gives corticosterone a putative role in the regulation of the limbic system. As the latter has been reported to be abnormal in genetically obese hypercorticosteronemic fa/fa rats, it is suggested that these corticosterone-induced changes within the limbic system may contribute to the overall phenotypic expression of this obesity state.
