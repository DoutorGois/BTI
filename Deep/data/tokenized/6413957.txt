Administration of TRH into the lateral ventricle of unanesthetized rats produced increases in the incidence of hippocampal theta (5.9-9.1 Hz) rhythm, locomotor activity and shaking behavior. The increase in theta rhythm produced by TRH was brief (less than 5 min) and was coincident with a brief, large increase in locomotor activity. Intracerebroventricular injection of either TRH or D-Ala2-metenkephalinamide (D-Ala2-ME) also induced episodes of shaking behavior. Shakes induced by D-Ala2-ME were associated with the occurrence of hippocampal epileptiform activity whereas those caused by TRH occurred in the absence of any recorded abnormalities in hippocampal activity. These results suggest that the increase in hippocampal theta rhythm after TRH is secondary to the increase in locomotor activity and, that in contrast to enkephalins, shaking behavior caused by TRH may not be related to an action on the electrographic activity of the hippocampus.
