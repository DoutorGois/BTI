Light and electron microscopic observation showed two types of neuronal immunostaining for basic fibroblast growth factor in the hippocampal CA2 subfield, where the densest immunoreactive neurons were localized in the brain. One neuronal type showed intense nuclear (eu- and heterochromatin) immunostaining but weak cytoplasmic immunostaining (N-type), and the other showed intense cytoplasmic but no or only faint nuclear immunoreactivity (C-type). The N-type also showed weak immunoreactivity in the perinuclear rough endoplasmic reticulum and contained bFGF mRNA as observed by in situ hybridization histochemistry, showed that this type can produces the bFGF protein. The N-type localized exclusively in the CA2 subfield. The C-type showed strong immunoreactivity on the rER, free ribosomes, and Golgi apparatus, although no clear evidence for bFGF production was observed. The multivesicular bodies, a pathway of endocytosis in hippocampal neurons showed apparent immunoreactivity under EM observation of both of types neurons (Parton et al. J. Cell Biol. 119: 123-137, 1992) suggesting a receptor-mediated type of incorporation of the bFGF.
