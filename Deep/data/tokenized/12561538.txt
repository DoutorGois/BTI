In order to explore the effects of zinc deficiency on the behavior, [Ca2+]i and active CaM contents of hippocampal cells of rats, 21 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, i.e. zinc deficiency group (ZD), pair-fed group (PF), and control group (CT) fed with zinc deficiency (ZD group) and normal diets (PF and CT group). At the end of the third week, the behavior in open-field test was observed. Then all the rats were killed and [Ca2+]i concentration and active CaM contents of hippocampal cells were determined by Fura-2 two wave-length fluorophotometry and flow cytometry respectively. It showed a significant difference between ZD and CT group in behavior was observed. [Ca2+]i concentration of ZD group was remarkably higher than that of CT and PF group. Active CaM contents of ZD and PF groups were significantly lower than that of CT group, and the active CaM content of ZD was also significantly lower than that of PF group. It showed that the effect of zinc deficiency on behaviors may be related with the changes in calcium status of hippocampal cells in growing rats.
