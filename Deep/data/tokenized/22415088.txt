BACKGROUND/AIMS: We have earlier found that indomethacin activates CaMKII, as a novel action distinct from COX inhibition. To explore further indomethacin actions, the present study focused upon PKC and examined the effect of indomethacin on alpha7 ACh receptor responses and hippocampal synaptic transmission through PKC. METHODS: We recorded currents through alpha7 ACh receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, quantified PKC activity in the in situ and cell-free PKC assay, and monitored field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) from the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. RESULTS: Indomethacin potentiated alpha7 ACh receptor currents in a bell-shaped concentration (100 nM-1 mM)-dependent manner, and the potentiating effect was inhibited by the PKC inhibitor GF109203X. Indomethacin activated PKC in a concentration (1-100 muM)-dependent manner for cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Additionally, indomethacin (100 muM) significantly activated PKC-epsilon under the cell-free conditions. Indomethacin (100 muM) induced a transient huge increase in the fEPSP slope followed by persistent increase, and the former effect was attenuated by the alpha7 ACh receptor antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin or GF109203X. Indomethacin (100 muM) also increased the rate of nicotine-evoked mEPSCs, and the effect was prevented by alpha-bungarotoxin or GF109203X. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study show that indomethacin activates PKC, possibly PKC-e in the brain, thereby potentiating alpha7 ACh receptor responses to stimulate presynaptic glutamate release, which in part contributes to facilitation of hippocampal transmission. This extends our knowledge about diverse indomethacin actions.
