OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of reconstruction of lost occlusal support on the biochemical changes of nervous system. METHODS: The changes of central nervous system metabolic compounds within hippocampus body were measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)HMRS) before and after denture restoration (six weeks) in seven patients with prolonged loss of occlusal support. RESULTS: (1)HMRS indicated that Cho/Cr decreased by 11.9% (P < 0.05) six weeks after denture restoration, MI/Cr decreased by 28.8% (P < 0.05), and NAA/CR increased by 4.8% (P > 0.05) within hippocampus body. CONCLUSIONS: Recovery of occlusal support facilitates improvement of neuron functions in patients' hippocampus, which may help improve the functions of nervous system.
