Maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) was derived from Wistar rats that just delivered the new offsprings. We examined the effect of this maternal IgG on infantile spasms induced by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in immature rats. Pup animals were treated subcutaneously with 10 mg/kg/day maternal IgG from day 11 to day 15 after birth followed by a single intraperitoneal dose of NMDA (15 mg/kg). Administration of maternal IgG decreased the severity and increased the number of ACTH immunoreactive cells in the cortex of rats with NMDA-induced spasms. Furthermore, maternal IgG inhibited NMDA-induced intracellular LDH activity in cultured hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that maternal IgG can attenuate NMDA-induced seizures. In infantile spasms, some factors may during pregnancy negatively affect the transfer of maternal IgG from mother to fetus thereby causing a decrease in the amount of protective maternal IgG.
