The hippocampal projection to the lateral septum was examined for use-dependent plasticity in a brain slice preparation using intracellular recording. Paired-pulse facilitation and posttetanic potentiation were present. Long-term potentiation (LTP) following high-frequency stimulation was observed after treatment with the GABAA antagonist bicuculline. A slow inhibitory synaptic potential also exhibited long-lasting potentiation after high-frequency stimulation. LTP of both components of the response was sensitive to NMDA antagonists.
