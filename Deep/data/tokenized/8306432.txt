Orthodromic and spontaneous population spike activity was measured in vitro in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices to determine maturational differences in excitability and susceptibility to K(+)-induced seizures. Several indices of excitability in the CA1 region changed in a non-monotonic fashion during maturation, in response to step-wise increases in bath [K+]. Slices from rats 18-22 days old, showed a greater probability of both spontaneous epileptiform activity and episodes of seizure-like activity followed by spreading depression, and more prolonged durations of evoked seizure-like events. Elevation of [K+] in the bathing medium increased these indices in a similar manner in older rats but not to the same degree as in 18- to 22-day-old rats. However, the threshold level of bath [K+] resulting in evoked bursts of population spikes was lower in adult and 28- to 32-day-old rats than in 18- to 22-day-old rats, suggesting that excitability is not uniformly greater at any given age. In 10- to 15-day-old rats, elevation of bath [K+] either produced persistent blockade of population responses, or increased the amplitude of the initial population spike, without producing bursts. Basal levels of [K+] in the interstitium of the slices corresponded to the various levels of [K+] placed in the bathing medium and there were no differences among age groups. Therefore, differences in basal [K+]o cannot account for the maturational changes in excitability and seizure activity. The period from 18-22 days of age in the rat is a useful focal point for investigating mechanisms underlying maturational changes in propensity to develop seizures.
