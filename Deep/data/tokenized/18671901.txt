BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to compare the expression of three glutamate transporter subtypes (GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAC1) in rats undergoing chest compression-induced global cerebral ischemia in the presence and absence of cerebral ischemia-related epilepsy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A reliable rat model of global cerebral ischemia-related epilepsy was established. The rats were divided into the following groups: sham surgery group (Group S), global cerebral ischemia without epilepsy (Group I) and global cerebral ischemia with epilepsy (Group E). The latter two groups were further divided into four subgroups based on time (24 hours, 72 hours, 5 days and 7 days) after 8 minutes of chest compression. Electroencephalographic recordings were obtained in all rats. Hippocampal tissue samples were prepared, and the expression of GLAST, GLT-1 and EAAC1 in the hippocampal CA1 region and the motor cortex area was studied using immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: Seizure developed in 32 (64%) of 50 rats. Compared with that in group I, the expression of GLT-1 in the hippocampal CA1 region and the motor cortex area in group E was down-regulated, and EAAC1 was up-regulated in those regions. CONCLUSION: Altering the expression of GLT-1 and EAAC1 through some means might lead them to be potential targets for therapy in cerebral ischemia-related epilepsy.
