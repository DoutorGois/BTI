Episodic memory, or the ability to form and retrieve conscious memories about specific past events, improves during childhood. Previous adult neuroimaging results indicate a central role of the hippocampus in episodic retrieval, but it is not clear whether the contribution of the hippocampus changes during development. Traditionally, developmental improvements in episodic retrieval have been thought to depend on strategic processes mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region that is considered to have a protracted course of development relative to the hippocampus. The primary goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the development of episodic retrieval is also associated with changes in hippocampal function. Children ages 8- to 11-years-old and adults ages 18-25 (N = 41) encoded black and white line drawings surrounded by either a green or red border. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired while participants attempted to recall which colour was originally paired with each drawing. Correct recall of item-colour pairings indicated successful episodic retrieval. Activity in the anterior hippocampus, but not in the posterior hippocampus, was associated with episodic retrieval in adults, whereas activity in the posterior, but not in the anterior hippocampus, was associated with episodic retrieval in children. Developmental differences were also found in regions in anterior lateral PFC and posterior parietal cortex. Overall, these results support the view that the development of episodic memory is supported by functional changes in the hippocampus as well as in other critical cortical regions.
