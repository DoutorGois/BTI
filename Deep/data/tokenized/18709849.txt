OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in diffuse axonal injury (DAI) in rat. METHODS: Eighty SD rats were used and samples were taken at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 3 d, and 7 d after brain injury. The expressions of NGF in cerebral cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, and hippocampus were studied with immunohistochemistry and compared with normal group and sham operation group. RESULTS: Low expression of NGF was observed in normal group and sham operation group. The expression of NGF increased 1 h after injury, peaked at 12 h, and returned to basal level at day 7. CONCLUSION: NGF is involved in repair of DAI. The changes of NGF expression following DAI may be applied to estimate the post-injury time interval of the brain in forensic medicine.
