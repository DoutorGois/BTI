The current view of the role of GABAergic interneurones in cortical-network function has shifted from one of merely dampening neuronal activity to that of an active role in information processing. In this review, we explore a potential role of hippocampal GABAergic interneurones in providing spatial and temporal conditions for modifications of synaptic weights during hippocampus-dependent memory processes. We argue that knowledge of spatiotemporal activity patterns in distinct classes of interneurone is essential to understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory.
