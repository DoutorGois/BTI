The presence in cholinergic nerve endings of muscarinic autoreceptors regulating the release of acetylcholine elicited by depolarizing stimuli was investigated in different areas of the rat brain. Synaptosomes prepared from cerebral cortex, hippocampus or corpus striatum were prelabeled with [3H]choline and the inhibitory effect of exogenous acetylcholine on the Ca2+-dependent release of [3H]acetylcholine evoked by 15 mM KCl was analyzed by superfusion. While acetylcholine was equally active in reducing its own release in hippocampus and cortex, it was much less effective in striatal synaptosomes. In contrast the values of several presynaptic cholinergic parameters ([3H]choline uptake, [3H]acetylcholine synthesis and release) were the highest in the striatum. Since experiments with slices showed that autoregulation of acetylcholine release through muscarinic receptors appeared to occur as efficiently in the striatum as in the two other areas, the present results suggest that in the striatum the autoregulation of acetylcholine release may not necessarily require the activation of autoreceptors located on cholinergic nerve terminals.
