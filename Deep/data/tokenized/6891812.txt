1. The possible role of the histamine system in the mechanism of action of the antidepressant drugs was proposed. 2. We studied the 3H-mepyramine binding to histamine H1-receptor following chronic treatment with different classes of antidepressant products which possess diverse pharmacological action at the synaptic level. 3. Administration of chlorimipramine in clinical dosage caused a complete disappearance of the 3H-mepyramine affinity for its receptor in the occipital cortex. The number of H1-receptors was decreased in the hypothalamus, the posterior hippocampus and the occipital cortex following chronic desipramine treatment. Nomifensine administration increased the Bmax in the anterior hippocampus while iprindole treatment have not affected the H1-receptor in the rat brain. 4. We conclude that the modification of H1-receptors is not a general property of antidepressants indicating that is not causally related to their main therapeutic action.
