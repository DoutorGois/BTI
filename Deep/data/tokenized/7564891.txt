The effect of prenatal protein malnutrition on release of monoamine neurotransmitters, their precursors and metabolites, from hippocampal slices was investigated in 15, 30, 90 and 220 days old male rats. The release of dopamine and its metabolites, tryptophan, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid from hippocampal slices of malnourished rats was greater than release from control slices at all ages studied. Malnutrition also significantly increased the release of normetanephrine but only in the 220 day age group. Potassium-induced depolarization increased release of tyrosine, normetanephrine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid less from slices of malnourished than from control rats. The release of norepinephrine, normetanephrine, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid increased significantly with age while the release of tyrosine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid decreased significantly with age. Age was also significantly associated with the effectiveness of potassium-induced depolarization in increasing release of tyrosine, norepinephrine, normetanephrine, tryptophan, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid.
