Cultures of primary embryonic rat brain hippocampus neurons with supporting glia cells were carried out on different substrates containing polypyrrole (PPy) and/or single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Neuron adhesion, neurites and dendrites branching elongation, and development of neuron networks on substrates were followed by phase-contrast optical microscopy and quantified to state cell survival and proliferation. Suspensions of as-grown and purified SWCNTs were sprayed on a glass coverslips and PPy/SWCNTs were deposited by potentiodynamic electrochemical deposition. Cell neurotoxicity revealed by neuron death was very high for purified SWCNTs substrates in good agreement with [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] (MTT) test showing lower viability on SWCNTs containing substrates compared with PPy-substrates and control samples probably due to the metal content and the carboxylic groups introduced during the purification. It is interesting to highlight that neurons grown on PPy-substrates adhere developing neurites and branching dendrites earlier even than on control cultures. On subsequent days the neurons are able to adapt to nanotube substrates developing neuron networks for 14-day cultures with similar patterns of complexity for control, PPy and PPy/SWCNT substrates. PPy/SWCNT substrates show a lower impedance value at frequencies under 1 Hz. We have come to the conclusion that glia cells and PPy added to the culture medium and substrates respectively, improve in some degree nanotube biocompatibility, cell adhesion and hence cell viability.
