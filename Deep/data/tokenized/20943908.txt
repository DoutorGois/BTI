A variety of epileptic seizure models have shown that activation of glutamatergic pyramidal cells is usually required for rhythm generation and/or synchronization in hippocampal seizure-like oscillations in vitro. However, it still remains unclear whether GABAergic interneurons may be able to drive the seizure-like oscillations without glutamatergic transmission. Here, we found that electrical stimulation in rat hippocampal CA1 slices induced a putative prototype of seizure-like oscillations ("prototypic afterdischarge," 1.8-3.8 Hz) in mature pyramidal cells and interneurons in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. The prototypic afterdischarge was abolished by GABA(A) receptor antagonists or gap junction blockers, but not by a metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist or a GABA(B) receptor antagonist. Gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings revealed that pyramidal cells were depolarized and frequently excited directly through excitatory GABAergic transmissions in each cycle of the prototypic afterdischarge. Interneurons that were actively spiking during the prototypic afterdischarge were mostly fast-spiking (FS) interneurons located in the strata oriens and pyramidale. Morphologically, these interneurons that might be "potential seizure drivers" included basket, chandelier, and bistratified cells. Furthermore, they received direct excitatory GABAergic input during the prototypic afterdischarge. The O-LM cells and most of the interneurons in the strata radiatum and lacunosum moleculare were not essential for the generation of prototypic afterdischarge. The GABA-mediated prototypic afterdischarge was observed later than the third postnatal week in the rat hippocampus. Our results suggest that an FS interneuron network alone can drive the prototypic form of electrically induced seizure-like oscillations through their excitatory GABAergic transmissions and presumably through gap junction-mediated communications.
