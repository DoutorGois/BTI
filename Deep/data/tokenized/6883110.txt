The specific benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro14-7437, in nanomolar concentrations, caused depolarization, increased spontaneous spiking, and conductance decrease when applied to CA1 cells in vitro. These effects were resistant to intracellularly injected Cl- ions or synaptic blockade by TTX, were prevented in Ca2+-free medium, and occurred with or without prior application of midazolam, an inhibitory benzodiazepine. Ca2+-mediated AHPs and Ca2+ spikes in TTX medium were diminished by the blocker, suggesting that Ro14-7437 acted by inhibiting Ca2+-mediated K+ conductance.
