The neuronal PAS domain protein 3 (NPAS3) gene encoding a brain-enriched transcription factor was recently found to be disrupted in a family suffering from schizophrenia. Mice harboring compound disruptions in the NPAS3 and related NPAS1 genes manifest behavioral and neuroanatomical abnormalities reminiscent of schizophrenia. Herein we demonstrate that Npas3-/- mice are deficient in expression of hippocampal FGF receptor subtype 1 mRNA, most notably in the dentate gyrus. In vivo BrdUrd-labeling shows that basal neural precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of Npas3-/- mice is reduced by 84% relative to wild-type littermates. We propose that a deficiency in adult neurogenesis may cause the behavioral and neuroanatomical abnormalities seen in Npas3-/- mice, and we speculate that impaired neurogenesis may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
