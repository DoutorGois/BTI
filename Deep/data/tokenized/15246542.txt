While one current focus for studying mechanisms of disease is investigation of transgenic mice confounding effects of the background strain often are neglected. We investigated mRNA expression of known markers of hypoxic tolerance by a semiquantitative RT-PCR (adenosine receptors (A1 and A3), nitric oxide synthases (eNOS and nNOS), APP production, progesterone receptor, and estrogen receptors alpha and beta) in CD-1, C3H, and B6 mice. We found differences in the baseline mRNA expression of adenosine A3 receptors in C3H mice and neuronal NOS in B6 mice as well as a distinct regulation of adenosine A3 receptors and estrogen receptor beta (no changes in C3H and B6 compared to upregulation in CD-1) on treatment of animals with a low dosage of 3-nitropropionate (20mg/kg body weight, i.p.). We conclude that the choice of background strain may confound interpretation of the effects of specific transgens in the study of the mechanisms of primary and induced hypoxic tolerance.
