The present study investigated the effects of hypothyroidism on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and proinflammatory cytokines in the dentate gyrus to elucidate the roles of COX2 in the hypothyroid hippocampus. Hypothyroidism was induced in rats by treating with 0.03% 2mercapto1methylimidazole dissolved in drinking water for 5 weeks. The animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. Hypothyroidism rats exhibited decreased triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels in the serum, while the levels of thyroidstimulating hormone and the weight of thyroid glands were significantly higher in the hypothyroid rats compared with those in the vehicletreated group. COX2 immunoreactivity was significantly increased in the hippocampal CA2/3 region and the dentate gyrus compared with the vehicletreated group. Levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)1beta, IL6 and tumor necrosis factoralpha were significantly higher in the hippocampal homogenates of hypothyroid rats. Cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation based on Ki67 and doublecortin immunohistochemistry were decreased in the dentate gyrus of hypothyroid rats compared with those in the vehicletreated group. These results suggested that hypothyroidismmediated COX2 expression affected hippocampal plasticity by upregulating the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus. Therefore, COX2 may be suggested as a candidate molecule for preventing hypothyroidisminduced neurological side effects.
