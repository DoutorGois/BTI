Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and permanent disability in the elderly. However, most of the experimental studies on stroke are based on young animals, and we hypothesised that age can substantially affect the stroke response. The two-vessel occlusion model of global ischemia by occluding the common carotid arteries for 15 min at 40 mmHg of blood pressure was carried out in 3- and 18-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The adhesion molecules E- and P-selectin, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), both intercellular (ICAM-1) and vascular (VCAM-1), as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cleaved caspase-3 were measured at 48 h after ischemia in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus using Western blot, qPCR and immunofluorescence techniques. Diametric expression of GFAP and a different morphological pattern of caspase-3 labelling, although no changes in the cell number, were observed in the neurons of young and old animals. Expression of E-selectin and CAMs was also modified in an age- and ischemia/reperfusion-dependent manner. The hippocampus and cerebral cortex had similar response patterns for most of the markers studied. Our data suggest that old and young animals present different time-courses of neuroinflammation and apoptosis after ischemic damage. On the other hand, these results suggest that neuroinflammation is dependent on age rather than on the different vulnerability described for the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These differences should be taken into account in searching for therapeutic targets.
