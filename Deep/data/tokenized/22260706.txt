The most recently identified PLC (phospholipase C) enzymes belong to the PLCeta family. Their unique Ca2+-sensitivity and their specific appearance in neurons have attracted great attention since their discovery; however, their physiological role(s) in neurons are still yet to be established. PLCeta enzymes are expressed in the neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. PLCeta2 is also expressed at high levels in pituitary gland, pineal gland and in the retina. Driven by the specific localization of PLCeta enzymes in different brain areas, in the present paper, we discuss the roles that they may play in neural processes, including differentiation, memory formation, circadian rhythm regulation, neurotransmitter/hormone release and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders associated with aberrant Ca2+ signalling, such as Alzheimer's disease.
