As part of the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus is considered to play a crucial role in associative memory. The reviewed data suggest that the dentate gyrus withstands the formation of plaques, tangles and neuronal death until late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, changes related to a disconnecting process, and more subtle intrinsic alterations, may contribute to disturbances in memory and learning observed in early stages of AD.
