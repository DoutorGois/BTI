A series of 5-aryl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ones was evaluated for anticonvulsant activity. In general the members of this series were prepared by the alkaline cyclization of 1-aroyl-4-alkylsemicarbazides. The resulting 2-unsubstituted 3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ones were then alkylated, yielding 2,4-dialkyl-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ones. Approximately one-third of the compounds examined exhibited activity against both maximal electroshock- and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in mice. Receptor-binding studies suggest that this activity was not a consequence of activity at either benzodiazepine or NMDA-type glutamate receptors. From this series, compound 45 was selected for further evaluation where it was also found to be active against 3-mercaptopropionic acid, bicuculline, and quinolinic acid induced seizures in mice. In addition, 45 also protected gerbils from hippocampal neuronal degeneration produced by either hypoxia or intrastriatal quinolinic acid injection.
