It has been proposed that signaling pathways involved in adaptive neural plasticity are long-term targets for the action of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT), which is widely used in the treatment of drug-resistant depression. We have previously performed EST analysis to identify some molecular machinery responsible for antidepressant effect. One of the cDNA fragments identified as antidepressant related genes/ESTs was identified as kf-1 which has a RING-H2 finger motif at the carboxy-terminus. In the present study, we have demonstrated the induction of kf-1 in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus not only after chronic antidepressant treatment, but also after a single and repeated ECT. RING finger proteins are proposed to play some important roles in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In conclusion, the current investigation has identified kf-1 as a novel molecular target for antidepressants and ECT.
