AIMS: Several physiological, pharmacological and behavioral lines of evidence suggest that the hippocampal formation is involved in nociception. The hippocampus is also believed to play an important role in the affective and motivational components of pain perception. Thus, our aim was to investigate the participation of cholinergic, opioidergic and GABAergic systems of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in the modulation of nociception in guinea pigs. MAIN METHODS: The test used consisted of the application of a peripheral noxious stimulus (electric shock) that provokes the emission of a vocalization response by the animal. KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that, in guinea pigs, microinjection of carbachol, morphine and bicuculline into the DH promoted antinociception, while muscimol promoted pronociception. These results were verified by a decrease and an increase, respectively, in the vocalization index in the vocalization test. This antinociceptive effect of carbachol (2.7 nmol) was blocked by previous administration of atropine (0.7 nmol) or naloxone (1.3 nmol) into the same site. In addition, the decrease in the vocalization index induced by the microinjection of morphine (2.2 nmol) into the DH was prevented by pretreatment with naloxone (1.3 nmol) or muscimol (0.5 nmol). At doses of 1.0 nmol, muscimol microinjection caused pronociception, while bicuculline promoted antinociception. SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate the involvement of the cholinergic, opioidergic and GABAergic systems of the DH in the modulation of antinociception in guinea pigs. In addition, the present study suggests that cholinergic transmission may activate the release of endorphins/enkephalin from interneurons of the DH, which would inhibit GABAergic neurons, resulting in antinociception.
