Anti-IgLON5-syndrome is known to be an antibody-mediated disease that mainly affects central structures in tegmentum and hippocampus and leads to associated symptoms like sleep-related disturbances, parkinsonism, chorea and limb ataxia. This is the first case of a patient with anti-IgLON5-syndrome and generalized fasciculations and neuromyotonic discharges in electromyography, suggesting that a peripheral involvement may occur in anti-Ig-Lon5-syndromes.
