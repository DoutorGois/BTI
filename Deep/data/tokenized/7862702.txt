Experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that the enhancing effect of nicotine on water maze performance in rats with lesions of the forebrain cholinergic projection systems (FCPS) is mediated by an interaction with the noradrenergic system, in particular the ascending dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNAB) and its projection areas. Three groups of rats received lesions of either: i) the nucleus basalis (NBM) and medial septal area/diagonal band (MSA/DB) by infusion of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-4-izoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) (FCPS group), ii) DNAB, by infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (NOR group), or iii) both FCPS plus DNAB (COMB group). Control animals received vehicle. Choline acetyltransferase activity was reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of the FCPS and COMB groups and in the hippocampus of the NOR group. NA level was reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of the FCPS and COMB groups, but not the FCPS group. In a reference memory task, the performance of both the NOR and COMB groups, but not the NOR group, was significantly worse than that of controls; there was no effect of nicotine administration (0.1 mg/kg) on escape latency or other measures in this task. In a working memory task, FCPS and COMB rats took longer to find the submerged platform on the second and following trials, and there was a significant enhancement of performance by nicotine in both groups, but not in controls. These results indicate that the enhancing effects of nicotine in rats with FCPS lesions are not mediated by an interaction with the DNAB.
