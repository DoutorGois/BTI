N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors have been implicated in many neurological disorders. Although NMDA receptors are best known for their high calcium permeability, the recently discovered NR3 subunits, NR3A and NR3B, have been shown to reduce the calcium permeability of the NMDA receptor. Thus, NR3 subunits may be important players in modulating synaptic plasticity in neurons. Although NR3B expression in the rodent and human brain has been studied, little is known about its distribution in different cell types. Here we used immunolabeling with a specific NR3B antibody together with antibodies against established neurochemical markers to determine the cellular and subcellular localization of NR3B. The nucleus was concurrently stained with NR3B immunolabeling to show that NR3B is widely expressed by many cells in each brain region. Our findings indicate that NR3B is widely expressed in the structures examined in the rat forebrain (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudoputamen, and nucleus accumbens), cerebellum, and lumbar sections of the spinal cord. Within these regions NR3B was found to be expressed in all the substructures of the hippocampus (CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus), the various layers of the cerebral cortex, projection neurons and interneurons of the striatum, different cell types of the cerebellum, and motor neurons of the spinal cord. Furthermore, when stained with NR1-the obligatory subunit responsible for forming functional NMDA receptors-the distribution of NR3B appears to be as ubiquitous as NR1. Taken together, our data suggest that there may be a population of NR3B-containing NMDA receptors conferring new functional roles in the mammalian central nervous system.
