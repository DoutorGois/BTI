In order to examine whether cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization is modulated by changes in serotonin receptor subtypes, we measured the binding of [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) to 5-HT1A receptors and of [3H]-ketanserin to 5-HT2 receptors in various brain regions of cocaine-treated and saline-treated (control) rats. As previously reported, repeated administration of cocaine resulted in behavioral sensitization. Stereotypic scores with the cocaine challenge were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in cocaine-pretreated animals than in the saline-pretreated group. Neither acute nor chronic cocaine administration significantly altered the number (Bmax) or the affinity (KD) of either [3H]8-OH-DPAT or [3H]ketanserin binding sites in any of the brain regions examined. These results suggest that the enhanced functional sensitivity of 5-HT1A or 5-HT2 receptor subtypes seen with cocaine may be associated with alterations in processes distal to receptors rather than changes in the number or the affinity of the receptors.
