AIMS: We have isolated a new muscarinic protein (MT-Mlalpha) from the venom of the Brazilian coral snake Micrurus lemniscatus. MAIN METHODS: This small protein, which had a molecular mass of 7,048Da, shared high sequence homology with three-finger proteins that act on cholinergic receptors. The first 12 amino acid residues of the N-terminal sequence were determined to be: Leu-Ile-Cys-Phe-Ile-Cys-Phe-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ala-His. KEY FINDINGS: The MT-Mlalpha was able to displace the [(3)H]QNB binding in the hippocampus of rats. The binding curve in competition experiments with MT-Mlalpha was indicative of two types of [(3)H]QNB-binding site with pK(i) values of 9.08+/-0.67 and 6.17+/-0.19, n=4, suggesting that various muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes may be the target proteins of MT-Mlalpha. The MT-Mlalpha and the M(1) antagonist pirenzepine caused a dose-dependent block on total [(3)H]inositol phosphate accumulation induced by carbachol. The IC(50) values for MT-Mlalpha and pirenzepine were, respectively, 33.1 and 2.26 nM. Taken together, these studies indicate that the MT-Mlalpha has antagonist effect on mAChRs in rat hippocampus. SIGNIFICANCE: The results of the present study show, for the first time, that mAChRs function is drastically affected by MT-Mlalpha since it not only has affinity for mAChRs but also has the ability to inhibit mAChRs.
