The undesired side-effects of haloperidol treatment include a number of extrapyramidal side-effects which have been proposed to result from drug-induced damage to the basal ganglia. The drug also causes irregular movements and locomotor patterns in experimental animals. Here we show that haloperidol treatment in rats is associated with increases in the expression of p53 and the ratio of pro-apoptotic (Bax) to anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2/Bcl-x(L)) proteins in the hippocampus and caudate putamen (CPu). In addition, haloperidol induces the DNA binding activity of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and concomitantly upregulates the levels of the phosphorylated form of IkappaBalpha protein in vivo. Similar responses are observed when a mouse hippocampal cell line (HT-22) is treated with haloperidol and/or vitamin E. Interestingly, all of these biochemical effects of haloperidol are significantly attenuated when animals or cultured cells are pretreated with alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E). Consistent with this, vitamin E is demonstrated to substantially reduce the haloperidol-induced impairment of locomotor activity in rats. Collectively, the data indicate the usefulness of vitamin E as an adjunct to haloperidol treatment and provide initial clues about the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in these effects.
