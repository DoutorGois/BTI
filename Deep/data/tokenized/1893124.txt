Influence of 4-E-BPE on the amplitude of population spices (PS) evoked in CA1 area by Shaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices were analysed. Bath application of 4-E-BPE (10(-6)-10(-5) M) led to a pronounced increase in the amplitude of the PS, the appearance of secondary PS and then introduction of GABA led to restoring original state. The 4-E-BPE was more potent than picrotoxin. These findings suggest that 4-E-BPE suppress inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of hippocampus.
