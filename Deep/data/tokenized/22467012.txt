Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a class of widely used flame retardants, are extensively diffused in the environment. Of particular concern are the reported highly sensitivity of PBDEs in children or developmental animals, however, almost no information is available on their potential effects on adults and the mechanisms are still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the neurotoxic effects of sub-chronic PBDE-47 exposure on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Thus, PBDE-47, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg per day was administered to rats by gavage for 30 days. The learning and memory function was tested by Morris water maze. Further, in order to explore the potential mechanism, the expression of NMDA-receptors was evaluated by using both immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-PCR. Our results showed that sub-chronic exposure to PBDE-47 produced learning and memory deficits in male adult rats. Also, significant decrease in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus areas of hippocampus affected by all three doses of PBDE-47 on the expression of NR(1), NR(2)B and Glu were found by IHC. In addition, the evaluation of expression of the NR(1), NR(2)B and NR(2)C showed statistically significant decrease in mRNA expression in rats exposed to PBDE-47. These findings showed that sub-chronic exposure to PBDE-47 could also induce behavioral alterations and the neurotoxic effects might due to the down-regulation expression of NMDA receptors. Our data indicated that the possibility of exposure of adults to PBDE-47 warranted further studies to characterize their potential neurotoxicity.
