A variety of processes limit NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR) activity in response to agonist exposure, including rundown--the decline of peak current with repeated, sustained agonist application. Here we report that calcium and tyrosine phosphorylation differentially regulate rundown of synaptic versus extrasynaptic NMDAR-mediated current in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons.
