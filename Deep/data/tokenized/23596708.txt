OBJECTIVE: To give the original research of diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) on learning and memory behavior, determine whether it can through blood-brain barrier and effect apoptosis of hippocampus cells in mice. METHODS: Accommodating 60 Kunming mice to the animal house for 3 days, then dividing the mice into 5 groups according to their weights. That is, one control group and four experimental groups (I group, 50 mg/kg BW. II group, 250mg/kg BW. III group, 500 mg/kg BW. IV group, 1000 mg/kg BW). The mice were fed with the corn oil in control group, and the other groups were fed with the related dose of diisobutyl phthalate mixture by gavages last for 8 weeks. At the end of experimental time, passive avoidance response was examined, then all of mice were killed, and choosed the brain tissues to test the DiBP content and apoptosis rate of hippocampal cells and hippocampal ultrastructural alterations on electron microscopy. RESULTS: In the passive avoidance response test, the exposed animals of IV group showed learning impairment as compared to unexposed mice (P < 0.05). DiBP was detected in III group and IV group, the mean content of them were (1.27 +/- 0.56) and (1.96 +/- 0.42) microg/g. The apoptosis rate of hippocampal cells (IV group vs control group) increase significantly (P < 0.05). Hippocampal ultrastructural were damaged in all dose-groups. CONCLUSION: As a result, in the experiments, exposure to DiBP could exert passive avoidance neurobehavioral effects. DiBP could through blood-brain barrier after oral intake, and disordered the way of apoptosis of hippocampal cells, and morphologic change of mitochondria mybe is the main reason of changes of neuron apoptosis.
