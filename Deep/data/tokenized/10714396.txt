PURPOSE: SGB-017 (ADCI) is a novel anticonvulsant that blocks both voltage-activated sodium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor-gated channels. Results by Rogawski et al. suggested that SGB-017 produces its anticonvulsant action primarily by inhibition of NMDA-receptor channels. However, SGB-017 is effective in several animal models of epilepsy that are unresponsive to NMDA antagonists. These results indicate that block of NMDA-receptor channels is not the only mechanism contributing to its anticonvulsant activity. Thus the effects of SGB-017 on neuronal sodium channels were investigated. METHODS: Whole cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to record sodium currents in freshly dissociated rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and hippocampal neurons and cultured human NT2 neurons. The effects of SGB-017 on the amplitude of sodium currents, elicited by a depolarizing pulse to 0 mV from different holding potentials, were measured and compared with those of carbamazepine (CBZ). RESULTS: SGB-017 inhibited sodium currents in rat SCG and hippocampal neurons with a similar potency to CBZ. Like CBZ, the inhibition of sodium channels by SGB-017 was voltage dependent. Its median inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibition of sodium channels at depolarized holding potentials is similar to that for its inhibition of NMDA receptor channels. In human hNT2 neurons, SGB-017 was more potent than CBZ at inhibiting sodium currents. CONCLUSIONS: SGB-017 produces its anticonvulsant activity by blocking both sodium- and NMDA-receptor channels in a voltage- and use-dependent manner. The combination of these two mechanisms of action makes SGB-017 an effective AED in several different animal models of epilepsy.
