Based on behavioral procedures aimed at measuring working or data-based memory for spatial location, response, and visual object information, it is shown that there is a triple dissociation among the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and extrastriate visual cortex in mediating spatial location, response, and visual object information, respectively. The hippocampus appears to subserve only spatial location, the caudate nucleus only response, and the extrastriate visual cortex only visual object information. The results support the neurobiological foundation of the attribute memory model.
