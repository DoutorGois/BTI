The concentration of immunoreactive insulin (IRI) extracted from the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala, midbrain, and hindbrain was significantly lower in obese (fa/fa) and heterozygous (Fa/fa) Zucker rats in comparison to lean (Fa/Fa) Zucker rats. This deficit in brain IRI content was most severe in the hypothalamus and olfactory bulb and was independent of severe obesity since the marked reduction of brain IRI content was also found in heterozygous rats which possessed only one copy of the fa allele. These results demonstrate that in the 2-3 month-old female Zucker rat, the fa allele is associated with defective regulation of insulin in the brain.
