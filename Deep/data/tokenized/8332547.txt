Since previous studies in vivo have shown that oxytocin is metabolized by rat synaptic membrane-bound aminopeptidase- and endopeptidase-like enzymes, the proteolytic conversion of oxytocin was studied in vivo after microinjection in the rat hippocampus, a brain area that contains oxytocinergic nerve endings and receptors. Isolation of the formed peptide fragments from the injected brain area after homogenization and adsorption on a Sep-Pak cartridge by high performance liquid chromatography, and their characterization by amino acid analysis, revealed that, when oxytocin (50 nmol in 0.5 microliter) was microinjected in the CA1 field of the rat hippocampus, only the N-terminal fragment oxytocin(1-8) was formed in such amount that could be characterized. The microinjection of [3H-Tyr2]oxytocin (10 pmol) revealed that in addition to oxytocin(1-8), free [3H]tyrosine was formed. Taken together with previous findings showing that C-terminal oxytocin fragments as well oxytocin(1-8) are formed by membrane-bound aminopeptidases and endopeptidases in vitro, respectively, the results suggest that, in addition to aminopeptidases, endopeptidase-like enzymes are involved in the proteolysis of endogenous brain oxytocin.
