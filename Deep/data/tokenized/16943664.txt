Traumatic brain injury (TBI) to postnatal day 17 rats has been shown to produce acute changes in hippocampal global protein levels and spatial learning and memory deficits. The purpose of the present study was to analyze global hippocampal protein changes 2 weeks after a moderate ipsilateral controlled cortical impact in postnatal day 17 rats using 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Paired sham and ipsilateral injured hippocampal lysates were independently labeled with different fluorescent cyanine dyes and coseparated within the same immobilized pH gradient strips and slab gel based on isoelectric point and molecular mass. Significant changes in key proteins involved in glial and neuronal stress, oxidative metabolism, calcium uptake and neurotransmitter function were found 2 weeks after injury, and their potential roles in hippocampal plasticity and cognitive dysfunction were discussed.
