The asymmetric synthesis of (2R,1'S,2'R, 3'S)-2-(2'-carboxy-3'-phenylcyclopropyl)glycine (PCCG-13), a trisubstituted carboxycyclopropylglycine endowed with unusual stereochemical features, is described. Preliminary biological evaluation demonstrates PCCG-13 as a very potent and selective competitive antagonist for the novel class of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors coupled to the activity of phospholipase D (PLD). PCCG-13 is therefore a useful tool for the exploration of the physiopathological role of this novel class of receptors.
