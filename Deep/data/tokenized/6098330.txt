The specific binding of [3H]kainic acid to hippocampal membranes was examined autoradiographically in rats kindled by tetanic stimulation of the amygdala or angular bundle. One day after the last of 3 class 4-5 kindled seizures, the specific binding of [3H]kainic acid in stratum lucidum of area CA3 was 47-61% less than in electrode-implanted unstimulated controls. Specific binding in the inner third of the dentate molecular layer was reduced to a lesser degree. These observations demonstrate that kainic acid receptors are down-regulated by kindling stimulation.
