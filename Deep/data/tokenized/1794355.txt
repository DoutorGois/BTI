An on-line enzymatic assay of dialysis fluid has been used to monitor the extracellular glutamate concentration in the rat hippocampus. Perfusion with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing a glutamate uptake inhibitor (either dihydrokainate or 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2' disulfonic acid) produced a marked stable increase in glutamate concentration; 10 min perfusion with 100 mM K+ produced a transient increase. Sustained epileptiform EEG discharges were induced in the hippocampus by focal injection of bicuculline into the piriform cortex or by systemic injection of picrotoxin. Extracellular glutamate did not change significantly during seizure activity, either in the absence or in the presence of glutamate uptake inhibitors. It is concluded that seizure activity is not necessarily accompanied by an overall increase in extracellular glutamate concentration.
