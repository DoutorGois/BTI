Glutamate receptor channels are synthesized in the cell body, are inserted into intracellular vesicles, and move to dendrites where they become incorporated into synapses. Dendrites contain abundant microtubules that have been implicated in the vesicle-mediated transport of ion channels. We have examined how the inhibition of microtubule motors affects synaptic transmission. Monoclonal antibodies that inactivate the function of dynein or kinesin were introduced into hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells through a patch pipette. Both antibodies substantially reduced the AMPA receptor-mediated responses within 1 hr but had no effect on the NMDA receptor-mediated response. Heat-inactivated antibody or control antibodies had a much smaller effect. A component of transmission appeared to be resistant even to the combination of these inhibitors, and we therefore explored whether other agents also produce only a partial inhibition of transmission. A similar resistant component was found by using an actin inhibitor (phalloidin) or an inhibitor of NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein)/GluR2 interaction. We then examined whether these effects were independent or occluded each other. We found that a combination of phalloidin and NSF/GluR2 inhibitor reduced the response to approximately 30% of baseline level, an effect only slightly larger than that produced by each agent alone. The addition of microtubule motor inhibitors to this combination produced no further inhibition. We conclude that there are two components of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission; one is a labile pool sensitive to NSF/GluR2 inhibitors, actin inhibitors, and microtubule motor inhibitors. A second, nonlabile pool resembles NMDA receptor channels in being nearly insensitive to any of these agents on the hour time scale of our experiments.
