Flexible navigation demands knowledge of boundaries, routes and their relationships. Within a multi-path environment, a subpopulation of subiculum neurons robustly encoded the axis of travel. The firing of axis-tuned neurons peaked bimodally, at head orientations 180 degrees apart. Environmental manipulations showed these neurons to be anchored to environmental boundaries but to lack axis tuning in an open arena. Axis-tuned neurons thus provide a powerful mechanism for mapping relationships between routes and the larger environmental context.
