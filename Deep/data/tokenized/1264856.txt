The influence of acetylcholine, physostigmine, and carbachole administered systemically in aqueous solutions and the volume of 2 or 3 mul to dorsal hippocampus (DH) or basal amygdaloid nucleus (BA) on rabbit's EEG and behaviour in chronic experiment was examined. EEGs were recorded from anterior cingular gyrus, DH, BA and medial hypothalamus. The excitation or attack activities after the administered compounds and of the receptors sensitive to acetylcholine in DH and BA were stated. Moreover, a strong functional connection of DH and BA was observed.
