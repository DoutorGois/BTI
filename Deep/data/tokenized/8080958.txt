We have examined the epileptic brain damage generated by intra-amygdaloid administration of kainic acid (KA). In the vulnerable CA3 region of the rat hippocampus, neurones developed apoptotic properties since, (i) their nuclei were positively stained with a selective in situ DNA fragmentation staining method; (ii) DNA cleavage into internucleosome-sized fragments was observed on agarose gels. Our results suggest that epileptic seizures generated in the amygdala by KA trigger apoptotic cell damage in pyramidal CA3 neurones.
