PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of in situ lipid-protein-sugar particles (LPSPs) in mitigating the epileptogenic and histologic effects of intrahippocampal pilocarpine in rats. METHODS: LPSPs with and without muscimol were produced by spray-drying, sized by Coulter counter, and muscimol content determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HLPC). Particles, free muscimol or saline, were injected into the hippocampi of Sprague-Dawley rats before 40 mM pilocarpine, and seizure activity was scored. The trajectories of behavioral scores between groups were compared with two-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Animals were killed after 2 weeks. Brain sections were stained (Timm and thionin) and scored. RESULTS: LPSPs were 4 to 5 microm in diameter, and contained 0 or 2% (wt/wt) muscimol. In vitro, muscimol was released over a 5-day period. Intrahippocampal injections of normal saline and blank LPSPs did not deter seizure activity from pilocarpine. The rise of the trajectory in behavior scores in animals given LPSPs containing 5 microg muscimol was significantly slower than in those receiving saline, blank particles, or 5 microg of unencapsulated muscimol. There was less apparent neuronal injury and CA3 and supragranular mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampi of animals receiving muscimol-containing particles than in animals that did not receive muscimol. Hippocampi of animals that received 5 microg of encapsulated muscimol showed less supragranular sprouting than did those receiving 5 microg of unencapsulated muscimol, but showed no difference in cell loss or CA3 sprouting. CONCLUSIONS: Focally delivered biodegradable microparticles loaded with muscimol are effective in reducing seizure activity from pilocarpine in animals and mitigate the histologic effects.
