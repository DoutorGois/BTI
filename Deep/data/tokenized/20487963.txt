Some properties of muscarinic cholinoceptors and benzodiazepine receptors in selected brain regions of guinea-pigs and rats were compared under identical experimental conditions. The regions investigated were striatum, hippocampus and pons-medulla, and the properties examined were the concentrations of receptors; apparent dissociation constants of the ligands [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (for muscarinic receptors) and [(3)H]flunitrazepam (for benzodiazepine receptors); Hill coefficients for the interactions of the antagonist atropine and the agonist acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors; the affinities of these compounds for the muscarinic receptors; and the effects of chronic administration of an organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor (di-isopropylfluorophosphate) on the concentrations of receptors. Rat striatal and hippocampal muscarinic receptors were found to have a slightly higher affinity for acetylcholine than the corresponding guinea-pig receptors. Administration of di-isopropylfluorophosphate reduced the concentration of muscarinic receptors in rat brain by 30%, but had no significant effect on the concentration of receptors in guinea-pig brain. In all other aspects, the properties of the brain receptors of the two species were very similar. For both species, the affinities of the muscarinic receptors for acetylcholine were higher in the pons-medulla than in the striatum and hippocampus. This was found to be the result of differences in the values of the association constants of the high- and low-affinity states of the receptors, rather than because of varying proportions of two states which have the same association constant in all regions. The insensitivity of guinea-pig brain muscarinic receptors to chronic administration of an organophosphate confirms the results of a previous study on the guinea-pig alone, and makes this system unique. Many other studies on various species have all indicated that prolonged activation of a receptor by an agonist (caused in the present work by inactivation of acetyl-cholinesterase) leads to a decrease in the concentration of the receptor.
