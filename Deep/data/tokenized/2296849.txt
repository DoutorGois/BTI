The distribution of the nerve growth factor precursor(proNGF)-like immunoreactivity was examined in the adult rat brain with affinity-purified antisera directed against synthetic peptides that reproduce sequences of the precursor protein. Immunoreactivity was localized in defined areas of the neocortex, hippocampal formation, thalamus/hypothalamus, striatum, olfactory bulb, pons and spinal cord, which are regions previously reported to contain NGF mRNA. Interestingly, immunoreactivity was also observed in the septum and diagonal band of Broca known to contain very low NGF mRNA levels. Using immunohistochemical methods combined with the retrograde transport of a protein gold complex we demonstrate that proNGF-like immunoreactivity is localized within neuronal cell bodies, in the cortex, hippocampus and septum. These results suggest that the immunological approach may not only identify NGF-synthesizing cells, but also cells which may accumulate proNGF or some cleavage products by an uptake mechanism.
