Rats reared in social isolation exhibit a syndrome of behavioral and biochemical effects indicative of enhanced mesolimbic dopamine (DA) function. The precise nature of the neurodevelopmental changes that produce this state are unknown but result in enhanced DA neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAC). It was hypothesized that this may be the indirect result of chronic changes in glutamate NMDA receptor function. The same prediction has been made for Fawn hooded (FH) rats that exhibit some of the characteristic effects of isolation-reared rats when compared to Wistar rats. Therefore, mRNA levels of the NMDAR1A receptor subunit were determined by in situ hybridization and were quantified in the striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of FH and Wistar rats. Isolation rearing alone was not found to have an effect on the expression of NMDAR1A, while FH rats had reduced levels across most brain regions examined. In some areas of the striatum and prefrontal cortex, this effect was greater in FH isolates than in FH socials, while in the hippocampus, the opposite was observed.
