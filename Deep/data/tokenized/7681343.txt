Turnover of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and their metabolites has been measured after a 15-day vitamin E-deficient diet in adult hippocampus. Moreover, we have measured in vitro receptor binding of [3H]5-HT in hippocampal membranes from control and vitamin E-deficient rats. Turnover rates of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-hydroxy-3-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) have been assayed from the disappearance rates after blocking by pargyline inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO). DA, NA, 5-HT, normetanephrine (NMN) and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) turnover rates have been measured as accumulation rates of DA, NA, 5-HT, NMN and 3-MT after pargyline inhibition of MAO. An increase was found in the turnover rate of DA between control and experimental animals. In contrast, no changes were found in the turnover rate of 3-MT and DOPAC. No change was found in the turnover rate of NA although there was an increase of the turnover rate of NMN in vitamin E-deficient diets. No changes was found in the turnover rate of 5-HT although there was a decrease of 5-HIAA turnover rate in the animals fed on a low vitamin-E diet. With respect to the 5-HT1 receptors, no changes were found in the affinity (kd) but the receptor number (Bmax) was increased in vitamin E-deficient rats.
