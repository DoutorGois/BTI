For the past decade, estrogen actions rapid in onset, short in duration through the putative membrane estrogen receptor have attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, there is so far limited evidence for estrogenic nongenomic regulation of the adenyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA system, especially in the brain. The present study reconfirms that 17beta-estradiol induces membrane-mediated PKA activation with a short latency in a living hippocampal neural cell with use of BSA-conjugated beta-estradiol which does not reach the nuclear estrogen receptor following my previous publication.
