Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus of awake animals is known to be reversed by long trains of low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Here we show that a persistent LTP reversal, i.e. depotentiation (DP), can be induced in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats by brief 7 Hz stimulations (three trains of 100 pulses, 1 min intertrain-interval) if LFS was applied 2 min after tetanization. In contrast, the same LFS protocol given 15 min after tetanization failed to induce long-lasting DP. Likewise, reduction of LFS (given 2 min post-tetanus) to two trains resulted only in short-term DP. Because naturally occurring hippocampal 7 Hz oscillatory events are correlated to new sensory input, our results might be relevant for the understanding of the mechanisms of LTP reversal induced by processing new information.
