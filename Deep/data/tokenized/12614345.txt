We investigated the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) isoforms in CG-4 rodent oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPC) and rat brain oligodendrocytes. Our RT-PCR analysis detected mRNAs for mGluR3 and mGluR5 isoforms in OPCs. Although neurons express both mGluR5a and mGluR5b splice variants, only mGluR5a was identified in OPCs. Antibodies to mGluR2/3 and mGluR5 detected the corresponding receptor proteins in immunoblots of OPC membrane fractions. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis identified mGluR5 in oligodendrocyte marker O4-positive OPCs. The expression of mGluR5 was also demonstrated in oligodendrocyte marker (O4 and O1) positive cells in white matter of postnatal 4- and 7-day-old rat brain sections using immunofluorescent double labelling and confocal microscopy. The mGluR5 receptor function was assessed in CG-4 OPCs with fura-2 microfluorometry. Application of the mGluR1/5 specific agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) induced calcium oscillations, which were inhibited by the selective mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP). The DHPG induced calcium oscillations required Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. In OPCs the group II mGluR agonist (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) decreased forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis, indicating the presence of functional mGluR3. The newly identified mGluR3 and mGluR5a may be involved in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes, myelination and the development of white matter damage.
