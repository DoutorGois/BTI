Gastrointestinal microbiota and its organisms are related to the brain and affect brain functioning including memory and learning. In this study we hence investigated the effects of probiotics on memory and oxidative stress biomarkers in an experimental model of Alzheimer's disease. Sixty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: Controls (C), control-probiotics (CP) that received probiotics for 8 weeks, sham operation (S) that had intra hippocampal PBS injection, Alzheimer (Abeta) that had the Abeta 1-42 intra-hippocampal injection and the Alzheimer-probiotics (AP) group, which in addition to being injected Abeta 1-42, received 2g (1010CFU) probiotics (L.acidophilus, L.fermentum, B.lactis, B.longum) for 8 weeks. Memory and learning were measured using the Morris water maze and oxidative stress biomarkers in the hippocampus, using ELISA kits. Morris water maze results indicated that using probiotics, in the Alzheimer-probiotics group, significantly improved spatial memory including scape latency, traveled distance and time spent in target quadrant. There was also improvement in oxidative stress biomarkers such as increased malondialdehyde levels and superoxide dismutase activity following the beta-amyloid injection. Overall, it seems that probiotics play an effective role in improving memory deficit and the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease by modifying microbiota.
