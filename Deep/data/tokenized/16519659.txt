The oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) has until recently been regarded as a lineage-restricted precursor cell. Considerable interest has been generated by reports suggesting that OPCs may possess a wider differentiation potential than previously assumed and thus be considered a multipotential stem cell. This study examined the neuronal differentiation potential of rat, postnatal cortical OPCs in response to extracellular cues in vitro and in vivo. OPCs did not exhibit intrinsic neuronal potential and were restricted to oligodendrocyte lineage potential following treatment with the neural precursor mitogen fibroblast growth factor 2. In contrast, a postnatal hippocampal astrocyte-derived signal(s) is sufficient to induce functional neuronal differentiation of cortical OPCs in vitro in population and single cell studies. Co-treatment with Noggin, a bone morphogenetic protein antagonist, did not attenuate neuronal differentiation. Following transplantation to the adult rat hippocampus, cortical OPCs expressed doublecortin, a neuroblast-associated marker. The present findings show that hippocampal, astrocyte-derived signals can induce the neuronal differentiation of OPCs through a Noggin-independent mechanism.
