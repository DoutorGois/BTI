Losigamone is an anticonvulsant both in vivo and in vitro. We here studied possible mechanisms for such effects with conventional intracellular recordings from pyramidal cells of area CA1 and entorhinal cortex in combined hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices. Losigamone reversibly reduced the number of action potentials elicited by 1 s long depolarising current injections. In addition, the drug moderately reduced EPSP amplitudes while monosynaptic fast and slow IPSPs were unaffected.
