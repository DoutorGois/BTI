We have taken advantage of the sequence conservation in the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily to isolate a fragment of a novel G protein-coupled receptor sequence using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of human genomic DNA. Screening of human genomic and hippocampal cDNA libraries with this amplified receptor fragment revealed a number of related sequences. Sequence analysis of four genomic clones and one cDNA clone clearly identifies these as related members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, as the deduced amino acid sequence reveals putative transmembrane domains and conserved amino acid residues. Southern blot analysis of restriction digests of human genomic DNA indicates that these receptor subtypes are likely to belong to a family of related genes. One of the proposed receptor sequences indicates the presence of pseudogenes in this family. Based on the homology of these sequences to a family of recently described receptors expressed exclusively in rat olfactory epithelium, it is suggested that these receptors represent a family of human odorant receptors.
