Use of phencyclidine (PCP) in rodents can mimic some aspects of schizophrenia. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Growing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In this study, we focused on inflammatory responses as target of PCP for inducing schizophrenia-like symptoms. 3-month-old C57BL/6J mice received daily injections of PCP (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline for one week. PCP-injected mice produced schizophrenia-like behaviours including impaired spatial short-term memory assessed by the Y-maze task and sensorimotor gating deficits in a prepulse inhibition task. Simultaneously, chronic PCP administration induced astrocyte and microglial activation in both the cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta was significantly up-regulated in PCP administrated mice. Furthermore, PCP treatment decreased ratio of the phospho-Ser9 epitope of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) over total GSK3beta, which is indicative of increased GSK3beta activity. These data demonstrate that chronic PCP in mouse produces inflammatory responses and GSK3beta activation.
