The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of gamma-Glutamylcysteine Ethyl Ester (GCEE) on the levels of GSH, caspase-3 activity, DNA damage and the expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and p53 mRNAs in rat hippocampus after status epilepticus (SE) induced by systemic kainic acid (KA). The male rats were divided into four groups as controls, KA (10 mg/kg), GCEE (10 mg/kg) and KA+GCEE. Glutathione (GSH) levels and caspase-3 activity were determined spectrophotometrically and colourimetrically, respectively. DNA damage and Bcl-2, Bax and p53 mRNA expressions were quantified by comet assay and reverse transcription followed by RT-PCR, respectively. KA treatment significantly depleted GSH levels, induced DNA damage, caspase-3 activity and the expressions of p53 and Bax mRNA. GCEE treatment protected GSH levels, decreased DNA damage and the levels of p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA against KA injection. These results indicate that GCEE treatment at the dose of 10 mg/kg is capable to protect the depleted levels of GSH and shows an anti-apoptotic activity due to the decreased levels of apoptotic biomarkers in the rat hippocampus after SE induced by KA.
