Recent cloning studies have isolated proteins which confer responsiveness to calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In this study, we have determined the central nervous system (CNS) distribution of the mRNA of one such protein, termed CGRP-receptor component protein (RCP), by in situ hybridization. CGRP-RCP mRNA was widely expressed in the guinea-pig CNS, being particularly abundant in cerebellum and hippocampus. These data should assist in the determination of the potential physiological function(s) of this protein in the CNS.
