Repeated audiogenic seizures (4 times a day for 14 days), in genetically selected sensitive mice, induce a significant decrease in GABA level in the following brain areas: nucleus caudatus, posterior colliculus, occipital and frontal cortex, cerebellum, substantia nigra, hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal cortex. No variations were observed in olfactory bulbs, pons medulla, hypothalamus, thalamus, or cochlear area.
