Several reports have indicated that the two glutamate receptor antagonists, dizocilpine (that binds to the phencyclidine recognition site of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor) and NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline, that binds to the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole) receptor), protect neurons against damage caused by hypoxia, ischemia or excitotoxicity. We, therefore, used a combination of these drugs to achieve enhanced neuroprotection. Primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons were challenged by glutamate intoxication. Both dizocilpine and NBQX produced dose-dependent increases in the percentage of viable neurons. Combined treatment with both glutamate receptor antagonists had an over-additive neuroprotective effect. Simultaneous administration of dizocilpine and NBQX also had a pronounced neuroprotective effect in vivo in mice subjected to focal cerebral ischemia and rats with global forebrain ischemia. This suggest that such a combination may have therapeutic relevance.
