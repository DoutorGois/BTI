BACKGROUND: The neuroinflammation characterized by glial activation and release of proinflammatory mediators is considered to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb radix Stephania tetrandra, has been demonstrated to decrease the expression of proinflammatory mediators by inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. The purpose of the study was to investigate effects of tetrandrine on experimental model of AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tetrandrine was administered in a rat model of AD induced by amyloid-beta (Abeta)(1-42). The learning and memory impairment was examined using Morris water maze; the extent of histological injury in hippocampus was determined by Nissl staining; NF-kappaB DNA binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay; the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in learning and memory impairment in rats with tetrandrine, and the increase in NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, the over-expression in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha as well as the increased histological injury in hippocampus in rats induced by Abeta(1-42) were significantly reduced following administration of tetrandrine. CONCLUSION: Tetrandrine could significantly ameliorate Abeta(1-42)-induced spatial learning and memory impairment, and the beneficial effect of tetrandrine treatment could be linked, at least in part, to the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity and the downregulation of expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, suggesting that administration of tetrandrine may provide a therapeutic approach for AD.
