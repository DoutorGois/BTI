The hippocampal formation is a highly conserved structure of the medial pallium that works in association with the entorhinal cortex, playing a key role in memory formation and spatial navigation. Although it has been described in several vertebrates, the presence of comparable subdivisions across species remained unclear. This panorama has started to change in recent years thanks to the identification of some of the genes that regulate the development of the hippocampal formation in the mouse and help to delineate its subdivisions based on molecular features. Some of these genes have been used to try to identify subdivisions in chicken and lizards comparable to those of the mammalian hippocampal formation and the entorhinal cortex. Here, we review some of these data, which suggest the existence of fields comparable to the dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1, subiculum, as well as medial and lateral parts of the entorhinal cortex in all amniotes. We also analyze available data suggesting the existence of serial connections between these fields, speculate on the possible existence of auto-associative loops in CA3, and discuss general principles governing the formation of the connections.
