Denzimol, a new anticonvulsant drug with a pharmacological profile similar to that of phenytoin, enhances the ataxic and antimetrazol activity of diazepam in rats without affecting its activity against picrotoxin-induced seizures. In vivo and ex vivo denzimol enhances the binding of 3H-flunitrazepam in cortex and in hippocampus but not in cerebellum. The possibility of this increase in the number of benzodiazepine binding sites contributing in some way to enhancement of the depressive and anticonvulsant activity of diazepam is discussed.
