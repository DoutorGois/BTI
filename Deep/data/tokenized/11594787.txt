cDNA coding for the alpha chain of the rat interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), cloned and sequenced. The nucleic acid coding sequence exhibited 88% and 68% homology with the mouse and human IL-10 receptor sequences, respectively. The translated protein exhibited 83% and 61% homology with the mouse and human IL-10 receptor proteins. Specific antibodies were raised to the extracellular domain of the rat IL-10 receptor expressed as a secreted protein in recombinant Drosophila S2 cells. Western blotting using these antibodies demonstrated the presence of the IL-10 receptor in five major regions of the rat brain (cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary), supporting a role for IL-10 as a central regulator of inflammation.
