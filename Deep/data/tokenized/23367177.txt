Long-term potentiation (LTP) has long been understood as an increase in the potency of a synaptic connection between two neurons. In this study, we combine a previously developed two-stage cascade model with electrophysiological recordings of rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells both before and after LTP to analyze linear and nonlinear contributions of pre and post-synaptic partners to the strengthening of their synaptic connectivity. The result suggests that the major nonlinear expression locus of LTP exists in the post-synaptic side. Additionally, the report reveals that LTP should be understood not only in the traditional view as a change in the magnitude of communication between two cells, but also as a change in their temporal coding properties of information exchange.
