OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antidepressant-like effect of electroacupuncture (EA) in a validated rat model. METHODS: Wistar Kyoto rats, a valid animal model of depression, were randomly divided into two groups, EA (n = 7) and placebo control (n = 6). EA treatment was given once a day, 5 days a week, for 3 weeks. Two acupoints, GV14 (Dazhui) and GV20 (Baihui), respectively on the cervical spine and scalp, were selected. EA frequency was held constant at 2Hz (2 pulses/second), pulse width 0.3-ms, and intensity was adjusted to 3 mA. Forced swim tests (FST), open field tests (OFT; e.g., a. rearing and grooming, b. distance traveled within a central area, c. time spent in central area, and d. total distance traveled), and the Morris Water Maze test (MWM) were conducted 3 weeks after the initial treatment. RESULTS: In the FST, there was significant difference between EA and control (P < 0.05) in immobility. In the OFT, there were significant differences between EA and control (P < 0.05) in rearing and grooming (P < 0.05). In the MWM, there were significant differences between treatment and control in frequency of crossing the platform (P < 0.05) and its surrounding area (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that EA enhances memory and improves depression-related behaviors in a rat model of depression. This suggests that the modality may have therapeutic effects on depression in humans. Electroacupuncture may act on depression by protecting nerve cells in the hippocampus.
