In the present study we determined the effect of repeated administration of manganese chloride on the binding parameters of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB) in striatum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus of mice. Daily intraperitoneal injections of manganese chloride (5 mg Mn/kg) 5 d/wk during 9 wk did not alter the receptor density (Bmax) and the dissociation constant (Kd) of 3H-QNB in the different brain regions studied. These results suggest that chronic treatment with manganese does not affect the binding characteristics of 3H-QNB to the cholinergic muscarinic receptors in mouse brain.
