OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation of age-related hearing loss and cognition impairment in C57BL/6J mice by observing hearing, cognitive function and synapses. METHODS: C57BL/6J and CBA/CaJ mice were divided into 3 groups. The hearing and cognitive functions of each animal was tested. And the ultrastructure of synapses was simultaneously observed for C57BL/6J mice. RESULTS: The 24-26-week-old C57BL/6J mice developed moderate hearing loss while the 42-44-week-old C57BL/6J counterparts suffered profound hearing loss. Whereas excellent hearing was maintained in 3 groups of CBA/CaJ mice within 44 weeks. During cognitive test, the performance of 42-44-week-old C57BL/6J mice was significantly worse than CBA/CaJ mice. During probe test, the number of platform crossing of 42-44-week-old C57BL/6J mice was smaller than that of CBA/CaJ mice (0.5 +/- 0.6 vs 1.9 +/- 1.6; P < 0.05). The 42-44-week-old C57BL/6J mice had a wider synaptic cleft and a thinner postsynaptic density than the 24-26-week-old C57BL/6J counterparts [synaptic cleft: (19.4 +/- 0.5) nm vs (11.9 +/- 0.7) nm; postsynaptic density: (15.2 +/- 0.5) nm vs (27.8 +/- 2.0) nm; both P < 0.05]. Furthermore, the degeneration of synapses in hippocampus CA3 area of C57BL/6J mice were clearly observed at 42 - 44 weeks of age, but not seen in CBA/CaJ mice. CONCLUSION: Age-related hearing loss might impact on the cognition impairment in C57BL/6J mice.
