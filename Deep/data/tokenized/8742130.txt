Controlled cortical impact (CCI) is a contemporary model of experimental cerebral contusion. We examined the cerebrovascular and neuropathologic effects of a severe CCI in rats. The utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of contusion volume after severe CCI was also established. Severe CCI (3.0 mm depth, 4 m/sec velocity) to the left (L) parietal cortex was produced in anesthetized (isoflurane/N2O/O2), intubated, and mechanically ventilated male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 58). Physiologic parameters were controlled. The time course of alterations in edema [L-R% brain water (% BW) in 3-mm coronal sections through injured and contralateral hemispheres, wet-dry weight] was evaluated at 2 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days posttrauma. Local cerebral blood flow (ICBF, measured in 8 structures in each hemisphere by autoradiography) was evaluated at 2 h, 24 h, and 7 days. Contusion volume (measured by histology and image analysis) was assessed at 14 days and measured in 6 rats by both MRI and histology. The survival rate after severe CCI was 96.2%. The L-R difference in % BW increased to 1.69 +/- 0.18% at 2 h, 3.00 +/- 0.08% at 24 h, 2.69 +/- 0.09% at 48 h, and 0.94 +/- 0.21% at 7 days. These values all differed from the control (p < 0.05). The % BW was greater at 24 h and 48 h than at 2 h and 7 days (p < 0.05). Marked reductions in ICBF were limited to structures in the injured hemisphere and were observed in the parietal cortex (2 and 24 h), subcortical white matter (2 and 24 h), and hippocampus (2 h), (p < 0.05) vs control rats. In the contusion core, ICBF was 19.4 +/- 8.8 mL 100 g-1 min-1 at 24 h (p = 0.011 vs normal). Necrosis was seen in large portions of the parietal cortex and subcortical white matter, and portions of the hippocampus and thalamus. Contusion volume was 47.8 +/- 9.2 mm3, which represented 14.4 +/- 2.1% of the traumatized hemisphere. Estimates of contusion volume by MRI and histology were closely correlated (r = 0.941, p < 0.017). Severe CCI in rats is accompanied by contusion, reproducible edema, and marked hypoperfusion, involving over 14% of the injured hemisphere, and can be produced with minimal mortality. T2-weighted MRI successfully and noninvasively identifies contusion volume in this model.
