OBJECTIVE: To explore the application of immunofluorescence and sandwich ELISA with double-antibodies in detection of human rabies. METHODS: The cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and hippocampus of four patients died of rabies identified by clinical diagnosis were collected and kept in freezer at -70 degrees C or in formaldehyde solution separately. The rat brain tissue infected by CVS strain of rabies virus was used as a positive control and the brain tissue of a patient died of acute pancreatitis was used as a negative control. RESULTS: Rabies virus was detected in the tissues kept in freezer at -70 degrees C and the positive control but was not detected in the tissues kept in formaldehyde solution and the negative control. CONCLUSION: Immunofluorescence and Sandwich ELISA with double-antibodies could be used in detection of human rabies. The samples should be kept in deep frozen temperature condition instead of in formaldehyde solution.
