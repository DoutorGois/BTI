The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the effect of nicotinic agonists on the [3H]norepinephrine ([3H]NE) release from rat hippocampal slices. The stimulatory effect of nicotine, cytisine, epibatidine and anatoxin-A was completely blocked by the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine (10 microM). In contrast, the effect of dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP) was only partially inhibited by mecamylamine but was completely blocked by the NE uptake inhibitor desipramine (DMI, 10 microM). Finally, the effect of lobeline was not affected by mecamylamine and was only partially blocked by DMI. Our data indicate that the majority of nicotinic agonists increase the release of [3H]NE exclusively via stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). DMPP, in addition to the stimulation of nAChRs, also evokes a carrier-mediated release. Lobeline has no stimulatory effect on nAChRs, induces a carrier-mediated release and has a further action of unidentified mechanism. Our results suggest that special caution is required for the interpretation of data, when DMPP or lobeline are used as nicotinic agonists.
