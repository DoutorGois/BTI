The exposure to radon and radon decay products in homes and at workplaces represents the greatest risk from natural ionizing radiation. The present study brings forward the residential, soil and water radon surveys in 5 counties of Romania. Indoor radon measurements were performed by using CR-39 track detectors exposed for 3 months on ground-floor level of dwellings, according to the NRPB Measurements Protocol. Radon concentrations in soil and water were measured using the LUK3C device. The indoor radon concentrations ranged from 5 to 2592 Bqm(-3) with an updated preliminary arithmetic mean of 133 Bqm(-3), and a geometric mean of 90 Bqm(-3). In about 6% of the investigated grid cells the indoor radon concentrations exceed the threshold of 300 Bqm(-3). The soil gas radon concentration varies from 0.8 to 169 kBqm(-3), with a geometric mean of 28.4 kBqm(-3). For water samples, the results show radon concentrations within the range of 0.3-352 kBqm(-3) with a geometric mean of 7.7 BqL(-1). The indoor radon map was plotted on a reference grid developed by JRC with the resolution 10 x 10 km(2).
