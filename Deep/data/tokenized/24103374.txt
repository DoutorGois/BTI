The peptide amphiphile (PA) with a laminin epitope IKVAV (IKVAV-PA) can be trigged into three-dimensional nanostructures in vivo. Application of IKVAV-PA to the injured spinal cord resulted in significant functional improvement in rodents with remarkable axonal regeneration at the lesion site. Here we showed that injection of IKVAV-PA into the hippocampus of a transgenic (Tg) mice model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) significantly improved cognitive impairment, accompanied by an enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Further examination demonstrated that IKVAV-PA injections also significantly reduced the levels of soluble Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in these brains. Our data suggest that IKVAV-PA may serve as a potential therapeutic intervention for the learning and memory losses in AD.
