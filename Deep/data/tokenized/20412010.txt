Gap junctions are conductive channels formed by membrane proteins termed connexins (Cx), which permit the intercellular exchange of metabolites, ions, and small molecules. Junctional permeability is regulated by pH, membrane potential, and intracellular secondary messengers. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the expression and distribution of astrocytic gap junctions in the hippocampus and the cortex after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in vivo. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) were subjected to lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) at moderate severity (2.6-2.8 atm, 12 msec) using a Dragonfly device model. Phosphorylated gap junction protein levels were quantified using Western blot analysis. Spatial distribution of immunoreactivity for phosphorylated Cx43 (p-Cx43) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Our findings showed that p-Cx43 expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus was significantly induced at 1 h after TBI, and remained at a high level until 24 h after injury. The p-Cx43 protein content reached a maximum level at 6 h after injury. In addition, the immunoreactivity for p-Cx43 was localized in the astrocytes surrounding ipsilateral CA3 pyramidal neurons. On the other hand, the protein level in the ipsilateral cortex was not significantly different at any time point after TBI. Double immunostaining using phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) showed that p-Cx43 and p-ERK immunoreactivities were enhanced in the same astrocytes at 6 h after injury. These findings suggest that astrocytic gap junctions participate in pathophysiological processes in the hippocampus after TBI.
