Space travel induces many deleterious effects on the flight crew due to the '0' g environment. The brain experiences a tremendous fluid shift, which is responsible for many of the detrimental changes in physical behavior seen in astronauts. It therefore indicates that the brain may undergo major changes in its protein levels in a '0' g environment to counteract the stress. Analysis of these global changes in proteins may explain to better understand the functioning of brain in a '0' g condition. Toward such an effort, we have screened proteins in the hippocampus of mice kept in simulated microgravity environment for 7 days and have observed a few changes in major proteins as compared to control mice. Essentially, the results show a major loss of proteins in the hippocampus of mice subjected to simulated microgravity. These changes occur in structural proteins such as tubulin, coupled with the loss of proteins involved in metabolism. This preliminary investigation leads to an understanding of the alteration of proteins in the hippocampus in response to the microgravity environment.
