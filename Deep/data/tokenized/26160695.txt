Cre/loxP-mediated inactivation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is proposed to be a promising therapeutic agent for promoting CNS and PNS regeneration. And adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector has been developed as an attractive gene delivery system with proven safety. In the present study, we investigated Cre/loxP-mediated knockout of PTEN in the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord in PTEN floxed mice by immunohistological analysis of PI3K/AKT/mTOR expression in neurons of the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord after sensorimotor cortex injection of AAV-Cre. Two weeks after injection of AAV-Cre, the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord were dissected and examined the expression of downstream molecules pAKT and pS6 of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. The results showed that remote delivery of AAV-Cre through sensorimotor cortex injection mediated PTEN knockout in neurons of the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord. We propose sensorimotor cortex injection of AAV may provide a potential strategy of gene therapy for the CNS diseases.
