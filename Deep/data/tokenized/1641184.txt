The electric source locations of interictal spikes recorded with depth electrodes were estimated by the dipole tracing (DT) method. Three-dimensional coordinates of the active surfaces of the depth electrodes and head geometry of the patient were measured from frontal and sagittal X-ray images and by a special device, respectively. The estimated dipole locations were superimposed on MR images of the patients. The dipole locations estimated in the hippocampal or parahippocampal regions successively moved in a small limited region during the interictal spike's peak. It was suggested that an interictal spike is composed of summated equivalent dipoles generated by hypersynchronization of a cluster of neurons, and that the timing of such hyperexcitation is more or less delayed because of electrical propagation along neuronal clusters which might be separated by sclerotic tissues.
