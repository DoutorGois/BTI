Previous neuroanatomical work has shown that lesions of the entorhinal cortex in adult rats cause the commissural projections to spread from their normally restricted locus in the inner molecular layer approximately 40-50 mum into the outer molecular layer (that is, into the zone deafferented by the lesion). In the present study we measured the effects of the entorhinal lesion on the distribution of short-latency potentials elicited by commissural stimulation in the molecular layer. Studies with animals tested at various times after the lesion and with a preparation that permitted recording from the same rat at several post-lesion intervals both indicated that the commissural response spread 100-150 mum towards the deafferented outer molecular layer, while the maximum response spread 50-100 mum. These effects were first detectable by 9 days after the lesion and were fully developed by 15 days post-lesion. These findings suggest that the growth of the commissural system seen after entorhinal lesions results in the rapid formation of functional terminals and are discussed in relationship to the behavioral consequences of brain lesions.
