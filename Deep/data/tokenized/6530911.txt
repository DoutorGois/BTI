Systemic administration of kainic acid in rats (30 mg/kg s.c.) and cats (5 mg/kg i.p.) produced after a definite period (30 to 60 min) secondary generalized seizures occurring first in the limbic structures (amygdala and hippocampus). The effect of N-aminomethylpiperazine-3,3-diethyl-2,4-pyridinedione (DKMP) at a dose of 100 mg/kg i.v. was evaluated on the background of developed kainic epilepsy. In rats, DKMP inhibited kainic clonic and tonic seizures and 100% of the animals survived. The drug was ineffective against limbic seizures. In cats, DKMP strongly suppressed the cortical EEG paroxysmal activity and slightly influenced the limbic one. The present data contribute to the knowledge of the anticonvulsive activity of DKMP, showing it to be a promising antiepileptic drug with mainly cortical action.
