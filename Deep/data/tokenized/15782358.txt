INTRODUCTION: Gait apraxia is not used to be considered as a diagnostic entity in Pediatric Neurology. CASE REPORTS: We present two pediatric patients that, after to have acquired normal gait and in consequence of a acute process, they lost the capacity to walk. In spite of intensive rehabilitation treatment hold along various years, they had not been able to help them. Both injury were very dissimilar; in one of them was affected the precentral and paracentral cortex in consequence of an encephalitic process. In the other, the basal ganglia and the hippocampus after a situation of near-drowning at the age of 15 months. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of this disorder is discussed and emphasis is done in its badly long-term prognosis.
