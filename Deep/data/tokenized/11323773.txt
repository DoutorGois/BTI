The hippocampus is a region of the brain that is crucial to memory function. Functional neuroimaging allows for the noninvasive investigation of the neurophysiology of human memory by observing changes in blood flow in the brain. We have developed a technique that employs high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with cortical unfolding to provide activation maps of the hippocampal region that surpass in anatomic and functional detail other methods of in vivo human brain mapping of the medial temporal lobe. We explain the principles behind this method and illustrate its application to a novelty-encoding paradigm.
