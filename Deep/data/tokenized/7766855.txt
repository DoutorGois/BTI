Carbon monoxide (CO), produced through the action of haem oxygenase (HO) isoenzymes, has been recently postulated as a retrograde messenger in the early stages of long-term potentiation (LTP). In the present study, rats submitted to an inhibitory avoidance task there is a significant increase (+76%) in hippocampal HO activity immediately after training (0 min), but not at 60 min post-training. No changes were observed in cerebral cortical and cerebellar HO activity. Bilateral intrahippocampal infusion of the HO inhibitor zinc-protoporphyrin-IX (ZnPP) (2 micrograms side-1) caused full amnesia for inhibitory avoidance when given 10 min before training or immediately after training, but not 60 min after training. These findings provide evidence that CO production in the hippocampus is important for the early stages of memory processing of an inhibitory avoidance training.
