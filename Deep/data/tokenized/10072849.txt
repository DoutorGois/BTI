OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the relationship between the induction of 70kDa heat shock protein in rabbit brains and heat stress. METHODS: HSP70 was detected using monoclonal antibody by ABC method in rabbit hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerberal cortex. RESULTS: Intense HSP70 staining was displayed in rabbit brains of the heat stroke group (rectal temperature 43 degrees C to death). Positive cells were distributed mainly in the CA1, CA2 regions of the hippocampus; granular cell layer I and pyramidal layer (II) of the cerebral cortex; and the periventricular area of hypothalamus. HSP70-psoitive substances were localized in the cytoplasm and neuronal processes, a few neurons exhibited dark staining nucle. Hosever, the rabbit brains of the general heat stress group (rectal temperature 42.0 degrees C, 30 minutes) had much weaker staining. CONCLUSION: Hyperthermia causes neuronal expression of HSP70, particularly under strong heat stress, and may be sustained till death.
