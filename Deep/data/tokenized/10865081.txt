The present study demonstrates the effect of ibotenic acid lesioning of ventral subiculum on the theta activity of CA1 area of hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex during REM sleep. Ibotenic acid lesioning of ventral subiculum, has increased the absolute power with no noticeable change in the relative power of theta of the CA1 area. In contrast, it has decreased both the absolute and relative power of entorhinal cortical theta. Subicular output may serve to modulate the synchronous neuronal activity of entorhinal cortex and CA1 pyramidal cells during REM sleep.
