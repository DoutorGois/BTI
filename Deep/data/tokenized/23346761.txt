In the present study, over a period of 8 days 12 mg/kg/d quercetin aglycone and 18 mg/kg/d isoquercitrin were orally given to rats, respectively. Four hours after administration, plasma samples were taken as well as tissue samples of liver, lung, heart, kidney and the brain sections hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum, cortex and the remaining brain. A HPLC-FD method with in-line post-column complexation was employed to quantify the quercetin metabolites (QM) in plasma and tissues. Compared to the quercetin gavage the isoquercitrin gavage consistently produced higher levels of QM in tissues (double to five-fold) as well as in plasma (double to three-fold). In body tissues, the highest amounts of QM were observed in the lung. In brain tissue, the highest levels of QM were found in the cerebellum, while the striatum contained the lowest levels of QM. In conclusion, this study clearly demonstrates that orally given isoquercitrin leads to higher levels in plasma and in all investigated tissue than quercetin aglycone.
