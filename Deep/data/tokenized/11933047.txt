An RT-PCR analysis revealed constitutive expression of mRNA for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NR)-1, NR-2C, and NR-2D subunits in rat adrenal and pituitary glands, in addition to brain and retina. Constitutive expression of mRNA was detected for the NR-2A subunit in pituitary but not adrenal gland. Although on Western blotting assays adrenal medulla exhibited expression of NR-1 subunit protein without expression of NR-2C and NR-2D subunit proteins, an immunohistochemical investigation clearly showed selective localization of proteins for NR-1, NR-2C, and NR-2D subunits in adrenal medulla but not in adrenal cortex. Prior treatment with different glycosidases invariably resulted in a marked increase in immunoreactivity to the anti-NR-1 antibody in both hippocampus and adrenal medulla. An intraperitoneal injection of a blocker of NMDA receptor channel, but not NMDA itself, led to marked potentiation of DNA binding activity of the transcription factor activator protein-1 in adrenal nuclear extracts 2 hr after administration. These results suggest that heteromeric NMDA receptor channels may be constitutively and functionally expressed with glycosylation of NR-1 subunit under the influence of tonic stimulation by circulating agonists such as L-glutamate in rat adrenal medulla.
