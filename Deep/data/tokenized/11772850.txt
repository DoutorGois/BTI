BACKGROUND: Membrane phospholipid abnormalities in people with schizophrenia, measured with (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P-MRS), have been previously reported in brain regions involved in this disorder. AIMS: In this 4.0 Tesla (31)P-MRS study of people with schizophrenia, membrane phospholipid metabolism was examined in brain regions previously inaccessible due to their small volumes. METHOD: Three-dimensional chemical-shift imaging (3D-CSI) examined 15 cc volumes in 12 brain regions in 11 people with chronic schizophrenia and 11 healthy control volunteers. RESULTS: Glycerophosphoethanolamine was decreased in the anterior cingulate, right prefrontal cortex and left thalamus, but increased in the left hippocampus and cerebellum in those with schizophrenia. Phosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine were decreased in the right prefrontal region and phosphocholine was decreased in the anterior cingulate. No significant difference in membrane phospholipid levels existed between groups in the parieto-occipital and posterior cingulate regions. CONCLUSIONS: Altered membrane phospholipid metabolism was demonstrated in all regions implicated in schizophrenia.
