(1)H MRS imaging was obtained from 10 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy before and after surgery. After surgery, metabolic recovery in the contralateral hippocampus was detected. Preoperatively, reduced N-acetylaspartate (p < 0.04) increased after surgery nonsignificantly to equal control values. Cholines increased after surgery (p < 0.02) and creatine-phosphocreatine showed a trend to higher values. The results suggest that the contralateral hippocampus is affected by repeated seizure activity in the ipsilateral hippocampus, rather than presence of bilateral mesial temporal sclerosis.
