Although schizophrenia is a widespread disorder of unknown aetiology, we have previously shown that muscarinic M4 receptor (CHRM4) expression is decreased in the hippocampus and caudate-putamen from subjects with the disorder, implicating the receptor in its pathophysiology. These findings led us to determine whether variation in the CHRM4 gene sequence was associated with an altered risk of schizophrenia by sequencing the CHRM4 gene from the brains of 76 people with the disorder and 74 people with no history of psychiatric disorders. In addition, because the CHRM4 is a potential target for antipsychotic drug development, we investigated whether variations in CHRM4 sequence were associated with final recorded doses of, and life-time exposure to, antipsychotic drugs. Gene sequencing identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs2067482 and rs72910092) in the CHRM4 gene. For rs2067482, our data suggested that both genotype (1341C/C; p = 0.05) and allele (C; p = 0.03) were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. In addition, there was a strong trend (p = 0.08) towards an association between CHRM4 sequence and increased lifetime exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, there was a trend for people with the C allele to be prescribed benzodiazepines more frequently (p = 0.06) than those with the T allele. These data, albeit on small cohorts, are consistent with genetic variance at rs2067482 contributing to an altered risk of developing schizophrenia which requires more forceful pharmacotherapy to achieve a clinical response.
