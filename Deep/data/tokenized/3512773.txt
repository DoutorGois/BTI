Antisera were raised in guinea pigs to synaptic vesicles purified from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata. In cholinergic nerve terminals from Torpedo the major antigens identified had Mr 300,000-150,000, 86,000, and 18,000. The Mr 86,000 antigen was conserved between Torpedo and rat, where it is neuron-specific and concentrated in nerve terminals. When rat brain synaptosomes are subfractionated the antigen is associated with synaptic vesicles. The antigen is not found in the cytoskeleton and in the vesicle-free cytosol. Immunohistochemical localization of the antigen in rat shows it to be associated with synapses in diaphragm, cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. The staining pattern of the antigen indicates that the antigen is not cholinergic-specific. The function of the Mr 86,000 antigen remains to be identified.
