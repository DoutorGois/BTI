The neuroprotective action of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was evaluated in a rat model of transient forebrain ischemia. A continuous intraventricular infusion of BDNF for 7 days starting immediately before the onset of ischemia significantly increased the number of pyramidal cells in the vulnerable CA1 sector of the hippocampus. In situ hybridization experiments suggest the neuroprotection to be mediated via trkB-receptors in the hippocampus. The data indicate a therapeutic potential for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
