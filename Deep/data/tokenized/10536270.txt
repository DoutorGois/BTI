Small reductions in temperature have been shown to improve neurologic recovery after ischemia. We have examined the effect of temperature on biochemical and physiological changes during hypoxia using rat hippocampal slices as a model system. The postsynaptic population spike recorded from the CA1 pyramidal cell region of slices subjected to 7 min of hypoxia with hypothermia (34 degrees C) recovered to 73% of its prehypoxic level; slices subjected to the same period of hypoxia at 37 degrees C did not recover. After 7 min of hypoxia ATP fell to 48% of its prehypoxic concentration at 34 degrees C and 30% at 37 degrees C. Potassium fell to 86% during 7 min of hypoxia with hypothermia, this compares to a fall to 58% at 37 degrees C. The increase in sodium after 7 min of hypoxia was also attenuated by hypothermia (133% vs. 163% of its prehypoxic concentration). When the hypoxic period was shortened to 3 min (37 degrees C) the population spike recovered to 94%. If the temperature was increased to 40 degrees C there was only 7% recovery of the population spike after 3 min of hypoxia. With hyperthermia (40 degrees C), ATP fell to 33% after 3 min of hypoxia, this compares to 81% at normothermia. Potassium fell to 76% after 3 min of hypoxia with hyperthermia, this compares to 91% at 37 degrees C. Sodium concentrations increased with hyperthermia before hypoxia, at 3 min of hypoxia there was no significant difference between the hyperthermic and normothermic tissue; there was a large increase in sodium with hyperthermia after 5 min of hypoxia (209% vs. 146%). We conclude that the improved recovery after hypothermic hypoxia is at least in part due to the attenuated changes in ATP, potassium and sodium during hypoxia and that the worsened recovery with hyperthermia is due to an exacerbation of the change in ATP, potassium and sodium concentrations during hypoxia.
