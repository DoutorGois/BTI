The release of endogenous aspartic, glutamic, and gamma-aminobutyric acids (Asp, Glu, GABA, respectively) was measured in the effluent from superfused hippocampal slices using a new and sensitive mass spectrometric method. The stimulation of the stratum radiatum of the rat dorsal hippocampus caused a Ca2+-dependent increase in the release of these amino acids. This release was accompanied by an increase in the incorporation of [13C2] from [13C]glucose into Asp, Glu, and GABA, suggesting an increase in their neosynthesis. The removal of Ca2+ from the superfusion fluid brought about a marked decrease in Asp and Glu release at rest, and prevented their stimulation-evoked release and the appearance of population spikes. The results support the hypothesis that Asp and Glu are excitatory neurotransmitters in intrinsic hippocampal circuits and are possibly released from the Schaffer collaterals and commissural fibres. The increase in GABA release and neosynthesis during stimulation of the stratum radiatum could be related to recurrent inhibition evoked by transsynaptic stimulation of the pyramidal cells.
