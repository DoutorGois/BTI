Brain activity was measured autoradiographically using [1-14C]octanoate (OCTO) as a fast functional tracer in rats receiving either saline, heroin or cocaine. Regional optical densities were normalized to a relative optical density index for comparisons of OCTO labeling between treatment groups. Heroin significantly increased labeling in the dentate gyrus and cocaine increased density in the anterior cingulate cortex, globus pallidus, hippocampus CA3-4, lateral septum, hypothalamus and ventral tegmentum. Heroin and cocaine induced significant, but opposing effects in medial cortex and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Both drugs decreased labeling density in the nucleus accumbens and piriform cortex, and increased density in the substantia nigra, subthalamus, medial septum, claustrum, lateral hypothalamus and hippocampus CA2. These results demonstrate the ability of the OCTO method to discriminate the brief metabolic effects of different drug classes, and suggest that heroin and cocaine may activate a common functional system in the brain.
