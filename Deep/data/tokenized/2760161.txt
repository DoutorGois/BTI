Anion chromatography methods have been developed to determine the concentrations of inositol phosphates and other water-soluble metabolites in rat brain. The cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were analyzed by chemically suppressed conductivity detection. Animals were sacrificed by directed microwave irradiation for more accurate estimations of in vivo concentrations. The effects of different sample preparation methods are compared. Trichloroacetic acid, formic acid, and perchloric acid extraction result in lower recoveries of phosphocreatine and other anions than does homogenization with water followed by chloroform-methanol extraction. The effects of postdecapitative ischemia on metabolite concentrations are determined. These methods will be used to study the effects of pharmacological agents on inositol phosphates and should be broadly applicable to the analysis of a variety of biological systems.
