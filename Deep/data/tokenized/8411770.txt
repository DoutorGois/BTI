We examined the protective activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) on mortality and delayed hippocampal cell death induced by transient cerebral ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil. Forebrain ischemia was produced by bilaterally occluding the common carotid arteries for 15 min using microaneurysm clips; then the blood supply to the brain was restored. The number of survivors was counted for 8 days, and the histopathological damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was scored according to the semiquantitative scale of Rudolphi and colleagues. When injected 15 min before the ischemic insult, FBP (100 and 333 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly reduced the rate of mortality during the 8-day observation period. Equivalent doses of fructose and fructose monophosphate did not improve survival, and neither did low doses (33 mg/kg) of FBP. FBP also produced a significant degree of protection against the CA1 pyramidal cell loss in comparison with its vehicle (distilled water). Conversely, when we administered the compound, at the same dose, 15 min after the release of the arterial occlusion, we observed neither a significant reduction of mortality nor significant protection against hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell loss. These results suggest that FBP possesses salutary properties against the damages induced by transient cerebral ischemia, although they are evident only when the compound is administered before the resolution of the ischemic injury.
