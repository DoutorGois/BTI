Intracellular injections of Lucifer Yellow were utilized to evaluate the incidence of dye-coupling among dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) neurons recorded from slice preparations of adult rat septal nuclei. Twenty percent of single injections of Lucifer Yellow resulted in pairs of labeled neurons. These dye-coupled cells were morphologically heterogeneous and did not exhibit any morphological characteristics that could be used to distinguish them from non dye-coupled neurons. The spatial separation of cell bodies and close apposition of dendrites within each pair indicated that the dye transfer site(s) were situated at dendrodendritic and/or dendrosomatic rather than somatosomatic junctions. The main axon of some dye-coupled neurons gave rise to intrinsic axon collaterals prior to exiting the nucleus indicating that these coupled neurons function as projection neurons as well as local circuit interneurons. Electrophysiological recordings of the passive membrane properties and spontaneous activity of individual dye-coupled neurons revealed no significant difference from non dye-coupled cells in the DLSN. Some neurons exhibited spontaneously occurring fast potentials which presumably represent electrotonic potentials. These fast potentials were often tightly coupled with action potentials but could be distinguished from synaptic potentials by their shape and their lack of voltage-dependent changes in amplitude. These morphological and supportive electrophysiological data provide the first indirect evidence for electrotonic coupling of dorsolateral septal neurons. The functional significance of this coupling may lie in the potential for synchronization of the output of the DLSN which could play an important role in the septal maintenance and modulation of hippocampal Theta rhythm.
