Volume losses in the medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulated, and orbitofrontal region have been observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Smaller reductions in similar regions have also been reported in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a canonical precursor to AD. We previously demonstrated that volume loss in bilateral anteromedial temporal lobe is present at baseline in longitudinally followed normal subjects who later developed MCI or AD. In this study we compared grey matter volumes within this predefined anteromedial temporal region (AMTR) at baseline between: 1) normal subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who subsequently developed cognitive complaints as reflected in a CDR memory box score of 0.5; and 2) normal subjects who remained normal over a median of 48 months of follow-up (CDR sum of boxes 0). We found significantly decreased volume within AMTR in the ADNI memory complainers. To relate AMTR results to those from conventional anatomy, we demonstrate that volumes extracted with the ICBM amygdala region had the best correspondence with AMTR volumes. In contrast, regions that have demonstrated volume loss in frank MCI and AD in ADNI, e.g., the posterior cingulate, did not show volume loss. These findings provide independent confirmation that volume changes preceding MCI occur in AMTR, a region of overlap between amygdala and anterior hippocampus.
