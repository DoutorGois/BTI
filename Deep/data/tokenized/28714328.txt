The mitochondrial protein prohibitin (PHB) has emerged as an important modulator of neuronal survival in different injury modalities . We previously showed that viral gene transfer of PHB protects CA1 neurons from delayed neurodegeneration following transient forebrain ischemia through mitochondrial mechanisms. However, since PHB is present in all cell types, it is not known if its selective expression in neurons is protective, and if the protection occurs also in acute focal ischemic brain injury, the most common stroke type in humans. Therefore, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing human PHB1 specifically in neurons (PHB1 Tg). PHB1 Tg mice and littermate controls were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Infarct volume and sensory-motor impairment were assessed three days later. Under the control of a neuronal promoter (CaMKIIalpha), PHB1 expression was increased by 50% in the forebrain and hippocampus in PHB1 Tg mice. The brain injury produced by MCAo was reduced by 63 +/- 11% in PHB1 Tg mice compared to littermate controls. This reduction was associated with improved sensory-motor performance, suggesting that the salvaged brain remains functional. Approaches to enhance PHB expression may be useful to ameliorate the devastating impact of cerebral ischemia on the brain.
