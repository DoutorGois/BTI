The deficiency of oxygen and glucose induces neuronal cell damage and death through multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. The degree of the damage is thought to depend on the intensity and duration of pathological event. In vivo and in vitro experimental investigations have shown that short-term oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) results in the delayed cell destruction. It allows studying of the neurodegenerative mechanisms induced by OGD for possible corrections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the morpho-functional changes in cultured hippocampal neurons after short-term OGD followed by reoxygenation during 1, 4 or 24 h. It is revealed that 20 min OGD has no influence on the cell viability, but metabolic activity, synaptic quantity and activity are decreased at 1 h at 4 h after OGD. These functional characteristics are normalized at 24h. The results expand a concept about different aspects of hippocampal neurons injury under deficiency of oxygen and glucose. A suggested experimental model could be used for testing different neuroprotective tools.
