Midkine is a 13-kDa retinoic acid-induced heparin-binding growth factor involved in various biological phenomena such as cell migration, neurogenesis, and tissue repair. We previously demonstrated that midkine-deficient (Mdk(-/-)) mice exhibited a delayed hippocampal development with impaired working memory and increased anxiety only at the age of 4 weeks. To assess whether midkine gene could play important roles in development and maintenance of central nervous system, we investigated biochemical and behavioral parameters in dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission of Mdk(-/-) mice. The Mdk(-/-) mice exhibited a hypodopaminergic state (i.e., decreased levels of dopamine and its receptors in the striatum) with no alterations of glutamatergic system (i.e., normal level of glutamate, glutamine, glycine, d-serine, l-serine, and NMDA receptors in the frontal cortex and hippocampus). We also found prepulse inhibition deficits reversed by clozapine and haloperidol in the Mdk(-/-) mice. Our results suggested that midkine deficiency may be related to neurochemical and behavioral dysfunctions in dopaminergic system.
