We investigated rapid protection effect by estradiol on corticosterone (CORT)-induced suppression of synaptic transmission. Rapid suppression by 1 muM CORT of long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3-CA1 synapses was abolished via coperfusion of 1 nM estradiol. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-derived field excitatory postsynaptic potential (NMDA-R-fEPSP) was used to analyze the mechanisms of these events. Estradiol abolished CORT-induced suppression of NMDA-R-fEPSP slope. This CORT-induced suppression was abolished by calcineurin inhibitor, and the rescue effect by estradiol on the CORT-induced suppression was inhibited by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitor. The CORT-induced suppressions of LTP and NMDA-R-fEPSP slope were abolished by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, and the restorative effects by estradiol on these processes were mimicked by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and ERbeta agonists. Taken together, estradiol rapidly rescued LTP and NMDA-R-fEPSP slope from CORT-induced suppressions. A GR-->calcineurin pathway is involved in these suppressive effects. The rescue effects by estradiol are driven via ERalpha or ERbeta-->MAP kinase pathway. Synaptic/extranuclear GR, ERalpha, and ERbeta probably participate in these rapid events. Mass-spectrometric analysis determined that acute hippocampal slices used for electrophysiological measurements contained 0.48 nM estradiol less than exogenously applied 1 nM. In vivo physiological level of 8 nM estradiol could protect the intact hippocampus against acute stress-induced neural suppression.
