The "direct coloring" thiocholine method of Karnovsky and Roots (1964) for the demonstration of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was modified and adapted to the technique of semipermeable membranes. In this way it is possible to demonstrate histochemically both the bound as well as the soluble part of AChE activity. The localization of the reaction product is very distinct. Microdensitometric investigations of results of this method showed a linear increase of the amount of reaction product up to an incubation time of 180 min and section thickness up to 24 micron. The medium supplemented with buffer (instead of agar) can be used for the demonstration of AChE activity in cryostat sections adherent to slides and is also very suitable for the detection of multiple forms of AChE in polyacrylamide or agarose gels.
