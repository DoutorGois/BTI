Findings on the role of subcortical and cortical structures in mnemonic processes, obtained by means of the reversible functional inactivation technique, are reviewed. The main advantage of this method (subcortical or cortical administration of local anesthetics or tetrodotoxin) is that it provides information not only on "where" but also "when" and for "how long" these processes take place, thus adding to the topographical dimension the chronological one. The review covers several types of memory (e.g., passive avoidance and spatial memory) studies examining the neural substrates of memory consolidation on the basis of the functional inactivation of the nucleus of the solitary tract, parabrachial nuclei, substantia nigra, hippocampus (dorsal and ventral), nucleus basalis magnocellularis, amygdala, medial septal area, striatum, olfactory bulb, and neocortex. The data are discussed in relation to earlier research and with respect to the anatomical and functional connectivity of the examined centers.
