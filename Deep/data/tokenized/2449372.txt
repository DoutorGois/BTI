1. Peptidase(s) activity of nuclear and synaptosomal fraction from cortex and hippocampus of rat brain against pyroGlu6[125I-Tyr8]SP6-11 was evaluated in different concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and Na+ in about "isotonic" conditions. 2. The effects of studied ions on the peptidase activities forming N-terminal and C-terminal fragments are different especially in synaptosomes of both areas. 3. The differences of ionic requirements for N- and C-forming activities are particularly relevant for Ca2+ at the cortex and K+ at the hippocampus. 4. Ca2+ activate forming of N-terminal fragments in the nuclear fraction whereas inhibit it in synaptosomes from both areas. 5. The ionic requirements for C-terminal fragments' formation in synaptosomes of both areas are contradictory.
