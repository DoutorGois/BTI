Acute forebrain ischemia reduced protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the adult rat cortex, striatum and hippocampus by 60-70% after 20 min ischemia episodes, followed by 48 h of recirculation. Ischemia of 1 min, followed by recirculation, produced a less pronounced but significant decrease in PKC activity. The ischemia-induced decrease of PKC affected both the soluble and the membrane-bound kinase. Alterations of PKC predate neuronal death following ischemia.
