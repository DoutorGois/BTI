Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the production of beta-amyloid proteins and hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Inflammation and apoptotic severity were highly correlated with earlier age at onset of Alzheimer's disease and were also associated with cognitive decline. This study aims to examine whether the traditional Chinese medicine ginsennoside Rd could prevent cognitive deficit and take neuroprotective effects in beta-amyloid peptide 1-40-induced rat model of Alzheimer's disease. To produce Alzheimer's disease animal model, aggregated beta-amyloid peptide 1-40 injected into hippocampus bilaterally. Ginsennoside Rd protected their cognitive impairment and improved their memory function by daily intraperitoneal injection for 30 days consecutively. In addition, ginsennoside Rd alleviated the inflammation induced by beta-amyloid peptide 1-40. Furthermore, ginsennoside Rd played a role in the down-regulation of caspase-3 proteins and reduced the apoptosis that normally followed beta-amyloid peptide 1-40 injection. The results of this study showed that the pretreatment of ginsennoside Rd had neuroprotective effects in beta-amyloid peptide 1-40-induced AD model rat.
