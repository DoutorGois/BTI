We have found that the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor (gamma2-GABA(A)R) specifically interacts with protocadherin-gammaC5 (Pcdh-gammaC5) in the rat brain. The interaction occurs between the large intracellular loop of the gamma2-GABA(A)R and the cytoplasmic domain of Pcdh-gammaC5. In brain extracts, Pcdh-gammaC5 coimmunoprecipitates with GABA(A)Rs. In cotransfected HEK293 cells, Pcdh-gammaC5 promotes the transfer of gamma2-GABA(A)R to the cell surface. We have previously shown that, in cultured hippocampal neurons, endogenous Pcdh-gammaC5 forms clusters, some of which associate with GABAergic synapses. Overexpression of Pcdh-gammaC5 in hippocampal neurons increases the density of gamma2-GABA(A)R clusters but has no significant effect on the number of GABAergic contacts that these neurons receive, indicating that Pcdh-gammaC5 is not synaptogenic. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of Pcdh-gammaC5 enhanced its surface expression but decreased the association with both gamma2-GABA(A)R clusters and presynaptic GABAergic contacts. Cultured hippocampal neurons from the Pcdh-gamma triple C-type isoform knock-out (TCKO) mouse (Pcdhg(tcko/tcko)) showed plenty of GABAergic synaptic contacts, although their density was reduced compared with sister cultures from wild-type and heterozygous mice. Knocking down Pcdh-gammaC5 expression with shRNA decreased gamma2-GABA(A)R cluster density and GABAergic innervation. The results indicate that, although Pcdh-gammaC5 is not essential for GABAergic synapse formation or GABA(A)R clustering, (1) Pcdh-gammaC5 regulates the surface expression of GABA(A)Rs via cis-cytoplasmic interaction with gamma2-GABA(A)R, and (2) Pcdh-gammaC5 plays a role in the stabilization and maintenance of some GABAergic synapses.
