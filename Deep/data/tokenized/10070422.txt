The microtubules, neurofilaments and microfilaments of the neuronal cytoskeleton are essential for the normal functioning of the neurone. Recent studies have shown that disruption of the cytoskeleton may represent a final pathway in many types of neuronal cell injury with both the somato-dendritic and axonal cytoskeleton being affected. This review discusses the current evidence on the role of the neuronal cytoskeleton in the pathogenesis of traumatic brain damage.
