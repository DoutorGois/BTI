The subiculum is an epilepsy-prone area within the hippocampal complex that receives a dense serotonergic innervation from the raphe nuclei. We investigated the effect of 5-HT on epileptiform activity in this region with intra- and extracellular recordings. Our data suggest that 5-HT has predominately inhibitory effects on epileptiform activity in the subiculum but in some cases could also function as a disinhibitory agent. As the subiculum is an important output station of the hippocampal complex the serotonergic innervation might influence the spread of epileptic seizures.
