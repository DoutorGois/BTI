Changes in voltage dependent calcium currents in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal slice during ethanol withdrawal were studied using an alcohol withdrawal seizure prone mouse strain (WSP) and compared to a withdrawal-resistant strain (WSR). There was a significant increase in the high voltage activated calcium currents during the withdrawal period in the WSP strain, while those of the resistant strain showed no significant enhancement. These results suggest that an increase in calcium currents is one factor involved in the alcohol withdrawal hyperexcitability of the prone strain observed in vivo.
