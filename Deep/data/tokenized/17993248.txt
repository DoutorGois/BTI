Low-frequency stimulation (LFS) has antiepileptogenic effects on kindled seizures. In the present study, the role of galanin receptors in the inhibitory effect of LFS on perforant path kindling acquisition was investigated in rats. Animals were kindled by perforant path stimulation in a rapid kindling manner (six stimulations per day). LFS (0.1 ms pulses at 1 Hz, 600 pulses, and 80-150 microA) was applied immediately after termination of each kindling stimulation. M35 (0.5 and 1.0 nM per site), a nonselective galanin receptor antagonist and M871 (1.0 microM per site), a selective galanin receptor type 2 (GalR2) antagonist, were daily microinjected into the dentate gyrus before starting the stimulation protocol. The expression of GalR2 in the dentate gyrus was also investigated using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Application of LFS significantly retarded the kindling acquisition and delayed the expression of different kindled seizure stages. In addition, LFS significantly reduced the increment of daily afterdischarge duration during kindling development. Intra-dentate gyrus microinjection of both M35 and M871 significantly prevented the inhibitory effects of LFS on kindling parameters. During the focal kindled seizure stages (1-3) M871 had no significant effect. However, during generalized seizure stages (4 and 5), M871 had the same effect as M35. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR also showed that after kindling acquisition, the GalR2 mRNA level decreased in the dentate gyrus but application of LFS prevented this decrease. Obtained results show that activation of galanin receptors by endogenous galanin has a role in mediating the inhibitory effect of LFS on perforant path-kindled seizures. This role is exerted through GalR1 during focal- and through GalR2 during generalized-kindled seizures.
