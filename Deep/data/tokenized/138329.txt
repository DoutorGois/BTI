The hippocampus of C57B1/6 mice was examined histologically and electron microscopically. Male and female mice at 3 and 8 months of age and female mice at 16 months of age were studied. PAS positive foci, containing particles 1-2 mu in diameter, were observed in the hippocampal region of 8 and 16 month old mice. These particles were diastase sensitive. Electron microscopically, in similar mice, a vacuolating change was observed in the cytoplasm of perithelial cells (pericytes) in the same area.
