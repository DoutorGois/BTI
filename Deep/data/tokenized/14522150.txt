The nervous system is made up of many specific types of neuron intricately intertwined to form complex networks. Identifying and defining the characteristic features of the many different neuronal types is essential for achieving a cellular understanding of complex activity from perception to cognition. So far, cortical GABAergic interneurons have represented the epitome of cellular diversity in the CNS. Despite the desperate need for effective classification criteria allowing a common language among neuroscientists, interneurons still evoke memories of Babel. Several approaches are now available to overcome the challenges and problems associated with the various classification systems used so far.
