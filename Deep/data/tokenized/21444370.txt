Disruption of calcium homeostasis in epileptic cells is characterized by both short- and long-term perturbations of Ca(2+) buffering systems. Along with the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase (PMCA) plays an important role in excitable cells. The involvement of PMCAs in epileptogenesis has primarily been studied in brief intervals after various stimuli; however, the specific contribution of this molecule to epileptogenesis is not yet fully understood. Our aim has been to investigate whether PMCA expression in the chronic stages of epilepsy is altered. Through an interdisciplinary approach, involving whole-cell recordings and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we have shown that epileptic neurons in our preparation consistently show changes in electrical properties during the period of chronic epilepsy. These changes included increased spike frequency, altered resting membrane potential and changes in passive membrane properties. Following these observations, which indicate an altered excitability in the epileptic cells studied, PMCA mRNA transcripts were studied. It was found that while PMCA1 transcripts are significantly increased one month following the pilocarpine epileptogenic stimulus, PMCA3, an isoform important in excitable tissues, was significantly, decreased. These findings suggest that, in the long-term, a slow PMCA (PMCA1) plays a role in the reestablishment of a new calcium homeostasis attained by epileptic cells. Overall, this phenomenon points out the fact that in seizure disorders, changes that take place in the balance of the different molecules and their isoforms in charge of maintaining neuronal calcium homeostasis, are fundamental in the survival of affected cells.
