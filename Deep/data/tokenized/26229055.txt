OBJECTIVE: It is often difficult to assess the driving performance of people with mild dementia. The Maze Navigation Test (MNT) was developed in the USA and has been shown to predict driving performance. The aim of this study is to evaluate how the MNT is performed against three commonly used bedside cognitive screening tools and compare our findings with the US population. METHODS: A convenience sample of 42 cognitively intact older people (age >/=65) completed the MNT, Mini-Mental State Examination, the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination and the Trail Making Tests. RESULTS: The mean MNT completion time was 307.6 (SD=85.6) and 444.5 (SD=157.3) for the 65-74 years and 75-84 years age group, respectively. Pearson's product-moment correlations were strongest with the Trail Making Test Part B (r=0.602). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study were comparable with the initial US data. The MNT is an easy-to-administer bedside cognitive screening tool. Further validation studies using the MNT and driving performance are warranted.
