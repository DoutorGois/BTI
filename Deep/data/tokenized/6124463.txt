One-minute oscillations of the infraslow activity were recorded within the range of 0 to 1 Hz with indwelled electrodes in the rabbit hippocampus. The oscillations disappeared for 5-hour period after L-DOPA administration. The phenomenon could be prevented with ethimisol. A correlation was found between the amplitude of the infraslow oscillations and the temperature of the dorsal hippocampus in different states of the c. n. s. induced by catecholaminergic serotoninergic and cholinergic neurotropic substances.
