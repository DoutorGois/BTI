1. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and 125I-Tyrl-somatostatin binding were measured from the brains of rats aged 1, 8 and 18 months. 2. Somatostatin binding was reduced in the striatum, frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus of the 8-month-old rats compared to the 1-month-old group. 3. Somatostatin binding was reduced in the striatum, frontal cortex and hippocampus of the 18-month-old rats compared to the 1-month-old group. 4. The reduction (40%) was most striking in the frontal cortex. 5. In no area of the brain did changes in SLI differ significantly between the different age groups.
