The study discusses the diagnostic value of some electrophysiological methods of investigating patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. It is emphasized that routine EEG, basal and tympanic leads are not informative enough. Special attention is paid to the study of stereoelectroencephalographic activity of deep epileptic foci and "secondary" synchronization phenomena. It is suggested that SEEG is a necessary component of preoperative study. It is also pointed out that a bitemporal pathological activity should not be considered a contraindication to a surgical treatment of epilepsy.
