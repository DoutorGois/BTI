Apomorphine intrahippocampally injected at a dose of 5 microgram led to a significant increase in incorporation of (3H)-fucose into total proteins of this brain area, whereas 40 microgram led to a significant decrease in comparison to controls, providing further evidence for the existence of dopaminoceptive structures in the hippocampus of rats and their significance for glycoprotein metabolism.
