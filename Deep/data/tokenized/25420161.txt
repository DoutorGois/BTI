Burgess et al ( 1 ) present intriguing results of repetitive transient opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in a transgenic mouse model of advanced Alzheimer disease (AD). The results underscore the potential of using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided focused ultrasound and microbubble ultrasonography (US) contrast agents for the disruption of the BBB as a potential long-term therapy to reduce amyloid plaque burden and improve cognitive performance. This daring conclusion that is based on an experimental animal model should now be confirmed in humans. Considering that the technology is commercially available and given the immense clinical need, clinical trials in this AD treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.
