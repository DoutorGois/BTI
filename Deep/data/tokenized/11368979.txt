Amygdaloid kindling is a model of human temporal lobe epilepsy, in which excitability in limbic structures is permanently enhanced by repeated stimulations. We report here dendritic aberrations occurring in mice following kindled-seizures. Adult mice received a biphasic square wave pulse [495+/-25.5 (S.E.M.) microA 60 Hz, 200 micros duration, for 2 s] unilaterally in the basolateral amygdaloid complex once a day and mice with electrophysiologically and behaviorally verified seizures were used in the experiments. The hippocampus and amygdaloid complex contralateral to the lesions were observed by immunofluorescence histochemistry with a somatodendritic marker, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), showing that kindled-seizures caused hypertrophy of proximal dendrites in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and in neurons of the amygdalohippocampal area. To further characterize the morphological changes of the dendrites, electron micrographic analysis was performed on the contralateral side. (1) In the granular layer of the dentate gyrus and the amygdalohippocampal area, kindled-seizures generated an increase in the number of dendrites containing polymerized microtubules and width of dendritic profiles showing the increase was in the range 0.2-3.0 and 0.2-1.4 microm, respectively. (2) In the granular layer, bundles between dendrites separated by the puncta adhaerentia increased. (3) In the granular layer, the seizure-induced dendritic aberration was more severe in the rostral than the caudal region. These results suggested that growth of dendrites with enriched-stable microtubules is part of the structural plasticity in response to seizure activity in specific areas of the adult brain.
