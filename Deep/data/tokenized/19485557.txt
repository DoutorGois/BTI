Previous studies show discrepancies concerning the effects of pretraining on spatial learning deficits induced by blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. These inconsistencies might be attributed to the differences in the nature of the pretraining tasks and the method of blocking NMDA receptors. In the present study, the authors pretrained rats in a spatial water maze task. The authors then trained them with a novel spatial task in a novel environment under chronic blockade of hippocampal NMDA receptors by intrahippocampal infusion of 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) using osmotic pumps. Although the rats had acquired the basic techniques needed to solve a water-maze spatial task during pretraining, those given high or low doses of AP5 showed acquisition deficits. As the spatial pretraining failed to ameliorate the acquisition deficits of a new task in a novel environment, it was suggested that NMDA receptors were necessary in forming spatial representations. Because neither dose of AP5 affected the performance of a spatial task in the retention phase, sensory motor disturbances could not have caused these deficits.
