Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in the development of posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Recently, we reported differential alterations in tonic and phasic GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) currents in hippocampal dentate granule cells 90 days after controlled cortical impact (CCI) (Mtchedlishvili et al., 2010). In the present study, we investigated long-term changes in the protein expression of GABA(A)R alpha1, alpha4, gamma2, and delta subunits, NMDA (NR2B) and AMPA (GluR1) receptor subunits, and heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP90) in the hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats evaluated by Western blotting in controls, CCI-injured animals without PTE (CCI group), and CCI-injured animals with PTE (PTE group). No differences were found among all three groups for alpha1 and alpha4 subunits. Significant reduction of gamma2 protein was observed in the PTE group compared to control. CCI caused a 194% and 127% increase of delta protein in the CCI group compared to control (p<0.0001), and PTE (p<0.0001) groups, respectively. NR2B protein was increased in CCI and PTE groups compared to control (p=0.0001, and p=0.011, respectively). GluR1 protein was significantly decreased in CCI and PTE groups compared to control (p=0.003, and p=0.001, respectively), and in the PTE group compared to the CCI group (p=0.036). HSP70 was increased in CCI and PTE groups compared to control (p=0.014, and p=0.005, respectively); no changes were found in HSP90 expression. These results provide for the first time evidence of long-term alterations of GABA(A) and glutamate receptor subunits and a HSP following CCI.
