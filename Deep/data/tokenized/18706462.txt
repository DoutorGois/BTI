Recently, we reported the discovery of a novel amino acid sequence derived from the NPFF precursor NAWGPWSKEQLSPQA, which blocked the expression of conditioned place preference induced by morphine and reversed the antinociceptive activity of morphine (5mg/kg, s.c.) in the tail-immersion test in rats. Here, we name it as NPNA (Neuropeptide NA from its flanking amino acid residues). The synthetic peptide influenced the expression of mRNA coding for Galpha(i1), (i2), and (i3) subunits. The results provide further evidence that yet another bioactive sequence might be present within the NPFF precursor.
