The literature on the behavioural effects of septal and hippocampal lesions is classified according to behavioural paradigm. The effects of the two kinds of lesion are summarized and compared to each other. A 'septo-hippocampal syndrome,' consisting of the effects common to both lesions, is delineated, and divergences between the effects of the two lesions are noted.
