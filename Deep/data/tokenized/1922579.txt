We present clinico-pathological correlations for a consecutive series of 44 demented patients in the Vienna longitudinal study on dementia. Prospective clinical diagnosis used the DSM-III-R and the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Not only the clinical, but also the neuropathological diagnosis of DAT is based on exclusion criteria, and depends on the interpretation of minimal vascular lesions. Although we did not exclude atypical cases from the study, 80% of diagnoses could be validated at autopsy. Nevertheless, our set of clinical criteria needs further validation in patients in the earliest stages of dementia.
