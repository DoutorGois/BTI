Glutamate uptake is reduced during ischemia because of perturbations of ionic gradients across neuronal and glial membranes. Using immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses, the authors examined the expression of the glutamate transporters EAAC1, GLAST, and GLT-1 in the rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex 8 hours and 1 to 28 days after transient forebrain ischemia. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots of CA1 homogenates showed a moderate increase in EAAC1 protein levels early after the insult. Consistently, it was observed that EAAC1 immunostaining in CA1 pyramidal neurons was more intense after 8 hours and 1 day of reperfusion and reduced at later postischemia stages. A similar transient increase of EAAC1 immunolabeling was detected in layer V pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex. In addition, the authors observed that EAAC1 also was located in oligodendroglial progenitor cells in subcortical white matter. The number of EAAC1-labeled cells in this region was increased after 3 and 28 days of reperfusion. Finally, changes in GLAST and GLT-1 expression were not observed in the CA1 region after ischemia using immunohistochemical study or immunoblotting. Enhanced expression of EAAC1 may be an adaptive response to increased levels of extracellular glutamate during ischemia.
