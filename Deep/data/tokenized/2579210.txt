Experimental cerebral ischemia was produced in gerbils by occlusion of the right common carotid artery in the neck. The evolution of the ischemic lesions was followed from five minutes to six hours by using the immunohistochemical techniques for tubulin and creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme. The earliest lesion was found in the subiculum-CA1 and CA2 regions of the hippocampus in five minutes. There was loss of staining in the apical dendrites and perikarya of the pyramidal cells. The earliest lesion in the cerebral cortex, visible in ten minutes, was a laminar loss of staining for tubulin. Evolution of the ischemic lesions in the thalamus and caudoputamen was delayed. However, in two hours widespread ischemic lesions were seen there. Evolution of the ischemic lesions was slightly slower with the reaction for creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme as compared to the reaction for tubulin, but was far more sensitive than hematoxylin-eosin staining. The distribution of ischemic lesions detected by the immunohistochemical method compared to ischemic areas detected by an India ink perfusion study suggested that both the extent of regional ischemia and regional difference in tissue vulnerability were contributing factors for the emergence of early ischemic lesions. The mechanism for prompt disappearance of the immunohistochemical reaction for tubulin is not clear, but the present investigation demonstrates the usefulness of the immunohistochemical technique for detecting early ischemic lesions and provides a possible biochemical mechanism for cellular damage after ischemic insults.
