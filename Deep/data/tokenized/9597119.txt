The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is unknown, but metabolic perturbations, including hyperammonaemia and increased brain turnover of serotonin (5-HT), have been identified. Possible alterations of 5-HT receptors in the brain have been rudimentarily studied. We therefore investigated the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptor density in 18-22 different regions in the brain of portacaval shunted rats by means of radioligand binding with autoradiographical evaluation. The results revealed a decreased 5-HT1A receptor binding in seven serotonergic projection areas of the brain, and an increase in the nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus and subiculum. No changes in the raphe nuclei were observed. An increased 5-HT1B receptor binding was seen in five brain regions: basal ganglia, olfactorial regions, hippocampus, mid brain and thalamus. However, decreased binding was seen in three regions of cortical areas and hippocampus. The 5-HT2A receptor binding site density was essentially unaltered. These findings suggest that perturbations in the central serotonergic neurotransmission may play a functional role in chronic hepatic encephalopathy.
