Behavioral and learning disturbances have been found in mice with partial trisomy 16, a new model for Down syndrome. Basal production of cyclic AMP in the hippocampus of trisomic mice was shown to be impaired. In addition, the responses of adenylyl cyclase to the stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors with isoprenaline and of the catalytic subunit with forskolin were both severely depressed.
