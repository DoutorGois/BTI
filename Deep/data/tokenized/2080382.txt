Therapeutic brain stimulation was applied in 74 patients with resistant forms of epilepsy. It was shown that low frequency stimulation of certain zones of the head of the caudate nucleus and higher frequency stimulation of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum lead to a marked suppression of interparoxysmal epileptic activity and to a disruption of both focal and generalized epileptic discharges. It is necessary to determine, by means of stereo-electroencephalography, the variability for localizing the inhibitory zones of the structures to implant the neurostimulators exactly.
