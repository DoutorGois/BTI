Previous research has indicated that intracerebral injection of potassium chloride, and the resultant electrical silence of the brain, lead to the attenuation of a previously conditioned emotional response; this response may reflect conditioned fear. The data reported here indicate that the normal mobilization of corticosteroids, perhaps a second index of emotionality, is also attenuated by such injections.
