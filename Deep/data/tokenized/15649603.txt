A central problem in neural coding is to understand what are the features of the stimulus that are encoded by the neural activity. Assuming that neuronal coding is optimized for information transmission, we can use mutual information maximization for extracting the relevant features encoded in certain activity patterns. We show that this algorithm can be successfully applied to the study of different encoding strategies for location and direction of movement in hippocampal and lateral septal cells. Using this approach, we find that in lateral septum, a significant amount of information about location can be encoded in patterns that are not place-fields.
