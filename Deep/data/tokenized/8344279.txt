We have studied the effect of Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures on the state of phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) from rat hippocampus. A method for the in vivo 32P-labeling of hippocampal proteins has been established, consisting of intracerebro-ventricular injection of 32PO4 of high specific activity. The results obtained indicate that PTZ induces a rapid and transient dephosphorylation of high-molecular-mass MAP-2, which is prevented when the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801 is previously administered. Phosphopeptide mapping of 32P-labeled MAP-2 obtained from hippocampi of PTZ-treated rats reveals a pattern of phosphorylation distinct from that obtained from control saline-treated rats or MK-801 plus PTZ treated rats. We discuss the possible implications of N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor activation and MAP-2 dephosphorylation on the plastic changes induced in rat brain hippocampus after induced epileptiform activity.
