The behavior of male rats with chronic end-to-side portacaval shunts or control surgery were evaluated in a complex enclosed maze, an open-field arena, and a swim canal. Subsequently, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were measured for hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain-medulla. Chronic portacaval anastomosis did not significantly alter any of the behavioral parameters evaluated in the diverse test situations studied, despite a significant elevation of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels in all brain regions analyzed and the elevation of serotonin levels in hypothalamus and midbrain-medulla.
