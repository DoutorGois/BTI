Young (3-month-old) and aged mice (18-month-old) were fed a diet containing Japanese herbal medicine (TJ-41 or TJ-48) for 5 months, and the effect of the herbal medicines were examined in terms of levels of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain of young and aged mice. In the aged mice, the levels of norepinepherine, serotonin and their metabolites in the brain were decreased in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. Feeding of diet containing TJ-48, but not TJ-41, enhanced the levels of some monoamines and their metabolites in the brains of aged mice, comparable to those of young mice. The results indicated that the improvement of levels of monoamines by Japanese herbal medicine was observed only in the aged mice, not in the young mice. The data have suggested the importance of the aged animals to see the effect of medicine on the functions of organs or systems.
