Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, pGlu-His-Pro-NH(2)) is a tripeptide found in numerous regions of the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). This study has provided evidence for a heterogeneous distribution of specific, nanomolar-affinity recognition sites for MeTRH in mouse and rat CNS. Membrane binding experiments revealed the following profile of these sites in mouse CNS: amygdala (AM) > olfactory tubercle > olfactory bulb (OB) > hypothalamus > striatum > pons-medulla > hippocampus > spinal cord > midbrain > cerebral cortex (CC) ? retina (RT) ? pituitary (PIT). Concurrent assays of rat brain homogenates indicated a similar order of regional enrichment in MeTRH binding sites as the mouse but the former species appeared to have an exceptionally higher density in RT and PIT compared to the latter animal. In contrast, mouse OB and AM seemed to possess a greater density of MeTRH sites than the same rat tissues. The pharmacological specificity of mouse and rat AM and PIT MeTRH binding sites was, however, almost identical and helped identify these entities as TRH receptors. Qualitative light-microscopic autoradiographic localization of TRH receptors in rat and mouse brain sections confirmed the relative distribution data obtained from membrane assays. In particular, the regions most enriched in TRH receptors determined by this technique were the various amygdaloid and hypothalamic nuclei, medial septum, n. accumbens and the inner cortical layers, areas for which numerous functional correlates have been previously demonstrated for TRH. These membrane and radiohistochemical data support a transmitter role for TRH in rodent CNS and indicate its putative sites of action.
