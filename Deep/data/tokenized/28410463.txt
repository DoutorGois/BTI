Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment during pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) causes sustained preservation of behavioral function in rats in the absence of enduring neuroprotection (Nicoletti et al., 2010), suggesting the possibility that other cells or mechanisms could be involved in the beneficial effects of VEGF during SE. Astrocytes have been reported to contribute to epileptiform discharges in the hippocampus (Tian et al., 2005; Kang et al., 1998) and to express VEGF receptors (Krum & Rosenstein, 2002). We report here that VEGF treatment significantly alters multiple astrocyte parameters. This study investigated astrocyte morphology one month after SE in animals treated with VEGF or inactivated VEGF control protein during SE. Individual GFAP-immunostained astrocytes from CA1 and dentate gyrus hilus were traced and morphologically quantified, and both somatic and process structures were analyzed. VEGF treatment during SE significantly prevented post-SE increases in number of branch intersections, process length, and node count. Furthermore, analysis of distance to nearest neighboring astrocytes revealed that VEGF treatment significantly increased inter-astrocyte distance. Overall, VEGF treatment during SE did not significantly alter the shape of the astrocytes, but did prevent SE-induced changes in branching complexity, size, and spatial patterning. Because astrocyte morphology may be related to astrocyte function, it is possible that VEGF's enduring effects on astrocyte morphology may impact the functioning of the post-seizure hippocampus.
