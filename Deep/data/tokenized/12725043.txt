In order to observe the change of brain fatty acid composition and neurotransmitter by DHA supplementation during the development stage of young rats, pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups: normal control group (O), low (L), medium (M) and high (H) dose-DHA supplemented groups. The fatty acids composition, the levels of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) and somatostatin (SS) in ceretral cortex and hippocampus of offsprings were measured. The body weight of pregnant rats and offsprings were also observed. The results showed that DHA content of brain homogenate and the levels of 5-HT, DA and SS in hippocampus of experimental young rats were significantly higher than those of the control group. And the body weight of young rats in the three DHA-supplemented groups were retarded in different degree. It was concluded that DHA supplementation changed the fatty acid composition and increased the levels of 5-HT, DA and SS in hippocampus. Proper ratio of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids in dietary supplementation should be considered.
