After intraperitoneal injection of ACTH, the content of GABA in hippocampus and the pain threshold were increased. This effect could be decreased by cyclosporin. ACTH decreased SI of MSBT and production of IL-II, and this suppression could be reversed by GABA synthesis inhibitor isoniazid, or GABA receptor blocker picrotoxin. These results suggest that: the analgesic effect of ACTH is related with the increase of GABA content in hippocampus, and cell immunity could be involved the regulation of GABA content in the brain regions. ACTH inhibited the effect of cell immunity, and this effect related to GABA content. Above effect is at least partly mediated by GABA synthesis and GABA receptor.
