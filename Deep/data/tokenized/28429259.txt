We studied early alterations in the GABAergic system of the rat hippocampus in the lithium-pilocarpine model of epilepsy. Twenty-four hours after the pilocarpine treatment, a decrease in the number of calretinin-positive interneurons was observed in the CA1 field of the hippocampus, whereas the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons remained unchanged. The decreased levels of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) and the membrane GABA transporter GAT1 were revealed using Western blot analysis. These data indicate an altered excitation/inhibition balance in the hippocampus with excitation dominance.
