Transient global amnesia (TGA) is an isolated amnesic syndrome with normal neurologic examination. Patients remain alert and communicative with no loss of personal identity; however, they experience striking loss of memory for recent events and an impaired ability to retain new information. We report a case of TGA in a patient with acute ischemia in bilateral hippocampal abnormalities. This provides evidence in support of an ischemic hypothesis as the possible etiology of TGA.
