The incorporation of intraventricularly injected L-[3H]-tyrosine into proteins from three rat brain regions was studied during the acquisition of a shock-motivated brightness discrimination. Separating the proteins by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an increased labeling confined to only a few of the resolved slow-moving bands of soluble and, especially insoluble hippocampus proteins. The labeling of visual cortex proteins showed only minute changes, while the auditory cortex proteins exhibited no differences between trained and nontrained animals.
