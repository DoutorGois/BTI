The purpose of this research was an assessment of neuroprotective effect of ACTH (4-9) in degenerative changes of nerve cells induced by dexamethasone. Experiments were led on Albino-Swiss mouse males. We examine morphological changes of neurons in the dorsal hippocampus in slides stained with cresyl violet and we performed quantitative analysis of neurodegenerative changes using a computer analyser of histological pictures. Achieved results indicate that ACTH (4-9) shows neuroprotective effect against neurotoxic influence of dexamethasone. This chemical inhibits dexamethasone induced degeneration of hippocampal nerve cells having morphological features characteristic of apoptosis.
