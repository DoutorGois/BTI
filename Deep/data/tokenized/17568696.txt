Recently, we have reported that quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, prevents memory impairment and hippocampus neurodegeneration induced by global cerebral ischemia (GCI). In the present study, we examined the possible effects of quetiapine on other behavioural deficits, including the depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural consequences of GCI. Mice were treated with quetiapine (5 or 10mg/kg/day; intraperitoneal (i.p.)) for 14 days. On Day 15, the animals were subjected to GCI. GCI resulted in a decrease of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining and induced depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural changes. The behavioural changes were indicated by a significant increase in the immobility duration in a tail-suspension test, and an increase in the time spent in the light box in a light/dark box test. Pre-administration of quetiapine significantly alleviated the decreased TH immunostaining and attenuated the depressive and anxiolytic-like behavioural changes induced by GCI. These results enhance our understanding about the mechanisms of quetiapine and suggest a wider perspective for the clinical use of quetiapine.
