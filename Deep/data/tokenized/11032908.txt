Oxidative stress may contribute to many pathophysiologic changes that occur after traumatic brain injury. In the current study, contemporary methods of detecting oxidative stress were used in a rodent model of traumatic brain injury. The level of the stable product derived from peroxidation of arachidonyl residues in phospholipids, 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2alpha), was increased at 6 and 24 h after traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, relative amounts of fluorescent end products of lipid peroxidation in brain extracts were increased at 6 and 24 h after trauma compared with sham-operated controls. The total antioxidant reserves of brain homogenates and water-soluble antioxidant reserves as well as tissue concentrations of ascorbate, GSH, and protein sulfhydryls were reduced after traumatic brain injury. A selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, SC 58125, prevented depletion of ascorbate and thiols, the two major water-soluble antioxidants in traumatized brain. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy of rat cortex homogenates failed to detect any radical adducts with a spin trap, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N:-oxide, but did detect ascorbate radical signals. The ascorbate radical EPR signals increased in brain homogenates derived from traumatized brain samples compared with sham-operated controls. These results along with detailed model experiments in vitro indicate that ascorbate is a major antioxidant in brain and that the EPR assay of ascorbate radicals may be used to monitor production of free radicals in brain tissue after traumatic brain injury.
