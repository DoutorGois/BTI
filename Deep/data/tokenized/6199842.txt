A monoclonal antibody produced against hippocampal cell membranes labeled the surface of neurons in the rat limbic system. With a few exceptions, all nonlimbic components were unstained. This specific distribution of immunopositive neurons provides strong evidence of molecular specificity among functionally related neurons in the mammalian brain and supports the concept of a limbic system.
