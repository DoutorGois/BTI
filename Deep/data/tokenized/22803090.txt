Here we present the results of histochemical detection of 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in neurons of the neocortex, cerebellum, and brainstem. The positive reaction was observed in a low number of neocortical, midbrain, and pontine neurons. The maximum number of positive neurons was detected in the cerebellar cortex (Purkinje cells) and hippocampus.
