Generalization of fear responses is a symptom of many anxiety disorders and we have previously demonstrated that female rats generalize fear to a neutral context at a faster rate compared to males. This effect is due in part, to activation of ER and modulation of memory retrieval mechanisms resulting in fear generalization. Given that the effects of estradiol on fear generalization required approximately 24h, our data suggested possible genomic actions on fear generalization. To determine whether these actions were due to cytosolic versus membrane bound receptors, female rats were given infusions of ICI 182,780, a cytosolic estrogen receptor antagonist, into the lateral ventricle or dorsal hippocampus simultaneously with estradiol treatment or with an ER agonist (DPN). Infusions of ICI into the lateral ventricle or the dorsal hippocampus blocked fear generalization induced by peripheral or central treatment with estradiol or DPN, suggesting that estradiol acts through cytosolic ERbeta receptors. In further support of these findings, intracerebroventricular or intra-hippocampal infusions of bovine serum conjugated estradiol (E2-BSA), activating membrane-bound estrogen receptors only, did not induce fear generalization. Moreover, rats receiving intra-hippocampal infusions of the ERK/MAPK inhibitor, U0126, continued to display estradiol-induced generalization, again suggesting that membrane-bound estrogen receptors do not contribute to fear generalization. Overall, these data suggest that estradiol-induced enhancements in fear generalization are mediated through activation of cytosolic/nuclear ER within the dorsal hippocampus. This region seems to be an important locus for the effects of estradiol on fear generalization although additional neuroanatomical regions have yet to be identified.
