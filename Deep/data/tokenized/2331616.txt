Disruption of the brain's protein phosphorylation system by ischemia may cause irreversible metabolic and structural alterations leading eventually to cell death. To examine the effect of ischemia on the phosphorylation state of brain proteins, tissue homogenates derived from the hippocampus, striatum and neocortex of normal rats and rats subjected to severe forebrain ischemia were phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP. The phosphorylated proteins were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and changes were assessed by autoradiography. Cerebral ischemia caused marked alterations of the phosphorylation state of many brain proteins; phosphorylation of some proteins was increased while phosphorylation of others was decreased. Despite differences in the sensitivity of the hippocampus, striatum and neocortex to ischemic injury the direction and approximate magnitude of protein phosphorylation changes caused by ischemia were similar in all three regions. Since the pattern of protein phosphorylation in the ischemia-vulnerable hippocampus was identical to that in the ischemia-resistant paramedian neocortex we conclude that abnormalities of protein phosphorylation may be necessary for ischemic injury to neurons but none are sufficient to explain the selective vulnerability of certain brain regions to ischemic damage.
