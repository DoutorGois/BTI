Chronic restraint stress has been associated with induction of morphological changes in the hippocampus. Postsynaptically, these changes include decreased length and branching of apical dendrites from CA3 pyramidal neurons, while presynaptically, depletion and clustering of synaptic vesicles have been observed. However, the molecular correlates of these changes remain poorly defined; while some studies have identified changes in the levels of some presynaptic proteins, none have assessed the coordinate expression of components of the membrane fusion complex, including synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 kDa, and their major regulatory molecules synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and synapsin. Therefore, we undertook to assess the immunoreactivity of these proteins in hippocampal slices obtained from rats subjected to either acute (one 6 h session) or chronic (21 days at 6 h per day) of restraint stress. Specifically, we observed a significant increase in synaptobrevin immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (54.2%; P=0.005), the stratum radiatum in the CA1 subfield (55.5%; P=0.007), and a region including the stratum lucidum and the proximal portion of the stratum radiatum in the CA3 subfield (52.7%; P=0.002); we also observed a trend toward increased synaptophysin levels in the stratum lucidum/radiatum of the CA3 subfield (8.0%; P=0.051) following chronic, but not acute, restraint stress. In that synaptobrevin has been associated with replenishment of the "readily-releasable" pool of synaptic vesicles and the efficiency of neurotransmitter release, the present results suggest that stress-induced changes in synaptobrevin may at least in part underlie the previously observed changes in synaptic and neuronal morphology.
