To test the three main hypotheses of the human amnesic syndrome (encoding, consolidation, retrieval), we designed an original protocol for memory assessment under Amytal that included, in addition to a retrograde memory measure, both short-term and long-term anterograde memory measures. Twenty epileptic patients with SEEG-confirmed unilateral temporal lobe foci were given right and left injections on successive days. Only the long-term memory measure for material presented under Amytal was significantly related to the presence of a temporal contralateral epileptogenic focus, even if it was assessed when the hemisphere had completely recovered from the effect of Amytal. Short-term memory deficits were observed equally often after injections ipsilateral and contralateral to the epileptogenic focus, and no retrograde amnesia was observed. These results are consistent with the consolidation hypothesis.
