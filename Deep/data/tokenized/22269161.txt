One of the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta) as senile plaques in specific brain regions. Clearly, an understanding of the cellular processes underlying Abeta deposition is a crucial issue in the field of AD research. Recent studies have found that accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta (iAbeta) is associated with synaptic deficits, neuronal death, and cognitive dysfunction in AD patients. In this study, we found that Abeta deposits had several shapes and sizes, and that iAbeta occurred before the formation of extracellular amyloid plaques in the subiculum of 5XFAD mice, an animal model of AD. We also observed pyroglutamate-modified Abeta (N3pE-Abeta), which has been suggested to be a seeding molecule for senile plaques, inside the Abeta plaques only after iAbeta accumulation, which argues against its seeding role. In addition, we found that iAbeta accumulates in calcium-binding protein (CBP)-free neurons, induces neuronal death, and then develops into senile plaques in 2-4-month-old 5XFAD mice. These findings suggest that N3pE-Abeta-independent accumulation of Abeta in CBP-free neurons might be an early process that triggers neuronal damage and senile plaque formation in AD patients. Our results provide new insights into several long-standing gaps in AD research, namely how Abeta plaques are formed, what happens to iAbeta and how Abeta causes selective neuronal loss in AD patients.
