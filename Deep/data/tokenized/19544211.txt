The 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor/67-kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR, also known as ribosomal protein SA, RPSA) has been reported to be involved in cancer development and prion internalization. Previous studies have shown that the LRP/LR is expressed in a wide variety of tissues. In particular, expression of LRP/LR mRNA may be closely related to the degree of PrP(Sc) propagation. This study presents a detailed investigation of the LRP/LR mRNA expression levels in eleven normal ovine tissues. Using real-time quantitative PCR, the highest LRP/LR expression was found in neocortex (p < 0.05). Slightly lower levels were found in the heart and obex. Intermediate levels were seen in hippocampus, cerebellum, spleen, thalamus, mesenteric lymph node, and the lowest levels were present in liver, kidney, and lung. In general, the LRP/LR mRNA levels were much higher in neuronal tissues than in peripheral tissues. The observation that differences in LRP/LR mRNA expression levels are consistent with the corresponding variation in PrP(Sc) accumulation suggests that the 37-kDa/67-kDa laminin receptor may be involved in the regulation of PrP(Sc) propagation.
