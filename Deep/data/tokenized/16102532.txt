It is not fully understood how NMDAR-dependent LTD causes Ca(2+)-dependent endocytosis of AMPARs. Here we show that the neuronal Ca(2+) sensor hippocalcin binds the beta2-adaptin subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex and that along with GluR2 these coimmunoprecipitate in a Ca(2+)-sensitive manner. Infusion of a truncated mutant of hippocalcin (HIP(2-72)) that lacks the Ca(2+) binding domains prevents synaptically evoked LTD but has no effect on LTP. These data indicate that the AP2-hippocalcin complex acts as a Ca(2+) sensor that couples NMDAR-dependent activation to regulated endocytosis of AMPARs during LTD.
