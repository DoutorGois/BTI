It is difficult to comprehend the entorhino-hippocampal information processing using acute transverse hippocampal slice, because the dorsally inclined connections of the entorhino-hippocampal projections can be damaged easily. Therefore, we investigated the spatial-temporal propagation in organotypic cultures of the hippocampus attaching to the entorhinal cortex using a real-time optical recording system with a voltage-sensitive dye and suitability as an in vitro model. Real-time imaging demonstrated that the stimulation of the perforant pathway induced excitatory propagation in trisynaptic pathway of the hippocampus and sequentially in the layer V from the medial to the lateral entorhinal cortex. The horizontal propagation from the lateral to the medial site was also seen after the stimulation of the lateral entorhinal cortex. The analysis of the entorhino-hippocampal organotypic culture would contribute to understanding of the mechanism of learning and memory.
