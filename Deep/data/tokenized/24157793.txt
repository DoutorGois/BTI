Oxidative stress is an established event in the pathology of neurobiological diseases. Previous studies indicated that store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) has been involved in oxidative stress. The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of SOCE inhibition on neuronal oxidative stress injury induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in HT22 cells, a murine hippocampal neuronal model. H2O2 insult induced significant intracellular Ca(2+) overload, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell viability decrease. Inhibition of SOCE by pharmacological inhibitor and STIM1 RNAi significantly alleviated intracellular Ca(2+) overload, restored the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased cytochrome C release and eventually inhibited H2O2-induced cell apoptosis. These findings suggest that SOCE inhibition exhibited neuroprotection against oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and SOCE might be a useful therapeutic target in neurobiological disorders.
