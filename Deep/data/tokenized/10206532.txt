We report a case of hemimegalencephaly in a 13-month-old girl successfully treated with modified functional hemispherectomy. Instead of total temporal lobectomy, medial temporal lobectomy with excision of the hippocampus and amygdala was carried out. The central region including the parasagittal tissue was preserved. A few days after the surgery seizures completely ceased. Administration of anticonvulsants was stopped 5 months after the surgery, and she has been seizure-free for 42 months.
