The Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a cell adhesion molecule that is highly expressed in the developing brain. CAR is enriched in growth cone particles (GCP) after subcellular fractionation. In GCP, we identified actin as an interaction partner of the cytoplasmic domain of CAR. In vivo, actin and CAR co-immunoprecipitate and co-localize. In vitro, the binding is direct, with a K(d) of approximately 2.6 microM, and leads to actin bundling. We previously demonstrated that CAR interacts with microtubules. These data suggest a role for CAR in processes requiring dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton such as neurite outgrowth and cell migration.
