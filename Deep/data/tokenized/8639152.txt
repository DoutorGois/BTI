The brains of mice selectively bred for differential locomotor activity in an open field (DeFries et al., Behav. Genet. 8:3-13, 1978) were analyzed for selection-dependent changes in the size of synaptic fields at the midseptotemporal level for the hippocampus. Timm-stained areas of all hippocampal fields from both left and right hippocampi were measured on five horizontal sections from the midseptotemporal level. The sample included 25 mice from two replicate lines, each one consisting of a high (HI); a low (LO), and a control line (CTL). The main selection effect was an enlargement of the intra-infrapyramidal mossy fiber (IIP-MF) projection in both HI lines by about 70% compared to LO and CTL mice (p < .0001), while other mossy fiber fields did not show differences. These findings confirm that genetic variations of the IIP-MF projection influence hippocampal processes mediating exploratory activities.
