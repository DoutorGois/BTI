Copulation in rabbits provokes behavioral and neuroendocrine changes in both sexes. To investigate if the activity of particular brain regions is modified accordingly we quantified, by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method, c-fos expression in the preoptic area, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and frontal cortex of male and female rabbits before mating, immediately afterwards, and 1 h later. Mating immediately increased c-fos expression in the hypothalamus of both sexes, the frontal cortex of females, and the preoptic area of males. c-fos expression did not change in the hippocampus after mating in either sex but decreased in the preoptic area of females following mating. Results show that mating provokes changes in brain activity, in a gender- and region-specific manner, which may underlie the behavioral and endocrine consequences of copulation in rabbits.
