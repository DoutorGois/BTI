In this study, We investigated the changes in the ability of learning-memory of 12-month- and 18-month-old mice, and the intrasynaptosomal Ca(2+) levels of some mouse brain areas (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, corpus quadrigem and cerebellum) on the basis of our last behavior observation and biochemistry detection. Meanwhile, the intrasynaptosomal Ca(2+) levels of the four brain areas were compared between the mice of impaired and good memory. The main results are as follows. With the increase of age, the ability of learning-memory of mice decreased significantly; and the concentration of the intrasynaptosomal free Ca(2+) (i) in mouse brain areas (except for cerebral cortex) increased markedly, especially in the memory-impaired mice. The results suggest that age-related memory impairment may be associated with the overloading of intrasynaptosomal free Ca(2+) (i).
