In humans, deletions/mutations in the CHL1/CALL gene are associated with mental retardation and schizophrenia. Juvenile CHL1-deficient (CHL1(-/-) ) mice have been shown to display abnormally high numbers of parvalbumin-expressing (PV(+) ) hippocampal interneurons and, as adults, display behavioral traits observed in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we addressed the question whether inhibitory interneurons and synaptic plasticity in the CHL1(-/-) mouse are affected during brain maturation and in adulthood. We found that hippocampal, but not neocortical, PV(+) interneurons were reduced with age in CHL1(-/-) mice, from a surplus of +27% at 1 month to a deficit of -20% in adulthood compared with wild-type littermates. This loss occurred during brain maturation, correlating with microgliosis and enhanced interleukin-6 expression. In parallel with the loss of PV(+) interneurons, the inhibitory input to adult CA1 pyramidal cells was reduced and a deficit in short- and long-term potentiation developed at CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses between 2 and 9 months of age in CHL1(-/-) mice. This deficit could be abrogated by a GABAA receptor agonist. We propose that region-specific aberrant GABAergic synaptic connectivity resulting from the mutation and a subsequently enhanced synaptic elimination during brain maturation lead to microgliosis, increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, loss of interneurons, and impaired synaptic plasticity. Close homolog of L1-deficient (CHL1(-/-) ) mice have abnormally high numbers of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing hippocampal interneurons in juvenile animals, but in adult animals a loss of these cells is observed. This loss correlates with an increased density of microglia (M), enhanced interleukin-6 (IL6) production and a deficit in short- and long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 excitatory synapses. Furthermore, adult CHL1(-/-) mice display behavioral traits similar to those observed in neuropsychiatric disorders of humans.
