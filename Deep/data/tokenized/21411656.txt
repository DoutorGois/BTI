Neurons recruit numerous mechanisms to facilitate the development of synaptic connections. However, little is known about activity-dependent mechanisms that control the timing and fidelity of this process. Here we describe a novel pathway used by neurons to regulate glutamate receptors at maturing central synapses. This pathway relies on communication between neurons and astrocytes and the ability of astrocytes to release the factor SPARC (secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine). SPARC expression is dynamically regulated and plays a critical role in determining the level of synaptic AMPARs. SPARC ablation in mice increases excitatory synapse function, causes an abnormal accumulation of surface AMPARs at synapses, and impairs synaptic plasticity during development. We further demonstrate that SPARC inhibits the properties of neuronal beta3-integrin complexes, which are intimately coupled to AMPAR stabilization at synapses. Thus neuron-glial signals control glutamate receptor levels at developing synapses to enable activity-driven modifications of synaptic strength.
