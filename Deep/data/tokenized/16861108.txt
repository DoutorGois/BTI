Previous studies showed that opioid drugs-oxycodone-6-oxime and 14-methoxy-5-methyl-dihydromorphinone (14-methoxymetopon)-produced less respiratory depressive effect and slower rate of tolerance and dependence, respectively. It was also reported that morphine decreased the prodynorphin gene expression in the rat hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus. In this study, we determined the prodynorphin gene expression and dynorphin levels in selected brain regions of opioid tolerant rats. We found that in the striatum morphine decreased, while oxycodone-6-oxime increased and 14-methoxymetopon did not alter the prodynorphin gene expression. In the nucleus accumbens, morphine and oxycodone-6-oxime did not change, while 14-methoxymetopon increased the prodynorphin gene expression. In the hippocampus both oxycodone-6-oxime and 14-methoxymetopon enhanced, whereas morphine did not alter the prodynorphin gene expression. In the rat striatum only oxycodone-6-oxime increased dynorphin levels significantly in accordance with the prodynorphin mRNA changes. In the hippocampus both opioid agonists increased the dynorphin levels significantly similarly to the augmented prodynorphin gene expression. In ventral tegmental area only 14-methoxymetopon increased dynorphin levels significantly. In nucleus accumbens and the temporal-parietal cortex the changes in the prodynorphin gene expression and the dynorphin levels did not correlate. Since the endogenous prodynorphin system may play a modulatory role in the development of opioid tolerance, the elevated supraspinal dynorphin levels appear to be partly responsible for the reduced degree of tolerance induced by the investigated opioids.
