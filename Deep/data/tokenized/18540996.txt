The role of oestrogen replacement therapy in preventing or delaying age-associated cognitive decline is controversial. Therapy success may critically depend on the time of treatment initiation following cessation of ovarian function. The present study aimed to assess, in middle-aged rats, whether the ability of oestradiol to modulate the cholinergic system depends on the timing of treatment initiation following ovariectomy. Using western blotting, protein levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were measured in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), which are both important areas with respect to cognitive function. In an initial experiment, we established the effects of oestradiol delivered via implanted capsules on ChAT levels in the hippocampus and PFC of young adult animals. In a second experiment, we tested the ability of the same oestradiol treatment paradigm to affect ChAT protein in 15-month-old middle-aged rats that had been ovariectomised either at the age of 10 months or at 15 months. In both experiments, rats were sacrificed 10 days after receiving implants and ChAT protein levels were measured. In both young adult and middle-aged animals, oestradiol treatment initiated immediately after ovariectomy significantly increased ChAT levels in the hippocampus but not in the PFC compared to cholesterol control treatment. However, when oestradiol treatment was initiated 5 months after ovariectomy, it failed to significantly increase ChAT levels in the hippocampus, but did so in the PFC. These data indicate that, after prolonged ovarian hormone deprivation, the ability of subsequent oestradiol treatment to modulate ChAT protein levels is altered in a site-specific manner.
