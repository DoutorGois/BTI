A growing body of evidence has focused on the impact of mitochondrial disturbances in the development of depression, but little data exist regarding the effects of chronic administration of antidepressant drugs on the brain's mitochondrial protein profile. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of chronic treatment with an atypical antidepressant drug-tianeptine-on the mitochondria-enriched subproteome profile in the hippocampus and the frontal cortex of 3-month-old male rats following a prenatal stress procedure. Rats that were exposed to a prenatal stress procedure displayed depressive- and anxiety-like disturbances based on the elevated plus-maze and Porsolt tests. Moreover, two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry showed structure-dependent mitoproteome changes in brains of prenatally stressed rats after chronic tianeptine administration. A component of 2-oxoglutarate and succinate flavoprotein subunit dehydrogenases, isocitrate subunit alpha, was upregulated in the hippocampus. In the frontal cortex, there was a striking increase in the expression of glutamate dehydrogenase and cytochrome bc1 complex subunit 2. These findings suggest that mitochondria are underappreciated targets for therapeutic interventions, and mitochondrial function may be crucial for the effective treatment of stress-related diseases.
