In this study, we show that removal of entorhinal cortex (ERC) afferents to hippocampus reduces levels of presenilin 1 (PS1) in the dentate gyrus of APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic (Tg) mice. PS1 immunoreactivity on the deafferented dentate gyrus decreases by approximately 25% and 50%, 2 and 4 weeks post-lesion compared to the contralateral side; by Western blotting, there is an approximately 40% decrease of the 43 kDa (full length) PS1 and an approximately 80% decrease of the 28 kDa (N-terminal fragment) PS1 on the lesioned dentate gyrus. Levels of beta-site APP Cleavage Enzyme 1 (BACE1) immunoreactivity also decrease by approximately 50% and 65% 2 and 4 weeks post-lesion. Together, these data demonstrate that PS1 and BACE1 are transported from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus via axons of the perforant pathway.
