Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion causes cognitive impairment, but the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. We used permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (2-VO) to induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in male Wistar rats. Cognitive impairment and the expression patterns of MAP-2, GAP-43, and synaptophysin were examined. We found that both learning capacity and memory were gradually impaired in the rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion concomitant with increased duration of 2-VO treatment. Four weeks of 2-VO treatment resulted in down-regulation of synaptophysin expression at the protein levels, and a further decrease was observed at 10-20 weeks, although mRNA levels remained the same. Ten weeks of 2-VO treatment lead to down-regulation of MAP-2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels with a further decrease at 20 weeks. Interestingly, GAP-43 mRNA was significantly up-regulated by 2-VO treatment, although the protein levels were not altered. Therefore, the cognitive impairment caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion may be partially explained by reduced expression of synaptophysin and MAP-2 at the protein level. The reduction in MAP-2 expression may be attributed to the inhibition of transcription, while the reduction in synaptophysin expression might be due to the inhibition of translation. Up-regulation of GAP-43 mRNA in the rat hippocampus with 2-VO treatment suggests that a compensatory mechanism may antagonize ischemic challenges.
