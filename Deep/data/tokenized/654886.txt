We have shown that as the number of granulovacuolar bodies in affected pyramidal cells of the hippocampus increases so cytoplasmic RNA contant is reduced. Prior to its degeration, the nucleolus is increased in volume while that of the nucleus remains unchanged in size throughout. The effects of these degenerative changes are to bring about a progressive decline in the capacity for nerve cell function, leading eventually to the death of the cell.
