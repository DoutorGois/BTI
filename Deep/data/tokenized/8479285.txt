The present study analyses the effects of learning on the spatial pattern and the time-course of changes of immediate early gene messenger RNA's (c-fos and c-jun) in mouse brain produced by training in an appetitive bar-pressing task. Activation of c-fos and c-jun after training is strictly located in the hippocampal formation and is learning-dependent. Levels of both proto-oncogene mRNAs in the trained group were 4 to 5 times higher than in the sham-conditioned group. Injections of apamin, a bee venom neurotoxin that selectively blocks a class of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels and improves learning and memory retention, produced as compared to untrained animals a 3- to 5-fold increase of expression of c-fos and c-jun with the same pattern as that observed in the trained animals. Post-training injection of 0.2 mg/kg apamin enhanced 1.4-fold the expression of both immediate early genes in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus as compared to trained saline-injected mice. All these results suggest that apamin-induced increase of immediate early gene expression might be related to the apamin-induced facilitation of learning.
