Eighteen male Wistar rats were given one daily two-way active avoidance conditioning session followed immediately by 5 hr of sleep recording, for 5 consecutive days. The group of rats that achieved 80% or greater avoidance in some of the 5 training sessions showed significant linear increases of paradoxical sleep (PS), compared with baseline levels, throughout the successive conditioning sessions. Furthermore, (a) the group of rats showing PS increases (more than 1 SD above baseline) after some of the training sessions achieved a significantly higher final number of avoidances than the remaining animals: (b) a high and positive correlation was observed between avoidance increases in the 3rd conditioning session and previous PS; and (c) maximum increases in correct performance often occurred following high PS increases. It is concluded that PS increases facilitate the consolidation of learning.
