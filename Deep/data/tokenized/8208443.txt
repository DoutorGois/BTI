The frequency and distribution of intravascular coagulation (IVC) were studied in brains of 121 patients who had died due to acute myeloblastic leukemias type M1 or M2. The IVC within the brain was observed in 59% of cases, more frequently in patients treated with polychemotherapy, especially according to TAD or VAPA protocols. The microthrombi were found predominantly in capillaries and small venous vessels. IVC was more frequent in cerebral and cerebellar white matter and in the neighbourhood of lateral ventricles (hippocampus, thalamus). In patients who had developed brain hemorrhage in the course of primary neoplasmic disease IVC was very frequent phenomenon, thus IVC is considered to be an important factor in the development of CNS hemorrhages in myeloblastic leukemias, irrespective of thrombocytopenia related to bone marrow involvement.
