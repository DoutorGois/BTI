Propofol is a commonly used general anesthetic agent which has been previously shown to enhance the inhibitory GABAergic transmission in the central nervous system. In addition to the GABAergic element, the excitatory transmission may be another central molecular site impacted by propofol. Increasing evidence implies that the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor represents an excitatory amino acid receptor subtype subjected to the regulation by propofol. Indeed, in this study, we found that a single injection of propofol at an anesthetic dose increased AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit phosphorylation in young (2-3 months old) and aged (20-21 months old) mice in vivo. Propofol caused an increase in GluA1 phosphorylation in the hippocampus but not in the prefrontal cortex. The propofol effect was also site-selective as the drug elevated GluA1 phosphorylation at serine 831 (S831) but not serine 845. Interestingly, while propofol induced a moderate and transient increase in S831 phosphorylation in young mice, the drug caused a substantial and sustained S831 phosphorylation in aged animals. Total GluA1 abundance remained stable in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in both young and aged mice in response to propofol. These results provide evidence supporting the sensitivity of GluA1 AMPA receptors to propofol. A single dose of propofol was able to upregulate GluA1 phosphorylation in the confined hippocampus in an age-dependent manner.
