In spite of numerous studies utilizing intraventricular administration of porcine galanin (1-29), little is known about the spread and cellular distribution of exogenous galanin following intraventricular administration. In this study a discrete nerve cell body population with their dendrites became strongly galanin immunoreactive (IR) in the dorsal hippocampus following intraventricular porcine galanin (1.5 nmol/rat). Time course experiments showed that after time intervals of 10 and 20 min, but not at 60 min, scattered small- to medium-sized galanin-IR nerve cell bodies and their dendrites were present in all layers of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. In double-immunolabeling experiments most of these nerve cells were identified as putative GABA interneurons costoring NPY-IR or somatostatin-IR in some cases. Twenty minutes after intraventricular injection of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), only endogenous punctate and coarse galanin-IR terminals were found, but no galanin-IR cell bodies. Intrahippocampal injection of fluorophore-labeled galanin resulted in the appearance of fluorescent nerve cell bodies with the same morphology and localization as in the above experiments. Coadministration of the putative galanin antagonist M35 (0.5 nmol) and galanin (1.5 nmol) resulted in a reduced number of galanin-IR nerve cell bodies in the hippocampus of half of the rats. These findings support the existence of a population of putative hippocampal GABA interneurons with the ability to internalize and concentrate galanin and/or its fragments present in the extracellular fluid, possibly mediated by galanin receptors.
