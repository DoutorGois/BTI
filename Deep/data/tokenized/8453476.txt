A massive and transitory increase in c-fos mRNA and Fos protein occurred in rats intoxicated by a single dose of soman (organophosphate compound and irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor) only in animals that had seizures. Comparison of immunohistochemistry that localizes Fos protein and of in situ hybridization that localizes its mRNA showed that there was an early and explosive expression of mRNA in many cerebral regions followed by transitory immunoreactivity in only some regions (piriform cortex, entorhinal area, hippocampus). The levels of mRNA and c-fos-like immunoreactivity decreased slowly and returned to basal level 24 h after soman administration.
