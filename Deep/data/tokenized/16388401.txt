Since alterations in monoamines and monoamine oxidase (MAO) have been postulated to play a role in toxic effects of lead (Pb) on the central nervous system, we have examined the protective effects of calcium (Ca2+) and zinc (Zn2+) supplementation on Pb-induced perturbations in the levels of monoamines and the activity of MAO. Swiss albino mice were lactationally exposed to low (0.2%) and high (1%) levels of Pb-acetate via drinking water of the mother. Pb-exposure commenced on postnatal day (PND) 1, continued up to PND 21 and stopped at weaning. Ca2+ or Zn2+ (0.02% in 0.2% Pb-water or 0.1% in 1% Pb-water) was supplemented separately to the mother up to PND 21. The levels of monoamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin) and the activity of MAO in the brain regions such as hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum and medulla of young (1 month old) and adult (3 month old) mice were determined in the synaptosomal fractions. The synaptosomal monoamines though increased with low level (0.2%) Pb-exposure, significantly decreased with high level (1%) Pb-exposure in all the brain regions in both the age groups. In general, the young mice seem to be more vulnerable to Pb-neurotoxicity. Ca2+ or Zn2+ supplementation significantly reversed the Pb-induced perturbations both in the levels of monoamines and in the activity of MAO. However, the recovery in monoamine levels and MAO activity was more pronounced with Ca2+ supplementation as compared to Zn2+. These results provide evidence that dietary Ca2+ and/or Zn2+ provide protection against Pb-induced neurotoxic effects.
