We evaluated oxidative stress associated with a model of experimental epilepsy. Male Wistar rats were injected i.p. with 150 mg/kg convulsant 3-mercaptopropionic acid and decapitated in two stages: during seizures or in the post-seizure period. Spontaneous chemiluminescence, levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, total antioxidant capacity and antioxidant enzyme activities were measured in cerebellum, hippocampus, cerebral cortex and striatum. In animals killed at seizure, increases of 42% and 90% were observed in spontaneous chemiluminescence of cerebellum and cerebral cortex homogenates, respectively, accompanied by a 25% increase in cerebral cortex levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In the post-seizure stage, emission completely returned to control levels in cerebral cortex and partly in cerebellum, thus showing oxidative stress reversibility in time. Hippocampus and striatum seemed less vulnerable areas to oxidative damage. A 30% decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity was only observed in cerebral cortex during seizures, while catalase and superoxide dismutase remained unchanged in all four areas during either stage. Likewise, total antioxidant capacity was unaffected in any of the studied areas. It is suggested that oxidative stress in this model of epilepsy arises from an increase in oxidant species rather than from depletion of antioxidant defences.
