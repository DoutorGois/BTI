The hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway provides highly convergent input to the mPFC in rats and shows two types of short-term plasticity in terms of paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) of the field potential under urethane anesthesia. We now report that stimulating either the dorsal or ventral subregions of the posterior hippocampus elicited PPF (by about 335 and 120%, respectively) of field potentials recorded in the mPFC at 100 ms interpulse interval. This PPF-like interaction occurred when projections were stimulated in the ventral-dorsal order (by about 200% of the single-pulsed response), but not vice versa. When weak long-term potentiation (LTP) of the dorsal projection was evoked simultaneously with strong LTP of the ventral projection, an associative effect was revealed (about +55%), although the magnitudes of LTP in each projection were not correlated. Even when the impermutable PPF-like facilitation was further enhanced (by about +120%), the enhancement was not correlated with either form of LTP, but exhibited the interaction of changes in the dorsal PPF, rather than in the heterotopic priming effect through the ventral projection. Moreover, this change was correlated with the associated LTP ratio of dorsal to ventral projection LTP (i.e., LTP associativity). Larger increases in LTP associativity correlated with greater impermutable PPF-like facilitation; in addition, there was hardly attenuation of the response to the dorsal projection by subsequent electrolytic lesions of the ventral subregion. These results indicate that the mPFC functionally integrates discrete sources of hippocampal information via cooperativity between short- and long-term plasticity.
