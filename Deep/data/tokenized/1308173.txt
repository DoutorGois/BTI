Both the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex are known to be crucial for spatial learning, but the contribution of the pathway linking the two structures, the perforant path (PP), has never been tested in a spatial learning paradigm. The present study examined the role of the PP in spatial learning using the Morris water maze. Seven days after bilateral transection of the PP with a fine-bladed knife, rats were habituated to the pool, then trained to swim from varying start locations to a platform submerged in a fixed location. After 28 training trials over 5 days, probe trials (without any platform present) were given to assess spatial memory for the location. Compared to sham-operated controls, lesioned rats showed slower learning and poorer asymptotic performance in terms of both swim path distance and escape latency, and less preference for the correct quadrant during probe trials. When the platform location was "reversed" to the opposite quadrant, the lesioned rats again showed poorer learning, poorer asymptotic performance, and reduced preference for the correct quadrant on the probe trial. When tested with a visible platform whose position varied from trial to trial, lesioned rats performed as well as controls. These results are congruent with previous analyses of the contributions of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus to spatial learning and suggest that for spatial learning, the PP is a critical functional link between these two structures.
