When WGA-HRP (wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate) or HRP was injected into the regions around the superior central and/or the dorsal raphe nuclei in the cat, cell bodies of a number of non-pyramidal neurons were labeled in Ammon's horn. Thus the existence of direct projections from non-pyramidal neurons in Ammon's horn to the rostral raphe regions in the brainstem was suggested in the cat.
