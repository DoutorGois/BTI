Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is a widely accepted model that attempts to link synaptic plasticity with memory. LTP models are also now used in order to test how a variety of neurological disorders might affect synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, electrical stimulation protocols that induce LTP appear to display different efficiencies and importantly, some may not be as physiologically relevant as others. In spite of advancements in our understanding of these differences, many types of LTP inducing protocols are still widely used. In addition, in some cases electrical stimulation leads to normal biological phenomena, such as putative memory encoding and in other cases electrical stimulation triggers pathological phenomena, such as epileptic seizures. Kindling, a model of epileptogenesis involving repeated electrical stimulation, leads to seizure activity and has also been thought of, and studied as, a form of long-term neural plasticity and memory. Furthermore, some investigators now use electrical stimulation in order to reduce aspects of seizure activity. In this review, we compare in vitro and in vivo electrical stimulation protocols employed in the hippocampal formation that are utilized in models of synaptic plasticity or neuronal hyperexcitability. Here the effectiveness and physiological relevance of these electrical stimulation protocols are examined in situations involving memory encoding (e.g., LTP/LTD) and epileptiform activity.
