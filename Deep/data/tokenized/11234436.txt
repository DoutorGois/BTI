In the review, it is presented an analysis of experimental data about cellular and molecular mechanisms of focal epileptogenesis. Basic principals of synchronized burst activity development in epileptogenic focus are considered. The roles of synaptic activities and extrasynaptic membrane excitability for epileptiform activity development are discussed. The various pathways of Ca2+ entry into neurones as well as an involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphorylation in mechanisms of epileptogenesis are analyzed. In vitro and in vivo experimental models of epileptogenesis (especially, kindling and audiogenic seizures) allowing to study the predisposition of neuronal circuit to epileptiform activity development are discussed.
