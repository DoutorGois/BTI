The present experiment was designed to determine whether classical eyeblink conditioning (EBC) can be established by using electrical microstimulation of the hippocampus as a conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with an air-puff unconditioned stimulus (US). We intended to examine whether EBC transfer could occur when a CS was shifted between microstimulation of the hippocampus as a CS (Hip-CS) and tone as a CS (tone-CS) and to compare the difference in transfer effectiveness between delay EBC (dEBC) and trace EBC (tEBC). Eight groups of guinea pigs, including 4 experimental groups and 4 control groups, were included in the study. First, the experimental groups received either a Hip-CS or a tone-CS paired with a US; then, these groups were exposed to a shifted CS (tone-CS or Hip-CS) paired with the US. The control groups received the corresponding Hip-CS or tone-CS, which was, however, pseudo-paired with the US. The control groups were then shifted to the tone-CS (or Hip-CS) paired with the US. The results show that EBC can be successfully established when using microstimulation of the hippocampus as a CS paired with an air-puff US, and that the acquisition rates of EBC are higher in the experimental groups than in the control groups after switching from the Hip-CS to the tone-CS or vice versa, indicating the occurrence of learning transfer between EBC established with the Hip-CS and tone-CS. The present study also demonstrated that the EBC re-acquisition rates were remarkably higher in dEBC than in tEBC with both types of transfer, which suggests that the saving effect was more evident in dEBC than tEBC. These results significantly expand our knowledge of EBC transfer as well as the functional neural circuit underlying EBC transfer.
