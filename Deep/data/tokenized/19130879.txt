Leptin is a protein hormone that acts within the hypothalamus to suppress food intake and decrease body adiposity, but it is increasingly clear that the hypothalamus is not the only site of leptin action, nor food intake the only biological effect of leptin. Instead, leptin is a pleiotropic hormone that impinges on many brain areas, and in doing so alters food intake, motivation, learning, memory, cognitive function, neuroprotection, reproduction, growth, metabolism, energy expenditure, and more. This diversity of function also means that a dysregulation of leptin secretion and signaling can have far reaching effects. To date research on leptin signaling has focused primarily on the hypothalamus, and the result is a relative lack of information regarding the impact of leptin signaling and leptin resistance in non-hypothalamic areas, despite a growing literature implicating leptin in the regulation of neuronal structure and function in the hippocampus, cortex and other brain areas associated with cognition.
