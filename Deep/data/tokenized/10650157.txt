A number of studies have shown an increase in nicotine self-administration among smokers when exposed to stress. Since it is well known that nicotine or stress alter the dopaminergic system, we examined the effect of chronic nicotine administration on the dopamine level and its metabolism in the striatum and the hippocampus during stressful conditions in rats. Nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p. for 14 days) increased the dopamine level in the striatum (P<0. 05) and decreased it in the hippocampus (P<0.05) in comparison with the effect of saline. Three hours of water-immersion restraint stress sharply elevated the dopamine level (P<0.05) and reduced the 3-methoxytyramine level (P ranged from 0.05 to 0.001 depending on the area and time point) in both brain regions studied, while dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanilic acid levels were not altered. Nicotine pretreatment attenuated some of these changes in a region- and time-dependent manner. However, stress induced a decrease in dopamine turnover in the hippocampus (P<0.05) but not in the striatum, and nicotine failed to prevent this effect. Stress-induced alterations gradually returned toward normal during the 48-h observation period, and in some cases this was facilitated by nicotine. Thus, we demonstrated differential, region- and time-dependent protective effects of chronic nicotine administration against stress-induced changes in dopamine levels and release in brain regions critically affected by stress.
