GTPase-activating protein is known to regulate the conversion between ras-GTP and ras-GDP. We studied the basal expression of GTPase-activating protein-like immunoreactivity in mouse cerebral regions using a polyclonal anti-GTPase-activating protein antibody. Cells with GTPase-activating protein-like immunoreactivity were distributed in frontal cortical layers IV and V, and in the parietal cortex, piriform cortex, amygdaloid area, septum, lateral thalamus, and hypothalamus. The GTPase-activating protein-like immunoreactivity was also observed in fiber-like structures in the caudate putamen, stria terminalis, internal capsule, and medial forebrain bundle, and around CA2 pyramidal cells in Ammon's horn. These results imply that GTPase-activating protein is constitutively expressed in mouse brain regions and may have physiological functions in specific neuronal pathways in the brain.
