Kindling with electrical stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus has been shown to disrupt spatial task performance in rats. The present study investigated the specificity of this effect in terms of the possible contribution of nonmnemonic effects, the presence of a more general mnemonic deficit, and the involvement of learning/short-term memory and/or long-term memory processes. Rats were fully kindled with stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus and subsequently tested for acquisition, 7-day retention, and 28-day retention of a hidden platform (HP) location in the Morris water maze and an object discrimination problem in a modified water maze. To control for nonmnemonic behavioral impairments, testing on both tasks was preceded by training on visible platform control tasks. Kindling impaired acquisition of the HP location but spared performance on all other aspects of testing, indicating a specific impairment of spatial learning/short-term memory. These results suggest that epileptogenesis induced by hippocampal stimulation is indeed associated with a selective disruption of the mechanisms mediating spatial learning/short-term memory.
