Fluid percussion injury (FPI) is a commonly used and clinically relevant model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the rat. Recently, our lab successfully adapted FPI to mice. To account for differences in response to injury between mice and rats and provide a foundation for further use of FPI in gene-targeting studies, we sought to characterize the temporal and regional response to FPI in male C57BL/6 mice. Animals were killed at 10 min, 24 h, and 4, 7, 14, and 35 days (n = 3 for each group) after a very severe parasagittal FPI (> 4.0 atm) or sham injury (n = 3). Extensive numbers of damaged neurons were consistently found in the ipsilateral cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus by 10 min. This damage was nearly identical at 24 h, but quickly declined at subsequent time points. Activated microglia were found only in regions of neuronal injury at the earliest time points. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity reached significantly higher levels compared with controls at 7 days (P < 0. 05) in the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus and remained elevated for 35 days. White matter degeneration was present in all regions examined. This damage did not appear until at least day 4, but progressed up to day 35. The spatial pattern of damage we observed in mice after FPI is similar to that seen in rats. However, the temporal progression of neuronal injury in mice is comparatively abbreviated in the hippocampus and thalamus. In conclusion, these results suggest that FPI in mice may be a particularly useful tool for studying mechanisms of TBI in gene-targeting studies.
