Origin of afferent projections of the hippocampal (mediodorsal cortex in lizards (Ophisaurus apodus) cells was revealed by studying retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. Most labelled neurons were located in n. dorsolateralis anterior thalami, corpus mamillaris, n. raphe superior, ipsilateral dorsal cortex and contralateral hippocampal cortex. Less neurons projecting to the hippocampal cortex were observed in the ventromedial part of basal telencephalon (tuberculum olfactorium, n. accumbens, nucleus of diagonal Broca band), hypothalamic preoptic area, mesencephalic ventrotegmental area. Labelled terminals of hippocampal efferents were found in the septum, thalamus, hypothalamus (mainly ipsilaterally) and bilaterally in the hippocampal and dorsal cortex. Both afferent and efferent connections of the hippocampal cortex in lizards are similar to those in mammals.
