To determine whether chronic epilepsy induces persistent cellular changes in subicular neurons intracellular recordings were used to compare membrane properties of control and kindled rats. In both, control and kindled preparations the subiculum contained regular firing cells and an extensive sub-population of bursting cells expressing amplifying membrane characteristics. Subicular cells showed a transient depression of the fast and slow AHP in the course of kindling that may contribute to the induction but not permanence of the kindled state.
