The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 has been reported to suppress paired pulse inhibition in the hippocampal slice. It is now shown that the depression of orthodromic synaptic transmission by Ro 15-1788 can be prevented by the adenosine antagonist 8-phenyl-theophylline, or by adenosine deaminase. Since Ro 15-1788 has previously been shown to inhibit adenosine-uptake into rat brain tissue, it is suggested that this property, leading to an accumulation of extracellular adenosine, may underlie its effects on synaptic transmission.
