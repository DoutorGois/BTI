LIM kinase 1 regulates actin filament dynamics through inhibition of ADF/cofilins. Surprisingly, nervous system development in LIM kinase 1 knockout mice is grossly normal, but the animals have deficits in spatial learning, alterations in LTP, and abnormalities in hippocampal dendritic spine structure. The findings are consistent with a role for LIMK-1 in synapse formation and function.
