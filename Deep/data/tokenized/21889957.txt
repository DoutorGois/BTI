The role of the GABA-A alpha-2 receptor subunit in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG) and prefrontal cortex (M2 area) during a fear session (performed one week after the conditioned fear test), was studied. We employed a model of high (HR) and low anxiety (LR) rats divided according to their conditioned freezing response. Pretreatment of rats with d-cycloserine immediately before the fear session attenuated fear response in HR and LR rats and increased the density of alpha-2 subunits in the BLA, M2 area and DG of HR animals. The less potent behavioural influence of midazolam (in HR group only) was linked to the increased expression of alpha-2 subunit in M2 area and DG. These results support a role of the GABA-A receptor alpha-2 subunit in processing of emotional cortico-hippocampal input to the BLA.
