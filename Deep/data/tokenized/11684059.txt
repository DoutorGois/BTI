We investigated the changes of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-immunoreactive structures in the hippocampal formation of aged macaques (Macaca fuscata fuscata). At adult stages (10 and 12 years), BDNF immunoreactivity occurred in the neurons of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal neurons in the CA1, CA2, CA3 subfields and the subiculum, and the neurons in the CA4 subfield and the entorhinal cortex. The apical dendrites were also BDNF immunopositive. In aged monkeys (26, 30 and 32 years), the intensity of the BDNF-immunoreactivity declined significantly in cell bodies and dendrites of the neurons in the hippocampal formation except the CA2 pyramidal neurons. These findings indicate that BDNF is one of the vulnerable signal molecules during the aging process of the primate hippocampal formation.
