beta-Asarone has significant pharmacological effects on the central nervous system. As a potential therapeutic agent to manage brain diseases, analysis of the pharmacokinetics of beta-asarone in brain is necessary. We used cardio-perfusion method to exclude the beta-asarone in the brain blood. The brain was divided into five regions: hippocampus, cortex, brain stem, thalamus and cerebellum, and pharmacokinetic differences were investigated. We found that concentration-time profile of beta-asarone in blood, hippocampus, cortex, brain stem and cerebellum could be adequately described by a first-order equation, consistent with a linear two-compartmental model, but a first-order equation with a linear one-compartmental model in thalamus. The half lives of beta-asarone in blood, hippocampus, cortex, brain stem, thalamus and cerebellum were 1.3801, 1.300, 1.937, 7.142, 2.832 and 8.149 h, respectively. Gender differences do not significantly influence plasma pharmacokinetics of beta-asarone.
