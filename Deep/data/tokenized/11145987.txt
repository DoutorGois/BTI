Measurement of the proportion of calcium/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase II (CaMPK-II) that is autonomously active or phosphorylated on Thr(286) is thought to provide an index of the degree to which CaMPK-II in a tissue has been activated. We have examined how various ways of handling hippocampal tissue can alter these properties. Both autonomous activity and phospho-Thr(286) content was high in freshly dissected hippocampus or freshly cut hippocampal slices. After incubation of hippocampal slices in artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 120 min, both properties of CaMPK-II decreased to a steady state level. Freeze-thaw or cutting the equilibrated slices could rapidly increase both autonomous activity and phospho-Thr(286) immunoreactivity of CaMPK-II. These increases were comparable to changes induced by experimental treatment. Therefore, our results suggest that considerable care needs to be taken over the way in which hippocampal slices are handled.
