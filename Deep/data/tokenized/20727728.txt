The investigation of single-neuron parameters is of great interest because many aspects in the behavior and communication of neuronal networks still remain unidentified. However, the present available techniques for single-cell measurements are slow and do not allow for a high-throughput approach. We present here a CMOS compatible microelectrode array with 84 electrodes (with diameters ranging from 1.2 to 4.2 mum) that are smaller than the size of cell, thereby supporting single-cell addressability. We show controllable electroporation of a single cell by an underlying electrode while monitoring changes in the intracellular membrane potential. Further, by applying a localized electrical field between two electrodes close to a neuron while recording changes in the intracellular calcium concentration, we demonstrate activation of a single cell ( approximately 270%, DF/F(0)), followed by a network response of the neighboring cells. The technology can be easily scaled up to larger electrode arrays (theoretically up to 137,000 electrodes/mm(2)) with active CMOS electronics integration able to perform high-throughput measurements on single cells.
