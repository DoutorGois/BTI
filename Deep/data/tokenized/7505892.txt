Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were administered either 2.4 g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric glucose daily for 4 weeks and the levels of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EP), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in different brain regions were determined. Results indicated a 3-fold increase in NE level in brain stem and hypothalamus and more than 2-fold increase in DA in corpus striatum in alcohol-treated rats as compared to controls. There was a significant increase in the level of DA in the corpus striatum but the levels in cerebral cortex, brain stem and hippocampus were decreased instead. Decreases in 5-HT levels were found in hypothalamus, brain stem, cortex and cerebellum of alcohol-treated brain as compared to untreated controls. These results indicate alterations of the biogenic amine contents in different regions of the SHR brain after chronic ethanol ingestion. Since stimulated release of biogenic amines in the SHR brain has been implicated in the regulation of blood pressure, changes due to ethanol ingestion may be a risk factor in hypertensive patients.
