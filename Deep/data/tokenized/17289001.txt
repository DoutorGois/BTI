A rodent model of diencephalic amnesia, pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD), was used to investigate diencephalic-limbic interactions. In-vivo acetylcholine (ACh) efflux, a marker of memory-related activation, was measured in the hippocampus and the amygdala of PTD-treated and pair-fed (PF) control rats while they were tested on a spontaneous alternation task. During behavioral testing, all animals displayed increases in ACh efflux in both the hippocampus and amygdala. However, during spontaneous alternation testing ACh efflux in the hippocampus and the alternation scores were higher in PF rats relative to PTD-treated rats. In contrast, ACh efflux in the amygdala was not suppressed in PTD treated rats, relative to PF rats, prior to or during behavioral testing. In addition, unbiased stereological estimates of the number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunopositive neurons in the medial septal/diagonal band (MS/DB) and nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) also reveal a selective cholinergic dysfunction: In PTD-treated rats a significant loss of ChAT-immunopositive cells was found only in the MS/DB, but not in the NBM. Significantly, these results demonstrate that thiamine deficiency causes selective cholinergic dysfunction in the septo-hippocampal pathway.
