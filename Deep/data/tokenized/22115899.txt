Chronic methamphetamine (meth) can lead to persisting cognitive deficits in human addicts and animal models of meth addiction. Here, we examined the impact of either contingent or non-contingent meth on memory performance using an object-in-place (OIP) task, which measures the ability to detect an object relative to its location and surrounding objects. Further, we quantified monoamine transporter levels and markers of neurotoxicity within the OIP circuitry and striatum. Male Long-Evans rats received an acute meth binge (4 x 4 mg/kg i.p., 2 h intervals) or self-administered meth (0.02 mg/infusion, i.v.; 7 days for 1 h/day, followed by 14 days for 6 h/day). Rats were tested for OIP recognition memory following one week of withdrawal. Subsequently, transporters for serotonin (SERT) and norepinephrine (NET) were quantified using Western blot in tissue obtained from the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and prefrontal cortex. In addition, striatal dopamine transporters, tyrosine hydroxylase, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were measured to assess potential neurotoxicity. Control (saline-treated) rats spent more time interacting with the objects in the changed locations. In contrast, contingent or non-contingent meth resulted in disrupted OIP performance as seen by similar amounts of time spent with all objects, regardless of location. While only acute meth binge produced signs of neurotoxicity, both meth regimens decreased SERT in the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus. Only meth self-administration resulted in a selective decrease in NET. Meth-induced changes in SERT function in the OIP circuitry may underlie memory deficits independently of overt neurotoxic effects.
