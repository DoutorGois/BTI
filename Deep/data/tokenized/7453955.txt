Changes of hippocampal EEG activity resulting from administration of d-amphetamine were investigated in rabbits before, during and after chronic treatment with haloperidol. Cross-zero analysis of EEG data showed that chronic treatment with haloperidol (3 mg/kg/day, i.p. for 9 days) attenuated the amphetamine-induced increase in hippocampal theta rhythm. The increase of theta activity by amphetamine was fully restored 30 days after withdrawal of haloperidol. Further, haloperidol reduced the incidence of spontaneous theta rhythm in 3 out of 4 animals. It is suggested that the enhancement of hippocampal theta by d-amphetamine is mediated in part by dopaminergic mechanisms which are susceptible to the action of haloperidol.
