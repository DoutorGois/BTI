We studied the responses of rat entorhinal neurons to electrical stimulation of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus and subicular complex. Three main results were obtained. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in entorhinal neurons in response to electrical stimulation. Cell in layers II, III and V of the entorhinal cortex were responsive. Frequency potentiation of excitatory responses was observed when 10/s stimulation was used. Excitatory responses were followed by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. The results provide evidence for an excitatory projection from the hippocampus and subiculum to the entorhinal cortex, and are consistent with the existence of feed-forward inhibition of entorhinal principal neurons.
