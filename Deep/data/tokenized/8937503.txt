To further assess the role of 5-HT in the modulation of audiogenic seizures (AGS) in the Genetically Epilepsy-Prone Rat (GEPR), changes in AGS severity after widespread chronic depletion of brain 5-HT by intracerebroventricular administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) were examined in moderate seizure GEPRs (GEPR-3s). Following treatment with 5,7-DHT (150 micrograms/30 microliters), a significant increase in seizure severity was observed at 2, 3 and 4 weeks as compared to vehicle-injected controls. The increase in seizure severity was evidenced by a significant increase in the incidence of tonic convulsions in 5,7-DHT treated animals (53% in treated animals compared to 0% in vehicle treated controls) over the testing period. Interestingly, the latency to wild running was increased in 5,7-DHT treated GEPRs, suggesting that depletion of brain 5-HT may slow initiation of AGS. Neurochemical analysis revealed marked depletion of 5-HT in the cortex (-96%), hippocampus (-94%), thalamus (-80%), hypothalamus (-62%), midbrain (-51%) and pons-medulla (-52%) in animals that received 5,7-DHT. However, no significant reductions in brain norepinephrine content were observed in any of the regions assayed due to the pretreatment of all animals with protriptyline. The present findings lend further support for an inhibitory action of brain 5-HT on audiogenic seizures in GEPRs.
