In this study, we determined the contribution of juvenile neurogenesis to the performance of mice on a remote memory for temporally based association task and in a novelty based spatial pattern separation task. This was accomplished by mating homozygous DNMT1-loxP mice with heterozygous GFAP-Cre mice and comparing Cre+ (no postnatal neurogenesis) to Cre- (wild type) littermate offspring. The results indicate that Cre+ mice are impaired relative to Cre- mice in the remote memory for a temporal based association task and in a novelty based spatial pattern separation task. These results support the temporal integration model of Aimone et al., [(2006) Nat Neurosci 9:723-727] and provide further support for an important role for postnatally born neurons in spatial pattern separation. In contrast, Cre+ mice are not impaired relative to Cre- mice in an object-context recognition task and a spatial location recognition task. These latter data suggest that postnatally derived neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) do not support all spatial and object recognition functions of the DG.
