Hypothyroidism impairs synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory. Clinical reports are conflicting about the ability of thyroid hormone replacement therapy to fully restore the hypothyroidism-induced learning and memory impairment. Recently, we have shown that hypothyroidism impairs LTP and cognition in adult rats. We have studied the effect of thyroxin replacement therapy on hypothyroidism-induced LTP impairment using electrophysiological and molecular approaches. Recording from CA1 region of the hippocampus in anesthetized adult rat indicated that 6 weeks of thyroxin replacement therapy (20 microg/kg/day) fully restored LTP impaired by hypothyroidism. Western blotting showed reduction in phosphorylated (P)-CAMKII, total-CaMKII, neurogranin, and calmodulin basal levels in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of hypothyroid rats. The levels of these molecules were normalized by thyroxin replacement therapy. The hypothyroid-induced elevation of basal calcineurin levels and activity was also normalized by thyroxin treatment. However, thyroxin replacement therapy did not restore hypothyroidism-induced reduction in PKCgamma basal protein levels. Additionally, real-time PCR, showed a reduction in basal neurogranin mRNA level that was normalized by thyroxin replacement therapy. In the sham (control) rats, induction of LTP by high-frequency stimulation increases P-CaMKII, and total CaMKII levels as well as CaMKII phosphotransferase activity. However, in hypothyroid rats, the same stimulation protocol induced an increase only in total-CaMKII. Thyroxin treatment normalized the levels and activity of these molecules. The results demonstrated that thyroxin therapy normalized the electrophysiological and molecular effects of hypothyroidism on the CA1 region and emphasized the critical role P-CaMKII plays in hypothyroidism-induced LTP impairment.
