Aluminum is the most plentiful metal on the Earth's crust, and its usage in cooking utensils, cosmetics, drinking containers, food additives, pharmaceutical products, and building materials provides many opportunities for potential aluminum consumption. However, its toxicity is low and harmful effects only develop with large-scale deposition of aluminum. In this study, we investigated the effects of subchronic exposure to aluminum (40 mg/kg/day) on neural stem cells, cell proliferation, neuroblast differentiation, and mature neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These experiments were performed in both high-fat diet and low-fat diet-fed C57BL/6J mice via immunohistochemistry using the relevant marker for each cell type, including nestin, Ki67, doublecortin, and NeuN. Subchronic exposure to aluminum in both low-fat and high-fat diet-fed mice reduced neural stem cells, cell proliferation, and neuroblast differentiation without any changes in mature neurons. Furthermore, this reduction effect was exacerbated in high-fat diet-fed mice. These results suggest that aluminum accelerates the reduction of neural stem cells, cell proliferation, and neuroblast differentiation additively or synergistically in high-fat diet-fed mice without any harmful changes in mature neurons.
