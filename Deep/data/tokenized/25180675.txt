Calcium independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) is an 85 kDa protein that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acyl ester bond of glycerophospholipids to liberate free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. In this study, we determined the role of constitutive iPLA2beta in long term potentiation (LTP) of the hippocampo-prefrontal cortical pathway in vivo. We also examined the effect of iPLA2beta knockdown using the rewarded alternation in T-maze task, a test of spatial working memory which is dependent on this pathway. Intracortical injection of an inhibitor to iPLA2, bromoenol lactone (BEL) or antisense oligonucleotide to iPLA2beta in the prefrontal cortex abolished induction of hippocampo-prefrontal cortical LTP. Moreover, iPLA2 inhibition and antisense knockdown resulted in increased errors in the rewarded alternation in T-maze task, indicating negative effects on spatial working memory. BEL or antisense injection did not produce DNA fragmentation in the cortex as demonstrated by TUNEL assay. Results confirm a role of constitutive iPLA2beta in hippocampo-prefrontal cortical synaptic plasticity in vivo, and add to previous observations of a role of iPLA2 in hippocampal LTP in vitro, and long-term memory retrieval. They may be relevant in Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative conditions that are associated with changes in iPLA2.
