[Arg8]-Vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to exert characteristic central physiological actions in the ventral septal area of the rat brain. This study reports the characterization of receptors for AVP in synaptic plasma membranes prepared from the ventral septal area, the lateral septum, and the hippocampus. Binding of [3H]AVP was temperature and time dependent, linearly related to protein concentration, saturable, and specific. Scatchard plot analysis suggested the presence of a population of binding sites in the three brain areas with dissociation constants and maximal binding capacities, respectively, of 1.06 +/- 0.39 nM and 24.0 +/- 7.01 fmol/mg of protein (mean +/- SEM; n = 3 for the ventral septal area, 0.92 +/- 0.13 nM and 47.0 +/- 4.96 fmol/mg of protein (n = 3) for the lateral septum, and 0.91 +/- 0.14 nM and 25 +/- 5.02 fmol/mg of protein (n = 3) for the hippocampus. In all three brain regions, the rank order of potencies of several vasopressin analogs, unrelated peptides, and other compounds for competitive displacement of ligand indicated a receptor with properties resembling those of the V1-like receptor for AVP. These data document the presence of a high-affinity, V1-like vasopressin receptor in the rat ventral septal area for which the pharmacological properties are similar to those previously reported in physiological studies.
