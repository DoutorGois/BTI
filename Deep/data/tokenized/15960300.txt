The Sgt1 protein was discovered in yeast but later it was found in other eucaryotic organisms, including plants and mammals. It was suggested that the Sgt1 protein plays a role in the CBF3 kinetochore and the SCF ubiquitin ligase complexes. Since the distribution, properties and functions of the mammalian Sgt1 have not been extensively studied, we examined the expression of Sgt1 protein in the rat tissues and here we report the preliminary results. Using northern and western blots we found that the Sgt1 protein is expressed in various tissues and that brain, skeletal muscles and spleen contain high levels of this protein and its mRNA. Then, by western blot, we checked the localization of Sgt1 in some areas of the rat brain such as cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus and we found that cerebellum and cortex contain highest amounts of this protein. Using immunohistochemistry we found that the Sgt1 protein is present in both neurons and glial cells.
