Results are given from experiments on binding of [3H]aldosterone to the cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors, in the brain structures of the rat with different types of behavior under normal conditions 10 min and two weeks after its peritoneal injection. Binding of [3H]aldosterone to cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors of the hippocampus, rather than the brain (without hippocampus and cerebellum), was shown to depend on the type of animal behavior. Stress was also shown to affect binding of this hormone to cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptors of the brain (without hippocampus and cerebellum), rather than hippocampus.
