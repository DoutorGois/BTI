Single-cell recording from the brain of non-human primates has traditionally been performed in monkeys seated in a primate chair. However, this arrangement makes long-term recordings difficult, causes stress that may confound the data, and prevents the manifestation of natural behaviors. Extending our previous neurophysiological studies in non-human primates (Ludvig et al. Brain Res. Protocols 2000;5:75-85), we have developed a method for recording the electrical activity of single hippocampal neurons in freely moving squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). The recording sessions lasted for up to 6 h, during which the monkeys moved freely around on the walls and the floor of a large test chamber and collected food pellets. Stable action potential waveforms were readily kept throughout the sessions. The following factors proved to be critical in this study: (a) selecting squirrel monkeys for the experiments, (b) using a driveable bundle of microwires for the recordings, (c) using a special recording cable, (d) implanting the microwires into the brain without causing neurological deficits, and (e) running the recording sessions in a special test chamber. The described method allows long-term extracellular recordings from the brain of non-human primates, without the stress of chairing, during a wide range of natural behaviors. Using this model, new insights can be obtained into the unique firing repertoire of the neurons of the primate brain.
