Expression of preprocholecystokinin mRNA was studied in regions of post mortem human brain using RNA blot analysis (Northern blot) and in situ hybridization. Northern blot analysis using a cDNA probe showed high levels of an approximately 0.8 kb preprocholecystokinin mRNA in all regions of neocortex examined. Lower levels of preprocholecystokinin mRNA were detected in amygdaloid body and thalamus. In situ hybridization analysis using the same cDNA probe revealed numerous weakly labelled neurons in different areas of human neocortex and less numerous neurons in hippocampus and amygdaloid body. High-performance liquid-chromatography and gel-chromatography combined with radioimmunoassay of cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity from human cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus revealed two major forms, one coeluting with sulphated cholecystokinin-8 and the other coeluting with sulphated cholecystokinin-58. Two minor components coeluting with cholecystokinin-4 and cholecystokinin-5 were also detected. The finding of cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity corresponding to cholecystokinin-8 and cholecystokinin-58 in caudate nucleus where no preprocholecystokinin mRNA was found, indicates the presence of these peptides in afferent nerve terminals.
