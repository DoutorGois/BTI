A method is described for confining an animal within an experimenter-defined area without the use of physical boundaries. The area of exploration is constrained by the presence of an aversive noise, triggered whenever the animal steps across a computer-controlled boundary. The radius of the invisible boundary is constantly reset so that the boundary becomes "fuzzy" and the animal cannot use it as a spatial localizing cue. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated both with behavioural data confirming reliable confinement, and also recordings of hippocampal place cells made from rats exploring the arena. The place cell data reveal that indeed, the cells did not appear to be controlled by the fuzzy boundary, in contrast with the strong control normally exerted by fixed boundaries. This technique is thus promising for studies of spatial behaviour in which the strong influence of walls needs to be removed in order to allow the study of more subtle processes such as landmark use and path integration.
