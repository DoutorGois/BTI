Cell signaling mediated by P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) has been suggested to be involved in epileptogenesis, via modulation of intracellular calcium levels, excitotoxicity, activation of inflammatory cascades, and cell death, among other mechanisms. These processes have been described to be involved in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) and contribute to hyperexcitability, resulting in spontaneous and recurrent seizures. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of P2X7R in epileptogenesis in vivo using RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit the expression of this receptor. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting P2X7R mRNA was injected into the lateral ventricles (icv) 6 h after SE. Four groups were studied: Saline-Vehicle, Saline-siRNA, Pilo-Vehicle, and Pilo-siRNA. P2X7R was quantified by western blotting and neuronal death assessed by Fluoro-Jade B histochemistry. The hippocampal volume (edema) was determined 48 h following RNAi. Behavioral parameters as latency to the appearance of spontaneous seizures and the number of seizures were determined until 60 days after the SE onset. The Saline-siRNA and Pilo-siRNA groups showed a 43 and 37% reduction, respectively, in P2X7R protein levels compared to respective vehicle groups. Neuroprotection was observed in CA1 and CA3 of the Pilo-siRNA group compared to Pilo-Vehicle. P2X7R silencing in pilocarpine group reversed the increase in the edema detected in the hilus, suprapyramidal dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3; reduced mortality rate following SE; increased the time to onset of spontaneous seizure; and reduced the number of seizures, when compared to the Pilo-Vehicle group. Therefore, our data highlights the potential of P2X7R as a therapeutic target for the adjunct treatment of epilepsy.
