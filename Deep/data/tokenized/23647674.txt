OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a curcumin intranasal thermosensitive hydrogel and to improve its brain targeting efficiency. METHODS: The hydrogel gelation temperature, gelation time, drug release and mucociliary toxicity characteristics as well as the nose-to-brain transport in the rat model were evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: The developed nasal hydrogel, composed of Pluronic F127 and Poloxamer 188, had shorter gelation time, longer mucociliary transport time and produced prolonged curcumin retention in the rat nasal cavity at body temperature. The hydrogel release mechanism was diffusion-controlled drug release, evaluated by the dialysis membrane method, but dissolution-controlled release when evaluated by the membraneless method. A mucociliary toxicity study revealed that the hydrogel maintained nasal mucosal integrity until 14 days after application. The drug-targeting efficiencies for the drug in the cerebrum, cerebellum, hippocampus and olfactory bulb after intranasal administration of the curcumin hydrogel were 1.82, 2.05, 2.07 and 1.51 times that after intravenous administration of the curcumin solution injection, respectively, indicating that the hydrogel significantly increased the distribution of curcumin into the rat brain tissue, especially into the cerebellum and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: A thermosensitive curcumin nasal gel was developed with favourable gelation, release properties, biological safety and enhanced brain-uptake efficiency.
