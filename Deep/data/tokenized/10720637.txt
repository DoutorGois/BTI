In order to determine whether the anticonvulsant effect of 2, 3-benzodiazepines is also displayed in a model of in vitro epilepsy, such as the "epileptiform" hippocampal slice, we studied the effects of 2,3-benzodiazepine 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxe-5H 2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466) and some new 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives on CA1 basal neuronal excitability and on CA1 epileptiform burst activity produced by 4-aminopyridine in rat hippocampal slices. The results showed that GYKI 52466 affected basal neuronal excitability as evidenced by its influence on the magnitude of the CA1 orthodromic-evoked field potentials. 2,3-Benzodiazepines showed their antiepileptic effect also in an in vitro model of experimental epilepsy. The effects of the new 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives suggest that the methylenedioxidation in positions 7 and 8 of the 2,3-benzodiazepine ring is the main structural modification for the antiepileptic effect of 2,3-benzodiazepines to take place.
