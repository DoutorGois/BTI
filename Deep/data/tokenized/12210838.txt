The neural cell adhesion molecule CHL1 (close homolog of L1) plays important roles in neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival in vitro. Reproducible and functionally active CHL1 antibodies are critical for a better understanding of the functional properties of CHL1 in vitro and in vivo. We have isolated human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies against mouse CHL1 from a human synthetic phage display library. To improve the binding activity of such antibodies, a clone (C12) was selected for affinity maturation by combined random mutagenesis of the V(H) gene and site-directed cassette mutagenesis to introduce random mutations in the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of the V(L) gene. From the mutant phage display library, we selected a clone (6C2) that gave the strongest signal as determined by ELISA. The dissociation constant of 6C2 (Kd 2.28 x 10(-8) M) was increased approximately 85-fold compared with the wild-type clone C12 (Kd 1.93 x 10(-6) M). 6C2 detected CHL1 by Western blot analysis in mouse brain homogenates and detected CHL1 in CHL1-transfected cells by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, the wild-type and affinity-matured antibodies promoted neurite outgrowth of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons in vitro. Our results suggest that the affinity-matured CHL1 scFv antibody will serve a range of applications in vitro and in vivo.
