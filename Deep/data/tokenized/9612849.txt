1. Concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-, neurokinin A (NKA)- and neurotensin (NT)-like immunoreactivity (-LI) were measured in brain tissues of Fawn Hooded (FH) (a model of depression), Wistar (W) (control for depression) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (control for strain) with the aim to explore possible associations between neuropeptides and models of depression. 2. In addition, peptides were determined after six electroconvulsive stimuli (ECS) or six sham ECS ("baseline") in order to investigate ECS mechanisms of action. 3. Baseline NPY-LI concentrations were markedly lower in the hippocampus of the "depressed" FH compared to the W and SD animals. 4. Baseline NKA-LI concentrations were higher in the occipital cortex and NT-LI concentrations in the occipital cortex, frontal cortex, and hypothalamus of the FH and W compared to the SD rats. 5. ECS increased NPY-LI in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and occipital cortex of all three strains. In the hippocampus, the increase was significantly larger in the FH compared to the W and SD rats. ECS also increased NKA-LI in the hippocampus. 6. In contrast, ECS decreased NT-LI in the occipital cortex of the FH and W animals. 7. The results indicate that NPY may play a role in depression and that changes in NPY and NKA probably constitute one of the mechanisms of ECT action. More speculatively, NT may also be involved in depression.
