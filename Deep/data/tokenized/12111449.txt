The serotonin transporter (5HTT) is the molecule responsible for the high-affinity reuptake of 5HT from the synaptic cleft. Mice lacking the 5HTT exhibit highly elevated extracellular concentrations of 5HT. We assessed whether the glutathione detoxification system is altered in 5HTT-deficient mice. While levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione were unchanged, glutathione metabolising enzymes showed a differential pattern of modulation. Glutathione peroxidase was reduced in frontal cortex, brainstem, and cerebellum of 5HTT-deficient mice, though not to a statistically significant extent, while a putative isoform of the detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase pi was decreased in a number of brain regions, especially in brainstem. At the level of the DNA, we found an increase of oxidative DNA adducts in the hippocampus of 5HTT-deficient mice. Given the importance of the hippocampus in learning and memory, this may be the most important neurochemical consequence of the absence of the 5HTT.
