In situ hybridization histochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos following the induction of audiogenic seizures in adult rats with transient neonatal hypothyroidism. The rats treated with 0.02% propylthiouracil (PTU) through mother's milk during days 0-19 after delivery showed a high incidence of seizures to auditory stimulation at the age of 4 months. The significant induction of c-fos mRNA by audiogenic seizures is prominent in several brain areas including central gray, peripeduncular nucleus, inferior colliculus, septal nucleus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and dorsomedial hypothalamus. However, the expression of c-fos mRNA was comparable in neocortex, dorsal hippocampus and medial geniculate body between control rats and PTU-treated, seizure-induced rats. These results confirm the previous report on the c-fos expression following audiogenic seizure sensitized during development by a loud noise [20]. The present results indicate that the neonatal PTU treatment may provide a useful tool for studying the mechanism underlying the seizure susceptibility and development after maturation.
