Electrolytic lesions of the septal area in the rat resulted in a major decrease in the activity of choline acetyltransferase in the hippocampus, consistent with the interruption of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway. These lesions also significantly decreased the levels of substance P in the hippocampus. It is suggested that a substance P projection to the hippocampus arises in or passes through the septal area.
