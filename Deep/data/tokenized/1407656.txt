Whereas loss of CA3 neurons in the hippocampus of monkeys which died of stress ulcers suggests that some structural changes may occur, there is no direct evidence that shows stress-induced irreversible changes of neurons. When rats were orchidectomized (castrated) and stressed by restraint and immersion in water for 15 min/day for 30 days, significant loss of hippocampal CA3 and CA4 neurons was observed. Furthermore, primary cultured hippocampal neurons survived shorter when treated with corticosterone. This neuronal loss was prevented by simultaneous administration of testosterone in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicate that stress can contribute to neuronal degeneration associated with hypogonadal conditions such as aging.
