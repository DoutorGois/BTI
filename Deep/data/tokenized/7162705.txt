[14C]2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake in the hippocampal formation was studied in the ground squirrel subjected to induced hypothermia. Whereas the stratum lacunosum-molecular has the highest 2-DG uptake in the dorsal hippocampus during euthermia, 2-DG uptake in the stratum lacunosum-molecular and stratum radiatum are similar during hypothermia. This may indicate activation of a cholinergic input to the hippocampus during hypothermia.
