NDRG2, a member of the N-myc downstream-regulated gene (NDRG) family, is involved in cell differentiation and development. However, the distribution and function of Ndrg2 in the central nervous system remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the expression and distribution of Ndrg2 in the mouse brain and explored the potential physiological functions of Ndrg2. Ndrg2 was expressed in different regions of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, midbrain, hippocampus, and thalamus, with high levels in the midbrain and thalamus. Immunohistochemistry assay revealed that Ndrg2-positive cells distributed widely in the adult mouse brain and some of them showed nuclear staining. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy studies showed that Ndrg2 protein colocalized with glial fibrillary acidic protein, indicating that Ndrg2 is expressed in astrocytes. Furthermore, Ndrg2 expression increased in glioma cells that were differentiating into astrocytes. Taken together, these findings suggest that Ndrg2 is possibly associated with glial cell proliferation and differentiation based on its immunolocalization in this study.
