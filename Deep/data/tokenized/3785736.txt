The effects of a unilateral electrolytic lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis on [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding sites in discrete brain regions of the rat were studied through the use of quantitative autoradiography. When compared to the contralateral side this lesion caused a decrease in the density of [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding sites in the medial prefrontal cortex, frontoparietal cortex and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala but not in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus and auditory cortex. These results add further weight to the view that the cholinergic innervation of the rostral cerebral cortex and amygdala originates from the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and suggest that [3H]hemicholinium-3 autoradiography is a suitable means of visualizing cholinergic nerve terminals.
