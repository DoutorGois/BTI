Examining a potential functional role for growth hormone secretagogue receptors in the hippocampus, Diano and colleagues (Diano et al., 2006), demonstrate novel actions of the orexigenic peptide ghrelin in hippocampal synaptic architecture, LTP, and learning and memory. These data suggest functional links between metabolic signaling and higher neural function.
