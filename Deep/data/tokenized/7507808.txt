As a basic study to investigate the involvement of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of central nervous system diseases, we have established an assay system to measure nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity by a high performance liquid chromatography monitoring conversion of arginine into citrulline. NOS activity in the rat brain was calcium-dependent and inhibited by L-nitro-arginine, a specific NOS inhibitor. The activities in the discrete brain regions were in the order cerebellum > olfactory bulb > striatum > hippocampus > cerebral cortex > midbrain > hypothalamus > pons.
