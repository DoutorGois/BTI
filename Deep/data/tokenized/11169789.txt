Neuronal activity elicits increases in intracellular Ca2+ in astrocytes, which in turn can elevate neuronal Ca2+ and potentiate the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission. Therefore, understanding the modulation of astrocyte Ca2+ elevations by neurotransmitters should aid in understanding astrocyte-neuronal interactions. On cultured hippocampal microislands containing only astrocytes, activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) with the specific agonist 1S,3R-ACPD triggers Ca2+ elevations that are potentiated by adenosine A1 receptor activation. A1 receptor modulation of mGluR-induced Ca2+ elevations is blocked by pertussis toxin and is mimicked by the wasp venom peptide mastoparan, suggesting that potentiation occurs by means of a G(i/o) mechanism. Surprisingly, on microislands containing only astrocytes, A1 receptor antagonism or adenosine degradation suppresses mGluR-triggered Ca2+ elevations, strongly suggesting that astrocytes are a source of physiologically relevant concentrations of adenosine.
