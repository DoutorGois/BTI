The present work explored the anti-neuroinflammation effects of Ginseng Rb1 in a rat model of Alzheimer disease produced by ventricle injection of Abeta1-42. Abeta1-42 injection induces loss of learning and memory behavior of rats in Morris water maze, which could be reversed with Rb1 treatment. Further, Rb1 reversed the changes in several direct or indirect neuroinflammation markers in the hippocampus, suggesting that this could be a potential underlying mechanism and a way to develop anti-aging drugs.
