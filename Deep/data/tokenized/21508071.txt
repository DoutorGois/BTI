Studies on the neurobehavioral toxicity of monocrotophos, an organophosphate, have been carried out on rats following their exposure from postnatal day (PD) 22 to PD 49 to investigate whether neurobehavioral changes are transient or persistent. Exposure of rats to monocrotophos (0.50 or 1.0 mg/kg body weight, p.o.) decreased body weight (10% and 30%) and impaired grip strength (28% and 32%) and learning ability (65% and 68%) at both the doses, respectively in comparison to controls. A trend of recovery was observed in body weight and learning, while decrease in grip strength persisted in rats 15 days after withdrawal. Activity of acetylcholinesterase was decreased in frontal cortex (36% and 67%), hippocampus (21% and 49%) and cerebellum (29% and 51%) in monocrotophos-treated rats at both the doses. The decrease in the activity of acetylcholinesterase persisted in frontal cortex and hippocampus; however, a trend of recovery was observed in cerebellum 15 days after withdrawal. Binding of (3)H-quinuclidinyl benzilate ((3)H-QNB) to frontocortical (19% and 35%), hippocampal (32% and 39%) and cerebellar (19% and 28%) membranes was decreased in monocrotophos-treated rats compared to controls. The decrease in the binding of (3)H-QNB persisted in frontocortical, hippocampal and cerebellar membranes 15 days after withdrawal. The results suggest that repeated exposure to monocrotophos in rats may cause behavioral and neurochemical modifications which may persist even after withdrawal. The findings are of concern in view of the high consumption of monocrotophos in many countries.
