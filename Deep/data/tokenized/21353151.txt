3D imaging at a subcellular resolution is a powerful tool in the life sciences to investigate cells and their interactions with native tissues or artificial objects. While a tomographic experimental setup achieving a sufficient structural resolution can be established with either X-rays or electrons, the use of electrons is usually limited to very thin samples in transmission electron microscopy due to the poor penetration depths of electrons. The combination of a serial sectioning approach and scanning electron microscopy in state of the art dual beam experimental setups therefore offers a means to image highly resolved spatial details using a focused ion beam for slicing and an electron beam for imaging. The advantage of this technique over X-ray muCT or X-ray microscopy attributes to the fact that absorption is not a limiting factor in imaging and therefore even strong absorbing structures can be spatially reconstructed with a much higher possible resolution. This approach was used in this study to elucidate the effect of an electric potential on the morphology of cells from a hippocampal cell line (HT22) deposited on gold microelectrodes. While cells cultivated on two different controls (gold and polymer substrates) did show the expected stretched morphology, cells on both the anode and the cathode differed significantly. Cells deposited on the anode part of the electrode exhibited the most extreme deviation, being almost spherical and showed signs of chromatin condensation possibly indicating cell death. Furthermore, EDX was used as supplemental methodology for combined chemical and structural analyses.
