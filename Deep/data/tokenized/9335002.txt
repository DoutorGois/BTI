To model one aspect of the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer's disease and to investigate the synaptic alteration of the hippocampus associated with entorhinal cortex lesion, ibotenic acid was used to produce selective unilateral neuronal loss in rat entorhinal cortex. Immunohistological and microdensitometrical analyses confirmed ibotenic acid lesion of the entorhinal cortex after 3 months and showed a decrease of synaptophysin-immunoreactive substances in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 field. This study demonstrates that entorhinal cortex lesion can lead to synaptic alterations and cause damage to presynaptic terminals with projecting area in the disruption of the entorhinal cortex hippocampus relay passage.
