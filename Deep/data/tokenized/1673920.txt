A neurotoxin (JSTX) was isolated from the venom of spider (Nephila clavata). JSTX blocked both the excitatory postsynaptic (EPSPs) and glutamate-induced potentials in lobster neuromuscular synapse and squid giant synapse. In mammalian central nervous system, JSTX blocked the EPSPs in CA1 pyramidal neurons resulting from stimulation of Schaffer collateral/commissure input. Pharmacological investigation showed that JSTX preferentially suppressed quisqualate/kainate receptor subtypes but was much less effective on NMDA receptor. Using synthesized spider toxins we studied the structure-activity relationship and found that the 2,4 dihydroxyphenylacetyl asparagine in the toxin structure was responsible for suppressive action, while the remaining part containing a polyamine was related to the agonist binding site with the polycationic part enhancing the toxic activity. Labeling of synthesized JSTX was used for histochemical as well as biochemical studies. Using autoradiography, 125I-JSTX-3 was found to bind at the lobster neuromuscular synapse. Histochemical study utilizing the interaction of biotinylated JSTX-3 with avidin showed specific binding of the toxin in rat cerebellum and hippocampus. JSTX-3-binding protein was purified from rat brain by affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE of the affinity purified protein showed at least 4 bands ranging from 40 to 70 kDa.
