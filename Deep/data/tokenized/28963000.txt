Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with immune dysregulation. We have previously shown that severe stress exposure in a preclinical animal model of the disorder, stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL), is associated with an increase in hippocampal interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and that blocking central IL-1 after the severe stress prevents the development of SEFL. Here, we tested whether blocking hippocampal IL-1 signaling is sufficient to prevent enhanced fear learning and identified the cellular source of stress-induced IL-1beta in this region. Experiment 1 tested whether intra-dorsal hippocampal (DH) infusions of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA, 1.25microg per hemisphere) 24 and 48h after stress exposure prevents the development of enhanced fear learning. Experiment 2 used triple fluorescence immunohistochemistry to examine hippocampal alterations in IL-1beta, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte-specific marker, and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule -1 (Iba-1), a microglial-specific marker, 48h after exposure to the severe stressor of the SEFL paradigm. Intra-DH IL-1RA prevented SEFL and stress-induced IL-1beta was primarily colocalized with astrocytes in the hippocampus. Further, hippocampal GFAP immunoreactivity was not altered, whereas hippocampal Iba-1 immunoreactivity was significantly attenuated following severe stress. These data suggest that hippocampal IL-1 signaling is critical to the development of SEFL and that astrocytes are a predominant source of stress-induced IL-1beta.
