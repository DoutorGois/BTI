Experimental neurosis was achieved in fifteen rabbits (both fixed on a stand and unrestrained) by sudden, drastic enhancement of a pain electrocutaneous stimulation used as reinforcement, at the stage of a stable elaborated avoidance reflex. The experimental neurosis was characterized by a prolonged (one to two months) disturbance of conditioned activity, greater motor restlessness, predominance of the fear type reactions, the animals' reduced weight, higher pulse and respiratory rate. Dynamics of the respiratory rate and brain bioelectrical activity became chaotic. Simultaneously, bioelectrical activity revealed greater similarity of the processes in the cortex and subcortical structures at one and the same moment. Analysis of the electrogram frequency spectra of different brain formations, pointed to an enhancement in all frequency ranges (with the exception of gamma), with a clear predominance of the 6 to 10 c/s band which was most distinctly expressed in the amygdaloid structures.
