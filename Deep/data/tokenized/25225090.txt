Astrocytes dynamic interactions with neurons play an active role in neurotransmission. The gap junction (GJ) subunits connexins 43 and 30 are strongly expressed in astrocytes and have recently been shown to regulate synaptic activity and plasticity. However, the specific role of connexin 43 in the morphological and electrophysiological properties of astrocytes in situ as well as in synaptic transmission remains unknown. Here, we show that connexin 43, a major determinant of astroglial GJ coupling, regulates astrocyte cell volume, but has no impact on astroglial passive membrane properties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that connexin 43 modulates glutamatergic synaptic activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. This regulation involves changes in synaptically released glutamate, with no alteration in neuronal excitability or postsynaptic function. These results reveal connexin 43 as a critical player in neuroglial interactions by supporting synaptic efficacy.
