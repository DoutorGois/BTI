Prior biochemical and electrophysiological studies have shown that low doses of ethanol inhibited calcium influx through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor/ionophore. The present data show that chronic ethanol treatment results in an increase in the number of NMDA receptor/ionophore complexes in the hippocampus, a brain area known to be associated with ethanol withdrawal seizure activity. Treatment during withdrawal with NMDA-exacerbated handling induced withdrawal seizures in the ethanol-dependent mice, while administration of the NMDA receptor-associated calcium channel antagonist MK-801 decreased the occurrence and severity of the withdrawal seizures in a dose-dependent manner. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the up-regulation of the NMDA receptor systems following chronic ethanol treatment may mediate the seizures associated with ethanol withdrawal in dependent animals.
