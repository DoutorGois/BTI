5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) 5-HT(6) receptors (5-HT(6)R) and 5-HT(7) receptors (5-HT(7)R) have been implicated in schizophrenia and as targets of atypical antipsychotic drugs. We have studied the expression of these receptors in the hippocampal formation and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 17 subjects with schizophrenia and 17 controls using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with cyclophilin co-amplification. In schizophrenia, 5-HT(6)R mRNA was decreased in the hippocampal formation, and 5-HT(7)R mRNA was decreased in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The mRNAs were unchanged in rats treated for 2 weeks with haloperidol, chlorpromazine, risperidone, olanzapine or clozapine. Regional decreases in 5-HT(6)R and 5-HT(7)R expression in schizophrenia may contribute to the overall serotonergic alterations which occur in the disorder, in part through their interactions with other neurotransmitter systems including glutamate and acetylcholine.
