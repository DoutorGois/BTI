Chronic early life stress increases adult risk for depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, illnesses characterized by aberrant functions of cognition and memory. We asked whether chronic early life stress disrupts maturation of gamma oscillations, on which these functions depend. Lifelong impairment of the stress response results from separation of rat pups from the dam for three hours per day during a critical period of hippocampal development (PNDs 2-14). Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, including the basket cell network which is fundamental to gamma oscillations, are reduced in number in post mortem studies of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and in chronically-stressed adult rats. To determine effects of chronic early life stress on gamma oscillations, we separated pups from dams once each day on PNDs 2-14 and recorded in vitro at PNDs 15-21. In control pups, separated for 15 minutes per day, gamma power had highly significant correlations with both age (p = 0.0022) and weight (p = 0.0024); gamma in pups separated for 180 minutes per day was not correlated with either factor. ANCOVA indicated significant differences between the groups in both measures. These findings indicate that chronic early life stress can disrupt maturation of the gamma oscillation network.
