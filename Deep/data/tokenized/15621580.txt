Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system. However, GBS patients frequently display a psychosyndrome, indicating an accompanying involvement of the central nervous system (CNS), although the cause is not understood. Hepatic encephalopathy is possibly the best characterized example of a psychosyndrome, and astrocyte dysfunction appears to play a major role. We hypothesized that if compromised astrocyte function is of general importance in the pathomechanism of a psychosyndrome, then astrocytes should be involved in the CNS dysfunctions of GBS patients as well. Using immunocytochemistry, we found anti-astrocyte autoantibodies in about 60% of GBS patients and few or none in control groups. This finding was confirmed by Western blots. Our data are consistent with the suspected importance of an impaired astrocyte function in the pathomechanism of a psychosyndrome.
