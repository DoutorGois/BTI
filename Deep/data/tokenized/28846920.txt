The present study investigated the effects of Naringin on seizure severity, progress of kindling, memory impairment, oxidative stress, neurochemicals, and neural damage in Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling. Alternate intra-peritoneal injections of PTZ induced kindling at 22 injections of PTZ. In comparison with the PTZ group, pretreatment with Naringin 30 min prior to PTZ administration and on a PTZ-free day was found to lead to a decreased seizure score, a mitigated progress of kindling, decreased transfer latency, and increased total number of arm entries, % alternation behavior in Y maze, and % conditioned avoidance response in a pole climbing apparatus. Biochemical analysis of the frontal and temporal cortexes and the hippocampus of the brain showed that Naringin attenuated the level of lipid peroxidation (MDA) and augmented the reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and total thiol results in decreased oxidative stress compared with the PTZ group and control group. Investigation of neurochemicals revealed a minute change in gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate and dopamine, and decreased AChE in the three regions. Increased CA1 neuronal density in the hippocampus and increased cell density in the frontal and temporal regions indicate the potential of naringin to act against PTZ-induced kindling, memory impairment, oxidative stress, neurochemical changes, and histological aberrations.
