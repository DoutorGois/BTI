Although much is known about the protective effect of acute estrogen therapy in cerebral ischemia, relatively little is known about the importance of apoptosis and cerebral plasticity in this mechanism. In this work 10 min global cerebral ischemia was produced by transient bilateral carotid occlusion in 4-month-old ovariectomized female gerbils. In every of our experimental group (sham for ischemia group, ischemia group and ischemia + a high, single dose 17beta-estradiol pre-treatment group) apoptotic (bcl-Xl, bax) and cerebral plasticity (GAP-43, synapsin-I, nestin) hippocampal genes' expression was measured four days after surgery. Expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-Xl (p<0.01) and the cerebral plasticity marker synapsin-I and nestin (p<0.01) increased with acute estrogen pretreatment in ischemic animals. No change, however, in bax or GAP-43 expression was detected in estrogen treated animals compared to ischemic gerbils. These results suggest that acute estrogen therapy has anti-apoptotic effect and increases cerebral plasticity, which play an important role in cytoprotection or cerebroprotection.
