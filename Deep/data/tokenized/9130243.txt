Using in situ hybridization techniques with an RNA probe coding for approximately 3.5 repeats of ubiquitin, corresponding to the polyubiquitin genes, we were able to demonstrate that under normal conditions the expression of the ubiquitin genes predominates specially in regions CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus, in the dentate gyrus and in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, being less prominent in neuronal cell bodies of the cerebral cortex. When the animals were submitted to an acute oxidative stress by injection of Fe/Dextran, the hybridization signal was apparently increased in the above mentioned regions of the hippocampus and in the cerebral cortex. On the other hand, the animals chronically injected with Fe/Dextran showed a highly intense gene expression in the cerebral cortex and in the cerebellum, particularly in the granular cell layer of this structure. The hybridization signal of the transcripts was absent in the Purkinje cells. The results suggest that the expression of the ubiquitin genes by CNS neurons depends on the anatomical location of the cells and that it increases as a consequence of the oxidative stress conditions to which they are submitted.
