The article treats problems related to the application of coherent analysis in studying the spatial synchronization of rhythms in the EEG. The significance of comparing the changes in the coherent functions (CF) of more combinations of cerebral structures, i.e. of intercoherent relations, is pointed out. Evidence is given that the observed equalization of the coherence according to different frequency ranges has a definite physiological significance, connected with the readjustment of the functional state of the nervous system on the basis of changes in the organization of the spatial rhythmic interrelations in it. Tests are made of several parameters for quantitative estimation of the changes in the intercoherent relations, which may be applicable to studying the organization of rhythms in the bioelectrical activity of the nervous system in different functional states in norm and pathology.
