In the present study we trained tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA)-knockout (tPA -/-) and wild-type (tPA +/+) male mice in step-down inhibitory avoidance learning, a hippocampus-dependent task. tPA -/- displayed significantly shorter latencies to step down at 90 min, one, two and seven days after training indicating the learning deficit in these animals (P < 0.05 vs tPA +/+). The locomotor activity, the level of anxiety in an elevated-plus maze, as well as the pain threshold did not differ between the two strains of mice. The learning disability of tPA -/- was overcome by more intense training. The learning deficit was also partially restored by limited intrahippocampal delivery of tPA (infused for 2 h before training; P < 0.05 vs control), but not by the delivery of urokinase plasminogen activator, indicating the acute need for tPA in learning. The beneficial effect of tPA was abolished by co-infusion of its inhibitor tPA-STOP, indicating that the facilitatory effect of tPA on learning requires a proteolytic step. However, tPA activity in the hippocampus was not indispensable for effective memory retrieval in tPA-infused tPA -/- mice. Thus, rapid, specific and proteolytic action of tPA facilitates hippocampus-dependent learning, but not retrieval of previously acquired information.
