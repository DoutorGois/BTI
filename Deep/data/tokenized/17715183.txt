NaHCO(3) transporters are involved in maintenance of intracellular pH and transepithelial HCO(3)(-) movement in many rodent tissues. To establish the human relevance of the many investigations on rodents, this study aimed to map these transporters and a related polypeptide, NaBC1 [solute carrier 4 (SLC4)A11], to several human tissues by using PCR on reverse transcribed human mRNA and immunoperoxidase histochemistry. The mRNA encoding the electroneutral Na(+):HCO(3)(-) cotransporter (NBCe1; SLC4A4), was expressed in renal cortex, renal medulla, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, pancreas, choroid plexus, cerebellum, cerebrum, and hippocampus. NBCe2 (SLC4A5) and NBCn1 (SLC4A7) mRNAs were mainly found in kidney and brain tissues, as was mRNA encoding the Na(+)-dependent anion exchangers NCBE (SLC4A10) and NDCBE1 (SLC4A8). In addition to previous findings, NBCn1 protein was localized to human renal medullary thick ascending limbs and duodenal epithelial villus cells and NBCe2 protein to renal collecting ducts. Finally, the message encoding NaBC1 was found in kidney, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, and brain, and the corresponding protein in the anterior and posterior corneal epithelia, renal corpuscules, proximal tubules, collecting ducts, pancreatic ducts, and the choroid plexus epithelium. In conclusion, the selected human tissues display distinct expression patterns of HCO(3)(-) transporters, which closely resemble that of rodent tissues.
