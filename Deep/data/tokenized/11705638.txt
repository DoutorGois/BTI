The use of virtual environment (VE) technology to assess spatial navigation in humans has become increasingly common and provides an opportunity to quantify age-related deficits in human spatial navigation and promote a comparative approach to the neuroscience of cognitive aging. The purpose of the present study was to assess age differences in navigational behavior in a VE and to examine the relationship between this navigational measure and other more traditional measures of cognitive aging. Following pre-training, participants were confronted with a VE spatial learning task and completed a battery of cognitive tests. The VE consisted of a richly textured series of interconnected hallways, some leading to dead ends and others leading to a designated goal location in the environment. Compared to younger participants, older volunteers took longer to solve each trial, traversed a longer distance, and made significantly more spatial memory errors. After 5 learning trials, 86% of young and 24% of elderly volunteers were able to locate the goal without error. Performance on the VE navigation task was positively correlated with measures of mental rotation and verbal and visual memory.
