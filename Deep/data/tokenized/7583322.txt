The effect of spermine on neurotransmission was studied in area CA1 of the hippocampal slice preparation. Paired-pulse stimulation (20 ms interpulse interval) was delivered to stratum radiatum; the evoked field potential responses were recorded simultaneously from stratum radiatum and from stratum pyramidale. At mM and sub-mM concentrations, spermine decreased the slope of pEPSP in stratum radiatum and the area of the conditioning population spike in stratum pyramidale. Short-latency paired-pulse inhibition of the population spike was converted to facilitation by spermine. These effects of spermine resembled those observed at low calcium concentration. In addition, dose-response and input-output curves determined at various Ca2+ concentrations demonstrated that the depressant effects of spermine were larger at low Ca2+ levels. The results support the notion that spermine competitively blocks presynaptic voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, thus causing a decreased release of neurotransmitter. Since spermine is present in brain, it is likely that it is a natural modulator of Ca2+ channels.
