The Madagascan lesser hedgehog tenrec was investigated to get insight into the areal evolution of the hippocampal formation in mammals with poorly differentiated brains. The hippocampal subdivisions were analyzed using cyto- and chemoarchitectural criteria; long associational and commissural connections were demonstrated with tracer techniques. The hedgehog tenrec shows a well differentiated dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1. Their major intrinsic connections lie within the band of variations known from other species. The dentate hilar region shows calretinin-positive mossy cells with extensive projections to the molecular layer. The calbindin- and enkephalin-positive granule mossy fibers form a distinct endbulb and do not invade the CA1 as reported in the erinaceous hedgehog. Isolated granule cells with basal dendrites were also noted. A CA2 region is hard to identify architecturally; its presence is suggested due to its contralateral connections. Subicular and perisubicular regions are clearly present along the dorsal aspects of the hemisphere, but we failed to identify them unequivocally along the caudal and ventral tip of the hippocampus. A temporal portion of the subiculum, if present, differs in its chemoarchitecture from its dorsal counterpart. The perisubicular region, located medially adjacent to the dorsal subiculum may be equivalent to the rat's presubiculum; evidence for the presence of a parasubiculum was rather weak.
