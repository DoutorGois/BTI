Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in a cascade of events that includes the production of reactive oxygen species. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is induced in glial cells following head trauma, suggestive of oxidative stress. We have studied the temporal and spatial effects of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on HO-1 levels following lateral fluid-percussion injury by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In the injured cerebral cortex, maximal HO-1 induction was seen 6 h post-TBI and was maintained for up to 24 h following the insult, while the ipsilateral hippocampus and thalamus showed marked induction at 24 h postinjury. In all three brain regions, little or no HO-1 immunoreactivity was observed on the contralateral side. Astrocytes exhibited positive immunoreactivity for HO-1 in the injured cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, while some neurons and microglia were also immunoreactive in the injured cortex. The administration of NAC 5 min following TBI resulted in a marked reduction in this widespread induction of HO-1, concomitant with a decrease in the volume of injury in all three brain regions. Together, these findings indicate that HO-1 induction is related to both oxidative and injury characteristics of the affected tissue, suggesting that protein expression of this gene is a credible marker of oxidative damage in this model of TBI.
