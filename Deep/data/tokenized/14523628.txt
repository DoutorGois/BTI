An anxiogenic or a pharmacological stressor, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142), (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally injected) induced a dense nuclear c-Fos-like immunoreactivity in the pyriform cortex, cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, layers II-VI of the neocortex, lateral habenula, lateral septum, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, striatum, central and medial nucleus of the amygdala, but a sparse c-Fos immunostaining in the hippocampus and layer I of the neocortex in the forebrain of 56-day-old rats. Among these regions, the 8-day-old rats expressed much fewer c-Fos-positive cells in the neocortex, lateral habenula, lateral septum and medial nucleus of the amygdala than the young adult rats following the FG-7142 injection. These differences in the regional distribution of a neuronal activity marker, c-Fos, could reflect the postnatal development of neuronal populations or neuron circuits involved in stress and/or emotional response in the forebrain.
