Argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) is a sporadic, very late-onset tauopathy, accounting for approximately 4-13% of neurodegenerative dementias. AGD may manifest with a range of symptoms such as cognitive decline and behavioral abnormalities. To date, no study has been able to demonstrate a distinct clinical syndrome associated with AGD. The diagnosis is exclusively based on postmortem findings, the significance of which remains controversial because up to 30% of AGD cases are diagnosed in subjects without any cognitive impairment, while AGD findings often overlap with those of other neurodegenerative processes. Nevertheless, the presence of AGD is likely to have a significant effect on cognitive decline. The neuropathological hallmarks of AGD are argyrophilic grains, pre-neurofibrillary tangles in neurons and coiled bodies in oligodendrocytes found mainly in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. This review aims to provide an up-to-date overview of AGD, emphasizing pathological aspects. Additionally, the findings of a Brazilian case series are described.
