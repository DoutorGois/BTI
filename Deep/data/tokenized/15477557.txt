The authors demonstrated that temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis preceded by febrile seizures can be divided into different groups according to age at epilepsy onset (AEO). AEO was found to be trimodal with a peak at ages 5.5, 15.3, and 26.7. In the adolescent AEO group, a family history of epilepsy occurred more frequently and the age at febrile convulsions was earlier than in the childhood group.
