Desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma is a paediatric brain tumor that is commonly seen in the infantile age group. Literature on the non-infantile variant of this low-grade supratentorial neoplasm is very scarce, except for a few case reports. Herein, we report a case of desmoplastic non-infantile ganglioglioma occurring at the age of 6 years and describe its conventional and advanced magnetic resonance imaging characteristics.
