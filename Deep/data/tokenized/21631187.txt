PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: The present work investigated the behavioural and biochemistry effects of moderate exposure to a static magnetic field (SMF) in rats. SMF effects were evaluated in sham- and SMF-exposed rats. METHODS: Adult Wistar rats were exposed for 1 hour per day for 5 consecutive days to 128 millitesla (mT) SMF. Then, their motor skills were tested using a Stationary beam and Suspended string test. Iron level in plasma and brain (i.e. frontal cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus and cerebellum) was measured. RESULTS: No significant change was observed between sham and SMF-exposed rats in the Stationary beam and Suspended string test. However, the same treatment induced an increase in plasma transferrin content (+25.4%) and decreased the iron level in plasma (-16.2%). The SMF treatment failed to alter the iron concentration in the brain. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that SMF exposure induced iron deficiency in plasma but did not induce motor-skills deficit.
