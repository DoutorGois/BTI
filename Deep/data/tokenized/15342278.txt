The present study evaluated the potential effect of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), which is known as an antiulcer agent, against kainic acid (KA)-induced neurotoxicity. Pretreatment with a single oral GGA dose (800 mg/kg, 2 days before KA) significantly attenuated KA-induced seizures and cell death in rat hippocampus. These effects of GGA were prevented by the coinjection of MK801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, which indicates that the protection was indeed mediated by glutamate receptor activation.
