Seven beagle dogs were administered sucrose (control animals) or different doses of (-)deprenyl orally by means of capsules for 3 weeks. Activities of Cu Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD were determined in striatum and hippocampus in these animals. There was a significant dose-dependent increase in activities of total as well as in both types of SOD enzymes in striatum but not in hippocampus. The results suggest that this monoamine oxidase B inhibitor can increase antioxidant enzyme activities in striatum but not in hippocampus in the dog, thus showing brain region selectivity. These results are in accordance with previously published observations in rats.
