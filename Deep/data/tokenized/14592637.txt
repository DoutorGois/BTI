The epilepsies are a complex group of disorders commonly associated with brain dysfunction, social isolation, and vocational difficulty. Each of these factors may contribute to increased prevalence of depressive disorders in epilepsy, but the specific mechanisms are not completely understood. The brain regions commonly involved in various types of epilepsies, such as the hippocampus and amygdala in temporal lobe epilepsy and subcortical nuclei in idiopathic generalized epilepsies, are important components of current models of depression. Increased understanding of mechanisms of depression in epilepsy is not only crucial for improving care of many persons with seizures, but may also yield useful information about principal mechanisms underlying both depression and epileptogenesis.
