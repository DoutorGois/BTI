Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNT) are rare, cortically located neoplasma associated with intractable partial complex seizures. This entity was first described by Daumas-Duport et al. [1988], who also coined the term DNT. In that report, at the time of operation, the patients' ages ranged from 3 to 30 years and the duration of symptoms ranged from 2 to 18 years. In contrast, we observed a histologically comparable tumor in a 75-year-old female with a 60 year epilepsy history. Autopsy revealed an 8 mm large tumor in the right hippocampus. In view of the extremely prolonged course of the patient's symptoms and the complete lack of excessive cell proliferation, the differentiation of a genuine tumor versus a hamartoma remains equivocal.
