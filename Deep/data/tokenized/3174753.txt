The purpose of these experiments was to define the temporal parameters involved in the phencyclidine (PCP) enhancement of 3H quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) accumulation in mouse brain. PCP enhanced QNB accumulation in brain if given intraperitoneally (IP) 1 and 4, but not 16 hours before intravenous (IV) administration of QNB. This effect was found in hypothalamus, striatum, cortex and hippocampus, but not cerebellum. PCP given after QNB did not alter QNB accumulation. The PCP enhancement persisted for at least 72 hours after QNB administration. These results confirm previous studies demonstrating that PCP must be present prior to QNB administration to enhance the accumulation and show that the effect persists for an extended period of time.
