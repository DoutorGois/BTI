We studied the effects of intranasal administration of antiglutamate antibodies on the development of stress response and level of neurotransmitter amino acids and monoamines in brain structures of rats with different initial behavioral activity. The stress exposure was followed by significant changes in behavioral activity and concentration of neurotransmitters in rat hippocampus and hypothalamus. The changes in the level of neurotransmitter amino acids and monoamines were more pronounced in the hippocampus. Antiglutamate antibodies administered intranasally in a single dose of 250 mug/kg immediately after stress exposure prevented the development of the stress response and normalized the level of neurotransmitters in the brain structures of rats. The effect of antibodies was the most pronounced in behaviorally active rats.
