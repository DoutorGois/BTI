Kruppel-like transcription factor 8 (KLF8) is a transcription factor suggested to be involved in various cellular events, including malignant cell transformation, still its expression in the adult rodent brain remained unknown. To analyze Klf8 in the mouse brain and to identify cell types expressing it, a specific transgenic Klf8(Gt1Gaj) mouse was used. The resulting Klf8 gene-driven beta-galactosidase activity was visualized by X-gal histochemical staining of the brain sections. The obtained results were complemented by in situ RNA hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Klf8 was highly expressed throughout the adult mouse brain gray matter including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, pallidum, and striatum, but not in the cerebellum. Immunofluorescent double-labeling revealed that KLF8-immunoreactive cells were neurons, and the staining was located in their nucleus. This was the first study showing that Klf8 was highly expressed in various regions of the mouse brain and in particular in the neurons, where it was localized in the cell nuclei.
