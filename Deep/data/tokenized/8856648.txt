Glutamate antagonists have been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia. Global cerebral ischemia in rats leads to selective neuronal damage in the hippocampus and striatum. Following ischemia a deficit in spatial learning and memory occurs. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of GYKI 52466, an antagonist at the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, with behavioural and histological measures of global ischemia in rats. Global ischemia was induced by four-vessel-occlusion (4VO) for 20 min in rats. GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg i.p.) was administered either 20 min before induction of ischemia or immediately after onset of reperfusion. One week after surgery spatial learning was tested in the Morris water maze. After behavioural testing the animals were sacrificed and the neuronal damaged was assessed. GYKI 52466 reduced the increase in escape latency and in swim distance induced by 4VO when given before ischemia but not when applied after ischemia. Neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus produced by 4VO was significantly attenuated by pretreatment but not by posttreatment with GYKI 52466. Striatal neuronal damage was not affected by either treatment with GYKI 52466. GYKI 52466 had neuroprotective effects in a rat model of global cerebral ischemia. Pretreatment with GYKI 52466 protected rats against behavioural deficits and hippocampal neuronal damage induced by 4VO.
