The authors removed a simple plug from the dorsal hippocampus, or from the dorsal hippocampus and part of the medial hippocampus in a telencephalic hemisphere in specimens of Lacerta viridis. The specimens were sacrificed some time after the operation after administration of 6-3 H thymidina. The examination of the emulsified slides showed that in these experimental condition no reparative process is observed, except for an impressive proliferation of cells and fibres which, from the meninx, bridges the cortical gap and, penetrating the telencephalic ventricle, attaches itself to the surrounding nerve tissue. The authors also described a limited cellular proliferation in the ependima of the telencephalic ventricles as a result of resection of the medial hippocampus; this observation is interpreted as a phenomenum connected to compensatory hypertrophy.
