In this study we examined changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) pattern in the brain of adult Reelin Orleans (RelnOrl) homozygous mutant mice. The AChE histochemistry firstly revealed an abnormal distribution of AChE-positive cells in several areas of the reeler brain, including cortices; the strongest labelling was observed in cerebellum and hippocampus when compared with controls. Biochemical determinations demonstrated an increase of 80-90% in AChE specific activity from cerebellar and hippocampal extracts. We also report that the AChE tetrameric form (G4) was selectively increased in the RelnOrl brain. The relationship between AChE and Reelin and suggested morphogenetic functions are also discussed.
