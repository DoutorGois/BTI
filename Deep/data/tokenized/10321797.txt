Within the past century it has been well established that most mature neurons lose their ability to divide. Since then, it has been assumed that behavioral performance leads to synaptic changes in the brain. The existence of these potential changes has been demonstrated in numerous experiments, and different mechanisms contributing to synaptic plasticity have been discovered. Many structures involved in different types of learning have now been identified. This article reviews the different methods used with mammals to detect electrophysiological modifications in synaptic plasticity following behavior. Evidence of long-term potentiation and long-term depression has been found in the hippocampus and cerebellum, respectively, and empirical data has been used to correlate these mechanisms with specific learning performance. Similar observations were made recently in the septum and amygdala. These phenomena seem to be involved in maintaining the performance in the cortical areas of the brain. Ongoing attempts to find the relationship between behavioral performance and modifications in synaptic efficacy allow to speculate upon the dynamics of cellular mechanisms that contribute to the ability of mammals to modify wide neuronal networks in the brain during their life.
