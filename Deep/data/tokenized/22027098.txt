Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus in adult mammals. The ubiquitin ligase HRD1 is associated with degradation of amyloid precursor protein and believed to be specifically expressed in neurons and not in astrocytes. We investigated expression of HRD1 using immunohistochemistry and found colocalization of HRD1 with the NSC marker protein nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the NSCs of the SVZ (the SVZ astrocytes) but not in the hippocampus. In the hippocampal dentate gyrus, HRD1 is localized in the nucleus of nestin-positive cells.
