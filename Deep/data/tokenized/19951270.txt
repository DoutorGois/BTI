OBJECTIVES: To investigate acute effects of intra-amygdalar excitatory amino acid administration on blood flow, relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient in rat brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Several days after MR-compatible cannula placement in right basolateral amygdala, anesthetized rats were imaged at 7 T. Relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured before and 60 min after infusion of 10 nmol KA, cAMPA, ATPA, or normal saline using arterial spin labeling. Quantitative T(2) and diffusion-weighted images were acquired. rCBF, T(2) and ADC values were evaluated in bilateral basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, frontal and parietal regions. RESULTS: KA led to the highest, and ATPA lowest bilateral rCBF increases. Time courses varied among drugs. T(2) for KA and AMPA was higher while ADC was lower for KA. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-amygdalar injection of GluR agonists evoked bilateral seizure activity and increased rCBF, greater for KA and AMPA than selective ATPA GluR5 activation.
