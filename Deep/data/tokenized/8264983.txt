Activity in the monkey hippocampal formation (HF) was analyzed during movement guided by auditory and visual cues. The monkey could control a motorized cab by pressing the proper 1 of 4 available levers within a 2.5 x 2.5 m field. Of 238 HF neurons analyzed, responses of 79 were place related and responses of 110 were task related. Of the task-related neurons, 33 were also place related, and responded to task cues only where place-related responses occurred. The results suggest HF gating of incoming non-spatial information, depending on information about location.
