Microfluorometry was used to investigate temperature dependence of hypoxia-induced intracellular calcium accumulation in gerbil hippocampal slice. When slices were superfused with hypoxic medium at 37 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 33 degrees C or 31 degrees C, latencies of acute increase of calcium accumulation, which was accompanied by a large negative shift of extracellular DC potentials, were delayed in a dose-dependent manner: mean latencies in field CA1 were 130 s, 182 s, 232 s and 277 s after hypoxia, respectively. This retardation in calcium accumulation may be involved in the mechanisms by which hypothermia diminishes ischemic injury.
