Data accumulated over the last years demonstrate that the hippocampal formation of rodents is sexually dimorphic with respect to its functional attributes. Neuroanatomical substrates that might contribute to explain these gender-related differences have been described in the dentate gyrus, and in the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal fields. However, the subiculum, the source of the major efferent projection of the hippocampal formation, has not been searched for the presence of sex-related differences. To address this issue, we have used stereological methods applied to adult rats of both sexes to estimate the volume of the subiculum, the total number of subicular neurons, and the total number and size of the synapses established by subicular neurons. The apical dendritic trees of Golgi-impregnated subicular neurons were also quantitatively analyzed. We have found that the volume of the subiculum and of its neuronal layer, and the total number of subicular neurons were greater in males than in females. Conversely, the total dendritic length of the apical arborization of the subicular neurons, and the number of dendritic spines and axospinous synapses were higher in females than in males. However, the size of the postsynaptic densities of the individual synapses was smaller in female than in male rats and, as a result, the surface area of the total active synaptic zones did not differ between the sexes. These findings provide an additional morphological clue for the comprehension of the sex dimorphisms within the hippocampal circuitries and, consequently, for a better understanding of the functional sex differences ascribed to the hippocampal formation.
