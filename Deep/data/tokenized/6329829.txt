Efferent sympathetic activity (ESA) recorded from cervical sympathetic trunk, was augmented after stimulation of medial, cortical and basal amygdaloid nuclei, whereas stimulation of the lateral amygdaloid nuclei decreased the ESA. Stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus also decreased the ESA. Electrolytic lesion of the septum led to an increase of the ESA during simultaneous stimulation of the lateral amygdaloid nucleus and the dorsal hippocampus. The data suggest that functional interaction between amygdaloid nuclei and septal relays participate in the amygdaloid influence on the activity of preganglionic sympathetic neurons.
