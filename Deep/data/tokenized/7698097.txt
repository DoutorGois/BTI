Previous experimental investigations have shown that several neuronal systems modulate the spontaneous and paroxysmal electric activity of the hippocampus. The locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system exerts an inhibitory influence on several brain areas including the ipsilateral hippocampus. Selective destruction of the LC increases the susceptibility to epileptiform phenomena in different models of experimental epilepsy. Our experiments were conducted on 34 rats in which a steady epileptiform interictal activity of the hippocampus was obtained by means of intrahippocampal administration of penicillin. Electrical stimulation of LC caused a significant decrease of penicillin spiking of hippocampus. Stimulation sessions given 10-15 min after i.p. propranolol administration (2 mg/kg) failed to induce any significant modification in the hippocampal spiking frequency. Intrahippocampal injection of L-noradrenaline mimicked the inhibitory effect of LC electrical stimulation on hippocampus. Finally, intrahippocampal administration of isoproterenol HCl, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, caused a significant decrease of hippocampal penicillin spiking; this effect was antagonised by i.p. propranolol administration. The experimental data show a modulating influence of the LC-NA system on penicillin focal hippocampal epilepsy that probably involves beta-adrenoceptors.
