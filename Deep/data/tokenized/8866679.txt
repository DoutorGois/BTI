Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuritic plaques and amyloid load were quantified in sections of the hippocampus at the level of the lateral geniculate body in 41 consecutive cases fulfilling pathological criteria for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and coming to autopsy after longitudinal study during life. A strong correlation was found between NFT density in the hippocampus and cognitive impairment scores obtained shortly before death, particularly with scores of memory impairment. Weaker and less consistent correlations were found for hippocampal neuritic plaques and amyloid load with cognitive/memory deficits. No significant correlations were found between hippocampal pathology and either age of onset or disease duration. All three measures of hippocampal pathology were inversely correlated with the minimum medial temporal lobe (MTL) width, a measure of the MTL atrophy made from temporal-lobe-oriented X-ray computed tomography scans performed during life; the strongest correlation being between atrophy of the MTL and NFT density in the hippocampus.
