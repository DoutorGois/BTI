Event-related potentials (ERPs) of the cat hippocampus were investigated by means of multielectrodes in various layers of the hippocampus. The experimental and mathematical procedures were the same as those in the companion report (Basar-Eroglu et al., in press a). It is shown that the most ample N200-P300 complex was recorded close to the CA3 region of the hippocampus.
