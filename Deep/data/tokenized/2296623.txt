1-(3-Chlorophenyl) piperazine (mCPP) was previously shown to have an anxiogenic-like effect, i.e., it decreased total interaction in a rat social interaction test. Evidence indicated mediation by activation of 5-HT1C receptors with an ED50 of approximately 500 micrograms/kg IP (Kennett et al. 1989). A comparable effect is now shown on infusing 4 micrograms of the drug ICV or infusing 0.5 microgram into the hippocampus. Both responses were dose dependent. Infusion of 1 microgram mCPP into the amygdala had no effect. None of the above treatments significantly reduced locomotion. Results are consistent with the postulated role of the hippocampus in anxiety.
