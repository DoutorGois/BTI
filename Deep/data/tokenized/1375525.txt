c-fos and zif/268 are regulatory genes encoding transcription factors able to influence gene expression directly. It has been shown repeatedly that expression of transcription factors correlates with different forms of cell activation, probably being functionally involved in the coupling of extracellular signals with long-term cellular responses. This study describes that c-fos and zif/268 mRNA accumulation, as measured by northern blot analysis, occurs in the rat hippocampus as well as the visual cortex following behavioral training of two-way active avoidance response.
