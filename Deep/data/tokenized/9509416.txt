Quantitative immunoblot analyses were carried out to study the distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2A and 2B (NR2A and NR2B, respectively) at the protein level in the adult rat brain. Highest levels of NR2A were detected in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, followed at more or less similar levels (about 36-72% of cerebral cortex) by striatum, thalamus, olfactory bulb, superior and inferior colliculi, and cerebellum. The lowest levels were detected in midbrain and lower brain stem (30-31% of cerebral cortex). The NR2B was more dramatic in differential distribution than the NR2A. Highest levels of NR2B were found in telencephalic (olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum) and thalamic regions, and expression in superior and inferior colliculi, midbrain, lower brain stem, and cerebellum were significantly lower (4-25% of cerebral cortex). Interestingly, NR2B proteins were barely detectable in the cerebellum. When the postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions were compared, the amount of NR2B in the cerebellar PSD fraction was only 1.8% of that present in the cerebral PSD fraction where the subunit is highly enriched. Immunoblot analyses with a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody showed that the molecular sizes of major phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in forebrain and hindbrain are 180 and 45 kDa, respectively. The regional distribution of the 180 kDa major phosphotyrosine protein was very similar to that of NR2B, and the protein could be immunoprecipitated by NR2B antibody. Our data shows that NR2A and NR2B subunits are differentially distributed in the brain in an overlapping manner, and that the major phosphotyrosine-containing protein of 180 kDa in forebrain is the NR2B.
