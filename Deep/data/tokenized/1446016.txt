In the present investigation the interaction of a novel selective NMDA receptors agonist, N-phthalamoyl-L-glutamic acid (PhGA), with the synaptic membranes preparation of human hippocampus was examined against NMDA. It was established that there are two binding sites of 3H-L-Glu, Kd1 = 0.35 +/- 0.11 nM, Bmax1 = 6.5 +/- 2.3 pmol/mg and Kd2 = 51 +/- 12 nM, Bmax2 = 98 +/- 17 pmol/mg. The inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated for NMDA and PhGA and were equal: Ki(NMDA) = 19 microM, Ki (PhGA) = 13 microM, respectively. It was concluded that PhGA is the partial agonist of the NMDA receptors.
