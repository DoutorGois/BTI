Previous studies have suggested that intracerebroventricular kainic acid injections alter brain anatomy and neurochemistry in a manner similar to what is observed in schizophrenic patients. Disturbances in sensory information processing are one of the major symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus, the present experiments were designed to evaluate the hypothesis that hippocampal damage, induced by administration of kainic acid, would alter the processing of auditory stimuli in a paired-click paradigm. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted for surface recording of auditory evoked potentials. At the time of electrode implantation, the rats also received bilateral injections of either kainic acid or the vehicle solution. In vehicle-treated rats, the midlatency N40 component of the auditory evoked potential was diminished in amplitude by approximately 60% in response to the second of a pair of clicks delivered 0.5 s apart. By contrast, no reduction of the N40 wave evoked by the second click was observed in kainate-treated rats. Further, administration of haloperidol, a prototypical neuroleptic agent, did not improve this auditory processing dysfunction in kainate-treated animals. Loss of auditory filtering in the paired-click paradigm and a lack of response to haloperidol in this test are typically observed in schizophrenic humans. Thus, the present results demonstrate that kainate-lesioned rats possess a functional schizophrenia-like abnormality, further reinforcing the utility of this model system for studying the basic neurobiology of schizophrenia-induced sensory processing deficits.
