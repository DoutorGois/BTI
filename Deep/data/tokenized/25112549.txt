Studies have been suggested that minocycline can be a potential new agent for the treatment of depression. In addition, both oxidative stress and energy metabolism present an important role in pathophysiology of depression. So, the present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of minocycline on stress oxidative parameters and energy metabolism in the brain of adult rats submitted to the chronic mild stress protocol (CMS). After CMS Wistar, both stressed animals as controls received twice ICV injection of minocycline (160 mug) or vehicle. The oxidative stress and energy metabolism parameters were assessed in the prefrontal cortex (PF), hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY) and nucleus accumbens (Nac). Our findings showed that stress induced an increase on protein carbonyl in the PF, AMY and NAc, and mynocicline injection reversed this alteration. The TBARS was increased by stress in the PF, HIP and NAc, however, minocycline reversed the alteration in the PF and HIP. The Complex I was incrased in AMY by stress, and minocycline reversed this effect, however reduced Complex I activity in the NAc; Complex II reduced in PF and AMY by stress or minocycline; the Complex II-III increased in the HIP in stress plus minocycline treatment and in the NAc with minocycline; in the PF and HIP there were a reduced in Complex IV with stress and minocycline. The creatine kinase was reduced in AMY and NAc with stress and minocycline. In conclusion, minocycline presented neuroprotector effects by reducing oxidative damage and regulating energy metabolism in specific brain areas.
