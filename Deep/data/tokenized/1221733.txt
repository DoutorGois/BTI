A micromodification for protein determination in tissue material using Amido black 10 B is described. Compared with the method of LOWRY et al. it requires a comparable time expenditure, but has three principal advantages: 1) it is 5-10fold more sensitive; 2) the calibration curve is linear over a virtually unlimited range; 3) it is feasible in the presence of a number of substances frequently used in protein analyses and making difficult or impossible measurement according to LOWRY et al.
