Evidence from animal stroke models suggests that the proximate cause of neuronal degeneration after ischemia is massive release of glutamate and activation of NMDA receptors. However, in the physiologic presence of oxygen and glucose in the rat hippocampal slice preparation, the neurotoxicity of glutamate, as measured by inhibition of protein synthesis, requires high concentrations and is not prevented by glutamate receptor antagonists. Thus, the NMDA receptor-mediated neurotoxic effects of extracellular glutamate accumulation during ischemia might depend on additional factors, such as neuronal depolarization. In the experiments reported here, slices were exposed to glutamate in a medium intended to mimic the ionic conditions found during ischemia, high potassium (128 mM) and low sodium (26 mM). This depolarizing medium itself inhibited protein synthesis in a manner which was partially mediated by NMDA receptor activation, since it was significantly reversed by the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, MK-801. Furthermore, the effect of glutamate under depolarizing conditions was also significantly decreased by MK-801, suggesting that glutamate was acting at NMDA receptors. Thus, depolarization appears to enhance the sensitivity of neurons to toxic NMDA receptor activation by glutamate. Under conditions that mimic ischemia, hypoxia plus hypoglycemia, a similar protective effect of NMDA receptor antagonists was observed. Depolarization and ischemia both appeared to attenuate the neurotoxicity of non-NMDA receptor agonists. It appears that under conditions of normal glucose and oxygen, high concentrations of bath applied glutamate inhibit protein synthesis at sites other than the NMDA receptor. However, when the Na+ gradient is decreased, as occurs during ischemia, glutamate's NMDA effects predominate. These findings suggest that ionic shifts may play a central role in permitting NMDA receptor-mediated ischemic neuronal damage.
