We analyzed CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family protein levels during reperfusion after a single episode of sublethal forebrain ischemia in the gerbil hippocampus to investigate their expression after ischemia and correlation with neuronal cell death. The common carotid arteries were surgically exposed bilaterally and occluded for 10 min to induce forebrain ischemia in adult Mongolian gerbils. C/EBPalpha, beta, delta, epsilon, zeta protein immunoreactivity was expressed in the hippocampal layer of the CA1 region at 72 h after ischemia and peaked at 96 h. These results appear to correlate with neuronal degeneration as shown by hematoxylin and eosin staining and DNA fragmentation in the terminal transferase biotinylated-UTP nick end labeled-method. The present results demonstrate that C/EBP family proteins appear in the selectively vulnerable CA1 pyramidal cell layer in gerbils during neuronal degeneration, and may serve as a signal that neurons are progressing to neuronal cell death and DNA fragmentation.
