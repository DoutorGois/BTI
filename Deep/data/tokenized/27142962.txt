Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the main cause of dementia. Substantial evidences indicate that there is over-activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis in AD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ; dactolisib), a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that is under phase I/II clinical trials for the treatment of some types of cancer, in hippocampal neuronal cultures stimulated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) 1-42 and in mice injected with Abeta 1-42 in the hippocampus. In cell cultures, BEZ reduced neuronal death induced by Abeta. BEZ, but not rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, or LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor that also inhibits mTOR, reduced the memory impairment induced by Abeta. The effect induced by Abeta was also prevented in PI3Kgamma(-/-) mice. Neuronal death and microgliosis induced by Abeta were reduced by BEZ. In addition, the compound increased IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus. Finally, BEZ did not change the phosphorylation of Akt and p70s6K, suggesting that the involvement of PI3K and mTOR in the effects induced by BEZ remains controversial. Therefore, BEZ represents a potential strategy to prevent the pathological outcomes induced by Abeta and should be investigated in other models of neurodegenerative conditions.
