BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that selenium supplementation may be beneficial in neuroprotection against glutamate-induced cell damage, in which mitochondrial dysfunction is considered a major pathogenic feature. However, the exact mechanisms by which selenium protects against glutamate-provoked mitochondrial perturbation remain ambiguous. In this study glutamate exposed murine hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell was used as a model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of selenium-dependent protection against mitochondria damage. RESULTS: We find that glutamate-induced cytotoxicity was associated with enhancement of superoxide production, activation of caspase-9 and -3, increases of mitochondrial fission marker and mitochondrial morphological changes. Selenium significantly resolved the glutamate-induced mitochondria structural damage, alleviated oxidative stress, decreased Apaf-1, caspases-9 and -3 contents, and altered the autophagy process as observed by a decline in the ratio of the autophagy markers LC3-I and LC3-II. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the protection of selenium against glutamate stimulated cell damage of HT22 cells is associated with amelioration of mitochondrial dynamic imbalance.
