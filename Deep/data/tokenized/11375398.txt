PSD-95/Disc-large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins play a central role in synaptic organization by their involvement in neurotransmitter receptor clustering and signaling complex assembly. The protein interacting with protein kinase C (PICK1), a synaptic PDZ domain protein that also contains a coiled-coil and acidic domain, binds to several synaptic components including the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7a. Coexpression of PICK1 and mGluR7a in heterologous cells induces coclustering of these two proteins. To examine the role of the different structural motifs of PICK1 in synaptic aggregation of PICK1 and mGluR7a coclustering, several PICK1 mutants were generated to analyze their distribution in transfected hippocampal cultured neurons and to test their ability to induce coclusters with mGluR7a when coexpressed in fibroblast cells. The PDZ and coiled-coil domains are both required, whereas the acidic region plays an inhibitory role in these processes. Our data suggest that synaptic aggregation and receptor coclustering depend on PICK1 binding to a target membrane receptor, e.g. mGluR7a, by a PDZ-mediated interaction and on PICK1 oligomerization through the coiled-coil domain. This study defined three structural signals within PICK1 regulating its synaptic localization and receptor coclustering activity, which could represent molecular substrates involved in synaptic development and plasticity.
