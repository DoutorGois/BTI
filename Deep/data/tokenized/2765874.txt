We studied long-term potentiation in the inbred mouse strains DBA/2 and C3H/He known to be different in both hippocampal mossy fiber distribution and several aspects of learning. Tetanic stimulation of mossy fibers resulted in a significantly stronger increase of the population spike amplitude in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer of C3H mice. This result suggests that the extent of the CA3 hippocampal mossy fiber projection correlates with synaptic efficacy in mice.
