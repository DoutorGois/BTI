To reveal the relationship between hippocampal nonpyramidal cells and seizure activity, single-unit activities of nonpyramidal cells were studied during electrically induced paroxysmal discharges in the hippocampal CA1 region of lightly anesthetized rabbits. Type I nonpyramidal cells (N = 21) that were located in or near the pyramidal cell layer tended to cease firing during the early part of paroxysmal discharges, but refired during the late part. In contrast, type II nonpyramidal cells (N = 14) which were found in the inferior subzone of the stratum oriens continued to fire during the entire course of the paroxysmal discharge.
