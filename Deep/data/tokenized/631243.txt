Split-chiasm cats with unilateral or bilateral lesions largely removing the commissurally connected portions of visual cortical areas 17, 18 and 19 showed good interocular transfer of monocularly learned pattern discriminations. The capacity for interocular transfer in these cats was in fact little or not different from that of split-chiasm cats with an intact cortex. Split-chiasm cats with an additional section of the forebrain commissures, as well as two split-chiasm cats with 17-18 lesions also submitted to forebrain commissurotomy after having shown good interocular transfer, were generally incapable of transferring pattern discriminations between the eyes. It is concluded that interocular transfer of pattern discriminations, in split-chiasm cats does not require areas 17, 18 and 19 and must therefore depend on other cortical areas.
