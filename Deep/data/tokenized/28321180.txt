Neuronal synchronization at gamma band frequency (20-80 Hz, gamma oscillations) is closely associated with higher brain function, such as learning, memory and attention. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, and modulate hippocampal gamma oscillations, but the intracellular mechanism underlying such modulation remains elusive. We explored multiple kinases by which nicotine can modulate gamma oscillations induced by kainate in rat hippocampal area CA3 in vitro. We found that inhibitors of cyclic AMP dependent kinase (protein kinase A, PKA), protein kinase C (PKC), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptors, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK), each individually could prevent the gamma oscillation-enhancing effect of 1 muM nicotine, whereas none of them affected baseline gamma oscillation strength. Inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase Akt increased baseline gamma oscillations and partially blocked its nicotinic enhancement. We propose that the PKA-NMDAR-PI3K-ERK pathway modifies cellular properties required for the nicotinic enhancement of gamma oscillations, dependent on a PKC-ERK mediated pathway. These signaling pathways provide clues for restoring gamma oscillations in pathological conditions affecting cognition. The suppression of gamma oscillations at 100 muM nicotine was only dependent on PKA-NMDAR activation and may be due to very high intracellular calcium levels.
