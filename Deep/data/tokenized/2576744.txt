1. The effect of the nootropic drug adafenoxate on monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in rat brain cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus has been studied using the following substrates: tyramine (total MAO), serotonin (MAO A) and beta-phenylethylamine (MAO B). 2. In a series of increased concentrations (from 5 x 10(-4) up to 1 x 10(-5) M) adafenoxate inhibits total MAO, MAO A and MAO B in the brain structures studied. 3. The adafenoxate IC50 values obtained illustrate its inhibitory properties and its lack of selectivity toward MAO in the brain structures isolated. 4. The results of our research prove the participation of MAO in the mechanisms through which adafenoxate affects the brain monoaminergic systems and realises its central effects.
