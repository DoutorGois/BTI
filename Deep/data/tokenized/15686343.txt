We report a fucose alpha(1-2) galactose-mediated pathway for the modulation of neuronal growth and morphology. Our studies provide strong evidence for the presence of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal glycoproteins and lectin receptors in hippocampal neurons. Additionally, we show that manipulation of Fucalpha(1-2)Gal-associated proteins using small-molecule and lectin probes induces dramatic changes in neuronal morphology. These findings may provide a novel pathway to stimulate neuronal growth and regeneration.
