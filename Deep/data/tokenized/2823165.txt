5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) stimulated the turnover of phosphoinositide in primary cultures of astroglia from the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and brain stem. Ketanserin and ritanserin, selective antagonists for the central 5-HT2 receptor, inhibited the 5-HT-stimulated formation of inositol monophosphate. In contrast, there was no statistically significant accumulation of cyclic AMP after incubation with different concentrations of 5-HT in any of the cultures studied. The results indicate that astrocytes from various regions of the brain possess 5-HT2 receptors coupled to the formation of inositol phosphates.
