BACKGROUND: To determine whether white matter (WM) memory network changes accompany early cognitive impairment and whether these changes represent early, pathologically independent axonal affection, we combined WM diffusion tensor imaging and cortical morphometric measurements of normal control subjects, patients with only subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: We included 66 patients with SCI or MCI and 21 control subjects from a university-hospital-based memory clinic in a cross-sectional study. Morphometric analysis was performed in FreeSurfer, and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics was used for analysis of diffusion tensor imaging-derived WM fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity (DR), and mean diffusivity (MD). Relationships between WM measures and stage were assessed with whole-brain voxelwise statistics and on a region-of-interest basis, with subsequent correction for cortical atrophy. RESULTS: In SCI patients, as compared with control subjects, there were widespread changes in DR and MD. No significant differences in thickness could be demonstrated. In MCI patients, as compared with control subjects, there were widespread changes in DR, MD, and fractional anisotropy; the precuneal and inferior parietal cortices were thinner; and the hippocampus was smaller. Multiple logistic regression analysis eliminated morphometry as an explanatory variable in favor of DR/MD for all regions of interest, except in the precuneus, where both thickness and DR/MD were significant explanatory variables. CONCLUSIONS: WM tract degeneration is prominent in SCI and MCI patients, and is at least in part independent of overlying gray matter atrophy.
