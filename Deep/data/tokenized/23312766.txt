OBJECTIVE: Knowledge about the hippocampal morphologic mechanisms of learning and memory for maternal mild zinc deficiency during pregnancy/lactation followed by zinc supplementation of pups after weaning is limited. This study examined the effects of zinc deficiency and zinc supplementation on cognition and hippocampal neurons. METHODS: One-day pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 12): control (CO), pair-fed (PF), zinc-deprived (ZD), and oral zinc-supplemented (OZS). The CO and PF groups were fed a control diet (zinc 25 mug/g diet), and the others were fed a mildly zinc-deficient diet (zinc 2 mug/g diet) during pregnancy and lactation. After weaning (day 21), offspring in the OZS group were switched to a control diet. After 35 d, the behavioral function of the offspring was tested with the Morris water maze test. The ultrastructure of the hippocampal CA3 area was observed under a transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: Compared with the CO and PF groups, rats in the ZD group spent more time finding the latent platform and swam longer distances (P < 0.05). The time used finding the platform and the swimming distance in the OZS group were similar to those in the CO and PF groups (P > 0.05). In addition, apoptotic neuronal changes in the hippocampus were observed in the ZD group, whereas the reversal of neuronal morphologic changes was observed in the OZS group. CONCLUSION: The changes in hippocampal neuron morphology were consistent with the changes in the learning and memory ability of mildly zinc-deficient and zinc-supplemented offspring.
