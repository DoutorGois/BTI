Prolonged seizures in immature rats result in minimal behavioral consequences when the animals are studied later in life. Likewise, early-onset seizures are associated with minimal morphological changes. However, it is known that seizures early in life result in changes in the brain that make it more vulnerable to subsequent seizure-induced injury (the so-called two-hit hypothesis). Whether this heightened vulnerability occurs immediately after the first seizure is not known. In this study, immature rats were exposed to status epilepticus (SE) followed by a series of 25 flurothyl-induced seizures, SE alone, 25 flurothyl-induced seizures alone, or no seizures. Rats exposed to SE and flurothyl seizures performed significantly poorer in the water maze 2 weeks following the last seizure compared with the other groups. No histological lesions were seen in any of the four groups. This study suggests that SE renders the immature brain vulnerable to further seizure-induced injury and this enhanced vulnerability occurs very quickly after the SE.
