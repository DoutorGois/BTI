The effects on tramadol state-dependent memory of bilateral intradorsal hippocampal (intra-CA1) injections of physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and atropine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, were examined in adult male NMRI mice. A single-trial step-down passive avoidance task was used for the assessment of memory retention. Post-training intra-CA1 administration of an atypical mu-opioid receptor agonist, tramadol (0.5 and 1 mug/mouse), dose dependently impaired memory retention. Pretest injection of tramadol (0.5 and 1 mug/mouse, intra-CA1) induced state-dependent retrieval of the memory acquired under the influence of post-training tramadol (1 mug/mouse, intra-CA1). A pretest intra-CA1 injection of physostigmine (1 mug/mouse) reversed the memory impairment induced by post-training administration of tramadol (1 mug/mouse, intra-CA1). Moreover, pretest administration of physostigmine (0.5 and 1 mug/mouse, intra-CA1) with an ineffective dose of tramadol (0.25 mug/mouse, intra-CA1) also significantly restored retrieval. Pretest administration of physostigmine (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mug/mouse, intra-CA1) by itself did not affect memory retention. A pretest intra-CA1 injection of the atropine (1 and 2 mug/mouse) 5 min before the administration of tramadol (1 mug/mouse, intra-CA1) dose dependently inhibited tramadol state-dependent memory. Pretest administration of atropine (0.5, 1, and 2 mug/mouse, intra-CA1) by itself did not affect memory retention. It can be concluded that dorsal hippocampal muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mechanisms play an important role in the modulation of tramadol state-dependent memory.
