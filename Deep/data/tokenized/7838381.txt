Selective excitatory amino acid- and GABAB-receptor antagonists were used to examine the role these receptors play in epileptiform burst discharge elicited by blocking GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition in hippocampal slice cultures of the rat. Application of bicuculline caused a single ictal burst followed by interictal bursting. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, reduced the depolarizing envelope underlying interictal discharge, and accentuated the appearance of concomitant slow oscillatory potentials, which occurred synchronously in all CA3 cells. The non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, 6-nitro-7sulphamoyl-benzo(F) quinoxaline and 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione, blocked interictal bursting at high concentrations, and low concentrations of 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione selectively eliminated the slow oscillations in an all-or-none manner, leaving the depolarizing envelope. No effects of either metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists or of dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel agonists or antagonists on evoked interictal discharge were observed. 6-Cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione-resistant interictal-like discharge could be obtained in the presence of bicuculline when the external Mg2+ concentration was reduced from 1.5-0.5 mM. The GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 35348 prolonged individual evoked interictal bursts, and caused the appearance of spontaneous ictal-like discharges. The implications of these results are discussed with regard to the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and to potential therapeutic intervention.
