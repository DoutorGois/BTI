Recent electrophysiological observations suggest that, in addition to the medial septal area pacemaker system, several alternative or additional mechanisms are involved in the generation/regulation of hippocampal theta activity. Discharging neurons phase-locked to hippocampal theta waves have been observed in the dorsal raphe, nucleus reticularis pontis oralis and especially in the supramammillary region of rats. Since these areas are reciprocally interconnected with the hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex, it would aid our understanding of limbic function to elucidate the location and neurochemical content of the entorhino-septal and septo-supramammillary projection neurons, as well as that of their postsynaptic targets. Light and electron microscopic immunostaining for calretinin, in combination with antero- and retrograde tracer techniques, postembedding immunostaining for GABA and the transmitter specific [3H]D-aspartate retrograde radiolabeling, as well as a co-localization experiment for calretinin and glutamate decarboxylase in rat supramammillary and septal neurons, demonstrated that: (i) a large population of entorhinal cells that forms asymmetric synaptic contacts on calretinin-containing neurons located at the border between the medial and lateral septal areas contains calretinin and are aspartate/glutamatergic; (ii) the overwhelming majority of calretinin-immunoreactive cells located at the border between the lateral and medial septal area are GABAergic; (iii) these neurons can be retrogradely labeled from the supramammillary area; (iv) anterogradely labeled axons originating in the border between the medial and lateral septum are GABAergic and (v) terminate on supramammillary area non-GABAergic, calretinin-containing neurons, which are known to project to the septal complex and hippocampus. These observations indicate that a large population of cells participating in the hippocampal feedback regulation of theta regulation/generation contain the same calcium-binding protein. Furthermore, entorhinal excitatory transmitter-containing neurons can depress the activity of supramammillary theta generating/regulating cells via septal inhibitory neurons.
