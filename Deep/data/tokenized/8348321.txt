The avian hippocampal formation (HP) is thought to play a role in the processing of spatial memory related to food-storing behaviour. The HP of two food-storing species (marsh tit (Parus palustris) and magpie (Pica pica)) and two non-storing species (great tit (Parus major) and jackdaw (Corvus monedula)) were compared following calbindin-like immunostaining. In the dorsal hippocampal region, both species of food-storing birds had larger calbindin-immunoreactive cells than did the two non-storing species. The fact that this association between storing behaviour and cell morphology is seen in two unrelated families of birds, the Paridae (marsh tit versus great tit) and Corvidae (magpie versus jackdaw) suggests that there may be a direct link between food-storing behaviour and the dorsal hippocampal calbindin-immunoreactive cell population.
