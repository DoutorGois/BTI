Using young and aged rats, we investigated relationships between amyloid precursor protein (APP) and working or reference memory, as well as assessed whether cognitive testing altered APP levels. In young rats, higher APP levels were related to more working memory errors as a linear function. Aged rats exhibited a curvilinear relationship between APP and working memory, with moderate APP levels associated with better relative performance. A comparison of rats that received cognitive testing with those that did not showed that testing decreased APP levels in young, but not aged, rats. Collectively, the data suggest that young and aged rats exhibit different relationships between APP and working memory, and that aged rats do not maintain the capacity to decrease APP in response to cognitive testing.
