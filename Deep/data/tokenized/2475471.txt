This paper describes a perivascular staining pattern that is obtained when dithizone or sodium selenite are used to label zinc intravitally. Our observations indicate that the perivascular staining is a result of zinc labeling in mossy fiber boutons adjacent to capillaries and suggest that there might be a special blood brain barrier in the mossy fiber regions.
