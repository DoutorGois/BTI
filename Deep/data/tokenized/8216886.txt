The effects of prenatal alcohol treatment on the development and in vitro phosphorylation of specific neuronal phosphoproteins isolated from the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rat brains were studied. In vitro phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) was decreased in the frontal cortex but not the hippocampus of animals exposed prenatally to alcohol. Phosphorylation of additional phosphoproteins, including tau proteins, Synapsin I, and GAP-43, was not affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Littermates of animals used for the phosphorylation assays showed impaired passive avoidance learning. These data demonstrate that the previously reported structural changes in the development of the cerebral cortex following prenatal alcohol exposure and behavioral deficits are accompanied by changes in the phosphorylation of the important cytoskeletal protein MAP-2.
