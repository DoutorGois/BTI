A list of spider species is presented for the Belem Area of Endemism, the most threatened region in the Amazon Basin, comprising portions of eastern State of Para and western State of Maranhao, Brazil. The data are based both on records from the taxonomic and biodiversity survey literature and on scientific collection databases. A total of 319 identified species were recorded, with 318 occurring in Para and only 22 in Maranhao. About 80% of species are recorded at the vicinities of the city of Belem, indicating that sampling effort have been strongly biased. To identify potentially high-diversity areas, discounting the effect of variations in sampling effort, the residues of a linear regression between the number of records and number of species mapped in each 0.25 degrees grid cells were analyzed. One grid, representing the Alto Turiacu Indigenous land, had the highest deviation from the expected from the linear regression, indicating high expected species richness. Several other grid cells showed intermediate values of the regression residuals, indicating species richness moderately above to the expected from the model.
