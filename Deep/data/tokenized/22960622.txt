Synaptotagmins are required for Ca(2+)-dependent membrane-trafficking in either neuronal synaptic vesicles or cellular membranes. Previous reports suggested that the synaptotagmin 11 (syt11) gene is involved in the development of schizophrenia based on the genomic analysis of patients. Parkin protein binds to the C2 domains of Syt11 which leads to the polyubiquitination of Syt11. However, where and how Syt11 performs its role in the brain is largely unknown. Here, we report that Syt11 is expressed mainly in the brain. In addition, exogenously expressed Syt11 in HEK293 cells can form higher molecular weight complex via its transmembrane domain. Also, Syt11 is targeted to both dendrite and axon compartments. Immunocytochemistry showed that Syt11 is juxtaposed to postsynaptic markers in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Both neuroligin 1 and 2, which are postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules and differentially induce excitatory and inhibitory presynapses, respectively, recruit Syt11 in neuron coculture. Immunogold electron microscopy analysis revealed that Syt11 exists mainly in presynaptic neurotransmitter vesicles and plasma membrane, and rarely in postsynaptic sites. These results suggest that Syt11 may contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release in the excitatory and inhibitory presynapses, and postsynapse-targeted membrane trafficking in dendrites.
