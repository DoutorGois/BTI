1. The neuronal basis of alkaline shifts in extracellular pH (pHo) evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals was studied by means of double-barreled H(+)-selective microelectrodes in the area CA1 of rat hippocampal slices. 2. Alkaline transients in stratum pyramidale evoked by stimulation at a low frequency (5-10 Hz) were enhanced by pentobarbital sodium (100 microM). In the absence of the drug, inhibition of extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CAo) by benzolamide or by prontosildextran 5000 (PD 5000) resulted in an increase in the alkaline shifts. In contrast to this, alkaloses evoked by low-frequency stimulation in the presence of pentobarbital were attenuated by a subsequent inhibition of CAo. 3. Blockade of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors with picrotoxin (PiTX; 100 microM) resulted in an enhancement of alkaline transients in s. pyramidale evoked by low-frequency stimulation (10 Hz) but suppressed alkaline shifts evoked by brief high-frequency (1 s, 100 Hz) trains of stimuli. 4. Application of trains of stimuli consisting of a constant number of pulses (50 or 100) revealed a striking dependence of the effect of benzolamide on stimulation frequency (10-200 Hz) in s. pyramidale: the enhancement of the alkaloses seen upon inhibition of CAo became progressively smaller with an increase in frequency, and at 100-200 Hz benzolamide produced a suppression or a complete block of the alkaline transients. However, alkaline transients evoked with the use of a constant train duration (5 s) were enhanced by benzolamide at all stimulation frequencies examined (5-200 Hz).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
