The aim of the present study is to clarify the possible relevance of the arachidonic acid cascade to working memory in rats, by using a three-panel runway apparatus. Interleukin-1 beta, injected bilaterally into the dorsal hippocampus at a dose of 100 ng/side, significantly impaired working memory, and this impairment was attenuated by pretreatment with 10 mg/kg (s.c.) of diclofenac, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor. Working memory was also impaired in rats administered a bilateral intrahippocampal injection of prostaglandin E2, in a dose-dependent manner at 0.01-1 microg/side. Furthermore, an injection of 100 ng/side of interleukin-1 beta significantly increased production of prostaglandin E2 (580 +/- 32 pg to 1142 +/- 101 pg/100 mg wet tissue) in the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings suggest that the activation of the arachidonic acid cascade was causative of the working memory impairment induced by interleukin-1 beta.
