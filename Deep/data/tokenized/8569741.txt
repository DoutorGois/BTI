An overview of some of the biochemical and molecular events involved in the process of learning and memory are presented in a short review. Two invertebrate models of learning are considered: the gill-withdrawal reflex of Aplysia and avoidance learning in Drosophila melanogaster. Particular attention is paid to the biochemical mechanisms underlying both the development of long-term potentiation (LTP) and passive avoidance learning (PAL) in the young chick. The role of several biological molecules in learning and memory are considered, for example, protein kinase C (PKC), Ca(++)-Calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII), GAP-43, and glutamate receptors.
