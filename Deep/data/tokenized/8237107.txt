The use of new methods of morphologic analysis made it possible to detail significantly already known insights and to formulate the new ones concerning the hippocampal construction. This review discusses in detail the principles of structural organization of all intrahippocampal interneuronal connections and projections to the hippocampus from entorhinal cortex. Also, other afferent and efferent pathways and connections of polymorphic neurons of hippocampus are studied. Revision of the lamellar principle of hippocampal organization and involvement of inhibitory system in restricting an excitation propagation along the hippocampus is discussed.
