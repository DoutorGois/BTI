BACKGROUND AND AIM: Beta-catenin, as a major effector molecule in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, could regulate adult neurogenesis. Here, the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in the proliferation of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) induced by hypoxia was investigated. METHODS: The hippocampal NSCs of neonatal green fluorescent protein transgenic mice on day 0 were cultured in hypoxia (5% O(2)) and traditional O(2) (20% O(2)). The expression of beta-catenin, p-GSK-3beta, and cyclinD1 in NSCs was measured under hypoxia or traditional O(2) by western blotting. NSCs were electroporated with pTOPFLASH reporter in different conditions and the LEF/TCF-dependent luciferase activity was assayed. RESULTS: Hypoxia increased the proliferation and reduced the apoptosis of hippocampal NSCs. NSCs proliferation was inhibited by transfecting with pAxin, whereas promoted by transfecting with pbeta-catenin. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia could enhance the proliferation of hippocampal NSCs and beta-catenin contributed to this action.
