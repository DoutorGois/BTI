The action of diazepam, meprobamate, trioxazine and mexidol on bioelectrical activity of sensorimotor cortex and dorsal hippocamp of the left and right hemisphere of the brain in conscious rat in free behavior has been studied. All the drugs produced a decline in the frequency of the dominant peak of EEG power spectra. Diazepam and meprobamate increased beta-activity. It is concluded that the decreased frequency may be due to an anxiolytic effect of the tranquilizers, whereas high beta-activity is related to muscle relaxant effect of some drugs.
