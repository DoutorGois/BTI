The neuroprotective role of the expression of heat shock protein (HSP) and immediate early gene remains unclear. Using immunoelectron microscopy, we examined the ultrastructural integrity of the neurons with expression of c-Fos, c-Jun and HSP70 in gerbils after transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Induction of c-Fos and c-Jun was observed in the CA3 region resistant to ischemia, while HSP70 was expressed not only in the CA3 but also in the vulnerable CAI region. With immunoelectron microscopy, the expression of c-Fos/c-Jun and HSP70 was observed in the neurons which retained neuronal integrity except for mitochondrial swelling and polyribosomal disaggregation. In contrast, the CAI neurons without immunoreaction for HSP70 showed cytoplasmic vacuoles and parallel stacking of rough endoplasmic reticulum, the features associated with the process of delayed neuronal death. These findings suggested that c-Fos and c-Jun were induced selectively in reversibly damaged neurons, whereas HSP70 was up-regulated even in neurons with irreversible damage, but was more preferentially and intensely expressed in neurons with reversible damage.
