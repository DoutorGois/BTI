Experimental models of traumatic cortical brain injury in rodents reveal that specific regions of the hippocampus (e.g., CA3 and hilar subfields) are severely injured despite their distance from the initial insult. Hippocampal neurons may be intrinsically more vulnerable to mechanical insult than cortical neurons due to increased NMDA receptor densities and lower energy capacities, as evidenced by increased susceptibility to ischemic insults. The selective vulnerability of hippocampal neurons was evaluated using an in vitro model of TBI in which either primary rat cortical or hippocampal neurons (E17) seeded onto silicone substrates were subjected to graded levels of mechanical stretch. Although cortical neurons exhibited significantly longer increases in stretch-induced membrane permeability, injury of hippocampal neurons resulted in larger increases in intracellular free calcium concentration [Ca(2+)](i) and cell death. [ATP](i) deficits due to stretch were apparent by 60 min after injury in cortical neurons but recovered by 24 h, whereas significant deficits in [ATP](i) were not observed in hippocampal neurons until 24 h after injury. MK801 pretreatment decreased the stretch-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients in both hippocampal and cortical cultures, thereby negating the regional specificity. However, MK801 pretreatment did not improve hippocampal viability and paradoxically, significantly increased cell death among cortical neurons. As the hippocampus is the primary brain region responsible for the memory deficits and epileptic seizures associated with TBI, understanding why this region is selectively damaged could lead to the development of more accurate mechanical tolerances as well as effective pharmaceutical agents.
