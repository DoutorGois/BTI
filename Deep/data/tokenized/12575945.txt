Theories of hippocampal function are often split into cognitive map theories and relational/episodic memory theories. In this issue of Neuron, show that hippocampal cells respond to the combination of spatial location and conditioned stimuli in a nonspatial fear conditioning task, suggesting a potential bridge between the competing theories of hippocampal function.
