We investigated the effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on aspartate release from cultured cerebellar neurons. This release occurred within 1 min after the addition of 100 ng/ml BDNF. The amount of aspartate released was less than that of glutamate. Aspartate release induced by BDNF was rapid and transient, as in the case of glutamate. Although high potassium evoked the release of both excitatory (glutamate and aspartate) and inhibitory (GABA and glycine) amino acid transmitters, BDNF only induced glutamate and aspartate release. BDNF-induced aspartate release was completely blocked by pretreatment with K252a or TrkB-IgG. The aspartate release induced by BDNF was not dependent on the extracellular Ca(2+), but required intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization. These results showed that BDNF may be involved in excitatory transmission using aspartate as well as glutamate through TrkB-mediated signaling in cerebellum.
