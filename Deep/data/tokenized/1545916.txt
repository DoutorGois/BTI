GM1 ganglioside and nerve growth factor both promote the recovery of injured central cholinergic neurons in young animals. Brain cholinergic activity declines with aging and nerve growth factor has been shown to correct cholinergic deficits in senescent animals. We have administered GM1, to young (three months old) or senescent (22-24 months old) rats and evaluated acetylcholine and choline content, choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activity as well as choline uptake in striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex. For some studies, nerve growth factor was administered alone or together with GM1. Our results indicate that cholinergic neurochemical parameters are decreased in some brain areas of senescent animals and that both GM1 and nerve growth factor can enhance their recovery.
