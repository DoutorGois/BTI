DNA fragmentation, mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-XL, Bax and caspase-3 were determined to characterize interrelations between expression of these apoptotic markers in the neonatal brain regions. High DNA fragmentation intensity in the cortex was in consonance with the lowest Bcl-XL/Bax expression ratio, the highest procaspase-3 and active caspase-3 levels. Low and intermediate DNA fragmentation levels in the cerebellum and hippocampus respectively were also in a good agreement with apoptotic proteins expression in these structures. In the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum DNA fragmentation intensity was proportional to the active caspase-3 level. In contrast to these structures, in the brainstem, the lowest level of this protease was accompanied by the highest intensity of DNA fragmentation among the brain regions studied. The data suggest that cell death normally occurring during early postnatal life could be realized in the developing brainstem via caspase-3-independent pathways in animals that express this protease.
