Using both quantitative autoradiography in sections and a homogenate preparation assay, the distribution and density of 3H-ketanserin binding to 5 HT2 receptors was examined in frontal cortex and the hippocampal region from six control subjects and seven subjects who had dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). There was no difference between control and DAT subjects in the levels of ketanserin binding in any region of the frontal cortex or hippocampus determined by quantitative autoradiography or in parallel experiments using homogenate preparations (e.g. left frontal cortex, layer III; controls, 34.4 +/- 1.6 pmol/g, DAT, 37.1 +/- 4.6 pmol/g). In all of the DAT brains there were abundant neuritic plaques (e.g. superficial layers of left frontal cortex; 35 +/- 7 plaques/mm2), and a marked reduction of choline acetyltransferase activity, (by 30-60% relative to controls), in both frontal cortex and the hippocampus. Thus, despite the presence of morphological abnormalities and a loss of cholinergic function, two classic features of DAT, 5 HT2 receptor binding was unaltered in this group of DAT brains compared to controls.
