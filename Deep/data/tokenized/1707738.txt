Ischemia of hippocampal slices leads to 86Rb+ efflux and to amino acid neurotransmitter release. This 86Rb+ efflux which corresponds to the massive K+ efflux from neuronal cells observed in ischemic animals is inhibited by glucose (IC50 = 1.7 mM). Glucose also inhibits the ischemia induced liberation of GABA and aspartate. 86Rb+ efflux is insensitive to any type of known blockers for ATP-sensitive, Ca2(+)-sensitive and voltage-sensitive K+ channels.
