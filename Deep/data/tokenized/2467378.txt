Glutamate activates a number of different receptor-channel complexes, each of which may contribute to generation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the mammalian central nervous system. The rapid application of the selective glutamate agonist, quisqualate, activates a large rapidly inactivating current (3 to 8 milliseconds), which is mediated by a neuronal ionic channel with high unitary conductance (35 picosiemens). The current through this channel shows pharmacologic characteristics similar to those observed for the fast excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC); it reverses near 0 millivolts and shows no significant voltage dependence. The amplitude of the current through this channel is many times larger than that through the other non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) channels. These results suggest that this high-conductance quisqualate-activated channel may mediate the fast EPSC in the mammalian central nervous system.
