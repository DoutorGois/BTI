Cell nuclei isolated from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Wistar and Krushinsky-Molodkina rats (the latter ones were examined both in quiet awake state and after audiogenic seizures) have different capacity to incorporate 3H-UTP. The levels of the label incorporation correlate with different calcium content in cell nuclei. Addition of exogenous calcium to nuclear suspension in the same concentration inhibits or activates 3H-UTP incorporation depending on the initial level of the nucleotide incorporation and on the endogenous calcium content. The data obtained allow the conclusion that the changes in calcium concentration in cell nuclei are one of the factors regulating RNA synthesis by brain cells in different functional states.
