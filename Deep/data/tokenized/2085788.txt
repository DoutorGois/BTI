The present study investigates whether the stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system affects spatial navigation deficits induced by the lesioning of the nucleus basalis (NB). Thus, the effect of gamma-vinyl-GABA treatment which elevates the GABA levels in brain was studied on water maze task both in unoperated and NB-lesioned (ibotenic acid) rats. The subchronic administration of gamma-vinyl-GABA aggravated dose-dependently NB lesion-induced deficits, although it did not impair the performance of unoperated rats in this task. The imbalance between GABAergic system and cholinergic or non-cholinergic systems of the NB may contribute to spatial navigation deficits in rats.
