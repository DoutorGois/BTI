The systemic administration of trimethyltin (TMT, 2.8 mg/kg, i.p.) induced granule cell death in the mouse dentate gyrus selectively 2 days later. The administration of TMT not only enhanced activator protein-1 DNA binding, along with an increase in expression of c-Jun and Fra-2, in the hippocampus 1 day later, but also facilitated phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) within the cytosol and nucleus. There was also a concomitant increase in the level of phosphorylated JNK kinase (MKK4/SEK1) in the cytosol 16-24 h after the administration. Moreover, TMT markedly elevated endogenous levels of both phosphorylated c-Jun and phosphorylated activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), in addition to activating JNK activity in the nuclear extracts obtained 16-24 h post-administration. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that whereas Fra-2 and phosphorylated ATF-2 were expressed in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer predominantly, phosphorylated c-Jun was observed in both the CA1 pyramidal and dentate granule cell layers after TMT administration. Taken together, our data indicate that TMT activates the JNK pathway in the hippocampus prior to neuronal cell death. The prior activation of this pathway could be at least in part involved in the TMT-induced neural damage seen in the dentate granule cells of mice.
