Afferents from the perirhinal cortex (PRh) form a major input to the hippocampal formation, which is known to be involved in sexual behavior in rodents. But there is a lacuna in literature regarding the role of the PRh in sexual behavior. Bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the PRh delayed the ejaculation latency and prolonged the mean inter-intromission interval significantly, suggesting a facilitatory role of the PRh in male rat sex behavior.
