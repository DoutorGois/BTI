A major effect of volatile anesthetics is to reduce excitatory synaptic transmission. In the present study the stimulated release of glutamate under the influence of increasing concentrations of isoflurane was studied in vitro by utilizing hippocampal slices from Wistar rats. Ca(2+)-dependent release was calculated by subtracting stimulated release with blocked synaptic transmission (50 mM K+, 0 mM Ca2+ and 4 mM Mg2+) from total evoked release (50 mM K+, 2 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+). Isoflurane 0.5, 1.5 and 3% reduced Ca(2+)-dependent release of glutamate to 69, 58 and 49%, respectively (P < 0.05 for all related to control). These results are in agreement with the possibility of reduced release of transmitter as a mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics.
