Zinc potentiates the induction of NMDA receptor-dependent hippocampal CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) at low micromolar concentrations, while excessive zinc attenuates it. Homeostasis of synaptic zinc is critical for LTP induction. In the present study, LTP at hippocampal CA1 synapses was analyzed focused on the timing and level of zinc influx into hippocampal cells in hippocampal slices from young rats. Zinc (100 microM) perfusion increased intracellular zinc level and subsequently attenuated CA1 LTP induced by tetanic stimuli at 100 Hz for 1s, which was completely inhibited in the presence of 50 microM APV, an NMDA receptor antagonist. When 10 microM CNQX, an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, which reduced zinc influx into hippocampal cells, was perfused prior to the zinc perfusion, the attenuation of CA1 LTP by the zinc perfusion was restored. These results suggest that facilitated zinc influx into hippocampal cells via AMPA/kainate receptor activation is an event to attenuate subsequent induction of NMDA receptor-dependent CA1 LTP. On the other hand, the zinc pre-perfusion also attenuated CA1 LTP induced by 200-Hz tetanus, but not NMDA receptor-independent CA1 LTP induced by 200-Hz tetanus in the presence of APV, suggesting that the induction of NMDA receptor-independent CA1 LTP is less susceptibility to the facilitated zinc influx into hippocampal CA1 cells. Zinc influx via AMPA/kainate receptor activation may differentially act on subsequent induction of CA1 LTP components.
