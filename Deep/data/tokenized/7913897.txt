Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats with the aim to study effects exerted by microinjections of somatostatin and neurotensin into lateral ventricle, amygdala, hippocampus and substantia nigra pars reticulata in case of epileptic activity. It was established that the mentioned neuropeptides exerted antiepileptic effect during seizures induced by corazol and picrotoxin, which was expressed by substantial elongation of the seizure latency and a decreasing of seizure intensity. It was shown that antiseizure activity of somatostatin and neurotensin was higher under conditions of picrotoxin-induced epileptic activity, than under conditions of that induced by corazol. A conclusion is made that somatostatin and neurotensin take part in epileptic activity regulation.
