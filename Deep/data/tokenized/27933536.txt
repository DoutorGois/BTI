This chapter describes the genetic analysis of a morphometric neuroanatomic trait. We used the extended BXD family of recombinant inbred mouse strains with the intent to analyze the genetic bases of heritable differences in hippocampal neurocircuitry and to identify Quantitative Trait Loci that underlie these variations. A detailed description of a GeneNetwork analysis is provided using data for the intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber (IIPMF) terminal fields which are strongly correlated with spatial navigation/radial maze learning.
