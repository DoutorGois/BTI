The effect of a novel prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) inhibitor, (S)-2-2[[(S)-2-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl]carbonyl]-N-(phenylmethyl) -1-pyrrolidinecarboxamide (JTP-4819), on spatial learning deficits in rats with dorsal hippocampal (DH) lesions was examined using an eight-arm radial maze. The correct performance remained at chance levels even after 18 acquisition trials in rats with DH lesions. JTP-4819 (3.0 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly ameliorated this learning impairment after 34-41 days of treatment. When DH lesions were created in rats after achievement of learning, postoperative performance deteriorated prominently, but gradually recovered with the repetition of trials. JTP-4819 (3.0 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly decreased the number of trials needed to reattain learning criterion. After the behavioral experiment, the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and [3H]-pirenzepine binding (Kd, Bmax) in the residual hippocampus and cerebral cortex were analyzed. Neither parameter was significantly affected by JTP-4819. In conclusion, JTP-4819 can improve both learning and relearning deficits of spatial memory in DH-lesioned rats, postulating that enhancement of neuropeptide activity via PEP inhibition may be involved in the mechanism of action of JTP-4819.
