Tachykinin NK2 receptors have been suggested to play an important role in the central nervous system. This study, using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed a detectable expression of NK2 receptor mRNA in various human brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, the putamen, the hippocampus, the substantia nigra and the cerebral cortex. The distribution of NK2 receptor expression in the cortex revealed a major expression in frontal and temporal cortex compared to occipital and parietal areas. These results provide a molecular basis for considering a role of NK2 receptors in human pathophysiology.
