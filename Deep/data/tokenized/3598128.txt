A series of three complex cerebral malformations is presented. The series was characterized by incomplete development of the commissural and chiasmatic plate of the developing forebrain. Associated anomalies included hypoplasia of the hippocampus, heterotopias, and nonfusion of the cerebellum. Mild facial anomalies were present, as were somatic anomalies of the heart and kidneys. Emphasis is placed on the order and classification of similar cerebral anomalies.
