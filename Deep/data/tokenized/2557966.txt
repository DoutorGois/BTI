Several differences have been found in GABAergic function between the long sleep (LS) and short sleep (SS) mice which were genetically selected for different ethanol-induced sleeptimes, and it has been suggested that these differences may explain their differential ethanol sensitivity. However, these lines also differ in seizure susceptibility, a behavior which may also be mediated by GABAergic pathways. Thus, it is difficult to associate differences in GABA neurochemistry with either of these behaviors, particularly when only two selected lines are used. We measured differences in the density and affinity of the [35S]TBPS binding site on the GABAA receptor/Cl- ionophore complex in discrete brain areas; and in order to determine the relationship between receptor binding and behavioral differences, we included mice from 5 of the LS and SS recombinant inbred strains (LS x SS RI) in addition to mice from the LS and SS lines. [35S]TBPS binding in sagittal brain sections was analyzed by quantitative autoradiography, and the amount of binding differed depending on whether bicuculline was added to inhibit endogenous GABA binding. In the presence of bicuculline, the number of [35S]TBPS sites in SS mice was highest in the colliculi (4.5 +/- 0.5 pmol/mg protein), cerebellum (4.8 +/- 0.6 pmol/mg), hippocampus (3.2 +/- 0.7 pmol/mg) and cortex (2.9 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg). The Bmax was two-fold lower in both superior and inferior colliculi (IC) of LS mice. There were no differences between lines in Bmax in any other area and in Kd values in any area (58 +/- 4.0 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
