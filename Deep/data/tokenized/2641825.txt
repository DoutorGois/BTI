Modification in several enzyme activities after Li treatment are described. The enzymes under study were Lys-aminopeptidase (Lys-AP), glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK). The changes observed were as follows: Modifications of Lys-AP activity in the hypothalamus (Ht), pituitary gland and hippocampus (HC); LDH increases in Ht and medulla (Md); CK increases in HC, Ht and Md. No changes were found in GOT activity. It is suggested that these enzymes play a part in the lithium action mechanism.
