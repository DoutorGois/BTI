Making optimal decisions depends on an appreciation of the value of choices. An important source of information about value comes from memory for prior experience. Such value-based learning has historically been considered the domain of a striatal memory system. However, recent developments suggest that memorial representations supported by the hippocampus may also contribute to decision making. Unlike striatal representations, hippocampal ones are flexible; they can be modified and updated as new information is acquired. In this paper we argue that the hippocampus plays a pivotal role in value-based decision making via three flexible learning mechanisms: (1) updating, (2) generalization, and (3) construction.
