To clarify the mechanisms of the antiepileptic activity of phenytoin (PHI), the effects of PHT on extracellular and total levels of monoamines (dopamine and serotonin), in rat striatum and hippocampus were studied. The plasma concentrations of PHT associated with therapeutic activity did not affect striatal and hippocampal extracellular levels of monoamines, whereas supratherapeutic concentrations of PHT decreased striatal and hippocampal extracellular levels of monoamines, in a concentration dependent manner. Toxic concentrations of PHT produced generalized seizures 'paradoxical intoxication' and an initial drastic decrease in striatal and hippocampal extracellular levels of monoamines before seizure onset, whereas the extracellular monoamines levels increased after seizures. In addition, the therapeutic concentrations of PHT did not affect monoamine turnover, whereas supratherapeutic concentrations of PHT inhibited monoamine turnover. These results suggest that monoaminergic transmission may not be involved in the antiepileptic mechanism of action of PHT, and that dysfunction of monoaminergic transmission can produce generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. Thus, the present study suggests that 'Paradoxical Intoxication' induced by toxic concentrations of PHT, at least partially, can be mediated by hypo-monoaminergic function in the brain.
