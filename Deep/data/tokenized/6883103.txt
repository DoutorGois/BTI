Monkeys with bilateral removals of both the amygdaloid complex and hippocampal formation were far more severely impaired on a tactual memory task than were monkeys with removal of either structure alone. These data parallel earlier findings on visual memory in monkeys and suggest that: (i) the memory deficit following combined ablations of the amygdala and hippocampus is multimodal; and (ii) the global anterograde amnesia observed in patients with medial temporal-lobe damage is also due to combined damage to these two structures.
