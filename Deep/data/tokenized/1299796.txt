This study assessed the effects of MK-801 (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg), a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, on focal seizure activity elicited by electrical stimulation to the feline hippocampus. Neither afterdischarge duration nor behavioral seizure stage was significantly suppressed following intraperitoneal administration of MK-801 at two dose. Rather, MK-801 at a higher dose induced hippocampal seizure status in some of the cats tested. The present data suggest convulsant properties of MK-801 and limitations of its clinical utility as an antiepileptic agent.
