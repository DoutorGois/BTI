Impairments of cognitive functions in children and adolescents are often consequences ofperinatal pathology (natal injuries, ischemia, hypoxia, infection and allergic diseases), which are accompanied by enhanced production ofproinflammatory cytokine interleukine-1beta. In this work it was shown that treatment with interleukine-1beta during the third week of life impaired active and passive avoidance conditioning in adult rats at the age of 60-70 days.
