OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of recombination activating gene-1 (RAG-1) and its localization in the mouse brain during the embryonic development. METHODS: The brain tissues of E (embryonic day) 11, E13, E15, E17, E19, P0 (the birth day) and adult mice were taken, the total RNA of brains were extracted and the changes of RAG-1 expression were detected with the method of RT-PCR. The freeze sections of brain tissues from each group were stained with immunohistochemistry method. RESULT: The expression of RAG-1 persisted from E11 to P0 brain and was steadily increased from E11 to E19; the results of RT-PCR were similar to that of immunohistochemistry. The positive-cells mainly appeared in the nucleus amygdalae, hypothalamus, thalamus and hippocampus at developmental stage. The expression began to appear in ventricular zone (VZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) of telecephalic vesicle, then gradually increased in subventricular zone (SVZ), corticle plate (CP) and subcorticle plate (SP). CONCLUSION: The expression of RAG-1 in mouse embryonic brain tissue is higher than that in the adult mouse, which may be related to the process of neuron development.
