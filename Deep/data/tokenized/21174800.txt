AIM: To study the effect of fetus hypobaric hypoxia on the number and channel character of NMDA receptor of hippocampus neurons. METHODS: Use in situ hybridization and patch-clamp techniques. RESULTS: After hypobaric hypoxia the number of NMDA mRNA positive neurons was decreased, the open probability of NMDA receptor was reduced, the open time constant was decreased, the close time constant was increased. CONCLUSION: Hypobaric hypoxia may change the development of NMDA receptor in fetus rat, then maybe effect learning and memory.
