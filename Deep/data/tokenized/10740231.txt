Ageing is a multifactorial, inevitable event of life span, which affects neurotransmission in the CNS. Since adenosine is a major neuromodulator of the synaptic activity, it was of interest to investigate the possible modification of the adenosinergic system in the brain during ageing. Using "in vitro" quantitative autoradiography and the radioactive ligands [(3)H]Cyclohexyladenosine and [(3)H]Nitrobenzylthioinosine, we have studied the distribution of A1 adenosine receptors and adenosine uptake sites in the aged mice (26 months) compared to the young ones (3 months). Our results showed a widespread reduction in A1 receptor binding in the aged animals, which was brain area-specific, occurring in areas where adenosine plays a significant neuromodulatory role such as the hippocampus, cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Interestingly, the significant reduction in NBI-sensitive adenosine uptake sites was restricted to few areas of the aged brain, mainly in thalamic nuclei. Since the alterations in the density of A1 receptors and adenosine uptake sites showed no regional correlation and since no significant changes in either neuronal or glial cell number are observed, at least in hippocampus and cortex in this mouse strain during ageing, our findings could be explained by a selective age-dependent reduction of these adenosinergic components rather than by a general neuronal cell degeneration. As adenosine depresses electrical activity in hippocampus, a downregulation of adenosinergic function could probably be related to enhanced excitability seen in hippocampal neurons of the CA1 subregion and dentate gyrus of aged animals.
