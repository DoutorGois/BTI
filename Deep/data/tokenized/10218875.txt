The selective Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor 2-[2-[4-(4-nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea methanesulfonate (KB-R7943), significantly improves recovery of population spike amplitudes in rat hippocampal slices after hypoxia/hypoglycemia. Our data suggest that the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, operating in reverse mode, contributes to hypoxia/hypoglycemia-induced injury in CA1 neurons.
