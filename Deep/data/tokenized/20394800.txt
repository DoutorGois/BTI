Considering the fact that schizophrenia is a highly complex disorder of the human brain, different models are needed to test specific causative or mechanistic hypotheses. The pathogenesis of schizophrenia is also characterized by abnormal neuronal development. It was found that schizophrenia as well as antipsychotic treatment are accompanied by alterations in neuronal proliferation. Recently we reported on increased neurogenesis and their controllability by neuroleptics in a pharmacological (ketamine) model of schizophrenia. To complete our understanding, here we studied neurogenesis and its sensitivity to the classical neuroleptic haloperidol in a developmental model of schizophrenia (maternal vitamin D deficiency). It was found that maternal vitamin D deficiency resulted in decreased neurogenesis. This effect was ameliorated by subchronic treatment with haloperidol. Thus, the results complete previous findings concerning the ability of haloperidol to ameliorate behavioral abnormalities induced by prenatal vitamin D deficiency and introduce the possibility to explain the curative effects of haloperidol, at least in part, due to re-establishment of disturbed cell proliferation.
