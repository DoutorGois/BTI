The antiamnesic action of the new complex preparations cytoflavin and neuronol was studied in rats with a cerebral ischemia model, tested for the passive avoidance conditioned reflex. The neuroprotector effect of drugs was determined by morphological methods. Both cytoflavin and neuronol reduced neuronal damage in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus and prevented the development of amnesia during the entire period of cerebral ischemia (3-21 days). Both drugs also improved horizontal locomotor activity and emotional reactions of animals in the open field test.
