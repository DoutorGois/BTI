In the present study, the molecular mechanisms underlying kainate-induced neurotoxicity were characterized in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Long-term exposure to kainate caused typically apoptotic cell death, which was accompanied by the accumulation of calcium, marked down-regulation of GluR2 subunit, and the activation of calpain and caspase-3. All these alterations were prevented by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist CNQX, but not by NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 and membrane L-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine. In the presence of cyclothiazide, kainate-induced neurotoxicity was significantly enhanced. Inhibition of either caspases by zVAD-fmk or calpains by calpeptin protected neurons from neurotoxicity. These results suggest that long-term exposure of hippocampal neurons to kainate causes apoptosis, whose mechanisms involve multiple Ca(2+)-dependent cascades, in which AMPA receptor subunits may be targets for Ca(2+)-activated protease-mediated degradation during kainate-induced neuron apoptosis.
