Long-term potentiation of CA1 field potentials was induced by weak tetanic orthodromic stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers in isolated hippocampal slices perfused with a medium containing arginine vasopressin fragment AVP(4-9)in micromolar concentrations. It is hypothesized that AVP(4-9)affects induction of long-term potentiation at the intracellular level.
