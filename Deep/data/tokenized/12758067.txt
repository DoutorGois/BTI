We have investigated synaptic function in the hippocampus in mice of different ages carrying a null mutation in the PrP gene. Experiments carried out in vivo and in vitro in two laboratories revealed no differences in the ability of juvenile and young adult control and PrP-null mice to express long-term potentiation, paired-pulse facilitation, or posttetanic potentiation in either the dentate gyrus or in the CA1 region. However, we found a significant reduction in the level of posttetanic potentiation and long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of aged PrP-null mice. These results are discussed in relationship to reported increased levels of oxidative stress in older PrP-null mice.
