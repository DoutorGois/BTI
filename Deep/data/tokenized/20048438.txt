Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels have been divided into at least 5 types (L-, N-, T-, P-, and Q-type). L/N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker cilnidipine could reduce the size of cerebral infarction in the rat focal brain ischemia. L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker amlodipine reduced cerebral edema and inhibit neuronal cell death. N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker omega-conotoxin reduce the size of cerebral infarction and inhibit delayed neuronal cell death in hippocampal CA1 area. It is suggested that calcium antagonist has neuroprotective effect.
