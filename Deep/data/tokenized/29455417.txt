We previously reported that Yulangsan polysaccharide (YLSP), which was isolated from the root of Millettia pulchra Kurz, attenuates withdrawal symptoms of morphine dependence by regulating the nitric oxide pathway and modulating monoaminergic neurotransmitters. In this study, we investigated the effects and mechanism of YLSP on the reinstatement of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. A CPP procedure was employed to assess the behavior of rats, and indicators of serum and four brain regions (nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) were determined to explore its underlying mechanism. YLSP inhibited priming morphine-induced reinstatement of CPP in a dose-dependent manner. YLSP markedly reduced nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase levels in the brain. Moreover, YLSP significantly decreased the dopamine and norepinephrine levels in the serum and brain. Furthermore, YLSP significantly decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations, inhibited the expression of dopamine D1 receptors and cAMP response element binding protein mRNA, and improved the expression of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in the four brain regions. Our findings indicated that YLSP could inhibit the reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP possibly by modulating the NO-cGMP and D1R-cAMP signaling pathways.
