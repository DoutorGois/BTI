In rabbits and rats, sexual steroid hormones were shown to alter bioelectric activity mainly in the structures of the Nauta septo-hypothalamo-hippocampal circle and the amygdalar circle of the limbic system. The data obtained suggested participation of steroid hormones in the processes of self-regulation of the cerebral reticulo-hypothalamolimbic complex's functions by means of involving into the process of reverberations in the limbic system's circles.
