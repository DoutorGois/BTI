Although seizures are known to be harmful, recent evidence indicates that they can also lead to adaptations that protect neurons from further insult. For example, a history of two episodes of status epilepticus during a critical period of early development can prolong the time period of resistance to hippocampal injury during the postnatal period. Neonatal seizures may lead to this neuroprotection via a preconditioning mechanism that could be attributed to attenuation of Ca(2+) currents, reduction of inflammation, and induction of survival signaling pathways. Understanding mechanisms underlying neuroprotective preconditioning may elucidate new therapeutic targets and improve outcomes and quality of life for pediatric epilepsy patients. This review will detail the specific cellular and molecular findings involved in neuronal preconditioning predisposed by early-life seizures.
