The transcription factor KROX-20, unlike many other immediate early genes, is not expressed in the rat hippocampus after bicuculline induced generalized seizures. Since limbic seizures are a more injurious stimulus, the KROX-20 expression profile was investigated in adult rats subjected to kainic acid induced limbic epilepsy at postictal intervals up to 48 h. Immunocytochemistry was performed using a specific polyclonal antiserum. In the hippocampus a sequential induction was observed with peak levels attained in dentate gyrus at 3 h, in CA1 at 8 h and in CA3 between 8 and 24 h, respectively. In contrast, no KROX-20 induction was found in hilus neurons. Prominent neuronal KROX-20 induction was also detected in other areas of the limbic system, in particular in amygdala and piriform cortex, as well as non-limbic regions such as neocortex and striatum. As is the case with KROX-20, heat shock protein (HSP) 70, a reliable marker for reversible neuronal injury, has a high induction threshold. Though not inducible in the hippocampus by generalized seizures, it is expressed after limbic epilepsy. Therefore, co-expression of KROX-20 and HSP70 was studied by a double labeling technique using a monoclonal antibody directed against the inducible form of HSP70. Neuronal subpopulations with perfect co-expression such as hippocampal CA1 neurons contrasted with others demonstrating partial co-induction (cortical neurons) or lack of co-expression (hilus cells), indicating that different stimuli trigger the activation of these two inducible genes.
