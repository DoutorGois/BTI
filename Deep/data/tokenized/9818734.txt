Changes in the mesial temporal lobe, particularly in the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, are reported to occur in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Neuroimaging provides a non-invasive means of studying these changes. We present a method for reliably measuring the hippocampus, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex on MRI. The advantages of our method include high reliability, the use of orthogonal views in delineating boundaries and circumscription of measurement such that no tissue of any one anatomic structure is included in the measurement of another structure.
