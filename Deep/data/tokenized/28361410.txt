Application of anxiolytic drug Selank to hippocampal slices increased the amplitude and discharge rate of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in rat hippocampal pyramidal CA1 neurons. In some neurons, Selank-induced up-regulation of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents was preceded by a transient decrease in this activity. In the examined concentration range (1-8 muM), Selank demonstrated no significant dose-dependence.
