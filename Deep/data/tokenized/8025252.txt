Immunocytochemical localization of tryptamine in rat brain was performed at light and electron microscope level. The immunoreactive cells were present in the mesencephalon, pons and medulla, around the interpendicular nucleus in the reticular substantia nigra and in the giganto cellularis ventralis nucleus. Immunoreactive fibres were present in the dorsal region of the brain stem, and innervated the hippocampus, the ependymal epithelium and the corpus striatum. An ultrastructural study revealed that tryptamine was present only in neuronal perikaryon and processes.
