Progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2) modulate neurogenesis and synaptic remodeling in the hippocampus during the rat estrous cycle and in response to deafferenting lesions, but little is known about the steroidal regulation of hippocampal progesterone receptors associated with these processes. We examined the neuronal expression of progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (Pgrmc1) and the classical progesterone receptor (Pgr), by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Pgr, a transcription factor, has been associated with synaptic remodeling and other major actions of P4, whereas Pgrmc1 is implicated in P4-dependent proliferation of adult neuroprogenitor cells and with rapid P4 effects on membranes. Ovariectomized adult rats were given E2, P4, or E2+P4 on two schedules: a 4-d model of the rodent estrous cycle and a 30-d model of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Pgr was hormonally responsive only in CA1 pyramidal neurons, and the induction of Pgr by E2 was partly antagonized by P4 only on the 30-d schedule. In CA3 pyramidal and dentate gyrus (DG) neurons, Pgr was largely unresponsive to all hormone treatments. In contrast to Pgr, Pgrmc1 was generally induced by E2 and/or P4 throughout the hippocampus in CA1, CA3, and DG neurons. In neuroprogenitor cells of the DG (immunopositive for bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin), both Pgrmc1 and Pgr were detected. The differential regulation of hippocampal Pgrmc1 and Pgr by E2 and P4 may guide drug development in hormonal therapy for support of neurogenesis and synaptic regeneration.
