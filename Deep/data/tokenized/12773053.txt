We have recently discovered a novel class of compounds that have oral general anesthetic activity, potent anticonvulsant activity, and minimal hemodynamic effects. The 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-propionamide (1) demonstrated potent ability to reduce the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane, with no effects on heart rate or blood pressure at therapeutic concentrations. Analogue 1 also had potent oral anticonvulsant activity against maximal electroshock (MES) and subcutaneous metrazol (scMET) models with a therapeutic index of 10 for MES activity. In this study, we further synthesized nine new racemic analogues and evaluated these compounds for effects on isoflurane MAC reduction and blood pressure. Preliminary data demonstrate potent reduction in the isoflurane MAC for two new compounds. Current mechanistic studies were unrevealing for effects on voltage-gated ion channels as a putative mechanism. Liposomal partitioning studies using (19)F NMR reveal that the aromatic region partitions into the core of the lipid. This partitioning correlated with general anesthetic activity of this class of compounds. Further, compound 1 was used at a concentration of 1 mM and slightly enhanced GABA(A) current in hippocampal neurons at 10 microM. Altogether, 3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-phenyl-propionamide exhibited excellent oral general anesthetic activity and appears devoid of significant side effects (i.e., alterations in blood pressure or heart rate).
