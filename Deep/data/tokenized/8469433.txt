The effects of high-dose ketamine on the c-fos protein (c-Fos) expression were investigated in rat by an immunohistochemical technique. The administration of 100 mg/kg ketamine i.p. induced seizure-like activity (limbic seizure). No c-Fos immunoreactivity was observed in hippocampus, piriform cortex and amygdala, while it was observed in neocortex and thalamus. These findings disagree with the reports that ketamine depresses the neuronal function of the neocortex and thalamus, while it stimulates the limbic system.
