Hippocalcin, which is a member of the neuronal calcium-sensor protein family, is highly expressed in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Recently, it was demonstrated that hippocalcin deficit caused an increase in neuronal cell death in the field CA3 of Ammon's horn (CA3) region of the hippocampus following the systemic injection of kainic acid. Treatment with kainic acid results in seizure-induced cell death in CA3. In the present study, we injected quinolinic acid, which is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist, into the hippocampal field CA1 of Ammon's horn (CA1) region in hippocalcin-knockout (-/-) mice, a procedure which mimics transient ischemia. Although significant pyknotic changes were observed at the injected site in wild-type (+/+) mice 24 h after injection, the area of pyknotic cells extended throughout the hippocampus in -/- mice. The quantification of cell numbers in Nissl-stained sections indicated that the cell damage in -/- mice was more severe than that in +/+ mice. The density of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick-end labeling-positive cells roughly paralleled that of Nissl-stained pyknotic cells. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons showed that the number of surviving neurons from -/- mice after 7 days in culture was smaller than the number from +/+ mice. The measurement of intracellular calcium concentrations in single cells revealed that the calcium extrusion from -/- neurons was slower than that from +/+ neurons. The involvement of hippocalcin in the upkeep of calcium extrusion was confirmed using hippocalcin-expressing COS7 cells. These results suggest that hippocalcin plays an important role in calcium extrusion from neurons and, in turn, helps to protect them against calcium-dependent excitotoxin damage in the hippocampus.
