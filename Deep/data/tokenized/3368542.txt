Motivational-emotional mechanisms were analyzed both by behavioral and electrophysiological methods. Rats were required to run along a straight runway alley (200 cm long) from a small, illuminated "starting plate" on one end to a dimly lit box on the other. The animal was hand-carried from the box to the starting plate and then it returned to the box without any additional reinforcement. Such locomotor reaction was acquired very quickly and could subsequently be evoked over several months. The behavioral effects of isolated changes in the experimental design were tested. The typical picture of the hippocampal RSA, during such motivational reactions was recorded.
