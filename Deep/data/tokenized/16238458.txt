Brain infections as well as peripheral challenges to the immune system lead to an increased production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), a cytokine involved in leukocyte-mediated breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. The effects of IL-1beta have been reported to depend on whether the route of administration is systemic or intracerebral. Using 50-day-old male rats, we compared the effects of IL-1beta on brain gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT; an enzymatic marker of brain capillary endothelium) at 2, 24 and 96 h after either an intravenous (i.v.) injection of 5 microg IL-1beta or an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v. - lateral ventricle) infusion of 50 ng IL-1beta. When the i.v. route was used, the GGT activity underwent small but significant changes; decreasing in the hippocampus 2 h after the i.v. injection, increasing 24 h later and returning to control levels at 96 h. No significant changes in the hippocampal GGT activity were observed at 2 and 24 h following the i.c.v. infusion. The GGT activity in the hypothalamus remained unchanged regardless of the route of IL-1beta administrations. Similar changes in GGT activity were revealed histochemically. The labeling was found mainly in the capillary bed, the changes being most evident in the hippocampal stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum-moleculare. A transient increase in GGT activity at 24 h, together with a less sharp delineation of GGT-stained vessels, may reflect IL-1beta induced increased turnover of glutathione and/or oxidative stress, that may in turn, be related to altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier in some neurological and mental disorders, including schizophrenia.
