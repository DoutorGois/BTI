The neural circuit of the dorsal hippocampus (dHip) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) contributes to cue-induced learning and addictive behaviors, as demonstrated by the escalation of ethanol-seeking behaviors observed following deletion of the adenosine equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1(-/-)) in mice. Here we perform quantitative LC-MS/MS neuroproteomics in the dHip and NAc of ENT1(-/-) mice. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, we identified proteins associated with increased long-term potentiation, ARP2/3-mediated actin cytoskeleton signaling and protein expression patterns suggesting deficits in glutamate degradation, GABAergic signaling, as well as significant changes in bioenergetics and energy homeostasis (oxidative phosphorylation, TCA cycle, and glycolysis). These pathways are consistent with previously reported behavioral and biochemical phenotypes that typify mice lacking ENT1. Moreover, we validated decreased expression of the SNARE complex protein VAMP1 (synaptobrevin-1) in the dHip as well as decreased expression of pro-dynorphin (PDYN), neuroendocrine convertase (PCSK1), and Leu-Enkephalin (dynorphin-A) in the NAc. Taken together, our proteomic approach provides novel pathways indicating that ENT1-regulated signaling is essential for neurotransmitter release and neuropeptide processing, both of which underlie learning and reward-seeking behaviors.
