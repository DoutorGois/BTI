An epileptic seizure is regularly followed by a postictal depression and then by a phase of increased excitability. The time course of these two phases was described for two types of epileptic after-discharges induced by stimulation of the hippocampus and/or the thalamus in acute experiments in rats. Using hippocampal stimulation, an interval of 10 min was necessary for induction of the second self-sustained after-discharge (SSAD) of the same duration as the first one. Significant prolongation of the second SSAD appeared with a 30-min interstimulation interval. The spike-and-wave rhythm induced by stimulation of thalamic nuclei exhibited a shorter refractory phase - up to 5 min - and also the facilitation took place sooner: with 15-min intervals a significant increase in duration of SSAD was recovered. The results are discussed in connection with the kindling model of epilepsy.
