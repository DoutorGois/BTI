Inhaled anesthetics are believed to produce anesthesia by their actions on ion channels. Because inhaled anesthetics robustly enhance GABA A receptor (GABA(A)-R) responses to GABA, these receptors are considered prime targets of anesthetic action. However, the importance of GABA(A)-Rs and individual GABA(A)-R subunits to specific anesthetic-induced behavioral effects in the intact animal is unknown. We hypothesized that inhaled anesthetics produce amnesia, as assessed by loss of fear conditioning, by acting on the forebrain GABA(A)-Rs that harbor the alpha1 subunit. To test this, we used global knockout mice that completely lack the alpha1 subunit and forebrain-specific, conditional knockout mice that lack the alpha1 subunit only in the hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala. Both knockout mice were 75 to 145% less sensitive to the amnestic effects of the inhaled anesthetic isoflurane. These results indicate that alpha1-containing GABA(A)-Rs in the hippocampus, amygdala, and/or cortex influence the amnestic effects of inhaled anesthetics and may be an important molecular target of the drug isoflurane.
