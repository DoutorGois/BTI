Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are essential enzymes involved in the cellular defense against oxidative processes occurring with the generation of the superoxide anion. In this work, we have investigated in the rat the effects of a subchronic administration of liposomal SOD from bovine erythrocytes, on benzodiazepine (BZD) 'central-type' receptor sites in cortex and hippocampus. Animals were treated for 15 days with an i.p. injection of liposomal SOD, and binding parameters were determined using [3H]flunitrazepam. BZD receptor affinity was found decreased, while no change was observed in the maximal binding capacity. With regard to previously reported data, our results show that the superoxide anion radical is involved in the modulation and/or the stability of 'central-type' BZD receptor sites.
