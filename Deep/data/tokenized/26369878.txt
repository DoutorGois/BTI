Increased dietary consumption of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with decreased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). These effects have been postulated to arise from DHA's pleiotropic effects on AD pathophysiology, including its effects on beta-amyloid (Abeta) production, aggregation, and toxicity. While in vitro studies suggest that DHA may inhibit and reverse the formation of toxic Abeta oligomers, it remains uncertain whether these mechanisms operate in vivo at the physiological concentrations of DHA attainable through dietary supplementation. We sought to clarify the effects of dietary DHA supplementation on Abeta indices in a transgenic APP/PS1 rat model of AD. Animals maintained on a DHA-supplemented diet exhibited reductions in hippocampal Abeta plaque density and modest improvements on behavioral testing relative to those maintained on a DHA-depleted diet. However, DHA supplementation also increased overall soluble Abeta oligomer levels in the hippocampus. Further quantification of specific conformational populations of Abeta oligomers indicated that DHA supplementation increased fibrillar (i.e. putatively less toxic) Abeta oligomers and decreased prefibrillar (i.e. putatively more toxic) Abeta oligomers. These results provide in vivo evidence suggesting that DHA can modulate Abeta aggregation by stabilizing soluble fibrillar Abeta oligomers and thus reduce the formation of both Abeta plaques and prefibrillar Abeta oligomers. However, since fibrillar Abeta oligomers still retain inherent neurotoxicity, DHA may need to be combined with other interventions that can additionally reduce fibrillar Abeta oligomer levels for more effective prevention of AD in clinical settings.
