The incorporation of 3H-leucine into the neuronal proteins and cytochemistry of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein levels in pyramidal neurons in layer III, V of the sensomotor cortex and hippocampus of the brain were studied in rats which were exposed to chronic ethanol consumption at different stages of "the abolish syndrome". There were significant heterogeneous changes of the neuronal protein metabolism at all studied structures in the experimental group as compared to control group. It was shown that after abolishment of ethanol consumption the neuronal protein synthesis decreased and content of protein increased in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons. After 12 h there was elevated synthetic activity of protein system and tendency to reduction of content of protein in the nucleus. After 24 h reduction of synthetic activity and tendency to normalization of the content of the neuronal protein were found. The functional importance of the results obtained is discussed.
