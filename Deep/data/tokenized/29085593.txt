OBJECTIVES: Development of the nervous system in human and most animals is continued after the birth. Critical role of this period in generation and specialization of the neuronal circuits is confirmed in numerous studies. Any pharmacological intervention in this period may result in structural, functional or behavioral abnormalities. In this study, sodium thiopental a GABA mimetic drug was administrated to newborn rats and their GAD65 and GAD67 expression in hippocampus was evaluated before and after puberty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Newborn male Wistar rats were received sodium thiopental (35 mg/kg) daily for 11 days (from 4 to 14 days after birth). Expression of GAD65 and GAD67 in their hippocampus was compared with control groups in 15 and 45 days after birth with RT-qPCR method. RESULTS: Significant down regulation of GAD65 and GAD67 gene expression was observed in treated rats compared with control group in 45 days after birth animals. But no significant difference was shown between experimental and control groups 15 days after birth animals. CONCLUSION: The effect of sodium thiopental on GAD65 and GAD67 expression only at adult rats showed a latent period of influence which can be attributed to dosage or intension of sodium thiopental neurotoxicity. Significant down regulation of GAD65 and GAD67 showed unwanted effect of sodium thiopental as GABA mimetic drug in critical period of development.
