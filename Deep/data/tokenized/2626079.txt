The chemical structure of AMG-1 was isolated during our search for an effective compound to overcome the untoward effects of complete ischemia. The duration of gasping was prolonged significantly and dose-dependently in mice by the administration of AMG-1, the efficacy being 1000 times that seen with adenosine. However, AMG-1 had no effect on ischemia-induced passive avoidance impairment and histopathological degradation in CAl neurons in the hippocampus. The relationship between adenosine and its analogue and cerebral ischemia is discussed.
