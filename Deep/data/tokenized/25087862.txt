OBJECTIVE: Learning and memory deficits are a source of considerable morbidity after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We investigated the effect of different patterns of hippocampal stimulation via a fornix electrode on cognitively demanding tasks after TBI. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent fluid-percussion injury and were compared with sham-operated rats. Electrodes were implanted into the fornix and hippocampus, and stimulation of the fornix produced robust evoked potentials in the hippocampus. A 60-s delayed non-match-to-sample (DNMS) swim T-maze was serially performed using four stimulation patterns: no stimulation (No Stim), low-frequency stimulation (LFS, 5 Hz), high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 130 Hz), and theta-burst stimulation (TBS, 200 Hz in 50 ms trains, five trains per second; 60 microA biphasic pulses). In a separate cohort of sham and injured animals, Morris water maze (MWM) was performed with or without TBS. RESULTS: In the DNMS swim T-maze, LFS and HFS did not significantly improve performance after TBI. However, there was a significant difference in performance between TBI + No Stim and TBI + TBS groups (P < 0.05) with no significant difference between Sham + No Stim and TBI + TBS. In the MWM, latency in the TBI + TBS group was significantly different from TBI + No Stim starting on day 2 (P < 0.05) and was not different from Sham + No Stim. The TBI + TBS group performed significantly more platform crossings in the probe trial (P < 0.01) and exhibited improved search strategy starting on day 3 (P < 0.05) compared with TBI + No Stim. CONCLUSIONS: Deficits in learning and memory after TBI are improved with TBS of the hippocampus. HFS and LFS do not appear to produce as great an effect as TBS.
