The incorporation of 3H-leucine into the neuronal proteins of the hemispherical cortex and hyppocampus was studied in rats aged 1 and 3 months which were exposed to hypoxia and ethanol in the antenatal period. The test one-month-old animals showed activation of protein synthesis in neurons and in layers III and V of the cortex and hyppocampus. At the age of 3 months the rats showed inhibited incorporation of the label into neuronal proteins of the studied structures of the brain which was more expressed in animals which had suffered intrauterine hypoxia.
