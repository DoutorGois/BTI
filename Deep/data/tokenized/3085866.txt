The localization of adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system was studied in two physiological conditions of noradrenergic denervation, a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of the locus coeruleus in newborn rat, and a pathological related degeneration of the locus coeruleus in man, Parkinson's disease. The localization of these receptors in the synapse has been studied with the technique of subcellular fractionation by differential centrifugation. In lesioned rats, an increase in the density of alpha 1 and beta 1 receptors was observed in several brain regions, in contrast to alpha 2 receptors which were not modified. Subcellular fractionation in lesioned rats showed an increase in alpha 1 and beta 1 receptors in synaptosomal fractions. Similar results were found in parkinsonian patients: alpha 1 receptors increased in the synaptosomal fraction; beta receptors increased in synaptosomal and microsomal fractions. These results suggest that alpha 1 and beta 1 receptors may be located on non-noradrenergic nerve terminals in mammalian brain. alpha 2 and beta 2 receptors may be situated on glial cells or neuronal elements unrelated to noradrenergic input.
