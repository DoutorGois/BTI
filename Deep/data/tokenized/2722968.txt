Previously using PKC isozyme-specific antibodies for immunoblot analysis, we demonstrated the heterogeneous distribution of PKC isozymes in various regions of monkey and rat brains and that type I PKC was most abundant in cerebellum, hippocampus, amygdala, and cerebral cortex (Huang et al.: J Biol Chem 262:15714-15720, 1987). Using these antibodies, we have also demonstrated that type I, II, and III PKC are products of PKC genes gamma, beta, and alpha, respectively (Huang et al.: Biochem Biophys Res Commun 149:946-952, 1987). By immunocytochemical analysis, type I PKC-specific antibody showed strong reactivity in various types of neuron in hippocampal formation, amygdala, cerebellum, and neocortex. In hippocampal formation, granule cells of dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of hippocampus were heavily stained. By immunoblot analysis, relative levels of PKC isozymes in several areas of monkey cerebral cortex involved in the visual information processing and storage were determined. Both type II and III PKCs appeared to be evenly distributed and at moderate levels, type I PKC formed a gradient of increasing concentration rostral along the cerebral cortex of occipital to temporal and then to the limbic areas. Neurobehavioral studies have demonstrated that the neocortical and limbic areas of the anterior and medial temporal regions participate more directly than the striate, prestriate, and posterior temporal regions in the storage of visual representations and that both hippocampus and amygdala are important in the memory formation. As type I PKC is present at high levels in hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior temporal lobe, we predict that the type I protein kinase C may participate in the plastic changes important for mnemonic function.
