Cystatins are endogenous cysteine protease inhibitors that modulate the turnover of intracellular and extracellular proteins. These inhibitors are strongly implicated in a variety of pathological processes such as tumor metastasis and many degenerating CNS disorders. Here we report the expression of cystatin C, a major cysteine protease inhibitor of mammalian animals, in the murine hippocampus at 3, 7, 15 and 30 days following perforant path transections. Northern blot analysis showed that cystatin C transcripts were up-regulated in a transient manner with a significant increase at 7 and 15 days post-lesion (219% and 185% of control, respectively) in the rat hippocampus after entorhinal deafferentation. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed the time-dependent up-regulation of both cystatin C mRNA and protein expressions in a mouse model which initiated at 3 days post-lesion, reached maximal levels 7-15 days post-lesion, and remained slightly elevated by day 30 post-lesion. The modulation of cystatin C expression was observed to occur specifically in the entorhinally denervated zones: the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus and the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Double labeling by either a combination of in situ hybridization for cystatin C with immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein or double immunofluorescence staining for both proteins in mouse hippocampus at 7 and 15 days post-lesion revealed that most cystatin C-expressing cells are astrocytes. From these results we suggest that the spatiotemporal up-regulation of cystatin C in the hippocampus is induced by entorhinal deafferentation and that cystatin C may be involved in the astroglia-mediated neural plasticity events in the hippocampus following perforant path transections.
