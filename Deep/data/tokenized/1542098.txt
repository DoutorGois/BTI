A series of phenothiazines was synthesized and evaluated as in vitro inhibitors of iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. The MIC (minimum tested concentration that gave greater than or equal to 50% inhibition) for 2-(10H-phenothiazin-2-yloxy)-N,N-dimethylethanolamine methanesulfonate (6) was 0.26 microM. Whereas methyl substitution at N-10 diminished activity nearly 100-fold, other structural modifications such as varying the amine group, the distance separating the amine substituent from the phenothiazine nucleus, and the linking group had little effect. Compound 6 was more effective than probucol, a known antioxidant, in blocking Cu2+ catalyzed oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as measured by competitive scavenger receptor mediated degradation of 125I-labeled acetyl-LDL by mouse peritoneal macrophage cells in vitro. At a concentration of 5 microM, compound 6 also protected primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons exposed to hydrogen peroxide (50 microM) when assessed 18 h later by fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide uptake.
