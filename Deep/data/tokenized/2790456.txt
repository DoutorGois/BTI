Previous findings suggest: (1) that altering protein kinase C (PKC) activity alters the persistence of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the intact hippocampal formation; and (2) that PKC activity is directly correlated with persistence of LTP in vivo as measured by the in vitro phosphorylation of two major PKC substrates in adult hippocampus, protein F1 and 80k. Using quantitative analysis of two-dimensional gels, we report here two additional phosphoproteins of 72 and 55 kDa which were directly correlated to persistence of LTP induced in the intact dorsal hippocampal formation. The phosphorylation of both proteins in response to addition of different kinase stimulators was distinct from that of protein F1 and 80k. Moreover, neither protein was a substrate for exogenous PKC. The physicochemical properties of these phosphoproteins suggest they are identical to the previously described synaptic vesicle proteins IIIa and IIIb, and as such are immunologically indistinguishable. Because proteins IIIa and IIIb are known to be phosphorylated by a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-stimulated kinase, and protein F1 is known to be a plasma membrane-associated protein (P-57) which releases bound CaM in response to phosphorylation by PKC, the present findings suggest a potential mechanism in which PKC-mediated changes in plasma membrane proteins produce CaM kinase-mediated changes in synaptic vesicle proteins through a phosphorylation cascade. These membrane/vesicle alterations are postulated to underlie the increased synaptic efficacy which marks persistent LTP.
