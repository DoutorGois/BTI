Spontaneous changes of respiratory rate and blood pressure in the slightly anesthetized rabbit, contemporaneous with hippocampal synchronization, might be related with abrupt changes of the alertness. Registration of arousal reaction in hippocampal, thalamic and cortical leads, elicited by Hering nerve stimulation, shows that baro- and chemosensitive afferences may induce activation of areas which are usually involved in conditioning process.
