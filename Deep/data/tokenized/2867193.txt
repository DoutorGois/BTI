beta-Kainic acid has been reported to have anticonvulsant properties. In view of its structural relationship to alpha-kainic acid it has therefore been tested for antagonist activity at excitatory receptors for N-methylaspartate, quisqualate and alpha-kainate using anaesthetized rats and brain slice preparations. No antagonism was found against these three agonists though beta-kainate itself caused excitation. If beta-kainate interferes with excitatory amino acid neurotransmission it probably acts presynaptically.
