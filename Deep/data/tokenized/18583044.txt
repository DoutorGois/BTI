Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase that have been recently recognized as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective drugs. Herein, we investigated anti-excitotoxic and anti-seizure effects of statins by using kainic acid (KA)-rat seizure model, an animal model for temporal lobe epilepsy and excitotoxic neurodegeneration. We observed that pre-treatment with Lipitor (atorvastatin) efficiently reduced KA-induced seizure activities, hippocampal neuron death, monocyte infiltration and proinflammatory gene expression. In addition, we also observed that lovastatin treatment attenuated KA- or glutamate-induced excitotoxicity of cultured hippocampal neurons. These observations suggest a potential for use of statin treatment in modulation of seizures and other neurological diseases associated with excitotoxicity.
