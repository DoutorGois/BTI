Demonstrating consistently reliable levels of expression is a critical part of any gene transfer study in order to assess variability and determine effective gene dosages. This article highlights some of the key methods for studying the expression levels of green fluorescent protein and neurotrophic factors after injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors into the brain. The data demonstrate greater spread and higher levels of expression using the cytomegalovirus/chicken beta-actin (CBA) promoter coupled with the woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE), compared to earlier AAV serotype 2 vectors. Injections of either CBA-nerve growth factor (NGF)-WPRE or CBA-glial cell line-derived neutrotrophic factor-WPRE AAV vectors into the nucleus basalis of the basal forebrain led to clear and consistent elevation of the respective trophic factor as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with NGF vectors affecting the size and number of cholinergic neurons. AAV serotype may also be important for the spread of expression, since injecting an AAV-5 vector into the hippocampus led to higher-frequency transfection of dentate gyrus granule neurons, suggesting altered tropism relative to AAV-2.
