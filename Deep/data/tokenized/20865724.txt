Although it is generally agreed that Abeta contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, its precise role in AD and the reason for the varying intensity and time of onset of the disease have not been elucidated. In addition to genetic factors, environmental issues such as stress may also play a critical role in the etiology of AD. This study examined the effect of chronic psychosocial stress in an at-risk (treatment with a subpathogenic dose of Abeta; "subAbeta") rat model of AD on long-term memory by three techniques: memory tests in the radial arm water maze, electrophysiological recordings of synaptic plasticity in anesthetized rats, and immunoblot analysis of learning- and long-term memory-related signaling molecules. Chronic psychosocial stress was induced using a rat intruder model. The subAbeta rat model of AD was induced by continuous infusion of 160 pmol/day Abeta(1-42) via a 14-day i.c.v. osmotic pump. All tests showed that subAbeta rats were not different from control rats. Result from behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings showed that infusion of subAbeta in chronically stressed rats (stress/subAbeta group) caused significant impairment of cognitive functions and late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Molecular analysis of various signaling molecules after expression of L-LTP, revealed an increase in the levels of p-CREB in control, stress, and subAbeta rats, but not in the stress/subAbeta rats. These findings suggest that the chronic stress-induced molecular alteration may accelerate the impairment of cognition and synaptic plasticity in individuals "at-risk" for AD.
