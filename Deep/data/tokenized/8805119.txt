We examined the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in ischemic brain damage using hippocampal slices prepared from 30 day old albino rats and exposed to 20 min of oxygen/glucose deprivation (ischemia) followed by 90 min postincubation in oxygen- and glucose-containing media. Damage in the CA1 region was rated on a 0 (intact) to 4 (severe neuronal damage) scale by a rater blind to the experimental condition. Control slices exposed to ischemia were rated as 2.8 +/- 0.4 (N = 12). L-NG-Monomethylarginine (100 microM) and L-NG-nitroarginine (100 microM), non-selective NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors, diminished ischemic damage (0.6 +/- 0.3, N = 8, and 1.0 +/- 0.5, N = 4, respectively). An inhibitor of brain NOS, 7-nitroindazole (30 microM), was also effective against ischemic degeneration (0.7 +/- 0.3, N = 5). These results suggest that activation of NOS is involved in ischemic degeneration in the CA1 region.
