In rats, the inhibition of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) in hippocampus was reported to impair memory acquisition. In the present study we investigated in rats whether PLA(2) inhibition in hippocampus is also related to impairment of memory retrieval. Rats were bilaterally implanted with cannulae in hippocampal CA1 region. After recovery, animals were submitted to one-trial step-down inhibitory avoidance task and tested for long-term memory (LTM) 24 h later. Before test session, animals received infusions of vehicle or the PLA(2) inhibitor PACOCF(3). Inhibition of PLA(2) activity impaired LTM retrieval. Memory impairment was fully reversed once PLA(2) activity was recovered. Moreover, LTM retrieval per se increased PLA(2) activity. To our knowledge, we demonstrated for the first time that PLA(2) activity is required for memory retrieval. Because reduced PLA(2) activity has been found in Alzheimer's disease brains, the present results may be relevant to clarify at least part of the biology of this disorder.
