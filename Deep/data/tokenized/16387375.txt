Neural plasticity of modality-nonspecific and modality-specific memory and learning abilities pertains to fluid intelligence and crystallized intelligence, respectively. The limbic system with the novelty neurons of the hippocampus interacts with the prefrontal cortex optimization of the orienting reflex and voluntary attention. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor produced by novelty neurons of the hippocampus contributes to long-term memory formation and improves learning abilities in a wide range of disciplines. Synergistic combination of stimulation with "analytical-specific visual perceptual patterns" and "optimally high" physiological activation of the bilateral electrodermal system optimizes the limbic system and prefrontal cortex activity as demonstrated by enhanced prefrontal N450 ERPs to a memory workload paradigm. This is accompanied by improvements in auditory retention tasks, word memorization, higher school achievement and marks, and an amelioration of "analytical-specific perceptual skills" as measured by the Mangina-Test. Intracerebral ERPs to a memory workload paradigm contributed to the elucidation of limbic structures and neocortical sites involved in memory workload processes. The progressive degeneration of these same structures causes the gradual decline of memory functions observed in early Alzheimer's disease. Research findings indicate that ERPs elicited by a memory workload paradigm are sensitive markers for diagnosis, treatment and clinical follow-up of early Alzheimer's patients. In addition, ERPs provide objective measurement of cholinergic medication effects on cerebral functions involved in memory processes through neuropsychophysiological parameters.
