Ghrelin is a novel brain-gut peptide and the endogenous ligand of growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a). Evidences have been shown that ghrelin inhibited cell apoptosis in cardiocytes, endotheliocytes, osteoblasts, and so on. Recently, it was reported that ghrelin inhibited neuronal apoptosis of hypothalamus and hippocampus. However, little is known about the effects of ghrelin on cortical neurons during focal ischemia/reperfusion injury. In the present study, we showed that ghrelin (i.v.) prevented cortical neurons from injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion in vivo and by LPS, glutamate, NMDA and H(2)O(2) in vitro. We found that the expression of ghrelin's receptor (GHSR-1a) in rat cerebral cortex were obviously decreased by ischemia/reperfusion injury and increased by ghrelin (i.v.). Ghrelin up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2/Bax and HSP70, and inhibited caspase8, 9, 3 through GHSR-1a, which was contributed to the neuroprotective mechanism of ghrelin. Ghrelin might be an important regulator in therapeutic strategy of cortex injury.
