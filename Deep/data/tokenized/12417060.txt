Animal models used to study human aging and neurodegeneration do not display all symptoms of these processes as they are found in humans. Recently, we have shown that many cells in neocortical slices from adult human postmortem brain may survive for extensive periods in vitro. Such cultures may enable us to study age and disease related processes directly in human brain tissue. Here, we present observations on subcortical brain tissue.
