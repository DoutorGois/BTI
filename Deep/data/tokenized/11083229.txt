In the current study, the temporal and regional changes of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) were investigated in rat brains subjected to 30 minutes of hypoglycemic coma followed by varied periods of recovery using Western blot and confocal microscopy. The total amount of CREB was not altered in any area examined after coma. The level of the phosphorylated form of CREB decreased during coma but rebounded after recovery. In the relatively resistant areas, such as the inner layers of the neocortex and the inner and outer blades of the dentate gyms (DG), phospho-CREB increased greater than the control level after 30 minutes of recovery and continued to increase up to 3 hours of recovery. In contrast, little or no increase of phospho-CREB was observed during the recovery period in the outer layers of the neocortex and at the tip of the DG, that is, regions that are selectively vulnerable to hypoglycemic insults. The current findings suggest that a neuroprotective signaling pathway may be more activated in the resistant regions than in the vulnerable ones after hypoglycemic coma.
