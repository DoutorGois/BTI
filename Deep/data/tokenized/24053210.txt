Athletes who sustain a concussion demonstrate a variety of symptoms and neuropsychological alterations that could be brought on by neurometabolic abnormalities. However, no study has yet investigated these aspects in female athletes using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The present study investigated the neurometabolic and -psychological effects of a concussion in the acute (7-10 days postinjury) and chronic (6 months postinjury) phases after injury. Eleven female concussed athletes and 10 female control athletes were scanned at both time points in a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Neuropsychological and symptomatic evaluations were completed at each time point. Neuropsychological alterations and a higher severity of symptoms were found in the acute phase in concussed athletes, relative to controls, but showed recovery in the chronic phase. Concussed athletes showed neurometabolic impairment in prefrontal and motor cortices characterized by a pathological increase of glutamine/glutamate and creatine (Cr) only in the chronic phase. Also, a significant decrease in N-acetyl-aspartate/Cr ratio was observed in control athletes at the second time point. Concussed female athletes showed acute cognitive alterations and higher severity of symptoms that do not appear to be underlied by neurometabolic abnormalities, which are only present in the chronic postinjury phase.
