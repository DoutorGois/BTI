ADAM metalloprotease-disintegrins mediate cell adhesion, proteolytic processing, and signal transduction. In the present study, the mRNA levels of ADAM9, ADAM10, and ADAM15 were examined in rat brain after kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus. ADAM9 and ADAM10 expression was induced in dentate gyrus of hippocampus. ADAM15 expression remained unchanged. The spatiotemporal expression of ADAM9 and ADAM10 suggests that their regulation after the KA-induced status epilepticus could be related to neuroprotection.
