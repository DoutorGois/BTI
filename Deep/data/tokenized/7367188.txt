Effects of bilateral hippocampal lesions were investigated in a newly developed discriminated rearing-avoidance task. A significant facilitation of avoidance conditioning was found in rats with hippocampal lesions. The over-all escape topography of the hippocampal-lesioned rats was mostly jumping whereas that of the controls was rearing. These findings suggest that the hippocampal lesion increases reactivity to shock.
