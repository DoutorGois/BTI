GLUT8 is a class III sugar transporter predominantly expressed in testis and brain. In contrast to the class I and class II transporters, hydrophobicity plots predict a short extracellular loop between transmembrane domain (TM)1 and TM2 and a long extracellular loop between TM9 and TM10 that contains the only N-glycosylation site. In vitro translated GLUT8 migrates as a 35-kDa protein that is glycosylated in the presence of microsomal membranes. In heterologous expression systems, glucose transport activity (Km of 2 mM) was inhibited by fructose and galactose. The transporter carries an NH2-terminal endosomal/lysosomal targeting motif ([DE]XXXL[LI]). Accordingly, constitutive GLUT8 has been found to be associated with endosomes and lysosomes but also with membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. A similar distribution was detected after overexpression of wild-type or tagged GLUT8 in different cell systems. In these cells, none of the conventional signals tested induced a translocation of GLUT8 to the plasma membrane. Therefore, GLUT8 appears to catalyze transport of sugars or sugar derivatives through intracellular membranes. Slc2a8 knockout mice were viable, developed normally, and showed mild alterations in brain (increased proliferation of neuronal cells in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, hyperactivity), heart (impaired transmission of electrical wave through the atrium), and sperm cells (reduced number of motile sperm cells associated with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels in sperm). The links between molecular function, cellular localization and phenotype of the knockout mouse is unclear and remains to be determined.
