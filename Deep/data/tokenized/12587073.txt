Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) triggered apoptosis in hippocampal cultures, as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and immunohistochemistry with antibody specific for the large fragment of activated caspase 3. The levels of phosphorylated (activated) c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were also increased in HSV-1-infected hippocampal cultures as were the levels of activated c-Jun, its target. JNK activation was involved in HSV-1-induced apoptosis as evidenced by apoptosis inhibition with the JNK inhibitor SP600125. HSV-2 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated protein kinase (MEK/ERK) survival pathway and did not trigger apoptosis in hippocampal cultures. The MEK specific inhibitor U0126 inhibited ERK activation and caused a significant increase in the percent TUNEL(+) cells in HSV-2-infected cultures, indicating that the failure of HSV-2 to trigger apoptosis is due to its ability to activate the MEK/ERK survival pathway. JNK was also activated in brain tissues from patients with HSV-associated acute focal encephalitis (HSE) that were positive for HSV-1 antigen. JNK activation correlated with apoptosis, as determined by immunohistochemistry with antibody to activated caspase 3 or cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). The data suggest that HSE has an apoptotic component that may contribute to disease pathogenesis.
