Ozone exposure induces increased production of free radicals which may result in oxidative stress. The objectives of this study were to determine the antioxidant effects of vitamin E on memory deficits and lipid peroxidation due to oxidative stress caused by acute ozone exposure. Rats were exposed to 0.7 p.p.m. ozone for 4 h and 50 mg/kg vitamin E was administered either before or after exposure. Experiment 1 evaluated alterations in short-term and long-term memory in a passive avoidance task. Experiment 2 quantified lipid peroxidation levels of the striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex. Vitamin E administered before or after ozone exposure blocked memory deterioration and increases in lipid peroxidation levels associated with oxidative stress.
