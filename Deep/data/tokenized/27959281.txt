The aim of this manuscript is to demonstrate that the known hormonally driven development of the male amygdalae, requires the vital use of stored memory in order that they are able to complete their recognised full structural architectonics. The hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex are strongly involved in the reception of testosterone which is the responsible hormone. The transfer of testosterone into memory and the mode of consolidation and storage of that memory are discussed. In regard to this activity, there have been suggestions concerning the possible effect of immune processes and also epigenesis and these are discussed. Finally, the controlled transfer to the male amygdala and the anabolic effect upon it are elucidated. The understanding of the hippocampal memory system is challenged by new evidence that has arisen.
