We have recently characterized a tachykinin receptor subtype (SP-N) whose preferred ligand is the mammalian neuropeptide, neurokinin B (Laufer, R., Wormser, U., Friedman, Z. Y., Gilon, C., Chorev, M., and Selinger, Z. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 7444-7448). To investigate this novel tachykinin receptor, we have now prepared a radiolabeled peptide, N alpha-[( 125I]desamino-3-iodotyrosyl)-[Asp5,6, N-methyl-Phe8]substance P (5-11) heptapeptide (125I-BH-NH-Senktide), which selectively interacts with the SP-N receptor subtype. The binding of 125I-BH-NH-Senktide to rat cerebral cortex membranes was studied under conditions that minimized nonspecific binding. Unlike other tachykinin receptor probes, this radioligand is not degraded during the binding experiment. Binding of 125I-BH-NH-Senktide is reversible, saturable, and of high affinity (KD = 0.9 nM). The radioligand labels a single class of binding site (122 fmol binding sites/mg of protein), as indicated by a linear Scatchard plot and a Hill coefficient close to unity (nH = 1.05). The pharmacological specificity of this binding site corresponds to that of the neuronal SP-N receptor in guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus, which was determined by a functional bioassay. Among various rat brain regions, the highest binding was observed in the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. These results suggest the existence and specific distribution of a neurokinin B receptor site of the SP-N type in rat brain. 125I-BH-NH-Senktide is the first selective and potent probe for this receptor and is thus an important tool for further studies of its distribution, regulation, and functional role.
