Studies in both humans and animals demonstrate that D,L- and D-fenfluramine (D,L-FEN and D-FEN, respectively) can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis following an acute dose. No data exist showing a prolonged effect of either drug, although two studies have hinted at increased adrenal activity. There are also considerable differences in the literature pertaining to the neurotoxic effects of D,L- and D-FEN. Some possible explanations for these differences include: activation of different neurotransmitter systems, the temperature at which the animals were maintained during exposure, or the substance sampled in each study. We investigated the effects of either D,L-FEN or D-FEN on pituitary, adrenal, and gonadal hormones 72 h after drug exposure. Furthermore, using a dosing regimen adapted from studies on methamphetamine (e.g., four times every 2 h in a single day) known to produce elevations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) under hyperthermic conditions, we examined the effects of D- and D,L-FEN (15 mg/kg, four times) on GFAP content when the animals were dosed at ambient temperatures of 21 or 32 degrees C. Approximately fivefold increases of corticosterone and threefold increases of aldosterone were found 72 h later under resting conditions following both D- and D,L-FEN. Nonetheless, when animals were dosed with D-FEN at 32 degrees C, no significant elevation in corticosterone was detected. No effect was observed for ACTH, testosterone, or GFAP following D- or D,L-FEN treatment. These data suggest that: (1) FEN treatment causes prolonged elevations in adrenal cortical hormones; (2) FEN-treated animals displayed hormonal characteristics similar to animals undergoing a chronic stressor as suggested by no difference in ACTH titers; (3) D,L-FEN treatment or D-FEN treatment (as reported previously) is not similar to other substituted amphetamines in that it does not increase GFAP, even under hyperthermic conditions.
