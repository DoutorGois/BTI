Research on neural androgen receptors (ARs) has traditionally focused on brain regions that regulate reproductive and aggressive behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and amygdala. Although many cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) also express ARs, the number of ARs per cell appears to be much lower, and thus, AR immunostaining is often hard to detect and quantify in the PFC. Here, we demonstrate that biotin tyramide signal amplification (TSA) dramatically increases AR immunoreactivity in the rat brain, including critical regions of the PFC such as the medial PFC (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We show that TSA is useful for AR detection with both chromogenic and immunofluorescent immunohistochemistry. Double-labeling studies reveal that AR+ cells in the PFC and hippocampus are NeuN+ but not GFAP+ and thus primarily neuronal. Finally, in gonadally intact rats, more AR+ cells are present in the mPFC and OFC of males than of females. Future studies can use TSA to further examine AR immunoreactivity across ages, sexes, strains, and different procedures (e.g., fixation methods). In light of emerging evidence for the androgen regulation of executive function and working memory, these results may help understand the distribution and roles of ARs in the PFC.
