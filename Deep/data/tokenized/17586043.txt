Nocistatin and nociceptin/orphaninFQ (N/OFQ) are the two new peptides which may have roles in nociception, memory, anxiety, and other biological functions. Nocistatin acts as a functional antagonist to N/OFQ in several functions, but their neuro-anatomical sites of interaction are unknown. We investigated the effect of combined intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of nocistatin with N/OFQ, on N/OFQ induced c-Fos expression in the mouse hippocampus, using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. We found that co-injection of nocistatin with N/OFQ significantly attenuated N/OFQ induced c-Fos expression in the hippocampus.
