A new method for the histochemical demonstration of adenylate cyclase activity, introduced and biochemically tested by Poeggel et al. (1981 a), was employed in nervous tissue. Using this method a multiple pattern of activity was detectable. Activity occurs in nervous as well as glial elements. Biochemical results and physiological conclusions could be confirmed by ultrahistochemical visualization of adenylate cyclase activity in nervous tissue. The specificity of the reaction is controlled by a number of variations of the incubation methods.
