Plant lycopene exhibits antioxidant activity in animal tissues. Transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in Mongolian gerbils resulted in delayed neuronal death in hippocampal regions. We examined the antioxidant effects of lycopene because we expected lycopene to attenuate ischemia-related neuronal damage by controlling apoptosis at the gene level. The gerbils were divided into two groups: the normal feeding (control) group that received normal market food (MF) and the lycopene group that received MF containing lycopene (5 mg in 100 g MF food). After 1.5-2.0 months (when body weight were 60-65 g), the lycopene level was 38.2 +/- 17.6 ng/ml in serum and 11.9 +/- 4.0 mug/g-wet weight tissue in the liver. Levels of B cell leukemia-2, an apoptosis-suppressing protein, decreased in control animal brains 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery, whereas the levels increased in lycopene-treated animal brains. Moreover, cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 activity increased gradually after ischemia, but was suppressed in the lycopene-treated animal brains 7 days after surgery. Finally, hippocampal superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased in the control group 3 h after ischemia and, gradually increased thereafter, whereas it was significantly elevated in the lycopene group. Thus, orally administered lycopene is accumulated in the body, and provided protections against ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury by inducing an increase in SOD activity and inhibiting apoptosis.
