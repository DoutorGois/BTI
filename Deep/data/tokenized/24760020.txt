Neurites of neurons under acute or chronic stress form bundles of filaments (rods) containing 1ratio1 cofilinratioactin, which impair transport and synaptic function. Rods contain disulfide cross-linked cofilin and are induced by treatments resulting in oxidative stress. Rods form rapidly (5-30 min) in >80% of cultured hippocampal or cortical neurons treated with excitotoxic levels of glutamate or energy depleted (hypoxia/ischemia or mitochondrial inhibitors). In contrast, slow rod formation (50% of maximum response in approximately 6 h) occurs in a subpopulation ( approximately 20%) of hippocampal neurons upon exposure to soluble human amyloid-beta dimer/trimer (Abetad/t) at subnanomolar concentrations. Here we show that proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) also induce rods at the same rate and within the same neuronal population as Abetad/t. Neurons from prion (PrP(C))-null mice form rods in response to glutamate or antimycin A, but not in response to proinflammatory cytokines or Abetad/t. Two pathways inducing rod formation were confirmed by demonstrating that NADPH-oxidase (NOX) activity is required for prion-dependent rod formation, but not for rods induced by glutamate or energy depletion. Surprisingly, overexpression of PrP(C) is by itself sufficient to induce rods in over 40% of hippocampal neurons through the NOX-dependent pathway. Persistence of PrP(C)-dependent rods requires the continuous activity of NOX. Removing inducers or inhibiting NOX activity in cells containing PrP(C)-dependent rods causes rod disappearance with a half-life of about 36 min. Cofilin-actin rods provide a mechanism for synapse loss bridging the amyloid and cytokine hypotheses for Alzheimer disease, and may explain how functionally diverse Abeta-binding membrane proteins induce synaptic dysfunction.
