Recent studies have suggested that rats subjected to transient global brain ischemia develop depressed expression of GluR-B in CA1 hippocampal neurons. The present study was performed to determine whether a similar change in AMPA receptor expression could be triggered in vitro by sublethal oxygen-glucose deprivation in rat hippocampal neuronal cultures. mRNA was extracted from individual hippocampal neurons via patch electrodes and amplified by RT-PCR 24-48 hr after sublethal oxygen-glucose deprivation. Compared with controls, insulted neurons expressed increased levels of GluR-D flop. As an indication that this change in receptor expression was functionally significant, insulted cultures exhibited increased AMPA- or kainate-induced 45Ca2+ accumulation sensitive to Joro spider toxin and increased vulnerability to kainate-induced death. These data support the hypothesis that exposure to ischemia may enhance subsequent hippocampal neuronal vulnerability to AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity by modifying the relative expression of AMPA receptor subunits in a manner that promotes Ca2+ permeability.
