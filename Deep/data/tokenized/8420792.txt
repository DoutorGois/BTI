Rat glutamate receptors have been shown to be expressed as two developmentally regulated, alternatively spliced isoforms. We have investigated the expression of these isoforms of GluRA and GluRB in the human hippocampus. The expression pattern of the mRNAs coding for these subunits does not correspond to that in the rat hippocampus, both isoforms being preferentially expressed in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions, with lower expression in CA3, with the exception of GluRB flop, where hybridization in CA3 is only lower than in dentate gyrus. Cloning of cDNA from human frontal cortex has also revealed that the two isoforms of human GluRB have virtual nucleotide sequence identity with the alternative exons in the rat, confirming the usefulness of oligonucleotides complementary to the rat cDNAs as probes for these receptor subunits in human neuropsychiatric disorders.
