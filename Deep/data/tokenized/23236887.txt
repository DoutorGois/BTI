The development of pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling is accompanied by neurodegeneration and neuronal loss in different areas of the hippocampus. However, the data on neurodegeneration development in the dentate gyrus remain controversial. In our study that was performed on 20 Wistar male rats, it was found that the process of neuronal loss was expressed unequally along the dentate gyrus. By the end of pentylenetetrazole kindling development, degenerating cells were present in the superior and inferior blades of the dentate gyrus, whereas the neuronal density in these areas was not reduced. On the other hand, in the angle of the dentate gyrus neuronal loss was already detected at the very early stages of kindling development. These findings allow to suggest a functional heterogeneity of a population of granule cells in relation to their susceptibility to seizure-induced injury.
