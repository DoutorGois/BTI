BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although a few automated hippocampal subfield segmentation methods have been developed, there is no study on the effects of the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease on the hippocampal subfield volume with in vivo MR imaging. The aim of this study was to investigate hippocampal subfield volume differences between drug-naive subjects with AD and healthy elderly controls by using an automated hippocampal subfield segmentation technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one drug-naive subjects with AD and 33 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3T MR imaging, and hippocampal subfield volume was measured and compared between the groups. RESULTS: Subjects with AD had significantly smaller volumes of the presubiculum, subiculum, CA2-3, and CA4 DG compared with healthy subjects (uncorrected, P<.001). In addition, we found significant positive correlations between the presubiculum and the subicular volumes and the MMSE-K and the CERAD-K verbal delayed recall scores in the AD group. CONCLUSIONS: We are unaware of previous imaging studies of automated hippocampal subfield segmentation in AD. These structural changes in the hippocampal presubiculum, subiculum, and CA2-3 might be at the core of underlying neurobiologic mechanisms of hippocampal dysfunction and their relevance to verbal delayed recall impairments in AD.
