OBJECTIVE: To observe protective effects of Shenmai (SM) injection on the delayed injury of the cerebral neurons in rat with intracerebral hemorrhage. METHOD: Rosenberg models of intracerebral hemorrhage was established and the effects of SM injection on the pathologic changes in neuronal structure, mitochondria-DNA(mtDNA)deletion, C-myc gene and expression PDGF-A gene in hippocampal CA1 areas, were investigated. RESULT: SM injection inhibited the apoptosis of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 areas, and decreased the degree of mtDNA deletion in the neurons in the injured area. SM injection had no effect on gene expression of C-myc at initial stage a intracerebral hemorrhage, but significantiy decreased the level of PDGF-A mRNA and prolonged the time of its expression. CONCLUSION: SM injection might attenuate the delayed injury induced by intracerebral hemorrhage via regulating the expression of PDGF.
