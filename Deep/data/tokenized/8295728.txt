Adult male Wistar rats were trained in a simple odor detection task, with peppermint odor serving as either an S+, S- or as a randomly presented odor. Twenty-four hours after the last training session, rats were injected with [14C]2-deoxyglucose and exposed to the odor. Mean relative 2-deoxyglucose uptake to the odor was enhanced in the pars dorsalis of the anterior olfactory nucleus of S+ and S- trained rats compared to controls. In contrast, no differences in uptake were detected in either odor-specific focal regions of the olfactory bulb glomerular layer, the pyriform cortex, or the hippocampus.
