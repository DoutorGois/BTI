Ephrins and Eph receptors are a family of molecules that have been implicated in axonal pathfinding. A unique feature of B-class ephrins and Eph receptors is their ability to transmit bidirectional signals in both ephrin- and Eph receptor-expressing cells upon cell-cell contact. These signals can lead to cytoskeletal alterations that have been attributed to regulating neuronal growth responses. Examination of gene-target knockout mice has supported this hypothesis, revealing numerous developmental defects in the nervous systems of mice mutant for both B-class ephrins and Eph receptors. To examine the potential scope of action for these genes in the nervous system, we have used in situ hybridization to study the mRNA expression of ephrins (B1, B2, and B3) and Eph receptors (B1, B2, B3, A4) in neonatal and adult mice. We found ephrins and Eph receptors to be expressed throughout the CNS. Expression was observed in the epithelium and migratory regions of the neonate and adult tissues as well as in discrete regions of high plasticity, including the adult olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum. These studies suggest additional potential roles for these molecules in the postnatal and adult CNS and will serve as a guide in the detailed evaluation of mutant mice.
