Behavioral experiments using ablation of the hippocampus are increasingly being used to address the hypothesis that the avian hippocampus plays a role in memory, as in mammals. However, the morphological basis of the avian hippocampus has been poorly understood. In the present study, the afferent and efferent connections of the hippocampus in the pigeon telencephalon were defined by injections, at various rostrocaudal sites, of neuronal tracers mainly into the triangular part located between its V-shaped layer of densely packed neurons. The major results obtained in the present study were as follows. 1) A topographical organization of the commissural projections was confirmed. These projections had two courses that projected to the contralateral side, one traveling through the fiber wall of the ventromedial telencephalon, which was the main path from neurons in the caudal hippocampus, and the other running down through the septohippocampal junction, which was the main path from neurons in the middle to rostral hippocampus. Both courses passed through the pallial commissure. 2) The hippocampus projected bilaterally to the septum, parahippocampal area (APH), and dorsolateral cortical area (CDL). These projections were also distributed topographically, with contralateral efferents crossing through the pallial commissure. 3) The hippocampus had ipsilateral reciprocal connections with APH, CDL, and the dorsal hyperstriatum. Septal afferents to the ipsilateral hippocampus were very small. 4) Intrinsic connections were found between the triangular part of the hippocampus and the lateral limb of the V-shaped layer of neurons. 5) The hippocampus projected ipsilaterally to the ventral basal ganglia and the fasciculus diagonalis Brocae. In sum, these connections of the hippocampus may form a neuronal circuit for the processing of spatial memory in pigeons.
