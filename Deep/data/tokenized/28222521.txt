The senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain is considered a robust experimental model for developing preventative and therapeutic treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease which cannot be effectively prevented, halted, or cured. Our previous studies showed that LW-AFC, a new formula derived from the classical traditional Chinese medicinal prescription Liuwei Dihuang decoction, ameliorates cognitive deterioration in PrP-hAbetaPPswe/PS1DeltaE9 transgenic mice and SAMP8 mice. This study aims to investigate the mechanism that mediates how LW-AFC improves cognitive deficit on the basis of the transcriptome. We conducted a genome-wide survey of gene expression in the hippocampus in mice from the senescence accelerated mouse resistant 1 (SAMR1) strain, from SAMP8 and from LW-AFC treated SAMP8. The results showed that LW-AFC reversed the transcriptome in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. The specific investigation of altered gene expression in subtypes defined by cognitive profiles indicated that the systemic lupus erythematosus pathway, spliceosomes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the insulin signaling were involved in the improvement of cognitive ability by LW-AFC. The expression of genes Enpp2, Etnk1, Epdr1, and Gm5900 in the hippocampus were correlated with that of LW-AFC's ameliorating cognitive impairment in SAMP8 mice. Because LW-AFC is composed of polysaccharides, glycosides, and oligosaccharides, we infer that LW-AFC has direct or indirect effects on altering gene expressions and regulating pathways in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice. These data are helpful for the enhanced identification of LW-AFC as new therapeutic modalities to AD.
