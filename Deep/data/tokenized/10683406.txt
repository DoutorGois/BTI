Previous studies have revealed a small number of hippocampal interneurons immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase, the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme. It remained an open question, however, whether these neurons represented a subgroup of inhibitory GABAergic neurons co-localizing acetylcholine. In this study, we have combined immunocytochemistry for choline acetyltransferase and in situ hybridization for glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA, the GABA-synthesizing enzyme. None of the choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons in the various layers of the hippocampus proper and fascia dentata were found to co-localize glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA. The lack of an in situ hybridization signal in these neurons is unlikely to result from the combination of the two labeling techniques. When combining in situ hybridization for glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA with immunostaining for parvalbumin, a calcium-binding protein expressed by many GABAergic hippocampal interneurons, numerous double-labeled cells were observed. These data provide neurochemical evidence for the existence of non-GABAergic, supposedly cholinergic non-principal cells in the hippocampus.
