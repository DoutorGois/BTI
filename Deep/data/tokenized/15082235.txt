In the present study, the expression of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase in the gerbil hippocampus associated with various sequelae of spontaneous seizures were investigated in order to identify the roles of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase in the epileptogenesis and the recovery mechanisms in these animals. The population of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactive neurons and Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunodensity were significantly lower in the pre-seizure group of SS gerbils than those in SR gerbils. At 30-min postictal, the Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactivity was significantly elevated in the hippocampal complex. At 3-h postictal, the Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was declined, as compared to the 30-min postictal. At 12h after seizure on-set, Na(+)-K(+) ATPase expression was re-enhanced in the all regions of the hippocampal complex including the dentate hilus. Following administration of vigabatrin Na(+)-K(+) ATPase expression was also increased. The present data suggest that altered Na(+)-K(+) ATPase expression may contribute the regulation of the seizure activity in this animal.
