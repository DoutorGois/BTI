Histaminergic receptors and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) are co-expressed at high levels in the hippocampal neurons and alter anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. Since the dorsal hippocampus may be involved in modulation of anxiety-like behaviors, the aim of the present study was to assess whether the nitric oxide (NO) system in the dorsal hippocampus affects anxiety-like behaviors induced by histaminergic agents in mice. The effects of the NO precursor, L-arginine and NOS inhibitor, L-nitro-amino-methyl-ester (L-NAME) on histamine, pyrilamine and ranitidine responses in elevated plus maze (E.P.M.) in mice were investigated. Intra-CA1 microinjection of histamine (9 mug/mouse) or H1 receptor antagonist, pyrilamine (3, 6 and 9 mug/mouse), but not H2 receptor antagonist, ranitidine decreased the percentage of open arm time (%OAT) and open arm entries (%OAE), without affecting locomotor activity, suggesting an anxiogenic-like response. Both L-arginine (0.4 and 0.8 mug/mouse) and L-NAME (40 ng/mouse) when injected into the dorsal hippocampus induced anxiety-like behaviors, but the drugs reversed the anxiogenic response induced by the effective dose of histamine (9 mug/mouse) or pyrilamine (9 mug/mouse). Our results also indicated that intra-CA1 administration of L-arginine and L-NAME, in the presence or absence of ranitidine, exerted an anxiogenic effect. The results may indicate a modulatory role for NO in the dorsal hippocampus in the anxiogenic-like response induced by histamine or pyrilamine.
