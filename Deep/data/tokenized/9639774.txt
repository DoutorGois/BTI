Dexamethasone (Dex) was injected into the rat lateral ventricle and the changes of glutamate-immunoreactivity (Glu-IR) and gamma-aminobulyric acid immunoreactivity (GABA-IR) neurons in the hippocampus were immunocytochemically examined 2 h after injection. The results showed that Glu-IR neurons increased and GABA-IR neurons did not show marked change. The mechanism remains to be further studied.
