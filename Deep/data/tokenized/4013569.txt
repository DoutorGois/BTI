Using phase-correlation analysis, electrical stimulation and pharmacological treatment (Benactyzine), changes in functional importance of the head of n. caudatus have been observed which were related to regulation needs for the delayed spatial preference and differentiation of temporal reflexes. Structural elements of any morpho-functional system are not determined constantly by one and the same functional importance. They may change their functional quality with respect to changes in experimental situation.
