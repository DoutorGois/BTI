1 The current paper reviews the role of temporal lobe structures in learning and different kinds of memory, with an emphasis on behavioral tasks that re auditory stimuli. 2 The effects of lesions to structures in the temporal lobe were examined in separate groups of dogs, which were trained on an auditory spatial delayed response, or in a trial-unique auditory delayed match to sample recognition task. 3 Spatial memory was impaired after bilateral hippocampal lesions. On the other hand, neither an anterior temporal lesion or rhinal cortical injury nor combined lesion to the hippocampus and the anterior temporal lobe, affected postoperative retraining and performance of the spatial task. 4 Auditory recognition memory task was not impaired after a hippocampal and/or rhinal cortex lesion. However, postoperative retraining of the task was impaired after a lesion to auditory association areas. 5 These results confirm the role of the hippocampus in spatial memory in the dog. On the other hand, the organization of auditory recognition functions within the temporal lobe appears to be different from those described for visual recognition functions.
