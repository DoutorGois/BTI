We examined the expression of the I, II and III subtypes of voltage-sensitive Na+ channel mRNA in the rat brain using in situ hybridization histochemistry with oligonucleotide probes. The distribution of cells with strongly positive signals was characteristic for each subtype. Synthesis of each subtype of Na+ channel protein may be regulated by differential mRNA expression.
