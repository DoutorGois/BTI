Early malnutrition is a risk factor for depression and schizophrenia. Since the offspring of malnourished dams exhibit increased brain levels of serotonin (5-HT), a tryptophan-derived neurotransmitter involved in the pathophysiology of these mental disorders, it is believed that the deleterious effects of early malnutrition on brain function are due in large part to altered serotoninergic neurotransmission resulting from impaired tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. However, tryptophan is also metabolized through the kynurenine (KYN) pathway yielding several neuroactive compounds including kynurenic (KA), quinolinic (QA) and xanthurenic (XA) acids. Nevertheless, the impact of perinatal malnutrition on brain kynurenine pathway metabolism has not been examined to date. Here, we used ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the simultaneous quantification of tryptophan and a set of seven compounds spanning its metabolism through the serotonin and kynurenine pathways, in the brain of embryos and adult offspring of rat dams fed a protein-restricted (PR) diet. Protein-restricted embryos showed reduced brain levels of Trp, serotonin and KA, but not of KYN, XA, or QA. In contrast, PR adult rats exhibited enhanced levels of Trp in the brainstem and cortex along with increased concentrations of 5-HT, kynurenine and XA. The levels of XA and KA were also increased in the hippocampus of adult PR rats. These results show that early protein deficiency induces selective and long-lasting changes in brain kynurenine metabolism. Given the regulatory role of KYN pathway metabolites on brain development and function, these changes might contribute to the risk of developing psychiatric disorders induced by early malnutrition.
