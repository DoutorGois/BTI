Accurate distal landing is essential to avoid paraplegia while performing the frozen elephant trunk technique (FETT). A 72-year-old man who had a hippocampus-shape aneurysm in the descending aorta was successfully treated by the FETT with a certain and sophisticated method to position the Stent graft precisely using a 16-F nephrostomy balloon catheter. No cerebrospinal complications were observed postoperatively, and computed tomography did not reveal any endleakage.
