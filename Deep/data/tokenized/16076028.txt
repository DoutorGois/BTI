Here we investigated the effects of estradiol replacement in ovariectomized female rats using hippocampal slices exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release to the incubation medium, what was assumed as a parameter of cellular death. In the estradiol-treated group the LDH release was markedly decreased by 23% as compared to the vehicle-treated group. In attempt to study a possible mechanism by which estradiol acts, we investigated some parameters of oxidative stress. In both vehicle-treated and estradiol-treated groups, OGD significantly increased the free radical production by 34% and 16%, respectively, although no significant differences on total antioxidant capacity were observed. Interestingly, estradiol replacement prevented the significant reduction in tryptophan and tyrosine contents caused by OGD observed in vehicle-treated animals. Our results show that estradiol replacement in ovariectomized female rats decreases cellular susceptibility to an ischemic-like injury and suggest a role for the hormone on protein damage prevention.
