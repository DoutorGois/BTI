The effect of chronic alcoholism in the neuronal nuclear area (karyometry) of the lateral entorhinal cortex at three rostro-caudal levels (rostral, intermediate and caudal) has been studied in 19 alcoholic subjects and in 15 aged-matched controls. Cases were distributed into three groups according to their age (29-44, 45-60 and 61-70 years of age). In the second group (45-60 years), the nuclear size in layers II and III of the caudal entorhinal cortex showed a very significant decrease compared to controls. The first group (29-44 years) also showed a significant reduction in size, while the third group presented the smallest differences. The presence of cirrhosis in the alcoholic group did not vary the observed results. Thus, chronic alcoholism significantly decreases the nuclear size in layers II and III of the lateral entorhinal cortex, and thus the entorhinal output to the hippocampus may be altered in alcoholism.
