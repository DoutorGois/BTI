We report that N-adamantyl-4-methylthiazol-2-amine (KHG26693), a novel thiazole derivative, can prevent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain inflammation in mice. In this LPS-induced model of brain inflammation, administration of KHG26693 effectively prevented increases in the levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, prostaglandin E2, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide, and mitigated reductions in the levels of superoxide dismutase in the hippocampus. KHG26693 also prevented reductions in the levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factors. Furthermore, pretreatment with KHG26693 prior to LPS treatment dramatically attenuated the elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 protein levels. Moreover, pretreatment with KHG26693 significantly suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-kappaB and IkappaBalpha through the inactivation of IKKbeta. Additionally, KHG26693 caused the downregulation of LPS-induced cystathionine-b-synthase gene expression in the brain. Although the clinical relevance of our findings remains to be determined, our data suggest that KHG26693 might prevent neuronal cell injury via the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.
