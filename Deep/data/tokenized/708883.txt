The transplacental action of nitrosoethylurea (NEU) was studied in organic cultures of the embryonic rat brain tissue (the hyppocampus region). The brain tissue proved to be highly sensitive to NEU. This was expressed in a greater survival of the experimental cultures in comparison with the control and in the appearance of epithelial proliferations of the vascular plexus resembling, in individual cases, adenomas. The amount of morphological changes observed in the experiment depended on the carcinogen dose.
