Lesions of the various afferents to the hippocampus have been widely used to investigate the mechanisms underlying growth and degeneration in adult mammalian CNS. It has been proposed that disturbances in intracellular calcium and activation of calcium-dependent proteases represent key steps in producing come of the consequences of the lesions. In this study, we show that lesions of the entorhinal cortex or of the commissural pathway result in profound changes in the distribution of brain spectrin. At 2 days after lesions of the entorhinal cortex, immunoreactivity to spectrin is markedly increased in the outer molecular layer (OML) of the dentate gyrus; conversely at 2 days after commissural lesions, immunoreactivity to the same antigen is increased in the inner molecular layer. The increase in immunoreactivity to spectrin varies with survival time after lesions of the entorhinal cortex. By 24 h post lesion, the increase is homogeneous across the OML, and becomes more intense by 48 h. Between 1 and 3 weeks the increase is much less than at 48 h and is concentrated at the inner border of the OML. Pretreatment of the animals with the calpain inhibitor leupeptin reduces the increase in spectrin immunoreactivity normally seen 48 h after the lesion of the entorhinal cortex. Changes in the pattern of immunoreactivity to GFAP are very different to that seen with spectrin antibodies and are consistent with the known modifications in astrocytes that follow lesions of hippocampal afferents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
