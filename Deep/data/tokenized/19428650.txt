Memory impairment is considered to be one of the most prominent consequences of aging. Deterioration of memory begins in advance of old age in animals, including humans. Thus, it is extremely important to prevent memory decline for increasing healthy aging. Ginsenoside, the effective ingredient of ginseng, has been reported to have a neuron beneficial effect, but the preventive role on memory impairment and the underlying mechanisms have not been well determined. In the present study, C57BL/6J mice aged 12 months were chronically treated with ginsenoside 100mg/kg per day for 8 months. Placebo-treated aged mice, young and adult ones (4- and 8-month-old, respectively) were used as controls. The efficacious effect of ginsenoside was manifested in the amelioration of memory impairment in aged mice by Morris water maze and step-down tests. Compared with aged control group, the plasticity-related proteins including phospho-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor1 (NMDAR1), phospho-calcium-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMK II), phospho-PKA catalytic beta subunit (PKA Cbeta), phospho-cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus significantly increased in ginsenoside treated group. These findings suggest that ginsenoside is effective on the prevention of age-related memory impairment, and the up-regulation of plasticity-related proteins in hippocampus may be one of the mechanisms.
