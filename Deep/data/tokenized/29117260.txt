BACKGROUND: In this study we investigated the role of hippocampal volume (HV) in visual memory. METHODS: Participants were a subsample of older adults (> = 70 years) from the Einstein Aging Study. Visual performance was measured using the Complex Figure (CF) copy and delayed recall tasks from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Linear regressions were fitted to study associations between HV and visual tasks. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 113, mean age = 78.9 years) average scores on the CF copy and delayed recall were 17.4 and 11.6, respectively. CF delayed recall was associated with total (beta = .031, p = 0.001) and left (beta = 0.031, p = 0.001) and right HVs (beta = 0.24, p = 0.012). CF delayed recall remained significantly associated with left HV even after we also included right HV (beta = 0.27, p = 0.025) and the CF copy task (beta = 0.30, p = 0.009) in the model. CF copy did not show any significant associations with HV. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that left HV contributes in retrieval of visual memory in older adults.
