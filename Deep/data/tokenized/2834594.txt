The present study showed that DN-1417 had a dose-dependent anticonvulsant activity on El mouse seizure. This finding is consistent with other reports using the kindling model of epilepsy. Since both the El mouse and kindling preparations have been regarded as complex partial seizure with secondary generalization, endogenous brain TRH, as well as exogenous TRH, may act as an anticonvulsant substance to such a seizure type of epilepsy. Moreover, this study showed IR-TRH of the El mouse changed significantly in the striatum or hippocampus genetically or postictally without a change in the TRH receptor binding. A transient decrease in hippocampal IR-TRH after convulsion shown in this study may suggest an increased release of TRH during and after the seizure. Further studies are required to clarify the relationship between a change in the brain TRH system and seizure susceptibility in the El mouse.
