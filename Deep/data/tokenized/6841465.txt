The objective of this study was to characterize local cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the recirculation period following incomplete forebrain ischemia. Specifically, we wished to determine whether perfusion defects developed in the immediate recirculation period, to study how initial hyperemia and delayed hypoperfusion at the local level were related to the severity of the preceding ischemia, and to find out whether reflow was influenced by the nutritional state of the animals. To that end, forebrain ischemia of 15 min duration was induced in fed and fasted ventilated rats under 70% N2O. Local CBF was measured with an autoradiographic technique at the end of ischemia, as well as at 5 and 60 min following the start of recirculation. Control experiments were performed to examine the influence of ischemia on cerebral metabolic state in fed and fasted animals. The ischemia reduced CBF to excessively low values (less than 5% of control) in many forebrain structures, including the cerebral cortices, caudoputamen, and hippocampus. In spite of this, perfusion defects failed to appear after 5 min of recirculation. Instead, moderate to marked hyperemia was present in all previously ischemic structures. After 60 min of recirculation, pronounced hypoperfusion developed. The magnitude of the initial hyperemia was poorly related to the severity of the preceding ischemia, but the latter partly determined the degree of delayed hypoperfusion. Thus, little or no hypoperfusion developed in structures whose flow rates exceeded 30-40% of control during ischemia. Fasted animals had a better preserved flow to many structures than did fed animals, indicating that the detrimental effect of feeding (or glucose infusion) is also reflected in lower perfusion rates.
