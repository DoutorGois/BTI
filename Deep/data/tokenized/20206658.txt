Thyroid hormones, particularly triiodothyronine (T3), have long been used for the treatment of depression, most frequently to enhance the therapeutic activity of other antidepressants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible underlying mechanisms for the antidepressant activity of T3. The effects of T3 20 microg/kg/d S.C. and fluoxetine 5mg/kg/d I.P. given alone or in combination for 7 days on the transcription rates of inhibitory serotonergic receptors (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B) were studied in different brain areas of male Sabra rats using real-time PCR. Significant effects of fluoxetine were found on the expression of 5-HT1B receptors in the frontal cortex and of T3 on the expression of 5-HT1A receptors in the amygdala and hippocampus and 5-HT1B receptors in the frontal and entorhinal cortices, the expression being reduced in all cases. An effect of the combination of T3 plus fluoxetine to reduce transcription was observed for 5-HT1A receptors, in the amygdala and dentate gyrus and for 5-HT1B receptors in the entorhinal cortex and anterior raphe nucleus. In the second experiment, the novelty suppressed feeding test (NFST) was used to examine the effects of fluoxetine 5mg/kg/d I.P. and T3 20 or 50 microg/kg/d, alone or in combination for 12 days, on latency to feed. Only the combinations of T3 (20 or 50 microg/kg/d) and fluoxetine (5mg/kg/d) yielded significant behavioral effects in this test. The results of our studies suggest that the mechanism underlying the antidepressant effect of T3 may involve a reduction in 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor transcription rates.
