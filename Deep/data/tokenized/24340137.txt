AIM: To evaluate changes in neurotransmission induced by a psychoactive beverage ayahuasca in the hippocampus and amygdala of naive rats. METHODS: The level of monoamines, their main metabolites and amino acid neurotransmitters concentrations were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four groups of rats were employed: saline-treated and rats receiving 250, 500 and 800 mg/kg of ayahuasca infusion (gavage). Animals were killed 40 min after drug ingestion and the structures stored at -80 degrees C until HPLC assay. The data from all groups were compared using Analysis of variance and Scheffe as post test and P < 0.05 was accepted as significant. RESULTS: The results showed decreased concentrations of glycine (GLY) (0.13 +/- 0.03 vs 0.29 +/- 0.07, P < 0.001) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (1.07 +/- 0.14 vs 1.73 +/- 0.25, P < 0.001) in the amygdala of rats that received 500 of ayahuasca. Animals that ingested 800 mg/kg of ayahuasca also showed a reduction of GLY level (0.11 +/- 0.01 vs 0.29 +/- 0.07, P < 0.001) and GABA (0.98 +/- 0.06 vs 1.73 +/- 0.25, P < 0.001). In the hippocampus, increased GABA levels were found in rats that received all ayahuasca doses: 250 mg/kg (1.29 +/- 0.19 vs 0.84 +/- 0.21, P < 0.05); 500 mg/kg (2.23 +/- 038 vs 084 +/- 0.21, P < 0.05) and 800 mg/kg (1.98 +/- 0.92 vs 0.84 +/- 0.21, P < 0.05). In addition, an increased utilization rate of all monoamines was found in the amygdala after ayahuasca administration in doses: 250 mg/kg (noradrenaline: 0.16 +/- 0.02 vs 0.36 +/- 0.06, P < 0.01; dopamine: 0.39 +/- 0.012 vs 2.39 +/- 0.84, P < 0.001; serotonin: 1.02 +/- 0.22 vs 4.04 +/- 0.91, P < 0.001), 500 mg/kg (noradrenaline: 0.08 +/- 0.02 vs 0.36 +/- 0.06, P < 0.001; dopamine: 0.33 +/- 0.19 vs 2.39 +/- 0.84, P < 0.001; serotonin: 0.59 +/- 0.08 vs 4.04 +/- 0.91, P < 0.001) and 800 mg/kg (noradrenaline: 0.16 +/- 0.04 vs 0.36 +/- 0.06, P < 0.001; dopamine: 0.84 +/- 0.65 vs 2.39 +/- 0.84, P < 0.05; serotonin: 0.36 +/- 0.02 vs 4.04 +/- 0.91, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest increased release of inhibitory amino acids by the hippocampus and an increased utilization rate of monoamines by the amygdala after different doses of ayahuasca ingestion.
