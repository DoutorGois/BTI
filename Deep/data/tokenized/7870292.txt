Activation of the NO-cGMP pathway or adenosine receptors depresses reversibly synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate, using the selective A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX, a convergence in the mechanisms of action of the NO donor SNAP, the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor zaprinast and adenosine.
