We report on a male patient who experienced a previously unreported sequence of cryptogenic West syndrome in infancy and subsequent mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. His complex partial seizures were consistently characterised by motionless staring with brief right eye blinking. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) showed bilateral temporal spikes which were dominant on the right side. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no organic brain lesion. Invasive EEG recording captured seizures with right hippocampal onset. The patient became seizure-free following right temporal lobectomy at 27 years, 8 months of age. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed corpora amylacea and gliosis in the temporal cortex but no clear findings of hippocampal sclerosis. It is suggested that an epileptogenic lesion causing MRI-negative mesial temporal lobe epilepsy may give rise to apparent cryptogenic West syndrome in infancy.
