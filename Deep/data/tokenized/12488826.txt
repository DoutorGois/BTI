We have used triple-label fluorescence immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) form large clusters at GABAergic synapses in dendrites and axon initial segment of cultured hippocampal neurons. The large synaptic clusters of alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs also contained alpha1, beta2/3, gamma2 GABA(A)R subunits and gephyrin. The alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs also formed small clusters. The small clusters were not associated with GABAergic synapses and often did not co-localize with gephyrin.
