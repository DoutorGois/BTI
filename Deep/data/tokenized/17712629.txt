It has recently been reported that diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with neurodegenerative and functional disorders of the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the changes in proliferating neurons in the dentate gyrus of type II diabetic rats using doublecortin (DCX), a marker of progenitors differentiating into neurons. At 4 weeks after birth, there were no differences in the blood glucose levels of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats or Zucker lean control (ZLC) rats. DCX-immunoreactive neurons were detectable in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in both the ZDF and ZLC rats; however, DCX immunoreactivity was higher in the ZLC rats than in the ZDF rats. At 12 weeks after birth, the blood glucose level was significantly increased by 400 mg/dl in the ZDF rats, but the blood glucose level in the ZLC rats was only slightly increased by 152.3 mg/dl. DCX immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in 12-week-old rats in comparison to 4-week-old rats. Some DCX-immunoreactive neurons were detectable in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the ZLC rats. However, only a few DCX-immunoreactive neurons were observed in the ZDF rats, and the DCX-immunoreactive neurons in the ZDF rats did not show fully developed processes. These results suggest that DCX-immunoreactive neurons were significantly decreased in an age-dependent manner and that DCX-immunoreactive neurons were also reduced in diabetic rats. In addition, the reduction in DCX-immunoreactive neurons in age matched rats may be associated with type II diabetes.
