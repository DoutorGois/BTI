OBJECTIVE: To study the protective effect of MG-132 on hippocampus cells apoptosis induced by deltamethrin (DM), one kind of pyrethroid pesticide. METHODS: 40 Male wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: olive oil control, DM treated alone (12.5 mg/kg), MG-132 (0.5 mg/kg) plus DM group, MG-132 treated 2h plus olive oil. After 24h treatment of DM, the hippocampus was taken out to detect the apoptotic cell rate, the level of bcl-2 and Caspase-3 activity. RESULTS: Compared with DM treated alone group (27.29% +/- 2.41%), the apoptotic cell rate in MG-132 + DM group (19.94% +/- 2.07%) was increased (P < 0.05), bcl-2 expression was enhanced [(0.43 +/- 0.06) vs. (2.01 +/- 0.23)] (P < 0.05) and the activity of Caspase-3 was decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in MG-132 treated 2h plus DM group [(4.55 +/- 0.46) vs.(3.73 +/- 0.35)]. CONCLUSION: MG-132 can protect hippocampus cells against apoptosis induced by deltamethrin.
