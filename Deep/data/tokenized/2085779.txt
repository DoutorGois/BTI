Age-dependent changes in monoaminergic systems and their relationship to senescent memory decline were investigated in 4- and 25-26-month-old, female, Fischer 344 rats. Spatial memory performance was tested on an 8-arm radial maze, and levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, serotonin (5-HT) and metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were measured in brain areas which contribute to memory function--basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei, subfields of the hippocampus, frontal and entorhinal cortex--and in monoaminergic cell body areas. The performance of aged subjects was significantly impaired as compared to young subjects, and alterations of 20-60% in monoamine and metabolite levels were measured in specific brain areas of aged rats. Decreased NE levels were found in basal forebrain nuclei and cortical areas but not in hippocampal subfields of aged rats. Changes in the 5-HT system were present in hippocampal, cortical and basal forebrain sites. Changes in the DA system were the most pervasive with aged rats showing decreased DA and/or metabolites in several basal forebrain nuclei, cortical areas, and the hippocampus. Aged rats showed 50% decreases of monoamines in locus coeruleus and substantia nigra and 30% decreases in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Some but not all of the changes correlated with memory performance. The present results in rats support evidence that age-dependent changes in monoaminergic function in discrete brain sites contribute to senescent memory decline and suggest that monoaminergic-cholinergic interactions within basal forebrain nuclei may be important in this decline.
