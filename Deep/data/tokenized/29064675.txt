Alcohol consumption during adolescence is deleterious to the developing brain and leads to persistent deficits in adulthood. Several results provide strong evidence for ethanol-associated alterations in glutamatergic signaling and impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Protein phosphorylation is a well-known and well-documented mechanism in memory processes, but information on phosphoprotein alterations in hippocampus after ethanol exposure is limited. This study focuses on age-related changes in the hippocampal phosphoproteome after acute alcohol administration. We have compared the phosphoprotein expression in the hippocampus of adult and adolescent Wistar rats treated with a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg i.p.), using a proteomic approach including phosphoprotein enrichment by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Our proteomic analysis revealed that 13 proteins were differentially affected by age, ethanol administration, or both. Most of these proteins are involved in neuroprotection and are expressed less in young rats treated with ethanol. We conclude that acute alcohol induces important changes in the expression of phosphoproteins in the hippocampus that could increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, especially when the alcohol exposure begins in adolescence.
