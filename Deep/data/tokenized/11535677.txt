The induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by high-frequency stimulation is considered an acceptable model for the study of learning and memory. In area CA1 calcium influx through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs; nmdaLTP) and/or L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (vdccLTP) results in distinct forms of LTP. In the light of significant accumulation of knowledge about patterns of naturally occurring activity in the intact animal, we examined whether the application of stimuli patterned after natural activity induced nmdaLTP and/or vdccLTP. In rat hippocampal slices we examined LTP induced by three types of patterned stimulation short (S-TBS), long (L-TBS), and high-intensity long theta-patterned stimulation (HL-TBS). The patterns of stimulation were applied in control, nifedipine (blocks vdccLTP), D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV; blocks nmdaLTP), or APV and nifedipine containing media. We found that S-TBS resulted in LTP that was completely attenuated in the presence of APV but was unaffected by nifedipine. Thus S-TBS results in the selective induction of nmdaLTP. L-TBS resulted in LTP that was completely blocked by APV and only partially blocked by nifedipine. Therefore L-TBS results in a compoundLTP consisting of both nmdaLTP and vdccLTP components. In the presence of APV, HL-TBS resulted in vdccLTP, and when APV and nifedipine were both present, LTP was completely blocked. Thus HL-TBS results in a vdccLTP in isolation when APV is present. We also examined saturation of S-TBS-induced LTP (nmdaLTP) by applying S-TBS at short intervals. When nifedipine was present, multiple S-TBS trains resulted in a substantially smaller final LTP as compared with controls. We conclude that multiple bursts of S-TBS eventually summate to result in compoundLTP. Stimuli patterned after innate rhythms in the hippocampus effectively induce nmdaLTP (S-TBS), compoundLTP (L-TBS), or vdccLTP (HL-TBS).
