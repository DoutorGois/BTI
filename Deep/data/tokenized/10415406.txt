There is much evidence to suggest that ischemic injury occurs during the reperfusion phase of ischemia-reperfusion insults, and that the injury may be due to reactive-oxygen-species (ROS)-mediated oxidative events, including lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. However, oxidative DNA damage has until now not been examined in situ. In the present study, we report for the first time observation of cell type- and region-specific oxidative DNA damages in 5 min transient ischemic model by immunohistochemical methods, using monoclonal antibody against 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative DNA product. The cell types containing 8-OHdG immunoreactivity were neurons, glia and endothelial cells in the hippocampus. The 8-OHdG immunoreactivity was present in the nucleus but not the cytoplasm of these cells. The level of 8-OHdG in CA1 increased significantly (P<0.05) at the end of 30 min after ischemia, but there was no increase within CA2 and CA3 areas. The 8-OHdG levels in the hippocampus increased significantly (about fourfold) after 3 h of reperfusion and remained significantly (P<0.01) elevated for at least 12 h. At 4 days after ischemia, 8-OHdG levels in the CA2 and CA3 areas decreased to levels of the sham without neuronal loss, while disappearance of 8-OHdG immunoreactivity in the CA1 coincided with neuronal death in this area. These findings strongly suggest that ischemia-induced DNA damage evolves temporally and spatially, and that oxidative DNA damage may be involved in delayed neuronal death in the CA1 region.
