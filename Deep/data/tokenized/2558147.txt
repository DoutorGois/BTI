We have examined the activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis in two lines of rats, the Roman high (RHA)- and low (RLA)-avoidance rats known to be emotionally different. These rats are selected for rapid acquisition of a conditioned avoidance response (RHA) compared with failure to acquire this response (RLA). In this study the endocrine response (ACTH, corticosterone, aldosterone) of RLA and RHA rats to two types of stress was examined: exposure to open-field stress for 10 min (Op) or exposure to ether vapours for 3 min (E). Basal plasma ACTH concentrations were lower in RLA than in RHA rats (RLA: 110.8 +/- 24.5 ng/l; RHA: 252.7 +/- 60.8 ng/l, P less than 0.05) but the absolute values of ACTH reached after both types of stress were comparable between RLA and RHA rats. Plasma corticosterone and aldosterone under resting conditions were not different between RLA and RHA rats. Plasma corticosterone was higher in RLA following openfield stress (P less than 0.05) while no differences between RLA and RHA were observed after ether stress (RHA: basal = 66 +/- 14.nmol/l, Op = 384 +/- 55, E = 606 +/- 75; RLA: basal = 121 +/- 52, Op = 612 +/- 92, E = 698 +/- 89). Stress-induced increases in plasma aldosterone were higher in the RLA line after both types of stress (RHA: basal = 175 +/- 36 pmol/l, Op = 546 +/- 53, E = 563 +/- 47; RLA: basal = 272 +/- 64, Op = 1246 +/- 91, E = 863 +/- 72).
