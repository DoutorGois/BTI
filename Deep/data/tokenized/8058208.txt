Using the in vivo microdialysis method, we have found that at moderate doses (1.44, 3.6 and 7.2 micrograms), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) facilitated norepinephrine (NE) release from the dentate gyrus of hippocampus in rats in a dose-response fashion. The same doses of CRF also enhanced locomotor activity in rats. On the other hand, CRF at the highest dose studied (14.4 micrograms) decreased NE release as well as locomotor activity in rats. These neuropeptide/neurotransmitter interactions may have significant physiological implications.
