The hippocampus is sensitive to the effects of ethanol and appears to have a role in the development of alcohol tolerance. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that there are innate differences in gene expression in the hippocampus of inbred alcohol-preferring (iP) and -nonpreferring (iNP) rats that may contribute to differences in sensitivity to ethanol and/or in the development of tolerance. Affymetrix microarrays were used to measure gene expression in the hippocampus of alcohol-naive male iP and iNP rats in two experiments (n=4 and 6 per strain in the two experiments). Combining data from the two experiments, there were 137 probesets representing 129 genes that significantly differed (P < or = 0.01); 62 probesets differed at P < or = 0.001. Among the 36% of the genes that were expressed more in the iP than iNP rat at this level of significance, many were involved in cell growth and adhesion, cellular stress reduction and anti-oxidation, protein trafficking, regulation of gene expression, synaptic function and metabolism. Among the 64% of the genes that had lower expression in the hippocampus of iP than iNP rats were genes involved in metabolic pathways, cellular signaling systems, protein trafficking, cell death and neurotransmission. Overall, the data indicate that there are significant innate differences in gene expression in the hippocampus between iP and iNP rats, some of which might contribute to the differences observed in the development of alcohol tolerance between the selectively bred P and NP lines.
