Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus has been considered to be a phenomenon closely related to learning and memory in the brain. In this paper, an integrated model of LTP is constructed based on hypotheses about both the mechanism of LTP induction and that of LTP maintenance, that is, the NMDA-receptor channel, protein phosphorylation and protein turnover. The validity of the model is discussed based on the results of computer simulations.
