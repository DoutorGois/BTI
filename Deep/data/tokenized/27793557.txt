Cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death worldwide, is frequently initiated or exacerbated by stress. In fact, chronic stress exposure and heightened reactions to acute psychological stress are both associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. This brief review focuses on the mechanisms by which corticolimbic nuclei, critical for stress appraisal and emotional reactivity, regulate heart rate and blood pressure responses to psychological stress. Both human and rodent data are examined with a major emphasis on basic studies investigating prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. A detailed literature review reveals substantial limitations in our understanding of this circuitry, as well as significant opportunities for future investigation that may ultimately reduce the burden of cardiovascular illness.
