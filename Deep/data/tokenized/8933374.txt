Methylazoxymethanol (MAM) is an alkylating agent that is used to induce microencephaly by killing mitotically active neuroblasts. We found that at later developmental times, MAM exposure can result in abnormal fiber growth in vivo. However, there have not been any previous studies on the effects of MAM on differentiating neurons. We examined the outcome of short exposure to MAM on postmitotic embryonic hippocampal cultures during the establishment of axonal polarity. At 0, 1, or 2 days in vitro (DIV), neurons were treated with 0.1 nM-1 microM MAM for 3 hr and then transferred to glial conditioned media. At 3 DIV, the cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescent staining for neuron viability and differentiation. Control cells initiate several minor processes; one process elongates rapidly at about 1 DIV eventually becoming an axon, while extensive dendritic growth occurs after 3-4 DIV. Neurons treated with 1 microM MAM at 0 or 1 DIV showed a marked inhibition of neurite growth and withdrawal of axons without affecting cell viability. These cells continued to show minimal neurite outgrowth at 7 DIV, even when transferred to a glial coculture. In contrast, cells treated initially with MAM, after neuronal polarity is established at 2 DIV, showed no effect on axonal growth. To determine the effects of MAM on the neuronal cytoskeleton, we examined the in vitro assembly of brain microtubules in a one cycle assay. Exposure to MAM depleted the soluble pool of proteins, including microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) and MAP2, which are required for neurite outgrowth, through a nonspecific process. Under non-saturating conditions, there were no changes in the total amount of microtubules assembled or the coassembly of MAP1B and MAP2 in the presence of MAM. These results demonstrate that MAM can directly affect differentiating neurons, indicating that an early disruption of axonal outgrowth may have long-term effects.
