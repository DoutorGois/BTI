OBJECTIVES: Hypoxic-ischemic tolerance can be induced in neonatal rats through hyperthermic preconditioning. The purposes of this study were to determine the interval between hyperthermic preconditioning and a subsequent hypoxic-ischemic insult that would provide optimal neuroprotection against the insult and to examine the relationship between tolerance induction and heat shock protein expression. STUDY DESIGN: On postnatal day 7 Wistar rat pups were separated into the following 2 groups: a heated group (those exposed to 15 minutes of hyperthermic pretreatment at a brain temperature of 41.5 degrees C-42.0 degrees C) and an unheated control group. At 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the hyperthermic stress, rats from both groups were exposed to left carotid artery ligation followed by 2 hours of hypoxia (8% oxygen and 92% nitrogen) at 33 degrees C. Twenty animals from each group were used at each time point. All rats were killed at 1 week after hypoxia-ischemia, at which time the brains were processed and neuronal damage in the cortex and hippocampus was assessed histologically. Another set of 7-day-old rats (n = 30) was studied immunohistochemically at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the same hyperthermic treatment. Expression of 72-kd heat shock protein was measured in neuronal, glial, and vascular endothelial cells. RESULTS: Hyperthermia-induced hypoxic-ischemic tolerance was observed at 6, 12, and 24 hours but not at 48 and 72 hours after hyperthermic preconditioning. Heat shock protein 72 expression in the vascular endothelial cells, rather than in the glial or neuronal cells, was most strongly associated with hypoxic-ischemic tolerance. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that heat shock protein 72 in endothelial cells plays an important role in the acquisition of hypoxic-ischemic tolerance at postnatal day 7, a time when maximal angiogenesis occurs and the blood-brain barrier is still immature.
