In sixty adult minks the hippocampus was dissected and measurements of its individual components were taken. Anatomical studies of the mink have been hardly undertaken, while the studies of the mink's brain can be considered as "terra incognita" (D. Goscicka). This is why it was decided to conduct an examination of the hippocampus of this animal.
