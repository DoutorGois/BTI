OBJECTIVE: To study the metabolic change in brain of rats with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the intervention effect with Anshen Jielu Recipe (AJR) on it. METHODS: Eight rats selected from 32 Wistar rats as normal group, the others were established as GAD model by using uncertainty empty water bottles method. Then the GAD rats were randomly divided into the model group (saline, by gastrogavage), the control group [buspirone hydrochloride, 2.0 mg/(kg x d), by gastrogavage], the treatment group [AJR, 12.5 g/(kg x d), by gastrogavage], 8 in each group, all were treated for 7 days. The concentration of cerebral metabolites, including N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr) and glutamate (Glu), in bilateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were measured using high-field strong super-conductivity (7.0T) animal MRI; and the ratio of NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr and Glu/Cr were calculated. The effect of AJR intervention was evaluated by changes of MRI before and after rats being treated with AJR for 7 days. RESULTS: Rats with GAD showed lowered ratios of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr, and elevated Glu/Cr ratio in the right prefrontal cortex than those in normal rats. After AJR intervention, the abnormal changes in the three indices were restored to certain extents. CONCLUSIONS: AJR has apparent antianxiety effect in rats with GAD, with the effect initiation faster than that in the control group. Its mechanism is probably correlated with the regulation of abnormal metabolism in the brain.
