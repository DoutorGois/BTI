Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) mediates endocrine, behavioral, and autonomic responses to stress. In addition to binding to two receptor subtypes, CRH binds to a CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP). While CRH-BP is hypothesized to play a role in regulating levels of free CRH and modulating the stress response, the effects of stressors on brain CRH-BP are relatively unexplored. The present study determined effects of acute and repeated restraint on CRH-BP mRNA in basolateral amygdala (BLA) and dorsal hippocampus (DH), brain regions involved in fear and motivation. Using in situ hybridization, we found that a single acute period of restraint significantly increased CRH-BP mRNA in BLA by 20% but had no effect in DH. Repeated restraint had no effect on basal levels of CRH-BP mRNA in BLA or DH. Importantly, repeated restraint blocked the effects of acute restraint in the BLA. These results demonstrate differential effects of acute and repeated restraint on CRH-BP mRNA.
