The presence of central cannabinoid receptor (CB1), involving the N-terminal 14 amino acid peptide, was demonstrated in the rat brain by immunohistochemistry. Intensely stained neurons were observed in the principal neurons of the hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra, cerebellar cortex, including the Purkinje cells. Moderate CB1-IR cell bodies and fibers were present in the olfactory bulb, cingulate, entorhinal and piriform cortical areas, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. The perivascular glial fibers have shown moderate to high density CB1-IR in olfactory and limbic structures. Low density was detected in the thalamus and hypothalamus and area postrema. The CB1 receptor was widely distributed in the forebrain and sparsely in the hindbrain. These new data support the view that the endogenous cannabinoids play an important role in different neuronal functions as neuromodulators or neurotransmitters.
