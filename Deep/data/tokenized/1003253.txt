Morphological alterations of the cerebral vasculature as related to the permeability of plasma proteins and angiographic contrast media following unilateral cerebral angiography were studied. Both Evans blue albumin and horseradish peroxidase were employed as protein tracers for light and electron microscopy investigation respectively. Grey matter regions of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum corpus striatum, hippocampus and midbrain showed the most extensive and consistent leakage of these protein tracers. The most extensive penetration of EBA was noted at 1 hr following cerebral angiography as compared to the 5 or 30 min sample times. Permeability changes were noted in small venules and arterioles as well as capillaries. The extent of permeability, however, was appreciably greater in the capillaires as evidences by rapid extravasation of HRP into the surrounding neuropil extracellular spaces. The glial basement membrane surrounding the perivascular spaces of small venules and arterioles precluded rapid penetration of HRP into the neuropil interstitium. Opening of the tight junctions between the endothelial cells was primarily responsible for the extravasation of HRP in all vessel types. Furthermore, it is out opinion that the hyperosmolar nature of the contrast medium is responsible for opening of these tight junctions.
