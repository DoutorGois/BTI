Treatment with the phencyclidine derivative ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and a well known anesthetic, has recently been introduced to mimic schizophrenia in animals. Using rats repeatedly treated with sub-anesthetic doses we demonstrate in the hippocampal formation the cellular distribution patterns of proteins being relevant to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Compared with controls an increase in the density of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase-, neuronal nitric oxide synthase- and cFOS-positive hippocampal interneurons was found, whereas the density of parvalbumin expressing cells was decreased. Our experiments show that repeated injections of sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine induce significant changes in the nitrergic and GABAergic system which, in part, resemble those described in postmortem brains of human schizophrenics indicating that sub-chronic treatment with sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine might be a useful animal model to study schizophrenia.
