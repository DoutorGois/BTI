Fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) is a relatively new member of the FGF family isolated from the conditioned medium of a human glioblastoma cell line as a secreting-type factor that exhibits a growth-stimulating effect on cultured glial cells. In order to elucidate the roles of FGF-9 in the central nervous system, we investigated in detail the distribution of FGF-9 proteins in the normal human and rat brains by immunohistochemistry using two different antibodies specific to FGF-9. In both human and rat, a strong expression of FGF-9 immunoreactivity was localized mainly in neurons throughout the normal brain. Immunoreactive glial cells were rarely encountered. In the human brain, strong and uniform immunoreactivity was observed in neurons of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, motor nuclei of the brainstem, and Purkinje cell layer. A detailed mapping in the rat brain showed a distribution of FGF-9 immunoreactivity in a widespread population of neurons, though the intensity varied between different locations and even among the same nucleus. The most prominent expression in rat was observed in neurons of the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, red nucleus, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, motor trigeminal nucleus, facial nucleus, reticular nucleus and Purkinje cell layer. These findings suggest that FGF-9 plays an important role in the central nervous system and may have a potential function closely connected to neurons in the normal brain.
