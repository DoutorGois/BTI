Mouse strains are well-characterized to exhibit differences in their physiological and behavioral responses to nicotine. This report examines the expression of the high-affinity nicotine binding receptor subunit, neuronal nicotinic receptor subunit alpha 4 (nAChR alpha 4), in the dorsal hippocampus of 27 inbred mouse strains. Multiple differences among mouse strains in the cellular expression of nAChR alpha 4 between subregions of the hippocampal field are evident. Differences that we describe in the expression of nAChR alpha 4 suggest mouse strains of diverse genetic origin could exhibit significant variation in how this receptor contributes to modulating intrahippocampal circuitry. These findings define a genetic frame-work in which the strain-specific responses to nicotine include underlying contributions by the varied anatomical context in which nAChRs are expressed.
