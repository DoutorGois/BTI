BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During cerebral ischemia, both promoting and limiting factors are present for activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ion channel and the dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive Ca2+ channels. We investigated the activity of these channels during ischemia and reperfusion in the rat hippocampus in situ. METHODS: Reversible ischemia was induced by bilateral carotid artery ligation. NMDA and BAY K8644 were applied by iontophoresis or pneumatic ejection, and extracellular field potential and resistance changes were recorded from the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Resting membrane potentials of the CA1 neurons were also recorded. RESULTS: DC potential shifts produced by NMDA and BAY K8644 were reduced when ischemia depressed the evoked activity more than 50%. They disappeared on total failure of synaptic transmission and recovered during reperfusion. When the evoked activity was depressed less than 50%, DC shifts were greater than their preischemic values; however, BAY K8644-induced potentiation did not reach statistical significance. CA1 neurons were depolarized during ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ischemia severe enough to cause transmission failure inactivates NMDA and DHP-sensitive Ca2+ currents. During less intense ischemia and reperfusion, NMDA and DHP-sensitive Ca2+ channels are functional, and their overactivation may lead to neurotoxicity.
