The objective of the present study was to examine both naturally occurring degrading events in axon terminals of the dentate gyrus and granule cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) throughout postnatal life. For that purpose, (1) a selective silver staining technique was applied to analyze neuronal lysosome accumulation (LA), indicating synaptic degradation during development. LA was quantified by counting silver grains in the inner third and outer two thirds of the molecular layer, granular layer, subgranular layer and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. (2) Proliferation of granule cells was identified by in-vivo labeling with 5-bromo-2'-desoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU-labeled granule cell nuclei were identified in consecutive horizontal slices along the mid-septotemporal axis of the hippocampus and light-microscopically quantified 4h after the BrdU-labeling. It was found (1) that in young animals LA significantly increased within all layers and reached adult levels after about 3 months. During subsequent development LA kept on this level throughout aging with highest values within the inner molecular layer. (2) There was a highly significant temporal gradient in granule cell proliferation with numbers of BrdU-labeled cells exponentially declining during juvenile life. Nevertheless, granule cell proliferation occurred throughout adult life and aging. The present results are discussed (1) with concepts of ongoing neuroplasticity and remodeling of neuronal networks in the developing and adult brain, and (2) with regard to pharmacologically induced neuromorphogenesis.
