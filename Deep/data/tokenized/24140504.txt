Depression is a common comorbid in diabetic patients. The pathophysiologic mechanisms that relate this comorbidity is not completely elucidated yet, although several lines of evidence point out that increased oxidative stress resulting from hyperglycemia may have a crucial role. Thus, the effect of prolonged treatment with insulin (INS), the antioxidant vitamin E (VIT E) or the antidepressant imipramine (IMI) was evaluated in animals submitted to forced swimming test. Oxidative stress parameters (lipid peroxidation product levels, reduced gluthatione levels and catalase and superoxide dismutase activities) were also evaluated in brain areas related to depression, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HIP). Our data show that treatment of streptozotocin-induced diabetic (DBT) rats with INS (6 UI/day, s.c.) prevented the blood glucose increase, reduced the immobility time, an antidepressant-like behavior, and normalized the reduced weight gain. Although the VIT E treatment (300 mg/kg, p.o.) had not altered the blood glucose levels, this treatment was able to reduce the immobility time and to reestablish the reduced weight gain in DBT rats. Differently, treatment with IMI (15 mg/kg, i.p.) induced antidepressant-like behavior in normoglycemic besides DBT animals. While VIT E and IMI treatments restored only specific oxidative stress parameters, INS was able to prevent all changed parameters evaluated in both PFC and HIP from DBT animals. Therefore, our data provide further evidence of the importance of oxidative stress in PFC and HIP in the pathophysiology of depression related to diabetes.
