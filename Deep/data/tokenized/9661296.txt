A modified method was developed for tissue-culturing postnatal hippocampal neurons using simple mechanical trituration for cell isolation and not including any hydrolysing enzymes, nerve growth factors or antiproliferating agents. The morphological properties of such neurons were characterized with light and interference polarizing microscopy, which revealed the appearance of growth cones from peripheral neurons and the presence of different types of neurons, including bipolar, stellate and pyramidal-like cells (i.e., pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells), which could be related to their putative counterparts in intact brain. The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp method was used for electrophysiological recordings of inhibitory synapses between these dissociated cultured neurons from the early postnatal rat hippocampus. This study indicated the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive and TTX-resistant inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in current-clamp and voltage clamp modes respectively. The coincident reversal potentials for IPSCs and for GABAA and glycine-evoked currents, and the sensitivity of the IPSCs to bicuculline or strychnine, indicated that these IPSCs were Cl-(-)dependent and mediated by either GABAA or glycine receptors. Inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded under voltage-clamp conditions decayed with a time course that could be fitted by a single exponential with a value of 26 ms. An average quantal content of 2.5 was responsible for a typical GABA and glycine-activated IPSC and a single quantum for GABAergic input was inferred to activate about 160, and for glycinergic, about 200 Cl-, channels.
