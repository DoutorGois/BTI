5'-Ether derivatives of the potent adenosine agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) were designed as "caged" ligands for the activation of A1-adenosine receptors following in situ photolysis. The synthesis involved a 2',3'-diol protection scheme using the acid labile ethoxymethynyl group. Generation of CPA was demonstrated chromatographically and in a bioassay measuring the inhibition of synaptic potentials in the rat hippocampus.
