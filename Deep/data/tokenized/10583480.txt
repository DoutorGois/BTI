Previous experiments using a classical fear conditioning paradigm have provided evidence that the processing of contextual conditional stimuli (CSs) by the hippocampus would be controlled by the amygdala through a modulation of hippocampal-lateral septal (H-LS) excitability. More specifically, our suggestion was that vasopressin release into the LS would occur in an elemental conditioning case [pairing CS-US (unconditional stimulus) procedure] and would result in less hippocampal-dependent contextual stimuli processing (i.e. overshadowing of CSs by the simple CS). Conversely, when an unpairing CS-US procedure is used, this would result in more contextual stimuli processing through a decrease in vasopressin release into the LS. The aim of the present experiment was to test this hypothesis using intraseptal injection of vasopressin or its V1/V2 antagonist. In agreement with this hypothesis, results suggest that vasopressin release into the LS would constitute a device by which priority is given to the more salient simple stimulus to the detriment of contextual information.
