This study was designed to investigate the effect of T. serrulatus scorpion venom on dopamine (DA) and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) concentrations in different regions of the brain. The ratio of homovanillic acid (HVA) to DA, and the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity were determined following intravenous or intracerebral venom injections. The increase in the HVA/DA ratio in the striatum after i.v. or intrastriatal injection could indicate an increase in DA turnover. One hour after i.v. injection of the venom GAD activity was shown to be decreased in the striatum and hypothalamus. After 24 hr GAD activity increased in the striatum and decreased in the hypothalamus and brain stem. These results could indicate different effects of the venom on the GABA system in different areas of the brain. After intrastriatal injection of the scorpion venom, the animals showed stereotyped behavior and rotation activity. Following intrahippocampal injection, myoclonus and orofacial automatisms, which constitute pro-convulsive signals, were observed. These behavioral alterations could be, at least in part, related to the GABA and dopamine alterations caused by the venom, since stereotypy, circling behavior and convulsions are dependent on dopamine and/or GABA.
