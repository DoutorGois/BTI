Ingestion of ammonium induces hyperammonemia which increases tubulin content in cerebrum but not in cerebellum. We have dissected 11 discrete areas of cerebrum and quantified the tubulin content in control and hyperammonemic rats. An heterogeneity in the induction of tubulin is shown. The areas more affected are ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, hypothalamus, septum, reticular formation and frontal cortex, in which tubulin content increased by 63%, 27%, 32%, 48%, 45%, and 25%, respectively, after two months of feeding the ammonium diet.
