BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that the long-term exposure of organophosphorus induces vascular dementia (VD) in rats. As a coenzyme, vitamin B6 is mainly involved in the regulation of metabolisms. Whether vitamin B6 improves VD remains unknown. METHODS: The model of VD was induced by feeding rats with isocarbophos (0.5 mg/kg per two day, 12 weeks). The blood flow of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) in rat was assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD). The learning and memory were evaluated by the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test. RESULTS: Administration of vitamin B6 increased the blood flow in the right and left posterior cerebral arteries and improved the functions of learning and memory in isocarbophos-treated rats. Vitamin B6 increased the protein levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) 2B, postsynaptic densities (PSDs) protein 95, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-II) in the hippocampus, which were decreased by isocarbophos in rats. Morphological analysis by light microscope and electronic microscope indicated disruptions of the hippocampus caused by isocarbophos were normalized by vitamin B6. Importantly, the antagonist of NMDAR signaling by eliprodil abolished these beneficial effects produced by vitamin B6 on PCA blood flow, learning, memory, and hippocampus structure in rats, as well as the protein expression of NMDAR 2B, PSDs protein 95, and CaMK-II in the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B6 activates NMDAR signaling to prevent isocarbophos-induced VD in rats.
