OBJECTIVE: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) has been described as a relevant factor for the development of topiramate-related depression and cognitive deficits. The aim of our study was to clarify whether patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and HS were also at risk during therapy with levetiracetam (LEV). METHODS: Data of 156 patients was analysed: 78 with TLE and HS and 78 with TLE and normal MRI matched for age, starting dose and titration schedule of LEV. Patients were selected from a population of consecutive patients started on LEV between 2000 and 2002. RESULTS: No differences were observed in prevalence of cognitive adverse events and depression between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: LEV treatment is not associated with cognitive adverse events and depression in patients with hippocampal sclerosis.
