Following interruption of the fornix-fimbria pathway, hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was restored gradually by cross-species cell suspension transplants of embryonic septum. The hippocampal segment closest to the implant reached 35% of normal 17 weeks after transplantation. The overall restoration of ChAT by xenogenic cell suspension had many similarities to that reported for homogenic solid and cell suspension septal grafts. The time course of the recovery of ChAT activity was different from the time course of the ingrowth of acetylcholinesterase stained fibers reported previously.
