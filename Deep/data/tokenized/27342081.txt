Synucleinopathy is characterized by abnormal accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn)-positive cytoplasmic inclusions and by neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments, but the pathogenesis mechanism of synucleinopathy remains to be defined. Using a transmission model of synucleinopathy by intracerebral injection of preformed A53T alpha-Syn fibrils, we investigated whether aberrant adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) signaling contributed to pathogenesis of synucleinopathy. We demonstrated that intra-hippocampal injection of preformed mutant alpha-Syn fibrils triggered a striking and selective induction of A2AR expression which was closely co-localized with pSer129 alpha-Syn-rich inclusions in neurons and glial cells of hippocampus. Importantly, by abolishing aberrant A2AR signaling triggered by mutant alpha-Syn, genetic deletion of A2ARs blunted a cascade of pathological events leading to synucleinopathy, including pSer129 alpha-Syn-rich and p62-positive aggregates, NF-kappaB activation and astrogliosis, apoptotic neuronal cell death and working memory deficits without affecting motor activity. These findings define alpha-Syn-triggered aberrant A2AR signaling as a critical pathogenesis mechanism of synucleinopathy with dual controls of cognition and neurodegeneration by modulating alpha-Syn aggregates. Thus, aberrant A2AR signaling represents a useful biomarker as well as a therapeutic target of synucleinopathy.
