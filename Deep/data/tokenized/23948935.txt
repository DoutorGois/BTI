Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors enhance memory, increase hippocampal neurogenesis, and reverse amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced memory deficits. Here, we examined whether long-form PDE4D knockdown by lentiviral RNA construct containing a specific microRNA/miRNA-mir hairpin structure (4DmiRNA) reversed memory impairment caused by amyloid-beta1-42 (Abeta42) in mice using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novelty object recognition tests. Western blotting analysis was used to assess protein levels of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB, unphosphorylated and phosphorylated [pCREB]), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) to explore the neurochemical mechanisms. Aggregated Abeta42 (0.5 mug/side) bilaterally infused in dentate gyrus decreased cAMP levels (p < 0.01) and produced memory deficits in the MWM (p < 0.01) and object recognition tests (p < 0.01). Microinfusions of lentiviruses resulted in downregulated expression of PDE4D4 and 4D5 proteins and reversed Abeta42-induced cAMP decline (p < 0.05) and memory deficits. Treatment also concomitantly increased pCREB (p < 0.05) and BDNF (p < 0.01) and reduced IL-1beta (p < 0.05), TNF-alpha (p < 0.01), and NF-kappaB (p65) (p < 0.05) in the hippocampus of Abeta42-challenged mice. These results suggest that long-form PDE4D knockdown may offer a promising treatment for memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease.
