We have searched for brain-specific extracellular molecules using a library of monoclonal antibodies against surface antigens of differentiated PC12h cells. One of the monoclonal antibodies, PCH42-14, recognized a 27/26-kDa protein of 10-week-old rat brain on immunoblotting. PCH42-14 antigen was detected only in brain, especially in cerebrum, olfactory bulb, mesencephalon, hippocampus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. On hippocampal neuron culture, PCH42-14 antigen existed extracellularly along with the neuronal extensions.
