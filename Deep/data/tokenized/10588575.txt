Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have produced controversial results concerning the correlation of hippocampal volume loss with increasing age. The goals in this study were: 1) to test whether levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, a neuron marker) change in the hippocampus during normal aging and 2) to determine the relationship between hippocampal NAA and volume changes. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) and MRI were used to measure hippocampal metabolites and volumes in 24 healthy adults from 36 to 85 years of age. NAA/Cho decreased by 24% (r = 0.53, p = 0.01) and NAA/Cr by 26% (r = 0.61, p < 0.005) over the age range studied, whereas Cho/Cr remained stable, implying diminished NAA levels. Hippocampal volume shrank by 20% (r = 0.64, p < 0.05). In summary, aging effects must be considered in 1H MRSI brain studies. Furthermore, because NAA is considered a marker of neurons, these results provide stronger support for neuron loss in the aging hippocampus than volume measurements by MRI alone.
