Following the intraventricular injection of a small amount of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT), the amount of radioactivity in telencephalic structures on the injected side was 6--7 times larger than that in corresponding areas on the opposite side. Moreover, a multiphasic disappearance of [3H]5-HT from whole brain or midbrain was found after the intraventricular injection of the labeled amine. However, after the intraventricular injection of [3H]tryptophan, the levels of [3H]5-HT in midbrain declined in a monophasic manner. A significant portion of the labeled amine derived from intraventricularly administered [3H]5-HT was resistant to the depleting effect of Ro4-1284 or to that elicited by destruction of the midbrain raphe nuclei, both of which caused an almost complete loss of endogenous 5-HT and labeled 5-HT formed from tryptophan. It thus appears that the intraventricular injection of [3H]5-HT leads to the formation of artifactual pools which are not present if the amine is synthesized in vivo. Studies with 6-hydroxydopamine suggested, however, that uptake of [3H]5-HT into adrenergic neurons did not occur to any great extent.
