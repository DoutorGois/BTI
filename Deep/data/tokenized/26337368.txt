Recent studies have highlighted the important role of the postsynaptic NMDAR-PSD95-CaMKII pathway for synaptic transmission and related neuronal injury. Here, we tested changes in the components of this pathway upon microwave-induced neuronal structure and function impairments. Ultrastructural and functional changes were induced in hippocampal neurons of rats and in PC12 cells exposed to microwave radiation. We detected abnormal protein and mRNA expression, as well as posttranslational modifications in the NMDAR-PSD95-CaMKII pathway and its associated components, such as synapsin I, following microwave radiation exposure of rats and PC12 cells. Thus, microwave radiation may induce neuronal injury via changes in the molecular organization of postsynaptic density and modulation of the biochemical cascade that potentiates synaptic transmission.
