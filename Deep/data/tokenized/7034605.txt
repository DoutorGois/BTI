Rabies virus was titrated from the hippocampus and salivary glands (mandibular, parotid, and sublingual) of 19 naturally infected skunks. Selection of the skunks was based on a positive fluorescent antibody test (FAT) on the hippocampus. One FAT- and virus isolation-negative skunk served as a control. The FAT was positive on 19 mandibular salivary glands, 16 parotid glands, and 17 sublingual glands. Rabies virus was subsequently isolated in albino Swiss mice from all (ie, 19) hippocampi and mandibular salivary glands, 16 parotid glands, and 17 sublingual glands. Virus was not isolated from the FAT-negative tissues. Titers (mouse intracerebral LD50/0.03 ml) were calculated in all FAT-positive tissues by the Reed-Muench method. Rabies titers from hippocampi ranged from 10(0.7) to 10(-4.5); from mandibular salivary glands, 10(2.8) to 10(-7.2); from parotid glands, 10(0.5) to 10(-5.8); and from sublingual glands, 10(-0.3) to 10(-3.8). Results indicate that "rabies-virus inhibiting substance" did not interfere with FAT or virus isolation from tissues of naturally infected skunks.
