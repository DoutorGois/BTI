The relationship between alpha-tocopherol, a known antioxidant, and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oxidation, has not been directly investigated in the primate brain. This study characterized the membrane distribution of alpha-tocopherol in brain regions and investigated the association between membrane alpha-tocopherol and PUFA content, as well as brain PUFA oxidation products. Nuclear, myelin, mitochondrial, and neuronal membranes were isolated using a density gradient from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), cerebellum (CER), striatum (ST), and hippocampus (HC) of adult rhesus monkeys (n = 9), fed a stock diet containing vitamin E (alpha-, gamma-tocopherol intake: ~0.7 micromol/kg body weight/day, ~5 micromol/kg body weight/day, respectively). alpha-tocopherol, PUFAs, and PUFA oxidation products were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-GC/MS) respectively. alpha-Tocopherol (ng/mg protein) was highest in nuclear membranes (p < 0.05) for all regions except HC. In PFC and ST, arachidonic acid (AA, microg/mg protein) had a similar membrane distribution to alpha-tocopherol. Total alpha-tocopherol concentrations were inversely associated with AA oxidation products (isoprostanes) (p < 0.05), but not docosahexaenoic acid oxidation products (neuroprostanes). This study reports novel data on alpha-tocopherol accumulation in primate brain regions and membranes and provides evidence that alpha-tocopherol and AA are similarly distributed in PFC and ST membranes, which may reflect a protective effect of alpha-tocopherol against AA oxidation.
