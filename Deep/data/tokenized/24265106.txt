Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation has recently become a main research target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment. In the present study, we transplanted NSCs from C57BL/6 mice into the hippocampus in the 12-month-old triple transgenic model of AD (3 x Tg) and determined whether NSC transplantation can alleviate impairments in spatial learning and memory via neuronal regeneration in AD mice. Two months after transplantation, Morris water maze tests suggested that spatial learning and memory in the 3 x Tg mice receiving NSCs was significantly improved compared to 3 x Tg mice not receiving NSCs. Furthermore, quantification of Nissl staining revealed that the number of neurons in the hippocampus of 3 x Tg mice receiving NSCs was significantly greater than that in 3 x Tg mice not receiving NSCs, indicating that new neurons were generated. These results may demonstrate that NSC transplantation can improve spatial learning and memory via neuronal regeneration in amyloid-beta precursor protein/presenilin 1/tau 3 x Tg mice.
