Immune mechanisms have been increasingly recognized in the pathogenesis of hippocampal sclerosis (HS), but infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells and its pathological significance in patients with HS has not been explored. We examined 30 cases of surgically resected hippocampi, including 16 International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) type 1, 9 ILAE type 2, 1 ILAE type 3 HS, and 4 ILAE No-HS, as well as 6 autopsy No-HS hippocampi. The HS hippocampi showed sparse to scattered CD8-positive T-cells, rare CD4-positive T-cells, and a modest increase in CD68-positive microglia/macrophages, which were significantly more numerous than those in the No-HS controls. The infiltration of CD8-positive T-cells was significantly greater in the CA1 subfield than other subfields of type 1 and type 2 HS. The numbers of CD8-positive T-cells positively correlated with those of CD4-positive T-cells; there was a lower ratio of CD4/CD8-positive T-cells. There were positive correlations between these cells and scores of neuronal loss but no significant correlation between the infiltration of these cells and epilepsy disease duration or age of epilepsy onset. These findings suggest that an autoimmune process may be involved in the pathogenesis of HS and infiltration of immune cells, particularly CD8-positive cytotoxic T-cells, may contribute to neuronal loss in HS.
