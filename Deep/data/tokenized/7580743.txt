Experiments performed on male rats with chronically implanted electrochemotrodes showed bemitil (12.5 and 25.0 mg/kg, intra-abdominally, 24 h prior to the locus creation) suppresses he pathological activity of (100 ED) epileptogenic locus induced by he sodium salt of penicillin in the hippocampus of the animals. Probable mechanisms of antiepileptic action of bemitil are considered.
