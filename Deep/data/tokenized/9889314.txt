Identification of trp (transient receptor potential) gene from Drosophila photoreceptor and subsequent molecular cloning of the human cDNA homologues suggest its participation in capacitative calcium entry (CCE) or so called store-operated Ca2+ channel (SOC). We identified five different trp-related amplifications of reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from rat brain; these corresponded to mouse trp homologues, mtrp1,3,4,5,6 and were distributed in various tissues with multiple expression levels. Two cDNAs, homologous to Drosophila trp from rat brain, designated rtrp3 and rtrp6, were isolated and characterized. By RT-PCR analysis, mRNAs of rtrp3 and rtrp6 were found to be expressed differently in brain and other tissues. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that rtrp6 mRNA was preferentially expressed in hippocampal dentate gyrus and cortical layers II and III. Expression of rat TRP3 and TRP6 in COS cells revealed an increase in CCE, as compared to that in the mock-transfected COS cells of the control. Isolation of cDNAs of rat trp gene family provides a useful model for studying mechanism of CCE.
