The neuroprotective effect of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) has been analysed in a rat model of seizures-associated brain damage. We report that after treatment with a convulsivant dose of Kainic acid, systemically administered aFGF prevents neuronal degeneration in specific brain areas, mainly in the hippocampal formation. Our findings extend the potential pharmacological use of fibroblast growth factors and afford new data to understand the neurophysiology of these proteins.
