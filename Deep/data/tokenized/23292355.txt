The aim of study was to investigate the effects of extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF; 50 Hz; 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mT) on oxidative stress in the brain of 3- (adult) and 10-month-old (middle-aged) gerbils. Nitric oxide (NO) level, superoxide (O2(-)) production, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and index of lipid peroxidation (ILP) were measured in the forebrain cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum immediately and 3 days after cessation of 7-day exposure. In all gerbils, ELF-MF significantly increased oxidative stress in all tested brain regions. This effect was correlated with the value of magnetic induction and was higher in middle-aged gerbils. Three days after cessation of exposure, the values of examined parameters were closer to control levels. In adult gerbils, the effect of ELF-MF of 0.1 mT on NO level, O2(-) production and SOD activity was almost fully disappeared, and ILP was at the control level regardless of the value of magnetic induction. In middle-aged gerbils, the effect of ELF-MF was still present but to a lesser degree than those observed immediately after cessation of exposure. These findings pointed out the ability of ELF-MF to induce age- and magnetic induction-dependent modification of oxidative stress in the brain.
