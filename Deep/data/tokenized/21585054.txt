OBJECTIVE: To explore the morphological basis of electroacupuncture (EA) in relieving addiction of ketamine. METHODS: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into normal control, normal saline (10 mL/kg), model and ketamine+ EA groups. Ketamine-addiction model was established by intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (100 mg/kg) , once a day for 7 days. EA (2 Hz) was applied to "Zusanli" (ST 36) and "Sanyinjiao"(SP 6) for 30 min, once a day for 7 days. The expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and c-fos in the hippocampal CA 1 region was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In comparison with the normal control group and normal saline group, the numbers of both TH immune-reaction (IR)-positive and c-fos IR-positive neurons in the hippocampal region in the model group were increased significantly (P<0. 05, P<0. 01). Correspondingly, the expression of both TH IR-positive and c-fos IR-positive products in the hippocampal CA 1 region in the model group was upregulated evidently (P<0. 05, P<0. 01). After EA of "Zusanli" (ST 36)-"Sanyinjiao" (SP 6), compared with the model group, the expression of both TH IR-positive and c-fos IR-positive products was downregulated considerably (P<0. 01). CONCLUSION: EA of "Zusanli"(ST 36)-"Sanyinjiao" (SP 6) can downregulate ketamine-addiction induced increase of expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and c-fos in the hippocampal CA 1 region in ketamine-addiction rats, which may contribute to its effect in relieving ketamine addiction symptoms in clinic.
