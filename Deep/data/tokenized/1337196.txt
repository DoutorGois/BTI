The interruption of GABA infusion in the cerebral cortex and in the hippocampus produces electrographic seizures in rats. Here, we have used the hippocampal slice preparation to induce a 'GABA withdrawal syndrome (GWS)'. With the stimulation parameters used (0.2 Hz, 200 microseconds), activation of the Schaffer afferents produced one population spike in the CA1 subfield, while multiple population spikes were observed in the slices previously incubated in GABA. Also, we recorded an increase in the amplitude of the population spike when compared to its control value. Paired pulse test showed absence of recurrent inhibition in these slices. These results suggest a dysfunction in GABAergic neurotransmission.
