The firing rate of the neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, the temperatures of the interscapular brown adipose tissue and of the colon (TIBAT and Tc) were monitored in 24 urethane-anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into four groups. These variables were measured before and after hippocampal injection of neostigmine (5x10(-7) mol) in the 1st and 2nd groups or of saline in the 3rd and 4th groups. The hippocampal injection was preceded by cortical spreading depression in the 1st and 3rd groups, while the cortical depression was not induced in the 2nd and 4th groups. The results show an increase of firing rate, TIBAT and Tc after neostigmine injection in the rats without cortical depression. Cortical spreading depression significantly reduces these enhancements. These findings demonstrate that: (1) the paraventricular nucleus plays a significant role in the hyperthermia induced by neostigmine injection into the hippocampus; and (2) the cerebral cortex is involved in the control of the paraventricular activity.
