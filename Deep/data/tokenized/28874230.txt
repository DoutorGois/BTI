Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders of humans and animals and no effective treatments are currently available. Allogenic transplantation of immortalized human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can prolong the survival of mice infected with prions. However, autologous transplantation is an appropriate model for evaluating the effects of MSCs on prion diseases. Therefore, we isolated and purified MSCs from the femur and tibia of mice as compact bone-derived MSCs (CB-MSCs). Flow cytometric analysis showed that CB-MSCs were negative for myeloid stem cell-derived cell markers CD11b and CD45, but positive for molecules such as Sca-1, CD105 and CD90.2, which are reported to be expressed on MSCs. The ability of CB-MSCs to migrate to brain extracts from prion-infected mice was confirmed by an in vitro migration assay. Intra-hippocampus transplantation of CB-MSCs at 120 days post-inoculation marginally but significantly prolonged the survival of mice infected with the Chandler prion strain. The transplantation of CB-MSCs did not influence the accumulation of disease-specific prion protein. However, the CB-MSC transplantation enhanced microglial activation, which appeared to be polarized to the M2-type activation state. These results suggest that autologous MSC transplantation is a possible treatment for prion diseases, while the modification of microglial activation may be a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.
