The calpain family of cysteine proteases has a well-established causal role in neuronal cell death following acute brain injury. However, the relative contribution of calpain isoforms has not been determined in in vivo models. Identification of the calpain isoform responsible for neuronal injury is particularly important given the differential role of calpain isoforms in normal physiology. This study evaluates the role of m-calpain and micro-calpain in an in vivo model of global brain ischemia. Adeno-associated viral vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs targeting the catalytic subunits of micro- or m-calpain were used to knockdown expression of the targeted isoforms in adult rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Knockdown of micro-calpain, but not m-calpain, prevented calpain activity 72 h after 6-min transient forebrain ischemia, increased long-term survival and protected hippocampal electrophysiological function. These findings represent the first in vivo evidence that reducing expression of an individual calpain isoform can decrease post-ischemic neuronal death and preserve hippocampal function.
