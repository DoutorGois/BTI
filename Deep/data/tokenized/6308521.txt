The relationship between the heterogeneous distribution of A-1 adenosine receptors and the capacity of adenosine to depress neuronal activity was examined in the rat hippocampus. Utilizing autoradiographic techniques, the distribution of A-1 adenosine receptors was assessed by the binding of [3H]cyclohexyladenosine ([3H]CHA) to cryostat sections of rat brain. The apical dendritic region of CA1 showed a differential distribution of adenosine receptors between the stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum/moleculare. The physiological relevance of this binding difference was studied in the hippocampal slice by examining the capacity of adenosine to depress evoked potentials in these two strata. It was observed that the receptor differences correlated with differential sensitivities to adenosine modulation of the evoked potentials. These data suggest that receptor density, as shown by binding techniques, may provide not only a qualitative but also a quantitative map of the sites of adenosine action.
