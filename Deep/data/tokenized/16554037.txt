The Homer family of scaffold proteins couples NMDA receptors to metabotropic glutamate receptors and links extracellular signals to calcium release from intracellular stores. Ania-3 is a member of the Homer family and is rapidly inducible in brain in response to diverse stimuli. Here, we report the identification of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) as a novel Ania-3/Homer-associated protein. Ania-3/Homer interacts with the b-splice forms of all PMCAs (PMCA1b, 2b, 3b, and 4b) via their PDZ domain-binding COOH-terminal tail. Ectopically expressed Ania-3 colocalized with the PMCA at the plasma membrane of polarized MDCK epithelial cells, and endogenous Ania-3/Homer and PMCA2 are co-expressed in the soma and dendrites of primary rat hippocampal neurons. The interaction between Ania-3/Homer and PMCAs may represent a novel mechanism by which local calcium signaling and hence synaptic function can be modulated in neurons.
