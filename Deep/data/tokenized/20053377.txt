Inflammation induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI) contributes to the development of injury in the newborn brain. In this study, we investigated the role of galectin-3, a novel inflammatory mediator, in the inflammatory response and development of brain injury in a mouse model for neonatal HI. Galectin-3 gene and protein expression was increased after injury and galectin-3 was located in activated microglia/macrophages. Galectin-3-deficient mice (gal3-/-) were protected from injury particularly in hippocampus and striatum. Microglia accumulation was increased in the gal3-/- mice but accompanied by decreased levels of total matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and nitrotyrosine. The protection and increase in microglial infiltration was more pronounced in male gal3-/- mice. Trophic factors and apoptotic markers did not significantly differ between groups. In conclusion, galectin-3 contributes to neonatal HI injury particularly in male mice. Our results indicate that galectin-3 exerts its effect by modulating the inflammatory response.
