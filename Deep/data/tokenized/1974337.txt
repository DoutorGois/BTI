Enduring synaptic potentiation can be induced in area CA1 of hippocampus by tetanic stimulation and by exposure to a medium containing high Ca2+ concentration. Both tetanic stimulation and high Ca2+ induce potentiation through voltage-dependent, post-synaptic mechanisms. Tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) was blocked by 50 microM D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) as previously reported by others. In contrast, Ca2(+)-induced long-lasting potentiation was not reduced by 50 microM APV. Thus the mechanisms by which tetanic stimulation and exposure to high Ca2+ induce synaptic potentiation may differ.
