Although juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has been considered as a disorder of thalamo-cortical circuit, it is not determined the causality relationship between thalamus and cortex. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is a disorder of thalamus or cortex. Twenty-nine patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and 20 normal controls were enrolled in this study. In addition, we included 10 patients with childhood absence epilepsy as a disease control group. Using whole-brain T1-weighted MRIs, we analyzed the volumes of the structures, including hippocampus, thalamus, and total cortex, with FreeSurfer 5.1. We also investigated the effective connectivity among these structures using SPSS Amos 21 based on these volumetric measures. The structural volumes in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy were not different from those in normal controls. There was a statistically significant effective connectivity from the total cortex to the thalamus in the patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. In addition, a significant effective connectivity from the hippocampus to the ipsilateral thalamus was revealed. Unlike the patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, neither the patients with childhood absence epilepsy nor normal controls had a significant effective connectivity from the total cortex to the thalamus or from the thalamus to the cortex. The connectivity of brain in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy could be different from that in patients with childhood absence epilepsy, and the cortex rather than the thalamus might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.
