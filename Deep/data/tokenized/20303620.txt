Olfactory and gustatory hallucinations are not often encountered in the acute care setting but may represent the subtle presenting features of a significant underlying disease process. We describe a patient whose most striking presenting symptoms were of olfactory and gustatory hallucinations and in whom the diagnosis and treatment of a new brain tumor and partial status epilepticus occurred entirely in the emergency department. The lesion was subsequently identified as glioblastoma multiforme involving the hippocampus and amygdala.
