Previous studies have shown an association between late-onset depression (LOD) and cognitive impairment in older adults. However, the neural correlates of this relationship are not yet clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in both cortical thickness and subcortical volumes between drug-naive LOD patients and healthy controls and explore the relationship between LOD and cognitive impairments. A total of 48 elderly, drug-naive patients with LOD and 47 group-matched healthy control subjects underwent 3T MRI scanning, and the cortical thickness was compared between the groups in multiple locations, across the continuous cortical surface. The subcortical volumes were also compared on a structure-by-structure basis. Subjects with LOD exhibited significantly decreased cortical thickness in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the superior and middle temporal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex when compared with healthy subjects (all p<0.05, false discovery rate corrected). Reduced volumes of the right hippocampus was also observed in LOD patients when compared with healthy controls (p<0.001). There were significant correlations between memory functions and cortical thickness of medial temporal, isthmus cingulate, and precuneus (p<0.001). This study was the first study to explore the relationships between the cortical thickness/subcortical volumes and cognitive impairments of drug-naive patients with LOD. These structural changes might explain the neurobiological mechanism of LOD as a risk factor of dementia.
