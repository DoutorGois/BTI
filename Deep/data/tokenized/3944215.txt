Regional protein synthesis was investigated in the rat brain during long-term recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia with 30 min of cerebral electrical silence. At various time intervals up to 14 days after glucose replenishment, animals received a single dose of L-[3,5-3H]tyrosine and were killed 30 min later. Brains were processed for autoradiography using the stripping film technique. Although hypoglycemia sufficiently severe to cause cessation of EEG activity leads to almost complete inhibition of amino acid incorporation in all "vulnerable" forebrain structures (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudoputamen), autoradiographs revealed a very specialized sequence with differential posthypoglycemic restoration of biosynthetic activity in certain neuronal cell types. Three major subpopulations could be distinguished: Neurons that fully regained their protein synthetic capacity within 6 h following hypoglycemia (cortical neurons of layer III-VI, large neurons in the caudoputamen, CA3 and CA4 pyramidal neurons, the majority of granule cells of the dentate gyrus) seemed to escape neuronal necrosis. Prolonged impairment of protein synthesis with only partial restoration during the early posthypoglycemic recovery period (CA1 neurons, most small- to medium-sized neurons of the caudoputamen) carried an increased risk of permanent cell damage. The large majority of these neurons, however, showed full recovery of protein synthesis as late as 7 days after hypoglycemia. Neurons with complete lack of amino acid incorporation after 6 h of recovery (granule cells at the crest of the dentate gyrus, small neurons of the dorsolateral caudoputamen) never resumed protein synthesis, regressed, and died. These studies in conjunction with morphological analysis indicate that the sequential recovery of protein synthesis reflects the extent to which neuronal populations are at risk during severe hypoglycemia.
