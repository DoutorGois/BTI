Cultures of septal and hippocampal neurons from fetal rat and dorsal root ganglion neurons from embryonic chick were pretreated with GM1 ganglioside or cycloheximide and then supplemented with toxic concentrations of ethanol. GM1 provided significant protection against ethanol neurotoxicity in each population. The inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide, however, which protects against cell death resulting from withdrawal of neurotrophic factor support, did not ameliorate ethanol-induced neuronal loss.
