Both familial and sporadic forms of Alzheimer disease (AD) present memory impairments. It has been proposed that these impairments are related to inflammation in relevant brain areas such as the hippocampus. Whether peripherally triggered and neuron-driven brain inflammation produce similar and equally reversible alterations is a matter of discussion. Here we studied the effects of ibuprofen administration on a familial AD mouse model overexpressing GSK-3beta that presents severe brain inflammation. We compared these effects with those observed in a peripherally triggered brain inflammation model based on chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Both proinflammatory stimuli produced equivalent reversible morphological alterations in granule neurons; however, GSK-3beta had a much more prominent role in newborn neuron connectivity, causing alterations that were not reversed by ibuprofen. Although both insults triggered similar behavioral impairments, ibuprofen rescued this defect in LPS-treated mice but did not produce any improvement in GSK-3beta-overexpressing animals. This observation could be attributable to the different microglial phenotype induced by ibuprofen treatment. These data may be clinically relevant for AD therapies, as GSK-3beta appears to determine the efficacy of ibuprofen treatment.
