The in vivo effects of beta-bungarotoxin (beta-BT) on the acetylcholine (ACh) system were studied in the whole cerebrum and in different brain regions. The effect of beta-BT on cerebral ACh and choline (Ch) contents was time-dependent. The results show that a single intracerebroventricular injection of 1 microgram toxin increased both the ACh and Ch contents in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, while in the striatum the ACh level was decreased. Ten nanograms of toxin injected into the lateral ventricle twice, on the first and third days, led to a reduced ACh level 2 days after the last treatment. In animals treated with the same dose three times, on the first, third, and fifth days, and sacrificed 2 days after the last injection, the choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities were reduced and the number of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was decreased. A biphasic effect of the toxin was therefore demonstrated. It is suggested that in the first phase of the toxin effect the increased levels of ACh and Ch may be due to the inhibition of neuronal transmission, while in the second phase, when the elements of the ACh system are reduced, the neuronal degenerating effect of beta-BT plays a significant role.
