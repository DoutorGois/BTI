To evaluate whether in vivo glutamate signals modulate signaling processes mediated by antioxidant-response element (ARE), we examined ARE binding in nuclear extracts from the hippocampus after in vivo treatment of mice with kainate. Enhancement of ARE binding was found at 2 h to 3 days after kainate treatment. Supershift analysis indicated possible involvement of Nrf2, Fos-B, and c-Fos in ARE binding in hippocampal nuclear extracts obtained from kainate-treated animals. On super-supershift analysis by combination of these antibodies, ARE probe/protein complex was shifted by the anti-Fos-B antibody alone, but not by the anti-c-Fos antibody alone, and further addition of the anti-Nrf2 antibody dramatically eliminated binding of the complex shifted by the anti-Fos-B antibody in hippocampal nuclear extracts from kainate-treated animals. Kainate treatment induced a profound increase in levels of c-Fos and Fos-B, without markedly affecting that of Nrf2 in nuclear extracts from the hippocampus. Co-localization of Nrf2 with both Fos-B and c-Fos was found in neuronal cell layers of the hippocampus in kainate-treated animals. RT-PCR analysis revealed that kainate treatment increases glutathione-S-transferase mRNA level in the hippocampus. Taken together, kainate signals may enhance nuclear ARE binding through an interaction between constitutive Nrf2 with inducible Fos-B expressed in murine hippocampus.
