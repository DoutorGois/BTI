In the current study, we investigated the participation of Bcl-2 in both processes of hippocampus neuronal stem cells (NSC) proliferation and differentiation. Present experiments are performed on organotypic cultures of mice hippocampus. A selective inhibitor Bcl-2 HA14-1 (10 muM) is supplied in incubating medium and the concentration is maintained at a constant level. Our data demonstrate that per cent of surviving cells is significantly higher in the group with the supplement HA14-1 then in the control group. In additional, expressions both phospho-histone H3 and Oct3/4 significantly increase in the group with supplement HA14-1. The facts suggest about activation of NSCs proliferation. After 6 weeks incubation, formation of embryoid bodies is observed in the group with HA14-1, that also suggest about NSCs proliferation, but not their differentiation. Also we estimate the level of NSCs differentiation. Our data have shown that the level of CRMP-2 (a protein which participates in axon growth during NSCs differentiation) decreases in the group with HA14-1. We also estimate level of ERK1/2 kinase activity of the MAPK signaling pathway, which immediately regulates neuronal differentiation. Decreasing of both activities ERK1/2 and CRMP-2 indicates diminution of neuronal differentiation in the experimental group. Thus, we demonstrate that inhibition of Bcl-2 increasingly stimulates NSCs proliferation, so that, it suggests that Bcl-2 controls NSCs differentiation to neurons.
