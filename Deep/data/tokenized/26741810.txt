Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a transcriptional coactivator involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and cell defense. The functions of PGC-1alpha in physiology of brain mitochondria are, however, not fully understood. To address this we have studied wild-type and transgenic mice with a two-fold overexpression of PGC-1alpha in brain neurons. Data showed that the relative number and basal respiration of brain mitochondria were increased in PGC-1alpha transgenic mice compared with wild-type mitochondria. These changes occurred concomitantly with altered levels of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as studied by proteomic analyses and immunoblottings. Cultured hippocampal neurons from PGC-1alpha transgenic mice were more resistant to cell degeneration induced by the glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid. In vivo kainic acid induced excitotoxic cell death in the hippocampus at 48 h in wild-type mice but significantly less so in PGC-1alpha transgenic mice. However, at later time points cell degeneration was also evident in the transgenic mouse hippocampus, indicating that PGC-1alpha overexpression can induce a delay in cell death. Immunoblotting showed that X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was increased in PGC-1alpha transgenic hippocampus with no significant changes in Bcl-2 or Bcl-X. Collectively, these results show that PGC-1alpha overexpression contributes to enhanced neuronal viability by stimulating mitochondria number and respiration and increasing levels of OXPHOS proteins and the anti-apoptotic protein XIAP.
