A series of experiments we examined in detail the effects of four chelating reagents, dithizone, DEDTC, oxine and EDTA, upon (1) Timm's staining in the hippocampal formation, (2) brain electrical activity recorded from hippocampal and cortical electrodes, (3) recovery effect with zinc acetate or zinc sulfate on abolished brain electrical activity, (4) open field activity, (5) toxicity, (6) and heart rate. Dithizone, DEDTC and oxine influenced all measures, and the degree of effect varied directory with dose. But EDTA has not any significant effect on biological system. Resulting data were summarized in Table 4.
