Inflammation influences the pathogenesis of seizures by boosting neuronal degeneration of temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS). This work aimed to determine the activity of metalloproteases (MMPs) in brain tissue fragments of TLE-HS patients and the effect of lobectomy on circulating inflammatory biomarkers. Surgical fragments (n=4) from epileptogenic focus (EF) e perilesion area (PL), and control hippocampus from autopsy (n=5) were processed for glial protein (GFAP), activated microglia (IB4) immunohistochemistry, and metalloprotease activity (MMP-2, -9). Perilesional area showed GFAP positive cells with morphology of activate astrocyte and reactive gliosis nearby the lesion. In the lesion foci, astrocytes had altered cytoarchitecture with disorganized stroma suggestive of necrosis, and numerous mononuclear cells with few projections and morphological characteristics of activate microglia. Analysis of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the sera before and after hippocampectomy confirmed the inflammatory pattern of TLE-HS, with high MMP-9 activity; high MMP-9/TIMP-1 and urokinase uPAR plasma levels before lobectomy but low after surgery. Maintenance of MMP-2 activity indicates persistent tissue remodeling in both groups. The present work shows that patients with chronic and medically intractable TLE-HS that undergone amigdalo-hippocampectomy for removal of epileptogenic lesion had a clinical enduring benefit of lack seizure recurrence for up to a year, and consistent reduction of proteases (MMP-9 and uPAR) activation that participate as important inflammatory epileptogenic inducers.
