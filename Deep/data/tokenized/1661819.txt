Quantitative in situ hybridization techniques were used to examine the effects of lesions which sever hippocampal cholinergic and cortical afferents on p75NGFR mRNA-expressing cells located in the medial septum (MS) and the vertical (VDB) and horizontal (HDB) limbs of the diagonal band of Broca. Animals received either bilateral transection of the fimbria/fornix, unilateral transection of the angular bundle, or sham surgery. Four days later, animals were sacrificed and sections through the MS, VDB and HDB were processed for detection of the p75NGFR mRNA using in situ hybridization techniques previously described (Mol. Brain Res., 6 (1989) 275-287). Transection of the fimbria/fornix and angular bundle differentially affected p75NGFR-expressing cells in the MS, VDB and HDB within 4 days after injury, in ways which were consistent and correlate with subsequent effects on cell survival, synaptic reorganization and growth. In particular, in the MS and VDB, transection of the fimbria/fornix resulted in a significant decrease in the size of p75NGFR-expressing cells (reductions of 25.9% and 15.1% respectively) which was accompanied by a significant reduction (37.9% and 12.7% fewer grains/cell) in relative levels of p75NGFR mRNA. In contrast, in the HDB, transection of the fimbria/fornix had no significant effect on the average size of p75NGFR-expressing cells; however, a significant increase (49%) in the mean relative level of p75NGFR mRNA was observed which may, in turn, reflect a large increase (as much as 2-3 fold) in the levels of p75NGFR mRNA expressed by a subpopulation of hippocampally projecting cholinergic neurons located in the HDB. Finally, transection of the angular bundle resulted in small, but significant increases (9.4% and 10.9%) in relative levels of p75NGFR mRNA in the MS and VDB, as well as an increase (19.6%) in the number of p75NGFR mRNA-expressing cells in the HDB, on the injured side. No increases in p75NGFR expression in the MS, VDB or HDB contralateral to the lesion were observed; however, a decrease in the size (6.9%) and message content (19.4%) of p75NGFR-expressing cells was detected in the MS contralateral to the lesion. Most importantly, all of these effects are consistent with the subsequent effects of these lesions on the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic cells, and the reorganization and growth of cholinergic afferents to the hippocampal formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
