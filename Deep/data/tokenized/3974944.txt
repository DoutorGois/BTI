Cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus was examined in the rat by immunocytochemical localization of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity combined with retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated wheatgerm agglutinin. It was found that at least 50% of hippocampal afferents arising in the septal-diagonal band region consisted of non-cholinergic projection neurons. In addition, scattered choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons were localized to the hippocampal formation. These results indicate that: (1) the septohippocampal pathway is neither uniformly nor predominantly cholinergic; and (2) confirm that cholinergic innervation of the hippocampal formation of the rat is derived in part from intrinsic neurons.
