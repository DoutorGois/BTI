Explants from trigeminal ganglia and skin of chick embryos and hippocampus from fetal rats were cultivated in Maximow assembly in the presence of Solcoseryl (Solco AG, Basel), a blood extract of calf. Solcoseryl in vitro did not influence the regeneration of nerve fibers from CNS explants. A stimulatory effect of Solcoseryl in vitro by 1% concentration on the outgrowth of new processes in explants of PNS was demonstrated. It is discussed: under optimal concentration Solcoseryl may be important for the influence of the composition of the medium in which explants of the nerve system and skin are cultivated.
