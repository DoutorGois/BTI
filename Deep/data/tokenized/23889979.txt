BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is activated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. ER stress-triggered unfolded protein response (UPR) leads to tau phosphorylation and neuronal death. AIMS: In this study, we tested the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced m-calpain activation is involved in ER stress-mediated AD pathogenesis. METHOD: We employed a hypoxic exposure in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing human Swedish mutation APP (APPswe). RESULTS: We observed that hypoxia impaired spatial learning and memory in the APP/PS1 mouse. In the transgenic mouse brain, hypoxia increased the UPR, upregulated apoptotic signaling, enhanced the activation of calpain and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), and increased tau hyperphosphorylation and beta-amyloid deposition. In APPswe cells, m-calpain silencing reduced hypoxia-induced cellular dysfunction and resulted in suppression of GSK3beta activation, ER stress and tau hyperphosphorylation reduction as well as caspase pathway suppression. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that hypoxia-induced abnormal calpain activation may increase ER stress-induced apoptosis in AD pathogenesis. In contrast, a reduction in the expression of the m-calpain isoform reduces ER stress-linked apoptosis that is triggered by hypoxia. These findings suggest that hypoxia-triggered m-calpain activation is involved in ER stress-mediated AD pathogenesis. m-calpain is a potential target for AD therapeutics.
