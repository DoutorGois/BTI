Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) is an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase/deacylase, and is involved in a variety of biological processes relevant to the transcription of rRNA, the DNA damage response, tumorigenesis, and metabolism. SIRT7 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously, including in the brain, but there is no detailed information about the anatomical distribution and functional role of SIRT7 in the brain. Here, we demonstrated that SIRT7 is widely expressed in the mouse brain, including in the cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. Behavioral examinations revealed that Sirt7 knockout (KO) and control mice showed similar levels of freezing behavior immediately after a fear response, but a significant decrease of freezing behavior at 24 h after fear conditioning was observed in Sirt7 KO mice. Histological analysis revealed that there is no apparent structural abnormality of the amygdala and hippocampus, which are regions involved in fear memory consolidation, in Sirt7 KO mice. Our results indicate that SIRT7 is involved in the consolidation of fear memory.
