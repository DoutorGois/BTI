Synapse loss is crucially involved in cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study was performed to investigate the distribution and density of chromogranin B-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of control compared to AD brain. Chromogranin B is a large precursor molecule found in large dense-core vesicles. For immunocytochemistry we used an antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide (PE- 11) present in the chromogranin B molecule. Chromogranin B-like immunoreactivity was concentrated in the terminal field of mossy fibers, the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in layer II of the entorhinal cortex. In AD, chromogranin B was detected in neuritic plaques. The density of chromogranin B-like immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in layers II, III and V of the entorhinal cortex in AD brains. The present study demonstrates that chromogranin B is a marker for human hippocampal pathways. It is particularly suitable for studying nerve fibers terminating at the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. It is present in neuritic plaques, and its density is reduced in a layer-specific manner.
