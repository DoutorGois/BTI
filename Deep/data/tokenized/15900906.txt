Effects of exogenous dehydroepiendrosterone (DHEA) administration on the levels of lipid proxidation products, malondialdyde (MDA)-a thiobarbuteric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in different brain regions viz. cerebral cortex, hippocampus cerebellum, and brain stem of 12 and 22 months old rats were studied. DHEA treatment significantly depressed TBARS and 4-HNE in all the brain regions studied, in both the age group rats. Interestingly, the magnitude of decrease was higher in the 22 months old rats than that in 12 months old rats. The results suggest that older the animal, better will be the response of exogenous DHEA administration against age-related peroxidative products.
