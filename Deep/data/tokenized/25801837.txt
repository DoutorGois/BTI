Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as new regulators in the pathogenesis of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and playing a major role in the inflammatory and immune processes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the dynamic expression of brain-specific miR-183 and miR-135a, brain-enriched miR-125b and miR-128 and inflammation-related miR-30c and miR-27a. Status epilepticus evoked by pilocarpine administeration was used to induce epilepsy in rats. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on rat hippocampus 2 hours, 3 weeks and 2 months following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, representing the acute, latent, and chronic phases, respectively. Expression levels were also measured in hippocampus obtained from TLE patients and normal controls. In the rat model, miR-183, miR-135a and miR-125b were detected upregulated during the acute and chronic phases compared to controls, but not during the latent phase. miR-30c and miR-27a were upregulated in the acute and chronic phases of TLE, while in the latent phase miR-30c was downregulated and miR-27a was upregulated. On the other hand, miR-128 showed significantly downregulated in all phases of TLE development. In TLE patients, miR-183, miR- 135a, miR-125b, miR-30c and miR-27a were upregulated, whereas miR-128 was downregulated. Our study revealed upregulation of miR-183, miR-135a and miR-125b in the seizure-related phases and TLE patients, suggesting that all may provide a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of TLE, whereas the dysregulation of miR-128, miR-30c and miR-27a may suggest different functions during the process of TLE development.
