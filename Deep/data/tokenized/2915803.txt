A 76-year-old man without apparent dementia met pathologic criteria at autopsy for Alzheimer's disease, which included a maximum senile plaque density greater than 15 per square millimeter of neocortex. Despite hippocampal sclerosis, changes typical of Alzheimer's disease were not found in this region or in basal forebrain. Choline acetyltransferase activity in hippocampus, septum, and parietal cortex was normal.
