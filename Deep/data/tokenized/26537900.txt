Studies have shown that neurofibromin (NF1) restricts GABA release at inhibitory synapses and regulates dendritic spine formation, which may play an important role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). NF1 expression was detected by double-label immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis in the brains of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model rats at 6 h, 24 h, 72 h, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, and 60 days after kindling. NF1 was localized primarily in the nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons. NF1 protein levels significantly increased in the chronic phase (from 7 days until 60 days) in this epileptic rat model. After NF1 expression was knocked down by specific siRNA, the effects of kindling with pilocarpine were evaluated on the 7th day after kindling. The onset latencies of pilocarpine-induced seizures were elevated, and the seizure frequency and duration were reduced in these rats. Our study demonstrates that NF1 promoted seizure attacks in rats with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy.
