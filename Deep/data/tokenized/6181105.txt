Following an olfactory bulb lesion in guinea pig (2 to 3 days), neuronal degeneration occurs in several olfactory-bulb-related areas, primarily in the piriform cortex. The degenerating neurons, which are argyrophilic, are also found in the posterolateral cortical amygdaloid nucleus and the ventrolateral entorhinal cortex. It is suggested that the neurons degenerate because of a transneuronal effect due to a sudden loss of afferent input from the olfactory bulb, although a retrograde effect acting in concert with transneuronal factors cannot be excluded. Terminal degeneration can be identified in several areas outside the olfactory bulb projection area, and is interpreted as degeneration in the axons of the degenerating cortical neurons. Such terminal degeneration, which is best seen 3 to 4 days postoperatively, has been identified in part of the basolateral amygdaloid complex, in the basomedial amygdaloid nucleus, and in the temporal parts of the fascia dentata of the hippocampal formation. Terminal degeneration has also been observed in the deep layers of the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract, and the anterior amygdaloid area. All these projections, apparently, represent the second link in two-neuron pathways, where mitral or tufted cells in the olfactory bulb make up the first neuron. This interpretation was confirmed in control experiments in which areas of argyrophilic neurons coincided with the location of retrogradely labeled neurons following injection of fluorescent substances into several of the above-mentioned areas of terminal degeneration.
