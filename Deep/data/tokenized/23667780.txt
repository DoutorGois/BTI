Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a proinflammatory cytokine that may play multiple roles in the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study determined time-dependent changes in IL-6 concentrations in vulnerable brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, and plasma after normothermic TBI. Because secondary insults are common in head injured patients, we also assessed the consequences of a post-traumatic secondary hypoxic insult on this pleiotropic cytokine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were intubated, anesthetized, and underwent a moderate parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury (1.8-2.1 atm, 37 degrees C) followed by either 30 minutes of normoxic or hypoxic (pO(2) = 30-40 mmHg) gas levels. Rats were sacrificed 3, 6, or 24 hours after TBI or shamoperated procedures. Brain samples, including the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus were dissected and analyzed. Plasma and CSF samples were collected at similar times and stored at -80 degrees C until analysis. IL-6 levels were significantly increased ( p < 0.05) at 3, 6, and 24 hours in the cerebral cortex and at 6 hours in the hippocampus after TBI. IL-6 levels in the TBI normoxic group for both structures returned to control levels by 24 hours. Plasma levels of IL-6 were elevated at all time points, while CSF levels were high at 3 and 6 hours, but normalized by 24 hours. Post-traumatic hypoxia led to significantly elevated ( p < 0.05) IL-6 protein levels in the cerebral cortex at 24 hours compared to sham-operated controls. These findings demonstrate that moderate TBI leads to an early increase in IL-6 brain, plasma, and CSF protein levels. Secondary post-traumatic hypoxia, a common secondary injury mechanism, led to prolonged elevations in plasma IL-6 levels that may participate in the pathophysiology of this complicated TBI model.
