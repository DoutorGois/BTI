Light microscopic examination of the hippocampus was carried out in young rats (intact and injected with propofol and mexidol according to different protocols). Propofol had a negative effect on hippocampal neurons causing an almost 2-fold increase in the count of modified cells in comparison with the normal level. Mexidol effectively corrected these shifts.
