The influence of alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists combined with drugs which act as antagonists at muscarinic and nicotinic receptor sites on epileptic focus produced by topic penicillin application was investigated. The beta-receptor blocking agent caused a faster and more intense activity of epileptogenic focus in comparison with activity in control animals, but the number of seizures decreased relatively for 25%. N-receptor antagonists diminished the facilitating effect of the beta-receptor antagonist on focal activity. Combination of m- and beta-receptor antagonists did not influence the spike activity of the focus. Treatment with alpha-receptor antagonists enhanced spikes and number of seizures only insignificantly. The combination of alpha- and n-receptor blocking substances does not influence the development of the epileptic process. The alpha-receptor antagonist together with the m-receptor blocking drug induces a facilitation of spike activity.
