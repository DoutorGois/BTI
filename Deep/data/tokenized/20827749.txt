The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest neurogenic region in the adult rodent brain. In the adult SVZ, unlike in the embryonic brain, neuronally committed precursor cells (neuroblasts) maintain their proliferative activity while migrating toward the olfactory bulb (OB), suggesting that they are inhibited from exiting the cell cycle. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the unique ability of adult neuroblasts to proliferate during migration. Here, we studied the expression and function of Diversin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathways. In the neonatal and adult mouse brain, Diversin expression was observed in neuroblasts and mature neurons in the SVZ and hippocampus. Retrovirus-mediated overexpression of Diversin promoted the proliferation of neuroblasts and increased the number of neuroblasts that reached the OB. Conversely, the knockdown of Diversin decreased the proliferation of neuroblasts. Our results indicate that Diversin plays an important role in the proliferation of neuroblasts in the SVZ of the adult brain.
