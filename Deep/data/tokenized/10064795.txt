Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) provide a powerful control of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and may serve as a target for drug development in human temporal lobe epilepsies. Agonists and antagonists at these receptors influence the development and propagation of seizures in some animal models of epilepsy. Experimental seizures can change the level of expression of mGluRs in the rat hippocampus. In the human dentate gyrus of patients suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), group III mGluR mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission is almost lost in the sub-group with Ammon's horn sclerosis. We tested the modulation of synaptic transmission by the group III mGluR specific agonist L(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) in the dentate gyrus outer molecular layer in control and amygdala-kindled rats, a common model for TLE. Extracellular field potential recordings upon subthreshold stimulation of lateral perforant path fibers were measured simultaneously in the outer molecular layer and granule cell layer. Analysis of 'paired-pulse' characteristics in the absence and presence of L-AP4 and group III mGluR mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission in the lateral perforant path revealed no significant alterations in fully kindled rats. Since there is no evidence of altered L-AP4 responses, a loss of group III mGluR function, particularly that of subtype mGluR8, seems not necessary for the kindling epilepsy.
