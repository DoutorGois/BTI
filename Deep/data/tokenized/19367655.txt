Highly water-soluble 3,4:9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic ammonium with quantitative fluorescence quantum yield was designed. Owing to the high negative electrostatic potential of the perylene plane, the perylene dye remained stable over a broad pH range and was successfully applied as a high-performance fluorochrome for living hippocampal neurons staining.
