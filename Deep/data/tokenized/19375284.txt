A previous report found an association between ApoE isoforms and postictal confusion in medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We performed a molecular epidemiology study in an independent sample of 77 TLE patients. We failed to replicate the original allelic association between ApoE epsilon4 allele and postictal confusion in our population (chi(2)=1.67; d.f.=1; p=0.2). Thus, the association between ApoE epsilon4 allele and postictal confusion still needs to be fully investigated in different and independent populations.
