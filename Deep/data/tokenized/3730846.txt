Limbic kindling was examined in genetically epilepsy-prone (GEPR) and non-epileptic control rats. The early stage of kindling development was accelerated in both groups of GEPR rats compared to controls. Later stages of kindling were accelerated in GEPR-9 but not GEPR-3 rats. These results indicate that GEPR rats have an enhanced susceptibility to limbic kindling and suggest that limbic brain alterations may contribute to acceleration of the early stage kindling development in GEPR rats.
