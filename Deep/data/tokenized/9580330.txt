Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and migration, and neurite outgrowth. Since these processes have been found to be under thyroid control in the developing rat brain, we have investigated the effect of congenital hypothyroidism on tenascin-C expression. At birth, in situ hybridization studies in hypothyroid rats show an abnormal up-regulation of tenascin-C in some areas (caudate-putamen, geniculate nuclei, ependymal epithelium of the lateral ventricles, hippocampus) and down-regulation in others (occipital and retrosplenial cortex, subiculum). With subsequent development, hypothyroid animals show higher tenascin-C expression also in the upper layers of the cerebral cortex and subplate, and the Bergmann glia of the cerebellum. Significantly, thyroxine treatment of hypothyroid rats led to normalization of tenascin-C levels in most areas. In agreement with the messenger RNA data, hypothyroid rats contain an uniformly higher level of immunoreactive tenascin-C protein throughout the brain, particularly in the cerebellum. Suggesting a direct cellular effect, thyroid hormone also decreases tenascin-C expression in two glial cell lines (C6, B3.1) expressing thyroid receptors. Our results show that congenital hypothyroidism causes specific alterations in the pattern of tenascin-C expression in the rat brain which may at least partially be responsible for some of the developmental disturbances observed in this syndrome.
