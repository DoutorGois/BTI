The incorporation rate of 3H-leucine into high- and low- molecular weight protein fractions of the motor cortex, hippocampal CA3 field and caudate nucleus was investigated after disruption of nucleus raphe dorsalis and nucleus raphe medialis to show an increase in the incorporation rate. The results obtained are discussed in the aspect of reciprocity of the serotonin- and noradrenergic systems on protein metabolism of the central nervous system.
