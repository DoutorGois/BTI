Stereoselective differences in pharmacokinetics between clausenamide (CLA) enantiomers have been found after intravenous and oral administration of each enantiomer to rats. The differences could be associated with protein binding of CLA enantiomers. By equilibrium dialysis methods, the binding of CLA enantiomers to rat plasma protein was investigated. The results showed that mean percentages of (-) and (+)CLA in the bound form were 28.5% and 38.0%, respectively, indicating that the unbound fraction of (-)CLA was higher than that of (+)CLA, which provided an explanation for stereoselective pharmacokinetics of CLA enantiomers in rats. The results also showed that there were species differences in plasma protein binding of (-)-isomer between rats (28.5%) and rabbits (47.2%). Furthermore, effects of plasma protein binding on the distribution of CLA enantiomers to their possible target tissues were observed. The amount of (-)CLA in brain was greater than that of (+)CLA 15 min after administration of each enantiomer to rats. But the results were reverse at 4 h postdose. Further studies in distributional kinetics showed that (-)CLA had a more rapid absorption and distribution to hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum than (+) CLA. (+)CLA had greater values for T(max), t(1/2) (beta), and AUC(0) (-->infinity), and smaller ones for CL/F and V(d)/F than its antipode. The data indicated that the distribution of (-) and (+)CLA in their target tissues was stereoselective. The stereoselective distribution might be involved in the metabolism and transport of two enantiomers in the central nerve system.
