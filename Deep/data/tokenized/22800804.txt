Polyunsaturated essential fatty acids (PUFAs) play a pivotal role in mediating cognitive, learning, and memory functions. We propose that PUFAs directly affect the neuronal membrane. PUFAs serve to stabilize and protect the structure and functions of the neuronal membrane. PUFAs exert many effects on the brain with respect to physiology, brain biochemistry, and disorders of the central nervous system. Many of these functions have effects at the cognitive level. This summary demonstrates that a deficiency in brain PUFAs will lead to cognitive deficits, while supplementation of PUFAs can rehabilitate cognitive deficits, as manifested in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, stress/anxiety, and aging.
