Pathophysiological conditions such as cerebral ischemia trigger the production of new neurons from the neurogenic niche within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus. The functional significance of ischemia-induced neurogenesis is believed to be the regeneration of lost cells, thus contributing to post-ischemia recovery. However, the cell signaling mechanisms by which this process is regulated are still under investigation. Here, we investigated the role of mitogen and stress-activated protein kinases (MSK1/2) in the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia. Using the endothelin-1 model of ischemia, wild-type (WT) and MSK1(-/-)/MSK2(-/-) (MSK dKO) mice were injected with BrdU and sacrificed 2 days, 4 weeks, or 6 weeks later for the analysis of progenitor cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and neuronal morphology, respectively. We report a decrease in SGZ progenitor cell proliferation in MSK dKO mice compared to WT mice. Moreover, MSK dKO mice exhibited reduced neurogenesis and a delayed maturation of ischemia-induced newborn neurons. Further, structural analysis of neuronal arborization revealed reduced branching complexity in MSK dKO compared to WT mice. Taken together, this dataset suggests that MSK1/2 plays a significant role in the regulation of ischemia-induced progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Ultimately, revealing the cell signaling mechanisms that promote neuronal recovery will lead to novel pharmacological approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral ischemia.
