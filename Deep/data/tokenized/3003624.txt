Noradrenaline (NA) synthesis in rat hippocampal synaptosomes is increased by calcium ionophore, A23187, in the presence of calcium. Activation of presynaptic muscarinic, gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors causes inhibition of the ionophore-stimulated synthesis. The results suggest that different mechanisms mediate the depression by presynaptic receptors of NA release and NA synthesis.
