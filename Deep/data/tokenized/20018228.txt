Studies have shown that maternal chronic stress or depression is linked to an increased risk for affective disorders in progeny. However, the impact of maternal chronic stress before pregnancy on their progeny in animal models has not been well studied. We investigated the behaviors and the neurobiology in 60-day-old male progeny of maternal rats exposed to a 21-day chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) before pregnancy, with male progeny of unstressed maternal rats as the control. Sucrose consumption test showed that both sucrose intake and sucrose consumption percentage of the CUS progeny were lower than those of the control progeny (P<0.05). The number of times crossing the removed hidden platform in the CUS progeny was significantly fewer than that in the control progeny in Morris water maze test (P<0.05). The level of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the hypothalamus was reduced but the level of norepinephrine (NE) in the hippocampus was increased in CUS progeny when compared to the control (P<0.05). Western blotting showed that the relative level of phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB) in the CUS progeny was lower than that in the control progeny (P<0.05). There were significant positive correlations between sucrose consumption percentage and the level of 5-HT in hypothalamus P<0.05) or the level of P-CREB in hippocampus (P<0.05). In conclusion, depression or stressful events before pregnancy was also associated with high risk of depression in progeny, and the down-regulation of P-CREB in the hippocampus might be one of the mechanisms underlying depression in the CUS progeny.
