This study presents a quantitative comparison of the time courses and regional distribution of both constitutive HSC73 and inducible HSP72 mRNA expression and their respective encoded proteins between young (3-week-old) and adult (3-month-old) gerbil hippocampus after transient global ischemia. The constitutive expression of HSC73 mRNA and protein in the hippocampus of the young sham-operated gerbils was significantly higher than in the adults. The HSC73 mRNA expression after ischemia in the CA1 layer of young gerbils was greater than in adult gerbils. HSC73 immunoreactivity was not significantly changed after ischemia-reperfusion in adult hippocampus, whereas it decreased in young gerbils. Ischemia-reperfusion led to induction of HSP72 mRNA expression throughout the hippocampus of both young and adult gerbils. HSP72 mRNA induction was more intense and sustained in the CA1 subfield of young gerbils; this was associated with a marked induction of HSP72 proteins and neuronal survival. The transient expression of HSP72 mRNA in the CA1 layer of adult gerbils was not associated with a subsequent synthesis of HSP72 protein but was linked to neuronal loss. Expression of HSP72 mRNA was shifted to an earlier period of reflow in CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of young animals. These findings suggest that the induction of both HSP72 mRNA and proteins in the CA1 pyramidal neurons of young gerbils, as well as the higher constitutive expression of HSC73, may partially contribute to higher neuronal resistance of young animals to transient cerebral ischemia.
