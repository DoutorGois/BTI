Raloxifene is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator recently launched in Japan as a new medicine for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Raloxifene stimulates neurite outgrowth in cultured cells and increases hippocampal cholineacethyl trasferase activity and serotonin receptor in the brain of ovariectomized rats. As a part of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation trial, 7,478 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were studied by using six tests of cognitive function. There was some evidence that Raloxifene may lower the risk of a decline in memory and attention. It is expected that novel SERM, which has more specific efficacy improving cognitive function will be developed.
