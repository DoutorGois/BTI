This protocol describes the preparation of hippocampal slice cultures from rat or mouse pups using sterile conditions that do not require the use of antibiotics or antimycotics. Combining very good optical and electrophysiological accessibility with a lifetime approaching that of the intact animal, many fundamental questions about synaptic plasticity and long-term dynamics of network connectivity can be addressed with this preparation.
