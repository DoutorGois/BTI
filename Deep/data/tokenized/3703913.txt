The effect of DSP4, a noradrenergic neurotoxin, on hippocampal kindling were examined in rats. The depletion of NA induced by intraperitoneal injection of DSP4 (50 mg/kg) facilitated the rate of hippocampal kindling by reducing the time spent in stage 2. The number of wet-dog shakes was also reduced in experimental animals during kindling stages 1 and 2 compared to control group. The results indicate that in DSP4 treated rats there is a more rapid activation of structures involved in the propagation of the local limbic seizure to motor centers responsible for the behavioral manifestation of the seizure, which is due to the NA depletion.
