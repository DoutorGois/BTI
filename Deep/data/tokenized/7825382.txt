Studies on the structure of the diurnal wakefulness-sleep cycle and spectral EEG parameters of the hippocampus, somatosensory, visual and auditory cortical zones have been made in rats (strain KM) genetically predisposed to audiogenic seizures. It was shown that in the paradoxical phase of sleep in these animals (in contrast to Wistar rats), the stage of the hippocampal theta rhythm is significantly reduced, whereas the duration of a stage of domination of alpha rhythm in the neocortical and hippocampal EEG is increased. No spontaneous epileptiform spike and spike-wave discharges were observed in the EEG pattern of KM rats. The role of ascending activating systems in organization of the paradoxical phase of sleep is discussed.
