A hypothesis is advanced stating that the dendrite spine is a cilium-like process of the neuron's chemoreceptor membrane provided with sensitive and motor mechanisms. The axo-spinous contacts in the c.n.s. can be controlled by a post-synaptic element. The Ca2+ induces a contraction of the actine molecules contained in the spine base, increases the diameter of the latter and decreases resistance against spreading of the electrotonic potential towards the stem of the dendrite. This mechanism seems to take part in the processes of learning and memory.
