INTRODUCTION: Several studies indicate erythropoietin (Epo) to have remarkable neuroprotection in various central nervous system disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta (Abeta) is believed to be responsible for the synaptic dysfunction that occurs in AD. Therefore, the present study is aimed to investigate the effects of Epo on the Abeta-induced impairments in learning-memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were used in this study. After the injection of Abeta, they were injected intra-peritoneal with Epo in the Abeta+Epo group or its vehicle in the Abeta+V group every other day for 12 days. A shuttle box apparatus was used for the passive avoidance learning and memory study. Moreover, paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was monitored before and after tetanic stimulation. RESULTS: Bilateral injection of Abeta decreased step-through latency (STL), whereas the 12 day administration of Epo significantly improved memory performance in Abeta+Epo group. The field potential recording demonstrated that the in vivo administration of Abeta25-35 led to extreme inhibition in long-term potentiation, this inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase of the normalized PPR (PPR after HFS/PPR before HFS) as an index for release probability. However, administration of Epo recovers the magnitude of the LTP and the extent of normalized PPR. CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrated that the injection of Abeta25-35 resulted in impaired LTP and the memory process, which is likely mediated through increasing the release probability of neurotransmitter vesicles. In addition, treatment with Epo improved the Abeta-induced deficits in memory and LTP induction, probably via recovering the release probability.
