Glutamate released from synapses during excitatory neurotransmission must be rapidly recycled to maintain neuronal communication. This review evaluates data from physiological experiments at hippocampal CA3 to CA1 synapses and the calyx of Held synapse in the brainstem to analyze quantitatively the rates of release and resupply of glutamate required to sustain neurotransmission. We calculate that, without efficient recycling, the presynaptic glutamate supply will be exhausted within about a minute of normal synaptic activity. We also discuss replenishment of the presynaptic pool by diffusion from the soma, direct uptake of glutamate back into the presynaptic terminal, and uptake of glutamate precursor molecules. Diffusion of glutamate from the soma is calculated to be fast enough to resupply presynaptic glutamate in the hippocampus but not at the calyx of Held. However, because the somatic cytoplasm will also quickly run out of glutamate and synapses can function continually even if the presynaptic axon is severed, mechanisms other than diffusion must be present to resupply glutamate for release. Direct presynaptic uptake of glutamate is not present at the calyx of Held but may play a role in glutamate recycling in the hippocampus. Alternatively, glutamine or tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates released from glia can serve as a precursor for glutamate in synaptic terminals, and we calculate that the magnitude of presynaptic glutamine uptake is sufficient to supply enough glutamate to sustain neurotransmission. The nature of these mechanisms, their relative abundance, and the co-ordination between them remain areas of intensive investigation.
