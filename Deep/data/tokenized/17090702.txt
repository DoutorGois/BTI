The effect of ZSET1446 (spiro[imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3,2-indan]-2(3H)-one) on cognitive impairment in mice, previously treated with methamphetamine (METH) at a dose of 1 mg/kg for 7 days, was investigated. ZSET1446 showed a significant ameliorating effect on METH-induced impairment of recognition memory, although it had no effect on exploratory behavior. ZSET1446 (1 microg/kg) recovered the defect of the novelty-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of METH-treated mice. The compound increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in the hippocampus but not PFC of naive mice without affecting the total ERK1/2 levels. The ameliorating effect of ZSET1446 on recognition memory in METH-treated mice was negated by pretreatment with a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor, SL327 (alpha-[amino-(4-aminophenylthio)methylene]-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetonitrile ). Furthermore, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 [R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine], and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK-801 [5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (dizocilpine maleate)], blocked the ameliorating effect of ZSET1446 on METH-induced memory impairment, whereas the D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride, had no effect. These results suggest that the ameliorative effect of ZSET1446 on METH-induced memory impairment is associated with indirect activation of ERK1/2 following stimulation with dopamine D1 and NMDA receptors of the PFC. ZSET1446 would be a potential candidate for further preclinical study aimed at the treatment of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, as well as METH psychosis.
