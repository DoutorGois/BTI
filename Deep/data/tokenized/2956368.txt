Brains were examined after autopsy from 12 patients over 53 years of age with Down's syndrome (in whose brains plaques and tangles were numerous in many areas of cortex and subcortex), 3 patients under 53 years of age with Down's syndrome (in whose brains plaques and tangles were minimal or absent), 10 patients, of age range similar to the older Down's group but with Alzheimer's disease and 5 control patients of age range similar to the younger Down's group. The number of plaques and tangles in the hippocampus and their density within the temporal cortex, the thickness of the temporal cortex, the cross-sectional area of the hippocampus and the relative number and mean nucleolar volume of nerve cells in these cortical and in some subcortical areas were estimated and compared in each of the 4 groups. The relative loss of nerve cells and the decrease in mean nucleolar volume were calculated in percentage terms for the older Down's syndrome patients by reference to data from the younger Down's syndrome patients, whereas such losses in Alzheimer's disease were calculated by reference to the younger control patients. While in qualitative terms, all areas of brain found to be damaged in Alzheimer's disease were also damaged in Down's syndrome at middle age, quantitative differences emerged with the reductions in relative nerve cell number and mean nucleolar volume being significantly less in many areas in Down's syndrome. Conversely plaques and tangles were more numerous in the hippocampus in Down's syndrome though in the temporal cortex plaques were less numerous. It seems, therefore, that although the same pathological process is likely to operate in the two conditions, additional biological and mortality differences between Down's syndrome and the general population may account for the observed quantitative variations.
