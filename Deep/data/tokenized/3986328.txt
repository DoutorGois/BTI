It has been shown in experiments on hippocampal slices of (CBA X C57BL/6)F1 mice with corazol kindling that the threshold of the appearance of the induced seizure discharge (ISD) in the area CA1 was decreased by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Diazepam provoked an increase in seizure susceptibility to corazol and penicillin and reduction of the ISD. The data suggest that alterations in neuronal reactivity, which follow kindling, can be found in an individual hippocampal segment, thus making it possible to investigate this phenomenon at the synaptic and molecular levels.
