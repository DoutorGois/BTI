The effect of intraventricular administration of the neuropeptide galanin on acquisition and retrieval in a modified Morris swim maze was studied in rats. Galanin induced a significant deficit in the acquisition of the task while no effects on the retrieval were observed. No deficits were seen 24 h after the last treatment. Galanin did not increase the number of failures to reach the platform. It is suggested that endogenous galanin modulates learning possibly via the galanin-containing cholinergic neurons in the septum-basal forebrain area projecting to the hippocampus and cortex.
