We used the SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice as an in vivo model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and performed immunohistochemical studies to investigate whether alpha-synuclein is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. In the spinal cord of transgenic mice, immunohistochemistry showed intense staining of alpha-synuclein mainly in the anterior horn. In the hippocampus of transgenic mice, differential increases in the staining density of alpha-synuclein were observed. In the cerebellar cortex of transgenic mice, the prominent immunostaining of alpha-synuclein was found in the molecular and granular layers. The present study provides the first in vivo evidence that alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was increased in the central nervous system of SOD(G93A) transgenic mice, suggesting that alpha-synuclein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALS. However, the functional implications of these increases require elucidation.
