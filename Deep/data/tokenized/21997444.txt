Pharmacological and histological studies of ten new amides of kynurenic acid revealed that N-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-4-oxo-1H-quinoline-2-carboxamide hydrochloride has effective neuroprotective properties. Namely, this molecule is: (1) proved to be an effective inhibitor of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus both in in vitro and ex vivo studies, (2) in four vessel occlusion model of transient global forebrain ischaemia, measuring the rate of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell loss and preservation of long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, the neuroprotective potential was represented. N-(2-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-4-oxo-1H-quinoline-2-carboxamide hydrochloride administration significantly diminished hippocampal CA1 cell loss and preserved LTP expression.
