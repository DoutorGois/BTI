TTC-909 (Clinprost), a chemically stable PGI2 analog, isocarbacyclin methyl ester (TEI-9090 or Clinprost) incorporated in lipid microspheres, when administered intravenously after brain ischemia, prevents ischemic neuronal damage possibly by modulating cerebral blood flow and platelet aggregation. However, the possibility exists that TEI-7165, which is the free acid form and a central metabolite of TEI-9090, has direct neurotrophic action in vivo, since TEI-7165 has been shown to block neuronal voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in vitro, and a novel prostacyclin receptor showing high affinity with TEI-7165 has been detected in a variety of brain regions including the hippocampus. In the present study, we infused TEI-7165 for 7 days into the lateral ventricle of gerbils starting 2 h before or just after 3-min forebrain ischemia. TEI-7165 infusion prevented significantly the ischemia-induced shortening of response latency time as revealed by a step-down passive avoidance task. Subsequent light and electron microscopic examinations showed that pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region, as well as synapses within the strata moleculare, radiatum and oriens of the region, were significantly more numerous in gerbils infused with TEI-7165 than in those receiving vehicle infusion. TEI-7165 infusion did not affect hippocampal blood flow or temperature. These findings, together with the previously depicted accumulation of centrally administered [3H]TEI-7165 around hippocampal neurons, suggest that TEI-7165 has a direct neuroprotective action in brain ischemia.
