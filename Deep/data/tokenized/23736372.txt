BACKGROUND: Much recent evidence suggest that obesity and related comorbidities contribute to cognitive decline, including the development of non age-related dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Obesity is a serious threat to public health, and few treatments offer proven long-term weight loss. In fact, bariatric surgery remains the most effective long-term therapy to reduce weight and alleviate other aspects of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Unlike the demonstrated benefits of caloric restriction to prevent weight gain, few if any studies have compared various means of weight loss on central nervous system function and hippocampal-dependent cognitive processes. DESIGN AND RESULTS: Our studies comprise the first direct comparisons of caloric restriction to two bariatric surgeries (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG)) on cognitive function. Weight loss following caloric restriction, RYGB and VSG was associated with generalized improvements in metabolic health and hippocampal-dependent learning, as measured in the radial arm maze and spontaneous alternation tests. However, VSG-treated rats exhibited deficits on spatial learning tasks in the Morris water maze. In addition, whereas VSG animals had elevated hippocampal inflammation, comparable to that of obese controls, RYGB and calorie-restricted (pair-fed, PF) controls exhibited an amelioration of inflammation, as measured by the microglial protein ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1). We also assessed whether GHR (ghrelin) replacement would attenuate hippocampal inflammation in VSG, as post-surgical GHR levels are significantly reduced in VSG relative to RYGB and PF rats. However, GHR treatment did not attenuate the hippocampal inflammation. CONCLUSION: Although VSG was comparably effective at reducing body weight and improving glucose regulation as RYGB, VSG did not appear to confer an equal benefit on cognitive function and markers of inflammation.
