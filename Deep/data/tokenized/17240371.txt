Immunization with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, a therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease (AD), reduces brain Abeta, and microglial Abeta phagocytosis has been proposed as an Abeta-lowering mechanism. We transplanted rat microglia into the rat lateral ventricle just after intra-hippocampal Abeta injection, and then investigated the contribution of exogenous microglia to Abeta clearance. Migration of exogenous microglia from the lateral ventricle to Abeta plaque was detected by magnetic resonance imaging and histochemical analysis, and the clearance of Abeta was increased by transplantation. These results suggest the possible usefulness of exogenous microglia to the therapeutic approach in AD.
