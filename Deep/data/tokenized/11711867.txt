SNAP-25 levels were measured in ventral hippocampus in subjects with unipolar depression (n = 12), bipolar disorder (n = 13), schizophrenia (n = 15) and controls (n = 15) using quantitative immunocytochemistry. SNAP-25 levels were reduced significantly in stratum oriens of bipolar patients compared with controls (p < 0.05); they were also reduced significantly in st. oriens (p < 0.01 vs schizophrenia), in alveous (p < 0.01 vs schizophrenia) and in presubiculum (p < 0.05 vs depressed). SNAP-25 levels were also reduced in several layers of schizophrenics, only significantly so in st. granulosum (p < 0.05 vs controls). In contrast, depressed SNAP-25 levels increased in st. moleculare (p < 0.01 vs schizophrenics) and presubiculum (p < 0.05 vs controls and bipolars; p < 0.01 vs schizophrenics). SNAP-25 values were not affected by age, sex, race, post-mortem interval, brain pH, side of brain, age of onset of disease, family history of psychiatric disease, drug or alcohol use, antipsychotic drug treatment, or mode of death. The reported changes in SNAP-25 levels appear to be disease specific, separating synaptic pathology in unipolar depression from that observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.
