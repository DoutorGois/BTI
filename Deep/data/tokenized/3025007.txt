A procedure is described which makes it possible to prepare slices from the rat brain that comprise nearly the entire lateral septum together with the major part of the fimbria-fornix afferent fibers to the lateral septum. The field potentials and monosynaptic excitation of lateral septal neurons elicited by electrical stimulation of the fimbria-fornix afferent fibers were employed to demonstrate that the neurophysiological features of the lateral septal neurons in vitro are similar to those found previously in vivo, and the synaptic transmission between fimbria-fornix afferent fibers and neurons of the lateral septum could be maintained in vitro without significant alterations for at least a 6-h period of incubation.
