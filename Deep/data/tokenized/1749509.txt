A combination of in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry (ICC) was used to identify the cells that contained mRNA for sulfated glycoprotein-2 (SGP-2) in adult male rats after striatal ibotenic acid (IA) lesioning. Astrocytic responses were monitored by ICC for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). IA lesioning that caused death of striatal neurons also stimulated astrocytic responses as monitored by GFAP and SGP-2. The SGP-2 immunoreactivity showed punctate deposits in the lesioned striatum without any apparent cellular localization. By in situ hybridization combined with ICC, SGP-2 mRNA was localized in astrocytes that were GFAP-immunopositive. These data suggest that reactive astrocytes may express SGP-2 which may be eventually secreted.
