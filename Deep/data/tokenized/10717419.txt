The expression level of type II adenylyl cyclase mRNA (ACII) was analyzed by northern blotting in amygdaloid kindled rats. Remarkable increases in ACII mRNA were observed in the bilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 24 h after the last generalized seizure. The elevated expression level in the hippocampus persisted for 4 weeks on the stimulated side. There were no changes in expression level in single-stimulated and partially-kindled states. These results suggest that the involvement of ACII might have an effect on the mechanisms of seizure generalization and the maintenance of persistent epileptogenesis rather than on the acquisition process.
