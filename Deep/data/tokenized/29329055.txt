BACKGROUND: Functional brain abnormalities have been noted in premenstrual syndrome (PMS). However, the brain structural alterations related to PMS remain unclear. This study aimed to identify possible abnormalities in gray matter (GM) volumes and structural covariance patterns among PMS patients. METHODS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from 20 PMS patients and 20 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis was applied to examine GM volumes changes between the two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to investigate the most reliable biomarker for distinguishing PMS patients from health controls based on the intergroup differences. Correlation analysis was then performed to assess relationships between the daily rating of severity of problems (DRSP) and abnormal brain regions. Finally, the regions identified from VBM analysis were served as seeds to characterize the whole-brain structural covariance patterns. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, PMS patients showed increased GM volumes in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (precuneus/PCC) and thalamus, and decreased GM volumes in the insula. The precuneus/PCC exhibited the highest classification power by ROC analysis and positively correlated with the DRSP. Moreover, different patterns of structural covariance in the two groups were mainly located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, angular gyrus and hippocampus. LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by a small sample and narrow age range of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide preliminary evidence for brain morphology alterations in PMS patients and contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PMS.
