Subependymal nodular heterotopia (SNH) is a cortical development malformation that is commonly associated with medically resistant epilepsy. Cases of SNH are challenging to treat surgically because there are typically multiple nodules, which may be involved in epileptogenesis. Moreover, dual pathology may exist in these patients. Here, we present a case with unilateral subependymal heterotopic nodules associated with ipsilateral hippocampal atrophy. Invasive and non-invasive work-ups revealed that the hippocampus was the actual ictal onset zone and that the SNH was not involved. An anterior temporal lobectomy was carried out, and postoperative seizure outcome was class Ia at the end of 2 years. The case demonstrates that SNH may not play a major role in patients with dual pathology. However, direct electroencephalography (EEG) recording from areas of SNH and other possible epileptogenic regions is indispensable in defining the ictal onset zone and avoiding poor surgical outcomes.
