The voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels responsible for synaptic transmission at CA3-CA1 synapses are mainly P/Q- and N-types. It has been shown that tonic inhibition of transmission due to activation of adenosine A(1) receptors occurs at this synapse. We have recently developed a technique to monitor synaptically released glutamate which is based on synaptically induced glial depolarisation. Using this technique, we have examined the effects of different voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel blockers on glutamate release. Under conditions in which the adenosine A(1) receptor was not blocked, omega-AgaIVA (a P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel blocker) suppressed synaptically induced glial depolarisation to a greater extent than omega-CgTxGVIA (an N-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel blocker) did. In contrast, in the presence of an adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, omega-AgaIVA was less effective at suppressing synaptically induced glial depolarisation than omega-CgTxGVIA. These results indicate that, in the absence of adenosine A(1) receptor-mediated tonic inhibition, the contribution of N-type is much greater than that of P-type, and that N-types are the primary target of tonic inhibition in normal conditions in which adenosine A(1) receptor-mediated tonic inhibition is present.
