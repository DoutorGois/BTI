The effect of the total single and chronic roentgen irradiation in the dose of 0.25 Gy on the rats to alteration dynamics in lysosomal cysteine cathepsin L [CE 3.4.22.15] level in different brain regions (cortex, cerebellum, middle brain, varolian, hippocampus, striatum) was studied as a result of 1, 12, 24, 120 and 168 hours of exposure. The data obtained displayed the opposite consequences of chronic effect of 0.01 Gy during 25 days if compare with the single irradiation by 0.25 Gy that led to the cathepsin L changes different in directivity and activity level in dependence on brain region and post-irradiation period.
