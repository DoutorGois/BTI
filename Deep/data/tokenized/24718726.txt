Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) has recently been applied for mapping the hemodynamic changes related to epileptic activity. The aim of this study is to compare the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to epileptic spikes in patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and those with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). In EEG-fMRI studies, the HRF represents the temporal evolution of blood oxygenation level-dependent signal changes. Several studies demonstrated that amplitude and latency of the HRF are variable in patients with epilepsy. However, the consistency of HRF parameters with underlying brain pathology is unknown. In this study, we examined 14 patients with FCD and 12 with unilateral HS selected from our EEG-fMRI database and compared the amplitude and latency of the HRF peak. We analyzed (1) HRFs in peak activation clusters, (2) HRFs in peak deactivation clusters, and (3) the maximum absolute responses within the EEG spike field, activation or deactivation. We found that the HRF peak amplitude in deactivation clusters was larger in the HS group than in the FCD when the deactivation occurred in default mode network (DMN) regions. This result suggests that spikes in patients with HS affect the DMN more strongly than those with FCD. However, if we focus on the maximum absolute t-value in the spike field, there is no significant difference between the two groups. The current study indicates that it is not necessary to use different HRF models for EEG-fMRI studies in patients with FCD and HS.
