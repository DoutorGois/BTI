Transection of the dorsal fornix bundle in rats resulted in impaired maze learning, while the behavior in open field, passive avoidance and spontaneous alternation test was unchanged. The results are discussed in terms of an association deficit. It is concluded that the dorsal fornix is probably not to be regarded as part of the hippocampal output system.
