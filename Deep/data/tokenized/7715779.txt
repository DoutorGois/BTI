Intraperitoneal or intrahippocampal injections of kainate induce both hippocampal cell death and axonal remodeling of the dentate gyrus granular neurons. We report here that injection of kainate into the dorsal hippocampus of adult mice may also trigger a conspicuous and long-lasting global trophic response of granule cells. Morphological changes include somatic and dendritic growth and increased nuclear volume with ultrastructural features characteristic of neuronal development. The trophic response is correlated with a specific overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor that is maintained for at least six months. This shows that plasticity in adult neurons can, in addition to axonal remodeling, extend to generalized cell growth. Our results further suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor could be involved in the activation and/or maintenance of this phenomenon.
