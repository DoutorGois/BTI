Neuroinflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression. Chronic glucocorticoids (GCs) exposure has deleterious effects on the structure and function of neurons and is associated with development and progression of AD. However, little is known about the proinflammatory effects of chronic GCs exposure on neurodegeneration in brain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic dexamethasone (DEX) treatment (5mg/kg, s.c. for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days) on behavior, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammatory parameters of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP-1) inflammasome in male mice. The results showed that DEX treatment for 21 and 28 days significantly reduced the spontaneous motor activity and exploratory behavior of the mice. In addition, these mice showed significant neurodegeneration and a decrease of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus CA3. DEX treatment for 7, 14, 21 and 28 days significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Moreover, DEX treatment for 21 and 28 days significantly increased the proteins expression of NLRP-1, Caspase-1, Caspase-5, apoptosis associated speck-like protein (ASC), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), p-NF-kappaB, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-18 and IL-6 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus brain tissue. DEX treatment for 28 days also significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of NLRP-1, Caspase-1, ASC and IL-1beta. These results suggest that chronic GCs exposure may increase brain inflammation via NLRP-1 inflammasome activation and induce neurodegeneration.
