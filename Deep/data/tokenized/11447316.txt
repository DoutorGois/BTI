We examined how transient cerebral ischemia affects the mRNA expression, and the immunoreactive distribution, of the somatostatin type 2 (sst2) receptor in the adult rat hippocampus. Following reperfusion, sst2 mRNA levels increased significantly in the CA1 region by 3 h, and were also increased in the CA3 and CA4/hilus subfields at 6 and 12 h. At 24 h, however, sst2 receptor mRNA levels returned to baseline throughout the hippocampus. At the protein level, we found the regional immunoreactivity of the sst2a receptor was maintained, or slightly elevated, throughout the hippocampus at 6 h, but not different from control at 24 h. These results suggest that sst2 receptors maintain their normal distribution and prevalence in the post-ischemic hippocampus before the deterioration of the vulnerable CA1 neurons. Thus, they represent attractive targets for neuroprotective interventions.
