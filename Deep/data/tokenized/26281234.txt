The prestimulus expectation period of conditioned avoidance reflex features synchronized Delta-rhythm (1-4 Hz) in the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and synchronized theta-rhythm (6-8 Hz) in the above-mentioned structures and the hippocampus. According to "Granger causality" Delta- and theta-rhythms flow (are predictors) in the direction from the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus to the VTA. Performance of conditioned avoidance reflex was marked by Delta-rhythm elimination simultaneously with generation of high-frequency (8-11 Hz) synchronized theta-rhythm. Delta-rhythm was shifted from the pre- to poststimulus period and prefrontal cortex--VTA theta-synchrony was eliminated in the cases of mistaken reaction withdrawal, Pavlovian fear conditioning scheme, conditioned signal presentation in the safe chamber part. The phase of Delta-, theta-rhythm modulates the amplitude of VTA fast (70-160 Hz) gamma-activity envelope, VTA/cortex and VTA/hippocampus gamma-phase synchronization and phase lag indexes, and frequency of simultaneously recorded VTA neuronal activity.
