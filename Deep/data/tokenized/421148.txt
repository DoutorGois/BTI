By chronically implanting a glass micropipette filled with tritiated leucine in the raphe centralis superior of the rat, the projection of this nucleus was traced by radioautography. The majority of the ascending projections were located within the ventral tegmental area and, further rostrally, the median forebrain bundle. Along the course of this bundle numerous fibers branched successively into the mammillary peduncle, the fasciculus retroflexus, the stria medullaris, the fornix and the cingulum. The most significant projections included the ones to the interpeduncular nucleus, the mammillary bodies, the habenular nuclei and the hippocampus. No projections were detected in the striatum, the cortex piriformis or the amygdala. Descending projections diffused to the pontine reticular formation and central gray through the medial and the dorsal longitudinal bundles. In addition widespread projections were also seen in nuclei located near the raphe centralis superior: raphe nuclei, dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei.
