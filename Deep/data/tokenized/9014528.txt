Abdominal region of pregnant Swiss mice were exposed to 0.25, 0.35 or 0.50 Gy of gamma radiation on days 11.5, 12.5, 14.5 or 17.5 post coitus (pc). Changes in locomotory activity and learning performance, and hippocampal biogenic amines (noradrenaline, NA; dopamine, DA; 5-hydroxytryptomine, 5-HT; and 5-HTs metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, 5-HIAA) were studied at 12 (adult) and 18 months (old) of age. Significant change in locomotory activity and learning performance was observed after exposure to 0.50 Gy at late organogenesis day (11.5 pc), when tested at 12 months of age, but not observed much change at 18 months. Biogenic amines did not show any significant change after any exposure dose at any of the gestation days. It was inferred from the results that gamma irradiation (0.50 Gy) at the late organogenesis (day 11.5 pc) can impair the brain functions in adults when normal faculties are functional.
