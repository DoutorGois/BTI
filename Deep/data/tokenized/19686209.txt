The adult mammalian brain continuously generates new neurons in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus throughout life. Adult neurogenesis, a highly dynamic process, has been shown to be exquisitely modulated by neuronal circuit activity at different stages, from proliferation of adult neural progenitors, to differentiation, maturation, integration, and survival of newborn neurons in the adult brain. Strategic activity-dependent addition of new neurons into the existing neuronal circuitry represents a prominent form of structural plasticity and may contribute to specific brain functions, such as learning, memory, and mood modulation. Here we review extrinsic mechanisms through which adult neurogenesis is regulated by environmental cues, physiological learning-related stimuli, and neuronal activities.
