The autocrine motility factor receptor (AMFR) is a multifunctional protein involved in cellular adhesion, proliferation, motility and apoptosis. Our study showed that increased AMFR protein expression in the hippocampus of KM mice correlated with enhanced capacity for learning and memory following the shuttle-box test and was significantly elevated in the highest score group. Also, AMF and AMFR mRNA expression positively correlates with the mRNA expression of the synapse marker synaptophysin (Syp). Aging studies in the senescence-accelerated mouse strain (SAM) prone/8 (SAMP8), an animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealed significantly decreased mRNA and protein expression of AMF and AMFR in the hippocampus. This is especially true for AMFR and AMF protein expression compared with age-matched SAM resistant/1 (SAMR1) mouse strain as the control. Additionally, the low mRNA expression of AMFR could be up-regulated by the four nootropic traditional Chinese medicinal prescriptions (TCMPs): Ba-Wei-Di-Huang decoction (BW), Huang-Lian-Jie-Du decoction (HL), Dang-Gui-Shao-Yao-San (DSS) and Tiao-Xin-Fang decoction (TXF). AMFR protein expression could be up-regulated by two TCMPs, Liu-Wei-Di-Huang decoction (LW) and BW. This indicated that AMFR is involved in the process of learning and memory in the central nervous system. These results may provide useful clues for understanding the etiology of AD.
