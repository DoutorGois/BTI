Cerebral ischemia represents a severe brain injury that could lead to significant neuronal damage and death. In this study, we performed a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult rats and observed that a subunit of nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) transcriptional factor, NF-YC, was accumulated in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. Immunochemistrical and immunofluorescent analysis revealed that NF-YC was primarily expressed in the nucleus of neurons. Meanwhile, we found that the changes of bim, one of the target genes of NF-Y, were consistent with the expression of NF-YC and Bim was mainly located in the NF-YC positive cells. Moreover, there was a concomitant upregulation of active caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells. Taken together, these results suggested that the upregulation of NF-YC might play an important role in the pathophysiology via proapoptotic protein Bim after MCAO and further research is needed to have a better understanding of its function and mechanism.
