The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), which is one of the glutamate receptors, is considered to have a close relationship to synaptic plasticity in the developing brain. In addition, it is known that the excessive stimulation of NMDARs can trigger neuronal apoptosis. In this study, we examined the distribution of NMDAR subunits [anti-NR1, NR2(A-C)] in the developing rat brain immunohistochemically. As a result, NR1, an essential subunit for the formation of a functional NMDAR complex, was mildly expressed in the restricted areas such as the temporal region of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in the fetal brain at Embryonal Days 18 and 20. On the other hand, in neonates, NR1 was expressed widely throughout the whole brain. The distributions of NR2A and NR2C showed temporal and spatial similarities to that of NR1, while the expression of NR2B showed differences in the intensity and distribution. A progressive change in subunit expression seen prenatally and postnatally could contribute to variation of NMDARs and synaptic plasticity during the developing period.
