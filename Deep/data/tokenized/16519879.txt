Glutamate plays a central role in the fast excitatory synaptic transmission and is a key neurotransmitter involved in several neurophysiological processes. Glutamate levels on the synaptic cleft are related to neural excitability, neuroplasticity, and neuronal damage associated with excitotoxicity. Mice lacking the cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) gene (Prnp) present a decreased astrocytic glutamate uptake in cultures, higher neuronal excitability in vitro and sensitivity to pro-convulsant drugs in vivo, and age-dependent memory impairment. Here, we investigate if PrP(c) might be involved in neuronal uptake and release of glutamate. For this purpose, we compared synaptosomal preparations from the cerebral cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb of 3- or 9-month-old PrP(c) null mice and with respective wild-type controls. Although we observed differences in synaptosomal glutamate release and uptake regarding the age of mice and the brain structure studied, these differences were similar for PrP(c) null mice and their respective wild-type controls. Therefore, despite a possible correlation between neuronal glutamate transporters, excitability, and neuronal damage, our results suggest that PrP(c) expression is not critical for neuronal glutamate transport.
