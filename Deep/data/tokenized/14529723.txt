Phorbol esters, activators of protein kinase C (PKC), have been shown to enhance synaptic transmission. One potential downstream target of PKC in the presynaptic terminal is the soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) SNAP-25, which has a PKC phosphorylation site in its C-terminal coil centered at serine 187 (S187/Ser187). We examined the role of S187 in hippocampal synaptic transmission. After proteolytic cleavage of native SNAP-25 by botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E), synaptic transmission was restored in a subset of transfected CA3 pyramidal cells with a toxin-resistant form of SNAP-25 containing unaltered S187 (Swt), S187 mutated to alanine (SA) or S187 mutated to glutamate (SE). We observed that phorbol-12,13-diacetate (PDAc, 10 microM) induced potentiation of neurotransmission to a similar degree for both Swt and SA (2.4-fold and 3.1-fold increase, respectively). Furthermore, basal levels of transmission mediated by SE were reduced relative to that of Swt (failure rates of 72% and 41%, respectively). Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of SNAP-25 S187 does not mediate the observed enhancement of neurotransmission by phorbol esters at hippocampal synapses.
