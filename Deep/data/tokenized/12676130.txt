To investigate the degree of plasticity of hippocampal neural stem cells from adult mice (mHNSC), we have analyzed their differentiation in co-culture with quail neural crest cells. In mixed culture, mHNSC give rise to several non-neuronal neural crest derivatives, including melanocytes, chondrocytes and smooth muscle cells. The data suggest that neural crest cell-derived short-range cues that are recognized across species can instruct adult mHNSC to differentiate into neural crest phenotypes.
