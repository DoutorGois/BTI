Methylamphetamine hydrochloride (80 mg/l.) and/or chlorpromazine hydrochloride (200 mg/l.) have been administered in the drinking water of female Wistar rats during pregnancy and suckling. The offspring were weaned at 21 days and thereafter received no drugs. Nine months later, male offspring were killed and noradrenaline and normetanephrine concentrations were determined in eight discrete areas of the brains: neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, corpora quadrigemina, pons/medulla, and amygdala region. Both drugs appeared to have permanently altered catecholamine concentrations in several areas of the brain. There was evidence of antagonism between the effects of the two drugs in the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and corpora quadrigemina, where the individual drugs produced altered noradrenaline concentrations but a combination of the two had no effect.
