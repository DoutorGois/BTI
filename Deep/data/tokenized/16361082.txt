Multidrug resistance protein, also referred as P-glycoprotein (P-gp, MDR1; ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 1 (ABCC1) and 2 (ABCC2) are, thus far, candidates to cause antiepileptic drug (AED) resistance epilepsy. In this study, we investigated P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2 expression, localization and functional activity on cryosections and isolated human brain-derived microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) from epileptic patients (HBMEC-EPI) with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), as compared with HBMEC isolated from normal brain cortex (HBMEC-CTR). We examined the expression and distribution of three transporters, P-gp, MRP1 and MRP2 on two major parts of the resected tissue, the hippocampus and the parahippocampal gyrus (Gph). P-gp showed diffuse expression not only in endothelium but also by parenchymal cells in both the hippocampus and the Gph. MRP1 labeling was observed in parenchymal cells in the Gph. By contrast, MRP2 was mainly found in endothelium of the hippocampus. P-gp and MRP1 expression in the Gph was relatively high in the patient with long-term seizure history. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of HBMEC revealed that MDR1, MRP1 as well as MRP5 (ABCC5) and MRP6 (ABCC6) were overexpressed in HBMEC-EPI at the mRNA level. HBMEC from both normal and epilepsy groups displayed protein expression of P-gp, whereas MRP1 and MRP2 were seen only in HBMEC-EPI. Accordingly, it is of particular interest that MRP functional activities were observed in HBMEC-EPI, but not in HBMEC-CTR. Our results suggest that complex MDR expression changes not only in the hippocampus but in the Gph may play a role in AED pharmacoresistance in intractable epilepsy patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) by altering the permeability of AEDs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
