BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although visceral hypersensitivity is a major pathophysiological feature of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), its molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. c-fos is a well-established marker of cell activation. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that norepinephrine (NE) system is dysregulated in IBS; however, very little is known on its mechanism. It is our hypothesis that elevated expression of c-fos in central nervous system (CNS) correlates with visceral hypersensitivity in rat model of IBS. Furthermore, we explored the changes of NE system in IBS patients. METHODS: The rat model of IBS was induced by heterotypic chronic and acute stress. Tissues obtained from rat model were analyzed for c-fos levels in CNS (frontal lobe, hippocampus, cornu dorsale) and colon by immunohistochemistry. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the colonic tissues obtained from IBS patients. RESULTS: The rat model of IBS was associated with increased expression of c-fos in different parts of CNS (P = 0.001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.002, respectively), but normal in colon (P = 0.207). The clinical parameters (colonic motility and sensation) of rat model were significantly correlated with elevated c-fos in CNS (P < 0.05). Enterochromaffin cells and serotonin in colon were related to the elevated c-fos in CNS (P < 0.05). The TH messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA level of IBS-D patients was almost four times as much as that of controls. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated expression of c-fos in CNS might be one of key mechanisms in etiology of IBS. Therefore, regulation of CNS activation could be a major targeting effect when treating IBS patients.
