OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of the changes of the amino acid receptor-gated ion-channel currents on the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). METHODS: Using rapid drug applicating device, we added 50 mumol/L gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) or 1 mmol/L N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NM-DA) + 10 mumol/L Glycine (Gly) to the surrounding of freshly isolated rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons to induce receptor-gated ion-channel currents, which was recorded by whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. RESULTS: The intensity of the GABAA-receptor mediated inward Cl- current of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of HE rats (413.3 +/- 436.8 pA, n = 31) was stronger than that of the controls (233.4 +/- 179.7 pA, n = 28, t = 2.1049, P < 0.05), and the appearance of the Cl- current in HE rats was more frequent than that in the controls. The intensity of the NMDA-receptor gated inward current in HE rats (408.5 +/- 317.2 pA, n = 37) was weeker than that in the controls (882.6 +/- 896.5 pA, n = 26, t = 2.5851, P < 0.05), but the difference of their channel opening frequency was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: The changes of the amino acid receptor-gated ion-channel currents play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.
