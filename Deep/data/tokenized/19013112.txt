A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method has been developed for measurement of N-acetylaspartate, N-acetylaspartylglutamate and glutamate. The analytes were separated within 5 min using an anion exchange/reverse phase column. The lower limit of quantification for Glu, NAA and NAAG was found to be 5, 50 and 6 nM, respectively, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5:1. Using this methodology the basal levels of Glu, NAA and NAAG could be measured consistently in in vitro superfusion samples from rat hippocampus. The assay was also used for measurement of the distribution of Glu, NAA and NAAG in different regions of the rat brain.
