Stable suspensions of NiO and/or Mn3O4 nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 16.7 +/- 8.2 nm and 18.4 +/- 5.4 nm, respectively, prepared by laser ablation of 99.99% pure metals in de-ionized water were repeatedly injected IP to rats at a dose of 0.50 mg or 0.25 mg 3 times a week up to 18 injections, either separately or in different combinations. Many functional indices as well as histological features of the liver, spleen, kidneys and brain were evaluated for signs of toxicity. The accumulation of Ni and Mn in these organs was measured with the help of AES and EPR methods. Both metallic nanoparticles proved adversely bio-active, but those of Mn3O4 were found to be more noxious in most of the non-specific toxicity manifestations. Moreover, they induced a more marked damaging effect in the neurons of the caudate nucleus and hippocampus which may be considered an experimental correlate of manganese-induced parkinsonism. Mathematical analysis based on the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) revealed a diversity of combined toxicity types depending not only on particular effects these types are assessed for but on their level as well. The prognostic power of the RSM model proved satisfactory.
