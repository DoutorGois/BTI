We have studied Gallyas- and tau-positive glial structures in three autopsied cases of motor neuron disease with dementia (MND-D). Gallyas-positive, tau-immunoreactive thread-like structures in the neuropil and crescent/coiled inclusions in the glial cells were mainly observed in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdaloid nucleus. Double staining using Gallyas staining and carbonic anhydrase 2 (CA2) immunohistochemistry revealed that some crescent/coiled inclusions occurred in the CA2-immunopositive cytoplasm of the oligodendroglia. Electron microscopic study with the Gallyas-Braak method revealed that the inclusion was a reticular, partly compact mass, containing 15 nm fibrils around round or oval nuclei. Since the regions where these structures appeared exhibited neuronal loss with gliosis, these data suggest that a cytoskeletal abnormality involving tau protein in glia might be associated with the degenerative process of MND-D.
