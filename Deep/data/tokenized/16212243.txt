Huperzine A-loaded microspheres composed of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) were prepared by an ONV emulsion solvent evaporation method. The characterization of the microspheres such as drug loading, size, shape and release profile was described. The in vitro release in the initial 7 days was nearly linear with 10% released per day. Thereafter drug release rate became slow gradually and about 90% drug released at day 21. The in vitro release rate determined by dialysis bag method had a good correlation with the in vivo release rate. Huperzine A aqueous solution was intramuscularly injected (i.m.) at 0.4 mg/kg and microspheres were intramuscularly injected at 8.4 mg eq huperzine A/kg in rats. The maxium plasma concentration (Cmax ) after i.m. microspheres was only 32% of that after i.m. solution. Drug in plasma could be detected until day 14 and about 5% of administered dose was residued at the injection site at day 14. The relative bioavailability of huperzine A microspheres over a period of 14 days was 94.7%. Inhibition of acyecholinesterase activity (AchE) in rat's cortex, hippocampus and striatum could sustain for about 14 days. In conclusion, huperzine A-loaded microspheres possessed a prolonged and complete drug release with significant inhibition of AchE for 2 weeks in rats.
