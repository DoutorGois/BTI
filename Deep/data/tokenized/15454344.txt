The present study was undertaken to identify and characterize in vivo binding sites of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the mouse brain by using [3H]paroxetine as radioligand. Relatively higher concentration of [3H]paroxetine was detected in the whole brain (minus cerebellum) than in the plasma of mice after the i.v. injection of the radioligand, and the half-life (t1/2) of elimination was much slower. The in vivo specific [3H]paroxetine binding in the mouse brain after the i.v. injection was defined as the difference of particulate-bound radioactivity between the whole brain and cerebellum, and it was dose-dependently attenuated by oral or intraperitoneal administration of fluoxetine (8.68-116 micromol/kg). Furthermore, oral administration of fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline at the pharmacologically relevant doses reduced significantly (25-94%) in vivo specific [3H]paroxetine binding in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain of mice, and their significant decreases were observed up to at least 8 h (fluvoxamine), 24 h (fluoxetine), and 12 h (paroxetine and sertraline) later. The value of area under the curve (AUC) for decrease in [3H]paroxetine binding vs. time in each brain region was largest for fluoxetine among these SSRIs, due to the relatively longer-lasting occupation of brain serotonin transporter. The AUC value in mouse brain after oral administration of each SSRI was 1.2-3.2 times greater in the thalamus and midbrain than in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Thus, the present study has revealed that [3H]paroxetine may be a suitable radioligand for in vivo characterization of brain binding sites and pharmacological effects of SSRIs.
