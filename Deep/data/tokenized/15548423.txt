Most studies regarding altered gene expression after learning are performed using multi-trial tasks, which do not allow a clear discrimination of memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. We screened for candidate memory-modulated genes in the hippocampus at 3 and 24 h after one-trial inhibitory avoidance (IA) training, using a cDNA array containing 1176 genes. While 33 genes were modulated by training (respect to shocked-only animals), most of them were upregulated (27 genes) and only 6 were downregulated. To confirm and extend these findings, we performed RT-PCRs and analyzed differences in protein levels in rat hippocampus using immunoblot assays. We found several proteins upregulated 24 h after training: extracellular signal-regulated kinase ERK2, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIalpha), Syntaxin 1a, c-fos and Homer 1a. The total level of none of these proteins were found to be altered when measured 3-h post-training. Several of the mRNAs corresponding to the upregulated proteins were changed at 3 h but not 24 h. Additionally, a number of other candidates were identified for the first time as modulated by learning. The results presented here suggest that single-trial tasks can expose previously unseen differences in dynamic regulation of gene expression after behavioral manipulations, both at the transcriptional and translational levels, and reveal a diversity of gene products modulated by this task, allowing deeper understanding of the molecular basis of memory formation.
