Amplitude and phase profiles of theta rhythm induced in the hippocampal formation slices by bath perfusion of carbachol was studied. Amplitude and phase profiles obtained in vitro closely resemble profiles of spontaneous theta rhythm recorded in freely behaving or anaesthetised rats. Electrotonic mechanism underlying the in vivo and in vitro theta are discussed.
