Estrogen deprivation is a high risk of cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, and the early used estrogen replacement has been proved effective in many studies. Because of the adverse actions, selective estrogen receptor modulating has been raised to substitute for estrogen replacement. In this study, we observed in hippocampus of bilaterally ovariectomized rats that the level of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) was decreased in nuclei with activated glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in cytoplasm at 8 weeks after operation. The level of nuclear ERalpha is important for its transcriptional property, and the inhibition of GSK-3beta benefits to ERalpha nuclear translocation. Then, we used 4,4k,4a-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1, 3, 5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) (1 mg/kg/day), an agonist of ERalpha, combined with LiCl (40 mg/kg/day), an inhibitor of GSK-3beta, to treat the ovariectomized rats. After the combination treatment of these two drugs (PPT + LiCl), the improved learning and memory abilities of ovariectomized rats in Morris water maze, increased dendritic spines in CA1 region, and decreased tau phosphorylation at Ser-396 in hippocampus were observed. Furthermore, PPT + LiCl treatment significantly increased ERalpha level in the nuclear fraction of hippocampus, and in the cytoplasmic fraction, the total level of GSK-3beta was declined after treatment with its increased phosphorylation at Ser-9 (inactivation form). This study suggested that PPT + LiCl treatment could inhibit the activation of cytoplasmic GSK-3beta and promote the nuclear translocation of ERalpha, and ERalpha together with GSK-3beta maybe the targets to preserve hippocampus-dependent cognitive ability after long-term ovariectomy.
