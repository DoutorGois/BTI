OBJECTIVE: Observe the expression and distribution of HMGB1 in Sombati's cell model and kainic acid-induced epileptic rats' model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dissociated hippocampal neurons from neonatal SD rats and cultured those for 9 days, then changed medium to Mg2+-free medium for 3 hours to induce Sombati's cell model. The expression level of HMGB1 in the neurons was detected at 24h and 72h by Western Blotting. Appropriate kainic acid was injected into the lateral ventricles to induced epileptic rats' model in vivo trial, the expression level and distribution of HMGB1 at 24h and 72h were established by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The expression level of HMGB1 showed significantly different between model group and control group both in vitro and in vivo trials. At 24h, the expression level of HMGB1 in the model group was lower than the control group (p < 0.05), and became higher than the control group at 72h (p < 0.05). From the in vivotrial, a nucleus-to-cytoplasm translocation was also discovered. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation indicates that HMGB1 plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy, by altering its quantity and distribution.
