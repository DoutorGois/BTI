The influence of noradrenaline (NA) on the functional development and chemical sensitivity of neurons of the newborn rat hippocamp was studied in organotypic cultures during the period of up to 38 days. NA was shown to inhibit the formation of spontaneous activity and lessen the number of active neurons in the explants. In these cultures, like in hippocamp in situ, the neurons with periodical activity markedly predominated. The cultivation in the medium with NA increased the sensitivity of neurons to NA: the number of cells responding to NA by the inhibition of impulsation increased up to 82%. The data obtained, as well as the previous results (Chubakov et al., 1983), suggest the diverse influence of NA and serotonin on the functional development of hippocampal neurons during postnatal ontogenesis.
