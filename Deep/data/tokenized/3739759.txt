Vasopressin and oxytocin were administered intracerebro-ventriculary to rabbits in order to test their effects on the brain electrical activity. The effects were manifested by an increase or decrease in the amount of energy of electrical pulse trains required to produce habituation which is known to occur after repetitive stimulation of the midbrain reticular - formation. Vasopressin inhibited the extinction of hippocampal theta rhythm, while oxytocin facilitated it.
