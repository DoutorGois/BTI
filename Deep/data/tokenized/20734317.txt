Valproate (VPA) has been used for decades in the treatment of epilepsy and migraine. However, maternal administration of VPA during pregnancy increases susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the offspring. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylation modification and its effects on the activity of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in the rat brain prenatally exposed to VPA. We exposed the rats in early pregnancy to VPA and found that the prenatal VPA exposure, in comparison with the prenatal vehicle exposure, induced demethylation in the promoter regions of wnt1 and wnt2, but not in those of Wnt inhibitory factor-1 and Dickkopf 1, in the prefrontal cortexes and hippocampi of the offspring. Consequently, both mRNA and protein expression of wnt1 and wnt2 were increased. Furthermore, the activity of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway was upregulated, as indicated by the increased levels of beta-catenin, hence the growing expression of its target genes. This work suggested an epigenetic action via which VPA, when administered in early pregnancy, induced dysregulation of signaling pathway, further facilitating susceptibility to ASDs.
