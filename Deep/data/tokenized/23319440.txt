The majority of functional MRI studies of pain processing in the brain use the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging approach. However, the BOLD signal is complex as it depends on simultaneous changes in blood flow, vascular volume and oxygen metabolism. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging is another imaging approach in which the magnetically labeled arterial water is used as an endogenous tracer that allows for direct measurement of cerebral blood flow. In this study, we assessed the pain response in the brain using a pulsed-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) approach and a thermal stimulation paradigm. Using pCASL, response to noxious stimulation was detected in somatosensory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and precuneus, consistent with the pain response activation patterns detected using the BOLD imaging approach. We suggest that pCASL is a reliable alternative for functional MRI pain studies in conditions in which blood flow, volume or oxygen extraction are altered or compromised.
