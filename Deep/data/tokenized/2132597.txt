This case study reports the auditory findings in one patient with left temporal lobectomy. Behavioral and electrophysiologic central auditory tests were administered just before and 1 week after surgical removal of the left anterior temporal lobe, including the amygdala and portions of the hippocampus. The dichotic digits test and late auditory evoked potentials with P-300 showed marked improvement postoperatively, consistent with improved central auditory function. Postoperative behavioral results on the dichotic digits test are consistent with anatomic evidence that there are few, if any, auditory connections to the anterior temporal lobe. Although electrophysiologic recordings improved postoperatively, they are still considered abnormal. This case study illustrates the use of both behavioral and electrophysiologic procedures for monitoring central auditory function.
