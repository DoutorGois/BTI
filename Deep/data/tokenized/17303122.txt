Theta-burst stimulation of the stratum radiatum induces a negative shift in the reversal potential (RP) of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs) in hippocampal CA1 neurons in brain slices from rats of age groups 3-4 days, 6-9 days and 3-4 weeks. Furosemide reversed the shift in the RP. The amplitude of the evoked PSC appeared to increase following the theta-burst stimulation but this increase was secondary to the change in the RP. These results indicate that the RP for GABA-ergic PSCs undergoes an activity-dependent plasticity in not only neonatal but also adult neurons presumably through an up-regulation of a K(+)-Cl(-) co-transporter. This plasticity can have significant implications for neuronal network activity in the central nervous system. Furthermore, these results indicate that studies on GABA-ergic synaptic efficacy require a careful, parallel monitoring of the RP.
