Significant impairments in the acquisition and retention of a step-down passive avoidance task were found in rats with striatal lesions induced by the cholinergic neurotoxin AF64A. No significant differences between control and AF64A-injected rats were found in sensitivity to electric shock or in various measures of spontaneous locomotor activity. Striatal choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was significantly decreased in AF64A-treated rats compared with controls, whereas glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activities were not. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between groups in activities of CAT and GAD in either the cortex or the hippocampus, results that support the specificity of the lesion to the striatum. The passive avoidance deficits found in these rats after intrastriatal injection of AF64A support a role for the striatal cholinergic system in complex behavioral processes.
