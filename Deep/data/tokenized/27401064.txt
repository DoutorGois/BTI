INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic strategies targeting Alzheimer's disease-related molecule beta- amyloid (Abeta), Tau protein and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) have been recently explored. However, the treatment effect for single target is not ideal. Based on multiaspect roles of Rho kinase inhibitor Fasudil on neuroprotection, neurorepair and immunomodulation, we observed therapeutic potential of Fasudil and explored possible mechanisms in amyloid precursor protein/ presenilin-1 transgenic (APP/PS1 Tg) mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: APP/PS1 Tg mice were treated with Fasudil (25 mg/kg/day) for 2 months by intraperitoneal injection. Mouse behavior tests were recorded every day. The expression of Abeta deposition, Tau protein phosphorylation, BACE and postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) in hippocampus was assayed. The levels in the brain of Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-nuclear factor kappa B/p65NF-kappaB/p65)- myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) inflammatory cytokine axis were measured. RESULTS: Fasudil treatment ameliorated learning and memory deficits, accompanied by reduced Abeta deposition, Tau protein phosphorylation, and BACE expression, as well as increased PSD-95 expression in hippocampus. Fasudil intervention also inhibited TLR-2/4, p-NF-kappaB/p65, MyD88, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha for TLRs-NF-kappaB-MyD88 inflammatory cytokine axis and the induction of interleukin-10. CONCLUSION: Fasudil exhibited multitarget therapeutic effect in APP/PS1 Tg mice. The study provides preclinical evidence that Fasudil treatment ameliorated memory deficits in APP/PS1 Tg mice, accompanied by the reduction of Abeta deposition and Tau protein phosphorylation, the decrease of BACE and the increase of PSD-95, as well as inhibition of TLRs-NF-kappaB-MyD88 inflammatory cytokine axis. However, these results still need to be repeated and confirmed before clinical application.
