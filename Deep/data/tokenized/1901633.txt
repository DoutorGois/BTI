Three parent peptides were shown to coexist in four rat brain regions: PHI(1-27)NH2 (peptide with an N-terminal histidine and a C-terminal isoleucinamide commonly called PHI), PHI-Gly (PHI(1-27)Gly) and PHV(1-42) (a 42 amino acids form with a C-terminal valine, consisting of PHI(1-27) C-terminally extended by the connecting peptide between PHI and VIP in the precursor molecule except for the terminal basic doublet preceding VIP). A differential distribution of the 3 forms was observed by means of radioimmunoassay, after chromatographic separation on Fractogel, in extracts from temporal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus. Total PHI-IR concentration was found to be higher in the temporal cortex and hippocampus than in the striatum and hypothalamus. PHI(1-27)NH2 was the major form, and accounted for 55% of total PHI-IR in the cortex and hippocampus, 62% in the hypothalamus and as much as 70% in the striatum. PHI-Gly represented 18% of total PHI-IR in the cortex and hippocampus, and 11% in the two other brain areas. PHV(1-42) represented 26% of total PHI-IR in all areas except in the striatum where it represented 18% only.
