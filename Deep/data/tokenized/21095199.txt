Since the discovery in 1996 that a region within caudal parahippocampal cortex subserves learning and recall of topographical information, numerous studies aimed at elucidating the structures and pathways involved in scene recognition have been published. Neuroimaging studies, in particular, have revealed the locations and identities of some of the principal cortical structures that mediate these faculties. In the present study the detailed organization of the system is examined, based on a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of scene processing in human subjects, combined with reviews of the results of lesions on this type of processing, single neuron studies, and available hodological data in non-human primates. A cortical hierarchy of structures that mediate scene recognition is established based on these data, and an attempt is made to determine the function of the individual components of the system.
