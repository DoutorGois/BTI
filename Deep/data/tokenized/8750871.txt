In the adult brain, the gene expression for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was weak in almost all neurons with relatively high levels in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum. On the embryonic days high levels of the gene expression were found throughout the entire neuraxis, then decreased gradually to adult levels during postnatal development. The present finding suggests that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may contribute not only to neurogenesis but also to some important physiological roles in differentiating and mature neurons.
