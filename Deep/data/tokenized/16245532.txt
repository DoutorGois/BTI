We report the use of chemically-functionalized water soluble single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) graft copolymers for modulation of outgrowth of neuronal processes. The graft copolymers were prepared by the functionalization of SWNTs with poly-m-aminobenzene sulphonic acid and polyethylene glycol. When added to the culturing medium, these functionalized water soluble SWNTs were able to increase the length of various neuronal processes.
