Objective. To explore the influence of repeated lower +Gz exposures on high +Gz exposure induced brain injury in rats. Method. Forty SD male rats were randomly divided into control group (5 rats), +10 Gz/5 min group (5 rats) +4 Gz exposure one time, three times and five times group (10 rats each group). After 1 d or 6 d of +4 Gz exposure each group were exposed to +10 Gz again. Three days after +10 Gz exposure the neuron damage was observed by light microscope in HE stained section. Result. There was no brain damage after repeated +4 Gz/3 min exposure 5 times so it was reasonable to use this exposure intensity as ischemia stimulation. +10 Gz/5 min exposure could result in irreversible neuron damage such as neuron degeneration and coagulation necrosis. The experiment results suggested that after +10 Gz/5 min exposure there were degenerated neurons in cortex, hippocampus and thalamus. The number of degenerated neurons were obviously decreased in cortex, hippocampus and thalamus when exposed to +10 Gz/5 min again after repeated +4 Gz/3 min 3-5 times. Conclusion. The degree of neuron damage was obviously slight at the time of exposure to +10 Gz/5 min again after repeated +4 Gz/3 min 3-5 times. The ischemia tolerance at the time of exposure to +Gz was similar to other brain ischemia.
