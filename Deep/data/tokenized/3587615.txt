Oxytocin (OXY) injected into the hippocampus is reported to interfere with the formation of memory in experimental animals. Memory impairment is one of the distinguishing features of Alzheimer's disease. We have studied OXY immunoreactivity in postmortem brain tissue from 12 cases of histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease and 13 controls. OXY concentration was increased 33% in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of Alzheimer brains (p less than 0.05), but normal in all other regions examined. Elevated hippocampal OXY levels may contribute to the memory disturbance associated with Alzheimer's disease.
