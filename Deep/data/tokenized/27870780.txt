The mesocorticolimbic circuit projects to the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, among others, and it originates in the dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA receives glutamatergic inputs from the prefrontal cortex and several subcortical regions. The glutamate released activates dopaminergic neurons and its action depends on the activation of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. VTA dopaminergic neurons release dopamine (DA) from axon terminals in the innervated regions and somatodendritically in the VTA itself. DA release in the VTA is directly correlated with the activity of dopaminergic neurons. We hypothesized that metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors (mGlu5) directly regulate the activity of VTA dopaminergic neurons. To test this hypothesis, the extracellular levels of VTA DA and glutamate were studied by in-vivo microdialysis after an intra-VTA perfusion of (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG), selective mGlu5 agonist. We observed that CHPG induced a significant increase in VTA DA and glutamate extracellular levels. To determine whether the effect of CHPG on DA levels is because of the increase in glutamate release, we perfused kynurenic acid, an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, through the probe. Our results showed that kynurenic acid did not block the ability of CHPG to cause DA release. Thus, our results suggest that CHPG acts directly on mGlu5 in dopaminergic neurons to induce the release of DA.
