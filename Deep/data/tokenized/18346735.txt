Changes in actin dynamics and pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) metabolisms are closely related to the pathophysiological profiles of the epileptic hippocampus. Recently, it has been reported that PLP phosphatase/chronophin (PLPP/CIN) directly dephosphorylates actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin as well as PLP. In the present study, therefore, we have investigated whether PLPP/CIN is linked to the dynamics of actin filament assembly and the excitability in the rat hippocampus. In control animals, pyridoxine chloride (PNP) treatment increased PLPP/CIN immunoreactivity only in astrocytes, which did not affect electrophysiological properties. Following status epilepticus, the PLPP/CIN protein level increased in granule cells and reactive astrocytes. These changes in PLPP/CIN protein level showed an inverse correlation with phospho-ADF (pADF)/cofilin levels and F-actin content. These changes were also accompanied by alterations in the excitability ratio and paired-pulse inhibition. Transduction of PLPP/CIN by Tat-PLPP/CIN showed similar effects on pADF/cofilin levels, F-actin content and excitability ratio in normal animals. These findings suggest that PLPP/CIN-mediated actin dynamics may play an important role in the changes of morphological properties and excitability of the epileptic hippocampus.
