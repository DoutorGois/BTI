The findings reported in this work show that pretreatment with polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly linolenic acid, present in vegetable oils, can provide a potent tolerance against neurodegeneration in two models of neuronal death-generating treatments such as kainic acid injection and global ischemia. Rats were injected i.v. with 500 nmol/kg of linolenic acid as long as 3 days prior to 6 min global ischemia or received an injection of linolenic acid as long as 3 days prior to a dose of 7.5 mg/kg kainic acid. Neuronal degeneration, assessed by analysis of neuronal density on Cresyl Violet-stained hippocampal sections, was significantly reduced in linolenic acid-treated rats (94-85% of cell survival in the ischemic model and 99-79% of cell survival in the epileptic model in respective CA1 and CA3 subfields). The neuroprotection observed following the injection of linolenic acid 3 days prior to induction of a severe ischemic or epileptic challenge was associated with the induction of the neuroprotective HSP70 heat shock protein within the time window of protection. The injection of 500 nmol/kg of linolenic acid induced a maximal HSP70 expression of 387% at 72 h. In contrast, the overexpression of one well-known protein inducer of neuronal cell death, Bax, which is induced by both ischemic and kainic acid-induced epileptic insults, was prevented by linolenic acid in the 3-day window of protection. These results strengthen the idea of an interesting potential therapeutical value of polyunsaturated fatty acids in neuronal protection.
