We have studied outward currents of neurons acutely dissociated from the dentate gyrus region of hippocampus using whole-cell and perforated patch recordings. Depolarizing voltage commands activated sustained outward currents at all age tested (P5-P30). Outward currents were blocked by tetraethylammonium (10 mM) but not 4-aminopyridine (25 mM). Comparison of sustained potassium current during postnatal development showed a significant increase in current amplitude with age reaching a peak between P20 and P30. These results suggest an overall increase in the number of voltage-dependent ion channels during development, specifically those underlying TEA-sensitive potassium currents.
