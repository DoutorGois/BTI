Many studies note that changes in oxidative balance are involved in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) and in the success of some antidepressants. Quetiapine exerts a therapeutic response and induces changes in physiological mechanisms that appear to underlie MDD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antidepressant and antioxidant effects of quetiapine (20 mg /kg) in adult animals. Sixty minutes after an acute treatment or the last administration of chronic treatment (14 days) with quetiapine, animals were subjected to the forced swimming test (FST) to evaluate mobility parameters. Then, the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (CPF), amygdala and nucleus accumbens (NAc) were removed for the assessment of oxidative stress parameters. Both acute and chronic treatments exerted antidepressant-like effects. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was reduced in the amygdala after acute treatment and in the hippocampus, PFC and amygdala after chronic treatment. In addition, after chronic treatment, the levels of thiobarbituric reactive species (TBARS) were reduced in the amygdala and NAc, and the protein carbonyl content was reduced in the CPF. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased in the NAc after acute and chronic treatments. Catalase (CAT) activity increased in the PFC after acute treatment and in the NAc after acute and chronic treatments. The concentration of nitrite/nitrate was lower in the CPF after chronic treatment. These results corroborate the antidepressant effect of quetiapine and indicate that quetiapine exhibits an antioxidant profile, a physiological mechanism that appears be involved in the therapeutic function of quetiapine in individuals resistant to classical antidepressant treatments.
