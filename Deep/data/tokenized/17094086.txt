Enduring long-term potentiation (LTP) requires immediate protein synthesis, hence we assessed whether more polyribosomes are present in dendritic spines of mature hippocampal dendrites after the induction of LTP. Reconstructions from serial section transmission electron microscopy (sSTEM) revealed more dendritic polyribosomes 2 h posttetanus, relative to low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Polyribosomes were present in spines of all shapes with larger postsynaptic densities after 2 h, suggesting a coordinated local protein synthesis among many synapses to replenish proteins utilized during an earlier phase of LTP.
