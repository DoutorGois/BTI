Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from epileptic patients with electrodes chronically implanted in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and other intracranial locations, and from monkeys with epidural, transcortical, and MTL electrodes. For both humans and monkeys, the eliciting events consisted of trains of auditory or visual stimuli in which a random 10-20% deviated in pitch or pattern from the remaining stimuli. The distribution of ERPs elicited by the rare (oddball) stimuli in both species was similar, consisting of a P3 recorded from the scalp or cortical surface and a slightly later, but temporally overlapping, focal negativity in the hippocampus and nearby MTL structures. The similarity between the patterns of ERPs in humans and monkeys establishes the feasibility of studying the electrogenesis of P3-like activity with detailed intracranial recordings in an animal model. The data also establish that the MTL ERPs in human patients represent a normal neurophysiological process unrelated to epilepsy.
