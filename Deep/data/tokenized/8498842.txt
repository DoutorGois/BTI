Recent studies in Alzheimer brains have shown aberrant protein phosphorylation, suggesting an alteration in protein kinases and/or phosphoprotein phosphatases. In the present study, the activity of acid phosphatase was investigated in samples prepared from postmortem normal human and Alzheimer brains. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate, a nonprotein phosphoester, was used as a substrate for acid phosphatase. The separation profile on Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography revealed that two major forms of high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight acid phosphatase were present in the crude extracts of both rat and human brains. Another class of zinc ion (Zn2+)-dependent acid p-nitrophenyl phosphatase was also detected in rat and human brains. In Alzheimer brains, the low-molecular-weight acid phosphatase activity was significantly decreased compared to that in control brains; however, the high-molecular-weight and Zn(2+)-dependent acid phosphatase activity in control and Alzheimer brains was not different. These results suggest that reduced activity of the low-molecular-weight acid phosphatase, which possesses phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase activity, might be linked to aberrant protein tyrosine phosphorylation found in Alzheimer brains.
