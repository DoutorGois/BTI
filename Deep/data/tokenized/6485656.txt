In acute experiments on rabbits studies have been made on functional connections of hippocampal fields CA1 and CA3 with various zones of the neocortex. It was shown that these hippocampal structures are most closely connected with the limbic ancient associative cortex, as well as with the parietal and temporal regions. In the sensorimotor cortex, the EPs were rather irregular. Fields CA1 and CA3 exhibit different projections to the mentioned regions of the neocortex.
