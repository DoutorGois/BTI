Ornithine decarboxylase and its inhibitor protein, antizyme are key regulators of polyamine biosynthesis. We examined their expression in the adult rat brain using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Both genes were widely expressed and their expression patterns were mostly overlapping and relatively similar. The levels of antizyme mRNA were always higher than those of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA. The highest expression for both genes was detected in the cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, locus coeruleus, olfactory bulb, piriform cortex and pontine nuclei. Ornithine decarboxylase and antizyme mRNAs appeared to be localized in the nerve cells. ODC antibody displayed mainly cytoplasmic staining in all brain areas. Antizyme antibody staining was mainly cytoplasmic in the most brain areas, although predominantly nuclear staining was detected in some areas, most notably in the cerebellar cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus and frontal cortex. Our study is the first detailed and comparative analysis of ornithine decarboxylase and antizyme expression in the adult mammalian brain.
