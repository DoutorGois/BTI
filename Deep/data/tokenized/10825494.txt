Long-term potentiation (LTP) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated components of 'dual-component' field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP-A and fEPSP-N) was studied in the CA1 stratum radiatum in hippocampal slices of rats. Relative degrees of LTP of these fEPSP components were compared for tetanizations with low and high strengths. Magnitudes of fEPSP-A and fEPSP-N were estimated in parallel with a least-square fitting of a short-latent (0.1-8.8 ms) fragment of evoked responses by a weighted sum of 'basic' fEPSP-A and fEPSP-N, obtained during a short preliminary application of d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV). We found that low-strength tetanizations selectively potentiated fEPSP-A, while high strength tetanizations potentiated both fEPSP components. These results demonstrate in the experiments with parallel measurements of fEPSP-A and fEPSP-N that LTP of these components differ depending on the strength of afferent tetanization. Unequal potentiation of the commissural-collateral and excitatory local-circuit synapses, which presumably contain different amounts of the AMPA and NMDA receptors, is discussed as the most probable explanation for these results.
