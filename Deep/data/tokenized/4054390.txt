Histological and electrophysiological studies of the frog primordial hippocampus described coordinates of the hippocampus within the telencephalon. Receptive fields of hippocampal neurons were compared with those of other neurons within the visual system. Neurons with excitatory on-off responses and tonic type of responses were shown to prevail. The majority of the primordial hippocampus neurons turned out to be liable to "habituation", i.e. to be the "novelty neurons".
