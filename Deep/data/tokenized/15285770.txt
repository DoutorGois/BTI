OBJECTIVE: Bilateral hippocampal abnormality is frequent in mesial temporal lobe sclerosis and might affect outcome in epilepsy surgery. The objective of this study was to compare the lateralization of interictal and ictal scalp EEG with MRI T2 relaxometry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) were studied with scalp EEG/video monitoring and MRI T2 relaxometry. RESULTS: Bilateral prolongation of hippocampal T2 time was significantly associated with following bitemporal scalp EEG changes: (i) in ictal EEG left and right temporal EEG seizure onsets in different seizures, or, after regionalized EEG onset, evolution of an independent ictal EEG over the contralateral temporal lobe (left and right temporal asynchronous frequencies or lateralization switch; P = 0.002); (ii) in interictal EEG both left and right temporal interictal slowing (P = 0.007). Bitemporal T2 changes were not, however, associated with bitemporal interictal epileptiform discharges (IED). Lateralization of bilateral asymmetric or unilateral abnormal T2 findings were associated with initial regionalization of the ictal EEG in all but one patient (P < 0.005), with lateralization of IED in all patients (P < 0.005), and with scalp EEG slowing in 28 (82,4%) of 34 patients (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that EEG seizure propagation is more closely related to hippocampal T2 abnormalities than IED. Interictal and ictal scalp EEG, including the recognition of ictal propagation patterns, and MRI T2 relaxometry can help to identify patients with bitemporal damage in MTLE. Further studies are needed to estimate the impact of bilateral EEG and MRI abnormal findings on the surgical outcome.
