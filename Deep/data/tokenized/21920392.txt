Laminins play an important role in neuronal development. However, the effects of each laminin isoform on neurite morphology remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of particular laminin (LN) isoforms on hippocampal neuron morphology. We found that LN-511 remarkably promoted elongation of both axons and dendrites, but reduced the number of dendrites. LN-511 E8 fragment, which includes the integrin-binding region, promoted axon and dendrite outgrowth and increased the dendrite number, although its effect on axon and dendrite elongation was smaller than that of full-length LN-511. These results suggest that LN-511 regulates axon and dendrite development by integrin-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
