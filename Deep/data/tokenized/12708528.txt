The present experiment examined the relationship between release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the amygdala and performance on a hippocampus-dependent spatial working memory task. Using in vivo microdialysis, the authors measured ACh release in rats during testing on a spontaneous alternation task. Amygdala ACh release was positively correlated with performance on the hippocampus-dependent task. These findings suggest that activation of the amygdala promotes processing in other neural systems important for learning and memory.
