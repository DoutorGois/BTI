Prefrontal cortical (PFC) and hippocampal (HI) volume reductions have been consistently found in patients with recurrent depressive disorder (DD). Here we examine the possibility that oxidative stress, widely implicated in neuronal cell damage, may contribute to these brain structural changes. We compared manganese (Mn) and copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) superoxide dismutase (SOD) coenzyme concentrations in postmortem PFC and hippocampal brain tissue from 7 patients with DD and 7 neuropsychiatrically healthy controls using sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. The concentration of Cu/Zn-SOD was significantly increased in the PFC but not in the hippocampus of patients. There was no significant change in Mn-SOD enzyme concentration in either region. Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence implicating oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of depressive disorder.
