Extra- and intracellular recordings from CA1 pyramidal and dentate granule cells in hippocampal slices of the rat revealed a depressant effect of histamine which was usually accompanied by a hyperpolarization but no changes in conductance of the cell membrane. Synaptic potentials were unaffected. It is concluded that histamine has a post-synaptic action on ionic conductance in the dendrites, that allows a modulation of quick information transfer but no rapid synaptic transmission.
