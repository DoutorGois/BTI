AIMS: The main purpose was to verify the potent capacity of Neurotropin(R) against neuronal damage in hippocampus and to explore its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: HT22 cells were treated with 40 mumol/L Abeta25-35 in the presence of various concentrations of Neurotropin(R) or in its absence. The cell viability was assessed with a CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry was used to measure cell apoptosis, intracellular ROS levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Abeta plaques were examined by Bielschowsky silver staining, and the activities of antioxidants were detected in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice after Neurotropin(R) treatment. The expression of proteins, including HIF-1alpha, Bcl-2, Bax, and MAPKs signaling molecules was evaluated by Western blot. RESULTS: Neurotropin(R) significantly reversed the cell injury induced by Abeta25-35 through increasing cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential, decreasing intracellular ROS and cell apoptosis of HT22 cells (P<.05). Furthermore, Neurotropin(R) markedly reduced the formation of Abeta plaques and upregulated the activities of antioxidants (P<.05). Additionally, the protein expression of HIF-1alpha, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK, and p-P38 was significantly inhibited in hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Neurotropin(R) exhibited a potent neuroprotective effect on inhibiting Abeta-induced oxidative damage and alleviating Abeta deposition in hippocampus via modulation of HIF-1alpha/MAPK signaling pathway.
