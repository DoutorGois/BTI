The effects of alpha 2-adrenoceptor and gamma-aminobutyric acidB (GABAB) receptor activation on noradrenaline synthesis were measured in rat hippocampal synaptosomes. The results show that alpha 2-autoreceptors and GABAB heteroreceptors inhibit K+-accelerated synthesis; they have no effect on basal synthesis.
