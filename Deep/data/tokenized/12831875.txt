Glucose-sensitive neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area produce orexin-A (hypocretin-1) and orexin-B (hypocretin-2) and send their axons to the hippocampus, which predominantly expresses orexin receptor 1 showing a higher sensitivity to orexin-A. The purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of orexin-A on the performance of Wistar rats during the Morris water maze test and then to determine the effects of orexin-A on both the long-term potentiation and long-term depression in Schaffer collateral/commissural-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. The results of the Morris water maze test show that 1.0 and 10 nmol of orexin-A, when administered intracerebroventricularly, retarded spatial learning. A probe test examined after training of water maze task also showed an impairment in spatial memory. The results of an electrophysiological study using hippocampal slices demonstrated that 1.0 to 30 nM of orexin-A applied to the perfusate produces a dose-dependent and time dependent suppression of the long-term potentiation. In addition, the long-term depression was not affected by orexin-A. The results of a paired-pulse facilitation experiment indicated that the effects of orexin-A were post-synaptic and not due to presynaptic transmitter release. These results show that orexin-A impairs spatial performance and these impairments can be attributed to a suppression of long-term potentiation in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 hippocampal synapses.
