The present study explored the protective effects of cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN) and fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 (URB) against neuroinflammation in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Activated microglia, astrocytes, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65-positive cells were measured by immunofluorescence. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by dihydroethidium staining. The protein levels of cluster of differentiation molecule 11b (OX-42), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), NF-kappaB p65, inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IkappaB-a), IkappaB kinase a/beta (IKK a/beta), phosphorylated IKK a/beta (p-IKK a/beta), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) were examined by western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All the protein levels of OX-42, GFAP, TNF-a, IL-1beta, COX-2, and iNOS are increased in CCH rats. WIN and URB downregulated the levels of OX-42, GFAP, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, COX-2 and iNOS and inhibited CCH-induced ROS accumulation in CCH rats, indicating that WIN and URB might exert their neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the neuroinflammatory response. In addition, the NF-kappaB signaling pathway was activated by CCH in frontal cortex and hippocampus, while the aforementioned changes were reversed by WIN and URB treatment. These findings suggest that WIN and URB treatment ameliorated CCH-induced neuroinflammation through inhibition of the classical pathway of NF-kappaB activation, resulting in mitigation of chronic ischemic injury.
