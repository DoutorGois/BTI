Recurrent seizures may cause neuronal damage in the hippocampus. As neurons form intimate interactions with astrocytes via glutamate, this neuron-glia circuit may play a pivotal role in neuronal excitotoxicity following such seizures. On the other hand, astrocytes contact vascular endothelia with their endfeet. Recently, we found kainic acid (KA) administration induced microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) receptor EP3 in venous endothelia and on astrocytes, respectively. In addition, mice deficient in mPGES-1 exhibited an improvement in KA-induced neuronal loss, suggesting that endothelial PGE(2) might modulate neuronal damage via astrocytes. In this study, we therefore investigated whether the functional associations between endothelia and astrocytes via endothelial mPGES-1 lead to neuronal injury using primary cultures of hippocampal slices. We first confirmed the delayed induction of endothelial mPGES-1 in the wild-type (WT) slices after KA-treatment. Next, we examined the effects of endothelial mPGES-1 on Ca(2+) levels in astrocytes, subsequent glutamate release and neuronal injury using cultured slices prepared from WT and mPGES-1 knockout mice. Moreover, we investigated which EP receptor on astrocytes was activated by PGE(2). We found that endothelial mPGES-1 produced PGE(2) that enhanced astrocytic Ca(2+) levels via EP3 receptors and increased Ca(2+)-dependent glutamate release, aggravating neuronal injury. This novel endothelium-astrocyte-neuron signaling pathway may be crucial for neuronal damage after repetitive seizures, and hence could be a new target for drug development.
