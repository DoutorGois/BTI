In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of Hippocampus mohnikei (Gasterosteiformes, Syngnathidae). This mitochondrial genome, consisting of 16 518 base pairs (bp), contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a non-coding control region as those found in other vertebrates. The control region, of 878 bp in length, is located between tRNA(Pro) and tRNA(Phe). The overall base composition of the heavy strand shows 29.90% of T, 22.98% of C, 32.12% of A, and 15.00% of G, with a slight A + T rich feature (62.02%).
