OBJECTIVE: To study the protection of Zibu Piyin Recipe (ZBPYR) on the insulin signal pathway in the hippocampus of Pi-yin deficiency diabetic encephalopathy rats and to explore its possible mechanisms. METHODS: The type 2 diabetic model was established using high fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of small dose streptozotocin (STZ). The Pi-yin deficiency model was established referring to classic compound factors. The learning and memory capabilities were tested in rats by the behavioral changes. The protein expressions of hippocampal IRE1alpha, JNK, and IRS-1 were detected using Western blot. RESULTS: There was statistical difference in the learning and memory capabilities of Pi-yin deficiency rats when compared with the blank control group (P<0.05). The learning and memory capabilities could be improved by ZBPYR. The protein expressions of hippocampal phospho-IRS-1, phospho-JNK, and total IRE1alpha were enhanced (P<0.05). But they were weakened after treatment of ZBPYR. CONCLUSIONS: ZBPYR could significantly improve the learning and memory capabilities of Pi-yin deficiency diabetic rats. Its functions might be correlated with improving the endoplasmic reticulum stress to regulate the insulin signaling pathway.
