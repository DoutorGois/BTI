Previous studies have shown that a family of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) plays pivotal roles in the brain; in particular, we previously reported that knockout of the gamma isoform of PI3K (PI3Kgamma) in mice impaired synaptic plasticity and reduced behavioral flexibility. To further examine the role of PI3Kgamma in synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent behavioral tasks we overexpressed p110gamma, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kgamma, in the hippocampal CA1 region. We found that the overexpression of p110gamma impairs NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) and hippocampus-dependent spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) task. In contrast, long-term potentiation (LTP) and contextual fear memory were not affected by p110gamma overexpression. These results, together with the previous knockout study, suggest that a critical level of PI3Kgamma in the hippocampus is required for successful induction of LTD and normal learning.
