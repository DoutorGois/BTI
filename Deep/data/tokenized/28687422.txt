OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether electro-acupuncture (EA) treatment at acupoints of Zusanli (ST 36) and Quchi (LI 11) could reduce motor impairments and enhance brain functional recovery in rats with ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established. EA at ST 36 and LI 11was started at 24 hours (MCAO + EA group) after ischemic stroke. The nontreatment (MCAO) and sham-operated control (SC) groups were included as controls. The neurologic deficits of all groups were assessed by Zea Longa scores and the modified neurologic severity scores on 24 hours and 8 days after MCAO. To further investigate the effect of EA on infract volume and brain function, magnetic resonance imaging was used to estimate the brain lesion and brain neural activities of each group at 8 days after ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Within 1 week after EA treatment, the neurologic deficits were significantly alleviated, and the cerebral infarctions were improved, including visual cortex, motor cortex, striatum, dorsal thalamus, and hippocampus. Furthermore, whole brain neural activities of auditory cortex, lateral nucleus group of dorsal thalamus, hippocampus, motor cortex, orbital cortex, sensory cortex, and striatum were decreased in MCAO group, whereas that of brain neural activities were increased after EA treatment, suggesting these brain regions are in accordance with the brain structure analysis. CONCLUSION: EA at ST 36 and LI 11 could enhance the neural activity of motor function-related brain regions, including motor cortex, dorsal thalamus, and striatum in rats, which is a potential treatment for ischemia stroke.
