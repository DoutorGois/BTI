OBJECTIVES: To explore relationship between rat brain tissues hurts of gas explosion and the expression of Protein Kinase C alpha mRNA. METHODS: Build up rat hurt model of gas explosion. In Situ Hybridization (IDH) technique was used to test Protein Kinase C alpha mRNA. Immunohistochemical Assays (IHA) was used to determine c-fos gene protein. RESULTS: Only a little a mount expression of PKC alpha mRNA and c-fos of the control group was detected. The expression of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of PKC alpha mRNA 24 h, 48 h and the 48 h increased obviously, and the 48 h reached the peak of expression; (t = 4.12 P < 0.01). The expression of c-fos protein of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus started to increase obviously at 0.5 h and the 4 h reached the peak, then the strength lowered gradually and the expression level came back normal level on fifth day. CONCLUSION: The anoxia of brain tissues due to the gas explosion may promote the expression of PKCamRNA, and PKCamRNA could regulate the expression of the gene of c-fos. Both PKCamRNA and the gene of c-fos are involved in harmful processes to the nerve cells.
