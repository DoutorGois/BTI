Cellular localization of grap junction mRNA was examined in the neonatal rat brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry using cDNA of rat liver gap junction (connexin 32). Hybridizable gap junction mRNA was localized on neural cells in the hippocampus. Gap junction mRNA was also found to be localized on neural cells of the parenchyma and ependymal layers in many other regions. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations of the hippocampus supported the presence of gap junctions in the examined region. These results are the first demonstration of morphologically identified gap junctions and cellularly localized gap junction mRNA in the neonatal rat brain.
