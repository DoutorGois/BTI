Sequential treatment of rats with low doses of lithium and pilocarpine, a high dose of pilocarpine, or continuous hippocampal stimulation [CHS] (9 epochs, 10 min each) is reported to result in status epilepticus (SE). We report a novel method to establish SE based on continuous ventral hippocampal stimulation (5 epochs) followed by low dose pilocarpine (40 mg/kg) challenge. Motor limbic seizures occured in all the control rats. The latency to spike activity was 15 +/- 1 min after pilocarpine administration. Ventral hippocampal [VHc] and cortical EEG recordings were used to monitor the protective effect of diazepam (5 mg/kg). Except phenobarbital, all the three drugs completely prevented all the phases of seizure activity. Initiation of spikes was significantly prolonged by phenobarbital pretreatment. Further study on the characteristics of these convulsions offers a unique possibility for the recognition of brain regions, pathways, and neurotransmitters engaged in the spread of seizures in this model.
