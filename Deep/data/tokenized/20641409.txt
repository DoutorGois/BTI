Changes in beta-adrenoceptor (G-protein coupled) density and affinity in the heart, lung and brain have been associated with a variety of disorders, such as myocardial ischemia and infarction, congestive heart failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease (1-3). There are at least four subtypes of beta-adrenoceptor receptors: beta1 to beta4 (4). Only the beta1and beta2-subtypes have been studied extensively. The cardiac receptors are found exclusively in the atria and ventricles and are responsible for the regulation of heart rate and myocardial contractility. The human heart and lung have a beta1 to beta2 ratio of 4:1, and 3:7, respectively. In contrast, the cerebral beta-adrenoceptors are heterogeneously distributed in the brain with the highest densities in the caudate and putamen, followed by the cortical areas and thalamus. The brain white matter has low densities. beta1-adrenoceptors are found predominately in the putamen and cortex, while the beta2-adrenoceptors are found mainly in the hippocampus and cerebellum. The cerebral beta-adrenoceptors are implicated in many physiological and behavioral responses. S-4-(3-(tert-butylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2H-benzimidazol-one (S-CGP12177) was reported to be an inhibitor of beta1- and beta2-adrenoceptors (5). S-[(11)C]CGP 12177 has been studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) producing excellent images of human heart and lung [PubMed]. However, the synthesis of [(11)C]CGP 12177 was proven to be laborious and often troublesome. Therefore, the isopropyl analogue of S-[(11)C]CGP 12177, S-4-(3-([(11)C]isopropylamino)-2-hydroxypropoxy)-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (S-[(11)C]CGP 12388) is being developed as a PET agent for studying beta-adrenoceptors non-invasively in the lung and heart but not the brain since it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
