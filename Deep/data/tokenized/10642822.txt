Ground squirrels withstand up to 90% reductions in cerebral blood flow during hibernation as well as rapid reperfusion upon periodic arousals from torpor. Metabolic suppression likely plays a primary adaptive role which allows hibernating species to tolerate such phenomena. However, several other aspects of hibernation physiology are also consistent with tolerance to dramatic fluctuations in cerebral blood flow, suggesting that multiple neuroprotective adaptations may work in concert during hibernation. The purpose of the present work was to study the dynamics of the low molecular weight antioxidants, ascorbate and glutathione (GSH), during hibernation. Alterations in concentrations of ascorbate during hibernation and arousal in two species of hibernating ground squirrels suggest that it could play a protective role during hibernation or arousal. Samples were collected during the hibernation season from arctic ground squirrels (AGS; Spermophilus parryii) and 13-lined ground squirrels (TLS; S. tridecemlineatus) during prolonged torpor and in squirrels that did not hibernate or had not been hibernating for several weeks. We determined antioxidant levels in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and in frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma ascorbate concentrations increased dramatically (3-4-fold) in both species during hibernation and rapidly returned to prehibernation levels upon arousal. By contrast, plasma GSH concentrations fell slightly or remained stable during hibernation. Ascorbate levels in the CSF doubled in hibernating AGS (not determined in TLS), while brain ascorbate content fell slightly (10-15%) in both species. Substantial increases in plasma and CSF ascorbate concentrations suggest that this antioxidant could play a protective role during hibernation and reperfusion upon arousal from hibernation.
