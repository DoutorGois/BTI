OBJECTIVE: To study the expressions of p35 and p25 and Cdk5 kinase activity in cultured rats hippocampal neurons following X-ray exposure to provide experimental evidence for prevention and treatment of radiation encephalopathy. METHODS: The hippocampal neurons cultured for 12 days were subjected to a single-dose X-ray exposure of 30 Gy. Western blotting was used to detect the p35 and p25 protein levels, and the effect of pretreatment with roscovitine, a Cdk5 inhibitor, on the apoptosis of the hippocampal neurons following the exposure was examined with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. RESULTS: The protein level of p35 increased significantly 3.5 and 4 h after the irradiation by 1.51-/+0.13 and 1.45-/+0.14 folds in comparison with the control level, respectively (P<0.01), and the p25 level increased significantly 6 h after irradiation by 1.62-/+0.28 folds (P<0.05). Nuclear condensation occurred in (24.8-/+3.97)% of the neurons 24 h after 30 Gy X-ray exposure, a rate significantly higher than that in the nonexposed cells [(1.82-/+1.08)%, P<0.01) and that in roscovitine-pretreated neurons [(7.74-/+2.27)%, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: X-ray exposure activates Cdk5 by increasing the p35 and p25 expressions in rat hippocampal neurons, and inhibition of Cdk5 activity with roscovitine can significantly protect the neurons from apoptosis.
