Adult neural precursor cells (NPCs) are predominantly located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles or in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. These NPCs produce neuroblasts that normally migrate and integrate into the olfactory bulb and hippocampus, respectively. Following CNS damage due to disease or injury, NPCs can also migrate to the site of damage. Enhancement of NPC migration to sites of neural damage may increase their potential for repair but requires an understanding of processes that regulate basal and injury-induced migration so we can harness this potential. This review highlights the extrinsic factors and major intrinsic signalling pathways that regulate endogenous basal NPC migration to the olfactory bulb and the role of inflammatory mediators and chemokines in disease and injury-induced NPC migration.
