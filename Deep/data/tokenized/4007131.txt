In swine, cerebral blood flow was documented by a left ventricular injection of radiolabeled 15-micron spheres. Utilizing this procedure, the effect of the putative neurotransmitter methionine-enkephalin on regional cerebral blood flow was systemically evaluated. Our results revealed that a peripheral infusion of methionine enkephalin into miniature swine significantly increased cerebral blood flow in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, pons, inferior parietal cortex and frontal cortex. Non-significant increases were observed in the hippocampus, occipital cortex and medulla oblongata while no effect on blood flow was observed in the pituitary gland. Significance of these results in the potential role of methionine enkephalin as a modulator of blood flow to the brain.
