The [14C]2-deoxyglucose method was applied to measure the effects of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55212-2 intravenous administration on glucose utilization in the rat brain. Two doses of the drug, that have been reported previously to increase extracellular dopamine concentrations in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, were used (0.15-0.30 mg/kg). At the lower dose, WIN 55212-2 increased energy metabolism selectively in the accumbens shell. Conversely, the higher dose of the drug reduced glucose utilization in the hippocampal formation and ventromedial thalamic nucleus without affecting energy metabolism in the accumbens shell. These results may be useful to further understanding the addictive potentials of cannabinoid drugs.
