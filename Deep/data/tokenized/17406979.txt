It is now well documented that active neurogenesis does exist throughout the life span in the brain of various species including human. Two discrete brain regions contain progenitor cells that are capable of differentiating into neurons or glia, the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Recent studies have shown that neurogenesis can be modulated by a variety of factors, including stress and neurohormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, drugs of abuse, and also strokes and traumatic brain injuries. In particular, the hippocampal neurogenesis may play a role in neuroadaptation associated with pathologies, such as cognitive disorders and depression. The increased neurogenesis at sites of injury may represent an attempt by the central nervous system to regenerate after damage. We herein review the most significant data on hippocampal neurogenesis in brain under various pathological conditions, with a special attention to mood disorders including depression and addiction.
