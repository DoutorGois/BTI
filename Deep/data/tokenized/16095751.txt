Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), a major component of high density lipoproteins, has been shown to be involved in lipid metabolism, cholesterol homeostasis and degeneration/regeneration of brain tissues and was proposed as a useful marker for the extent and severity of CNS injury. We searched for aberrant protein expression in hippocampus from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) by an analytical method based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and unambiguously identified 2 spots as apolipoprotein A-I forms in brain of MTLE patients with 7.5-fold increased levels (controls: 0.046 +/- 0.046; MTLE patients: 0.343 +/- 0.154, mean +/- SD, P = 0.003). Western blot analysis confirmed increased apo A-I levels in MTLE. Immunohistochemistry detected staining for apo A-I extracellularly in perivasal brain parenchyma, neuropil and areas with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression as well as some pyramidal neurons and subpial astrocytes. These findings indicate that the increase of apo A-I in MTLE was possibly not reflecting a pathogenetic role but was rather due to extravasates, bleedings or increase of microvascular endothelial cells known to synthesize apo A-I. Care has to be taken when protein expressional findings are to be interpreted in the presence of plasma proteins, including apo A-I, thus clearly representing a confounding factor.
