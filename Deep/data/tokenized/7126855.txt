Influence of diazepam on the amplitude of the population spikes (PS) evoked in CA1 area by Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices was analyzed. Diazepam was diluted in Hanks solution used for slice incubation. Introduction of diazepam (3.96 X 10-6 M) into the medium led to a significant decrease in the PS amplitude. higher concentrations (3.96 X 10-5 M) resulted in augmentation of the population EPSP and in disappearance of the PS. The effects were reversible. It is concluded that diazepam inhibits the discharges of the population of CAl neurones.
