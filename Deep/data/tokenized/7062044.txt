Carboxy- and amino-terminal specific neurotensin antisera have been characterized and used to determine the nature of neurotensin-like immunoreactivity in the rat central nervous system. Using these antisera, together with the separation of neurotensin-like immunoreactivity on reverse-phase HPLC columns, it is clear that the majority of rat central nervous system neurotensin-like immunoreactivity is indistinguishable from the synthetic tridecapeptide, However, smaller amounts of carboxy- and amino-terminal neurotensin-like immunoreactivity were detected, which may correspond to carboxy- and amino-terminal fragments of neurotensin. In addition, using the amino-terminal directed neurotensin antiserum, a detailed distribution of neurotensin-like immunoreactivity in the rat central nervous system is described. Highest amounts were found in the hypothalamus, central amygdaloid nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord and of the trigeminal region.
