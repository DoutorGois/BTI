The neurodegenerative effect of ibotenic acid injected into the rat hippocampus was unaffected by the anaesthetics halothane or pentobarbital, apart from a trend to an increased toxicity at higher doses of pentobarbital (60-72 mg/kg). Its toxicity was substantially blocked only by high anaesthetic doses of the indirect acting N-methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonist, ketamine (150-180 mg/kg, i.p.). This is in contrast to its previous reported ability to protect at low concentrations in vitro. On the other hand, the protective effect of ketamine was modified under halothane or pentobarbital anaesthesia. Thus, under halothane anaesthesia, ketamine at 60 mg/kg, i.p. caused a large increase in ibotenic acid-induced neuronal death.
