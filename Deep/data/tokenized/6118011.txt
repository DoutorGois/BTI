The effects of neuroleptic drugs (chlorpromazine, trifluperazine, fluphenazine, benperidol, bromperidol, flupentixol, clozapine, reserpine, RO-4-1284) on the activity of prostaglandin synthetase were studied in the microsomes of the seminal vesicles of the bull. The activity of prostaglandin synthetase was determined in the microsomes of bull brain (cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus) and the effect of the neuroleptic drugs was determine on the activity of prostaglandin synthetase in the thalamus, where the activity of this enzyme was highest. It was found that the experimental model of seminal vesicles was unsuitable for evaluating the effects of neuroleptic drugs on the central nervous system. It was demonstrated that prostaglandin synthetase activity differed in different parts of the brain and this activity was highest in the thalamus. The obtained results indicate that inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase activity seems to have no significant importance in the mechanism of the neuroleptic action of these drugs.
