Two different types of the glial envelope are demonstrated around the septal cerebral area grafts (SCAG) and the hippocampal grafts (HG) developing in the anterior eye chamber of the rat during 3-4 months. In the SCAG it is multilayered, consists mainly of modified oligodendrocytes. Processes of the nervous cells perforate the surface of the envelope. In the HG the unilayered glial envelope consists of bodies and processes of the fibrous astrocytes; it is impenetrable for the nervous processes. Since both types of the cellular elements making these envelopes have been described in the norm, it is possible that the differences in the surfaces described are specific for these structures.
