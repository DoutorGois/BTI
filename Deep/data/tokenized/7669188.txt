The synthesis of some o-methoxyphenylpiperazines with a benzamide moiety on N-4 alkyl chain was accomplished and their affinity for dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes was assayed by in vitro receptor binding. The results show that several derivatives had a good affinity both on D-2 and 5-HT1A receptors, the IC50s ranging from 10(-7) to 10(-8) M.
