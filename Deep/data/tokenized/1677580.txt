Our previous work provided evidence that hippocampal opioid peptides form an important neurochemical substrate underlying the gene-dependent exploratory behavior of mice. A prominent hippocampal opioid is dynorphin B, which resides in the mossy fibers exclusively. In order to seek support for causal relationships between dynorphinergic hippocampal mechanisms and exploration, a quantitative-genetic method was chosen. For this purpose, mice from the inbred strains C57BL/6, DBA/2, BLN, and CPB-K were used. Their hippocampal mossy fiber projections were visualized by means of immunohistochemistry, using a highly specific anti-dynorphin B antiserum. The additive-genetic correlations that were estimated suggest pleiotropic gene effects on locomotion, rearing-up, wall-leaning, and several intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber (iipMF) variables. Long iipMF, in particular, were found to be associated with high exploratory activity.
