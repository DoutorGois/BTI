Binding sites for N-Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (Tyr-MIF-1), a novel peptide structurally related but immunoreactively different from Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (MIF-1), were investigated. The presence of Tyr-MIF-1-like material in brain tissue has previously been demonstrated by RIA and its levels were shown to vary with the diurnal cycle and after pinealectomy. We now demonstrate a high affinity binding site in rat brain that is saturable and specific for Tyr-MIF-1. Crude P2 synaptosomal fractions from rat brains were incubated with 125I-Tyr-MIF-1 in the presence or absence of 10 microM unlabeled Tyr-MIF-1 (nonspecific binding). Binding reached equilibrium at 30-40 min at 23 degrees C and at about 4 hr on ice, after which it was relatively stable for at least 18 hr. None of the other peptides (including MIF-1) or amino acid residues tested were found to effectively compete for 125I-Tyr-MIF-1 binding. Binding was linear with protein from 280 micrograms to at least 1.1 mg protein per tube. Scatchard analysis of the striatum-thalamus revealed the presence of binding sites with an apparent Kp of 91 nM and maximum number of sites in the range of 45 fmol/mg tissue. Analysis of several brain areas revealed a differential distribution of the binding sites with relatively high concentrations in cortex, striatum, and amygdala and low concentrations in pons-medulla. Together with the previously published RIA results, the demonstration of a receptor for Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 supports the concept of the presence of this novel peptide and its receptor in the brain.
