The main glutamate transporter GLT-1 is responsible for clearing synaptically released glutamate from the extracellular space and contributes to the shaping of glutamatergic transmission. Recently, it has been shown that ceftriaxone (CEF)-induced GLT-1 upregulation is associated with an impairment of the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, a simple form of information processing that is reduced in schizophrenia, and determines a strong reduction in hippocampal metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)2/3-dependent long-term depression. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that administration of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 blocks the effect of GLT-1 upregulation on PPI of the startle. We showed that administration of LY379268 (1 mg/kg) prevented PPI alterations associated with GLT-1 upregulation, suggesting that CEF-induced PPI impairment was mGluR2/3 dependent. In addition, we showed that CEF-induced GLT-1 upregulaton did not alter the expression of mGluR2/3, and also that it occurred at sites of mGluR2/3 expression. These results indicate a novel mechanism by which GLT-1 upregulation modulates PPI of the startle.
