The cholinergic projections to the limbic telecephalon in the rat were investigated by use of fluorescent tracer histology in combination with choline-O-acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry (pharmacohistochemical regimen). Propidium iodide or Evans Blue was infused into the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, dorsal retrohippocampal region, amygdala, and the entorhinal, perirhinal, pyriform, insular, and cingular cortices. Retrogradely transported fluorescent labels and ChAT and/or AChE were microscopically analyzed on the same brain section. Virtually all of the cholinergic projections to the limbic telencephalon derived from the basal forebrain cholinergic system composed of neurons associated with the medial septal nucleus, nuclei of the vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, the magnocellular preoptic area, the subpallidal substantia innominata and its rostral extension into the regions of the ventral pallidum laterally and the lateral preoptic area medially, and the nucleus basalis. The cingulate cortex received a small cholinergic projection from the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus in the brainstem. All of the presumed cholinergic innervation of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and dorsal retrohippocampal area and the majority of cholinergic afferents to posterior cingulate and entorhinal cortices derived from the medial septal nucleus, vertical and horizontal limbs of the diagonal band, magnocellular preoptic area, and rostral substantia innominata. Putative cholinergic afferents to the amygdala and to pyriform, insular, perirhinal, and anterior cingulate cortices orginated from ChAT-positive cells concentrated more caudally in the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Within the basal forebrain, no simple topographic pattern emerged to explain the cholinergic innervation of the limbic telencephalon, although an essentially reverse rostrocaudal organization was observed for afferents to the cingular region. It was noted, however, that most regions of the limbic telencephalon received cholinergic input from rostral portions of the basal forebrain cholinergic system, an observation inviting speculation that anterior aspects of the basal forebrain provide cholinergic afferents primarily to limbic structures in the telencephalon whereas more caudal portions are the source of cholinergic fibers preferentially innervating non-limbic regions. Of the total number of projection neurons innervating a given region of the limbic telencephalon, a greater proportion was ChAT-positive if phylogenetically newer target structures were innervated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
