AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are dynamically regulated at synapses, but the time course and location of their exocytosis and endocytosis are not known. Therefore, we have used ecliptic pHluorin-tagged glutamate receptor 2 to visualize changes in AMPAR surface expression in real time. We show that synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPARs respond very differently to NMDA receptor activation; there is a rapid internalization of extrasynaptic AMPARs that precedes the delayed removal of synaptic AMPARs.
