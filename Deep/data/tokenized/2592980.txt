The effect of aluminum (Al) was studied in an in vitro system of cultured hippocampal neurons from fetal rats in a chemically defined medium. Neuronal aggregates interconnected by neurites were detected light and electron microscopically in control and Al-treated cultures. In the Al-treated cultures disruptions of the fibers were observed proximal to the aggregates; the number of disruptions increased with The Al concentration applied. It is concluded that interference of intracellular Al with the neuronal skeleton occurs, leading to an enhanced fragility of the interconnecting neurites. The concentration-dependent Al-induced disruption of interconnecting neurites may serve as an in vitro model for further research in Al neurotoxicity.
