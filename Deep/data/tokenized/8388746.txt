Agonists at metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) produce both pre- and postsynaptic responses in the hippocampus that can be monitored electrophysiologically. We provide evidence for the involvement of a distinct mGluR coupled to stimulation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in the postsynaptic actions of 1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1S,3R-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), a selective mGluR agonist. In contrast, the presynaptic effects of 1S,3R-ACPD are not produced by increases in cAMP, but may be mediated through a different subtype of mGluR linked to inositol phospholipid metabolism.
