The steady-state levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) of five cloned dopamine (D) receptors were measured in five brain regions in rats in a recently developed animal model of 'behavioral dependence' on ethanol. One group of rats was given the choice between ethanol and water over a 9-month period and developed 'behavioral dependence' on ethanol (group a). This group was compared with a group given the choice between ethanol and water for only 2 months (not yet behaviorally dependent, group b), a group forced to consume ethanol as sole fluid over a 9-month period (not behaviorally dependent, group c) and ethanol-naive control rats. All groups were sacrificed 1 month after ethanol withdrawal. The concentrations of mRNA of D3-receptors in the limbic forebrain (which included the nucleus accumbens) were significantly lowered in groups a and b, but unchanged in group c. D3 mRNA levels were reduced in the hippocampus of group b and unchanged in the cortex, amygdala and striatum. No significant changes in the mRNA concentrations of D1-, D2-, D4- or D5-receptors were seen in the five brain regions in any group. In conclusion, chronic consumption of ethanol under the 'free-choice condition', which may best induce the drug-rewarding effect, leads to specific changes in the D3-receptor gene expression which were not seen after forced ethanol administration. Changes in D3 mRNA levels were, however, not a specific correlate of 'behavioral dependence', as they were also detected in rats not yet 'behaviorally dependent' (group b).
