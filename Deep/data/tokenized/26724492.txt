Confabulation, the production of statements and actions that are unintentionally incongruous to the subject's history, background, present and future situation, is observed in several conditions affecting the nervous system, but it has never been described in normotensive hydrocephalus. In this article we report on a patient with normotensive hydrocephalus who suffered from an amnesic-confabulatory syndrome. After hydrocephalus shunting, both amnesia and confabulation cleared up abruptly. We discuss this finding in terms of a possible disconnection of the hippocampus, due to transitory white matter damage, which may have recovered after hydrocephalus shunting.
