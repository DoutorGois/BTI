Hippocampal and striatal systems are widely related to spatial tasks. Depending on the strategies used, different memory systems can be activated. In this study, the authors used the cytochrome c-oxidase technique as a functional marker of the hippocampal and dorsal striatum activity related to training in several water maze tasks. Current results show a differential participation of the hippocampal and striatal systems in navigation. When spatial information is relevant, participation of the hippocampal system is more important, and when the task is similar to a response learning one, the striatal system is more active. According to computational models, CA3 seems to be more active when the associative demand is higher, whereas CA1 and dentate gyrus activity are higher when spatial information processing is required.
