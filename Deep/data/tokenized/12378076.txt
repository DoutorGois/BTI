For seizure control in temporal lobe epilepsy, the head of the hippocampus to the choroidal point, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal area, uncus, and at least the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala should be completely removed. The subtemporal approach should be selected for removal of these structures, and it does not interrupt the temporal stem and optic radiation. Pre- and postoperative neuropsychological examinations revealed that there is no significant decline of scores of various examinations including WAIS, WMS, Randt memory, and verbal associates learning tests, even if the resection were performed on the language dominant side. Seizure control for the 20 non-lesional patients operated with this approach is 60% (Class I and II), without definite permanent complications.
