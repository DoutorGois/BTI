Since we found that the stress response of acetylcholine release in the hippocampus was attenuated in male rats living in a small cage, we individually housed female rats in a large (diameter=35 cm) or a small (19 cm) cylindrical cage for 4 days and examined the response to restraint stress which was applied from 12:00 h to 13:00 h. Both groups of rats showed a significant increase in the acetylcholine release in the hippocampus, as well as an increase in corticosterone release. But neither housing condition affected the expression of the 4-day estrous cycle. We surmise that there may be a sex difference in the effect of housing condition in the stress response of acetylcholine release in the hippocampus.
