Chance events led me to a lifelong career in scientific research. They paved the way for being the first to see long-term potentiation of synaptic efficiency (LTP) in Per Andersen's laboratory in Oslo in 1966. Here I describe my way to this discovery and the experiments with Tim Bliss in 1968-1969 that led to Bliss and Lomo, 1973. Surprisingly, we later failed to reproduce these results. I discuss possible reasons for this failure, which made us both leave LTP research, in my case for good, in Tim's case for several years. After 30 years of work in a different field, I renewed my interest in the hippocampus and LTP in the early 2000s and published, for the first time, results that I had obtained 40 years earlier. Here I present my take on how interest in and research on LTP evolved after the early years. This includes a discussion of the functions of hippocampus as seen in those early days, the case of patient H.M., Donald Hebb's place in the story, the search for 'memory molecules' such as PKMzeta, and the primary site for LTP expression (pre- and/or post-synaptic?). Throughout, I reflect on my life in science, how science is done and what drives it. The reflections are quite personal and I admit to mixed feelings about broadcasting them.
