GABAergic neurons of the amygdala are thought to play a critical role in establishing networks for feedback and feedforward inhibition and in mediating rhythmic network activity patterns relevant for emotional behavior, determination of stimulus salience, and memory strength under stressful experiences. These functions are typically fulfilled in interplay of amygdala and hippocampus. Therefore, we explored the putative connectivity of GABAergic neurons with the hippocampo-amygdalar projection with the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (Phal) and Miniruby injected to GAD67-GFP knock-in mice in which GABAergic neurons are labeled by the expression of the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP) inserted to the GAD1 gene locus (Tamamaki et al. J Comp Neurol 467:60-79, 2003). We found that, while hippocampal axons target all nuclei of the amygdala, the densest fiber plexus was found in the posterior basomedial nucleus. Electron microscopy revealed that the vast majority of contacts in this nucleus were formed by thin fibers making small asymmetrical contacts, predominantly on GFP-negative profiles. However, several asymmetrical contacts could also be seen on GFP-positive profiles. A surprising result was the occasional occurrence of anterogradely labeled symmetrical synapses indicating a GABAergic contribution to the projection from the hippocampus to the amygdala. While hippocampal input to the amygdala appears to be largely excitatory and targets non-GABAergic neurons, our data provide evidence for a direct involvement of GABAergic neurons in the interplay of these regions, either as target in the amygdala or as projection neurons from the hippocampus. These particular "interface neurons" may be of relevance for the information processing in the amygdalo-hippocampal system involved in emotional behavior and memory formation.
