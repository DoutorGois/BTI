Aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) cause have been implicated in the etiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, these elements cause the conformational changes of Alzheimer's amyloid beta protein. In this study, we determined the concentrations of Al, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn in various tissues of Tg 2576 (AbetaPP transgenic) Al-treated mice. Female Tg 2576 mice and wild-type littermates were exposed through the diet to 1mg Al/g for 6 months. At 11 months of age, metal concentrations were measured in various tissues. In brain, Al levels were higher in hippocampus than in cortex and cerebellum. In hippocampus, Cu concentrations decreased in non-treated Tg 2576 mice, while Zn levels were higher in Al-treated mice. Copper, Zn, Mn and Fe concentrations in liver, kidney and bone were not affected by Al exposure. The current results show that Al exposure of Tg 2576 and wild-type mice did not produce important metal changes related with the genotype, responding similarly both groups of animals. As Tg 2576 mice have been considered as a potential model for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the present results would not support the hypothetical role of Al in the etiology of AD.
