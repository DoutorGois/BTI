The present study was designed to investigate the effects of the intrahippocampal co-injection of beta-amyloid protein1-40 (Abeta(1-40)) with ibotenic acid (Ibo) on learning and memory in normal and aging model rats, and to explore the mechanism underlying the effects of the co-injection. The normal and aging rats were bilaterally injected Abeta(1-40) (4 microg for each side) with Ibo (2 microg for each side) into the hippocampus. Two weeks after the intrahippocampal injection, the exploratory behavior and learning-memory ability of the rats were tested by using open field, Y-maze and passive avoidance task. And the changes of membrane fluidity in hippocampal mitochondria, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in hippocampus were also examined. The co-injection of Abeta(1-40) with Ibo induced tested rats a remarkable decrease in the explorative behaviors and a significant decline in learning-memory ability (P < 0.01). The neurochemical changes induced by the co-injection included a significant decrease in membrane fluidity of hippocampal mitochondria (P < 0.01), a significant decrease in the activity of SOD (P < 0.01), as well as a remarkable increase in the content of MDA (P < 0.01). The results suggest that co-injection of Abeta(1-40) with Ibo may induce an increase of hippocampal damage by peroxidation and a serious deficit in the learning and memory of the rats. The results also suggest that the co-injection of Abeta(1-40) with Ibo may provide a useful animal model for the Alzheimer's disease (AD) research.
