Brain tissue, maintained in vitro, was used to determine whether agents that block calcium entry into neurons can improve the recovery of evoked responses after anoxia. The hippocampus was dissected from a rat brain and sliced perpendicular to its long axis such that its main neuronal circuits remain functional. A pathway in the slice was stimulated electrically, and an extracellular potential, the evoked population spike, recorded from the neurons postsynaptic to that pathway. A bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in either the perforant path or the Schaeffer collaterals and a monopolar metal microelectrode placed, respectively, in either the dentate granule cell layer or the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. The slices were maintained in vitro by superfusing them with oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). In order to generate anoxia, the tissue was superfused with aCSF bubbled with 95% N2, 5% CO2 for either 5 or 10 min. All drugs examined were present in the aCSF before, during, and immediately after the anoxic period. Percentage recovery was expressed as the amplitude of the evoked population spike 60 min after anoxia divided by its preanoxic amplitude. Protection in this model is defined as a significant (P less than 0.05) improvement in percentage recovery compared with the recovery of untreated slices. There was no recovery of the response recorded from untreated dentate granule cells after 10 min of anoxia (0 +/- 0%, n = 5; mean +/- SE), whereas 5 min of anoxia was sufficient to cause damage to the untreated CA1 pyramidal cells (4 +/- 3%, n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
