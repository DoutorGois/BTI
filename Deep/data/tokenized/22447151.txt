The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of N-[2-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-ethyl]-2-(2,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-ph enyl)-acrylamide (FLZ), a synthetic squamosamide cyclic derivative, on senescent mice induced by D: -galactose/NaNO(2) (120/90 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 60 days. FLZ (75 and 150 mg/kg) was orally administered once daily for 30 days after D: -galactose/NaNO(2) treatment for 30 days. The cognitive function of mice was evaluated with step-down task. The brain biomarkers including monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression of acetylcholinesterase (ACh-E) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) protein in the CA1 region of hippocampus were counted by immunohistochemical staining. The results showed that the cognitive function, GSH-px activity in the brain, and the expression of ACh-E and ChAT in the CA1 region of hippocampus were significantly decreased, while MAO-B activity and MDA level in the brain were increased in senescent mice compared with the control mice. FLZ treatment prolonged the step-down latency and decreased the number of step-down errors in the senescent mice. In addition, FLZ treatment increased the GSH-px activity and the expression of ACh-E and ChAT in the hippocampus and decreased the MDA level and MAO-B activity compared with the senescent mice without drug administration. These findings suggested that FLZ improves the performance in the step-down task and the pathological alternations in senescent mice.
