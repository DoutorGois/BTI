This study tested the hypothesis that prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) during the brain growth spurt (BGS) in the guinea pig suppresses the glutamate-NMDA receptor-nitric oxide synthase (NOS) signaling system in the developing hippocampus. Pregnant guinea pigs [term, about gestational day (GD) 68] received daily oral administration of 2 g ethanol/kg maternal body weight/day on GD 43 and/or GD 44 and then 4 g ethanol/kg maternal body weight/day from GD 45 to GD 62, isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding or water. Offspring were studied at GD 63 (near-term fetus) and postnatal day (PD) 10 (young postnatal life). Maternal blood ethanol concentration during ethanol treatment, pregnancy outcome variables, no change in spontaneous locomotor activity, and decreased brain and cerebral cortical weight data were reported previously [Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 23 (2001) 355]. This BGS-PEE regimen did not affect hippocampal stimulated glutamate release in young postnatal offspring, NMDA receptors as assessed by [3H]MK-801 binding, or NOS activity in near-term fetal offspring. Furthermore, BGS-PEE did not affect the number of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells in defined locations of these three regions in the hippocampal formation. These findings are in contrast to the effects of chronic prenatal exposure to this ethanol regimen throughout gestation, including suppression of the hippocampal glutamate-NMDA receptor-NOS signaling system, decreased number of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, increased spontaneous locomotor activity, and impaired performance in the Morris water maze.
