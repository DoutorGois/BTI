Using an exchange assay for glucocorticoid receptors, we found that immobilization stress resulted in a approximately 50% translocation of receptors (i.e. receptors assumed to be chromatin bound) from soluble fractions prepared from hippocampal tissue. The increased hormone-receptor signal persisted for about 2-4 h following the termination of the stressor. This time course is consistent with the known temporal pattern for the negative feedback of glucocorticoids on adrenocortical activity.
