A wide range of subcellular organelles, pathogens, and macromolecular complexes are actively transported within neuronal and nonneuronal cells by microtubule motors. Transport speeds range up to 2-3 mum/s, which requires millisecond- and nanometer-scale resolution for proper imaging and analysis. Dissecting the contributions of multiple motor types has been challenging because of their functional interdependence and the complexity of individual motor behavior. In this chapter, we describe several methods for motor inhibition coupled with high-resolution particle tracking of vesicular and virus cargoes to provide a detailed and quantitative understanding of motor behavior and regulation. We discuss long-term inhibition, as well as short-term inhibition methods when needed to minimize complications from motor protein interactions.
