Expression of hippocalcin and neural visinin-like calcium-binding protein 2 (NVP2) in aging rat brain was investigated by immunoblot and immunohistochemical analyses. In 3-month old rats, hippocalcin and NVP2 were present at high concentrations in hippocampal and cerebral pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells, with hippocalcin protein levels being five to ten times higher than NVP2 levels. Hippocalcin levels in hippocampus and cerebral cortex decreased by approximately 20% at 24 months. While the number of hippocalcin-positive cells in CA3, dentate gyrus and cerebral cortex were preserved, staining intensity decreased. In contrast, the number and staining intensity of hippocalcin-positive cells in CA1 were maintained. NVP2 levels in hippocampus and cerebral cortex decreased by approximately 30% at 24 months. In cerebral cortex, the number and intensity of NVP2-positive cells decreased. In CA1 through CA3 and in dentate gyrus, NVP2-positive cell numbers were preserved, but staining intensity decreased. In summary, the loss of hippocalcin and NVP2 in aging rat brain may be associated with age-related impairment of postsynaptic functions.
