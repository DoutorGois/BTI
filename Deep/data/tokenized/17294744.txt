OBJECTIVE: The present study tried to find out the effects of coriaria lactone (CL) on the sodium currents of the rat hippocampal neurons and their significance. METHODS: The sodium currents of the acutely isolated Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampal neurons were recorded by employing the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell voltage-clamp mode. The effects of CL on the peak currents in the neuron membrane were assessed and analyzed. RESULTS: Both 0.1 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL CL increased the maximal peak density of sodium currents significantly (17.32%+/-8.52% vs 37.98%+/-4.91%). The effect of 0.2 mg/mL CL (P < 0.05) was more significant than that of 0.1 mg/mL CL (P > 0.05), when compared with the control (3.16%+/-0.65%). CONCLUSION: CL can increase the amplitudes of the voltage-dependent sodium currents in the acutely isolated hippocampal neurons. This effect may contribute to the enhanced excitability of hippocampal neurons and play a role in the epileptogenetic process of CL.
