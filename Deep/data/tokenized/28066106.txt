OBJECTIVES: Inflammation plays a critical role in the progression of diabetic complications such as neurological disorders. Previous reports have indicated the memory-improving effect of troxerutin, in rat hippocampus, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Hence, we have investigated the effect of troxerutin pretreatment on gene expressions of inflammation-related microRNAs (miRs), miR-146a and miR-155, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway in the hippocampus of healthy and diabetic rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (control, control + troxerutin, diabetic, and diabetic + troxerutin). Diabetes was induced by a single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Troxerutin (150 mg/kg) was orally administered in animals for 1 month. After 10 weeks of diabetes, animals were anesthetized and decapitated for the isolation of hippocampus. The expression of miR-146a and miR-155 and the messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of NF-kappaB, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1), and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6) were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Diabetes significantly increased hippocampal mRNA levels of NF-kappaB, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6 compared with nondiabetic rats (P < 0.05); however, pretreatment with troxerutin decreased them in both diabetic and nondiabetic animals, independent of its glycemic effect (P < 0.05). The expression levels of miR-146a and miR-155 were decreased in diabetic group as compared to the control (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These findings showed that troxerutin could inhibit the inflammatory NF-kappaB pathway in the hippocampus of diabetic rats, which may be due to the negative feedback loop regulated by miR-146a.
