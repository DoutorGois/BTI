OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of cell division cycle 42 GTP-binding protein (Cdc42) in the brain tissue of patients with intractable temporal epilepsy and discuss its effect on epileptogenesis. METHODS: Twenty samples brain tissues were collected from the brain tissue bank of intractable temporal epilepsy established by Epilepsy Preventive and Therapeutic Center of Chongqing. The expression of Cdc42 was determined by immunohistochemistry and fluoroimmunoassay. Twenty brain tissue samples were collected from autopsy on 20 sex and age-matched persons who died from accident were used as controls. RESULTS: The absorption values of Cdc42 in the temporal lobe of the patients was 0.038 +/- 0.016, significantly higher than that of the controls (0.020 +/- 0.005, t = 14.59, P < 0.01). The absorption values of Cdc42 in the hippocampus of the patients was 0.049 +/- 0.009, t = 12.01, P < 0.01). Fluoroimmunoassay showed that the fluorescence intensity of Cdc42 in the temporal lobe of the patients was 18.3 +/- 2.5, significantly higher than that of the controls (11.8 +/- 2.9, t = 33.77, P < 0.01), and the Fluorescence intensity of Cdc42 in the hippocampus of the patients was and control hippocampus were 23.8 +/- 3.3, significantly higher than that of the controls (10.1 +/- 2.6, t = 12.01, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The overexpression of Cdc42 in the cortex of temporal lobe and hippocampus may play an important role in the epileptogenic mechanisms of intractable epilepsy.
