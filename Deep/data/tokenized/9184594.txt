PURPOSE: In rodents, specific motor components of generalized convulsive seizures depend on two distinct anatomic substrates: (a) forebrain networks are responsible for facial and forelimb clonus with or without rearing and falling; and (b) brainstem networks are responsible for running-bouncing fits and tonic convulsions. To investigate the requirement of proprioceptive inputs in the generation of these two different types of seizures, we compared the effects of neuromuscular blockade by D-tubocurarine on the EEG expression of brainstem- and forebrain-triggered seizures. METHODS: Unilateral electrical stimulations were applied for 50 consecutive days in freely moving male adult rats through a bipolar electrode aimed at the dorsal hippocampus (n = 5), the occipital cortex (n = 4), the inferior colliculus (n = 6), or the midbrain reticular formation (n = 6). Two days after the last stimulation, rats were paralyzed with d-tubocurarine and stimulated in the same way. RESULTS: In brainstem structures, the first electrical stimulation induced tonic seizures concomitant with low-voltage cortical activity; repetition of daily stimulations progressively induced tonic-clonic seizures associated with high-amplitude cortical spike-wave discharges. After immobilization by d-tubocurarine, brainstem stimulations failed to induce any EEG paroxysm. In forebrain structures, repeated electrical stimulations produced a classic kindling with progressive occurrence of clonic seizures associated with large cortical discharges; d-tubocurarine left unchanged the EEG pattern of these latter seizures. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that proprioceptive reafferentation resulting from movement is necessary for the generation of self-sustained brainstem seizures but is not implicated in the elaboration of forebrain seizures.
