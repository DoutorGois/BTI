Memory is often considered to be a process that has several stages, including acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. Memory can be modified further through reconsolidation and performance can change during extinction trials while the original memory remains intact. Recent studies of the molecular basis of these processes have found that many signaling molecules are involved in several stages of memory but, in some cases, molecular pathways may be selectively recruited only during certain stages of memory.
