We examined the uptake and distribution of an antisense phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotide (s-ODN) to c-fos, rncfosr115, infused into the left cerebral ventricle of male Long-Evans rats and the effect of this s-ODN on subsequent Fos, NGF, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and actin expression. To establish the uptake and turnover of s-ODN in the brain, we studied the copurification of the immunoreactivity of biotin with biotinylated s-ODN that was recovered from different regions of the brain. A time-dependent diffusion and the localization of s-ODN were further demonstrated by labeling the 3'-OH terminus of s-ODN in situ with digoxigenin-dUTP using terminal transferase and detection using anti-digoxigenin IgG-FITC. Cellular uptake of the s-ODN was evident in both the hippocampal and cortical regions, consistent with a gradient originating at the ventricular surface. Degradation of the s-ODN was observed beginning 48 hr after delivery. The effectiveness of c-fos antisense s-ODN was demonstrated by its suppression of postischemic Fos expression, which was accompanied by an inhibition of ischemia-induced NGF mRNA expression in the dentate gyrus. Infusion of saline, the sense s-ODN, or a mismatch antisense s-ODN did not suppress Fos expression. That this effect of c-fos antisense s-ODN was specific to NGF was demonstrated by its lack of effect on the postischemic expression of the NT-3 and beta-actin genes. Our results demonstrate that c-fos antisense s-ODN blocks selected downstream events and support the contention that postischemic Fos regulates the subsequent expression of the NGF gene and that Fos expression may have a functional component in neuroregeneration after focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.
