We assessed the two forms of monoamine oxidase (MAO), MAO-A and MAO-B, in discrete regions of the brain and in cerebral micro- and macrovessels, choroid plexus, and liver of three species of monkeys: African Green, rhesus, and cynomolgus. MAO was determined by specific [3H]pargyline binding which is stoichiometric and irreversible and by measuring the rate of oxidation of several substrates. Cerebral micro- and macrovessels had low MAO content. Regional brain MAO did not vary by more than one-fold in the brains of each of the three species of monkeys and was higher in the basal ganglia than in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. MAO in the choroid plexus was low, while the liver had higher MAO activity than any of the brain samples. The vast majority of MAO in all the tissues that we examined was of the MAO-B type, and specific [3H]pargyline binding correlated well with the oxidation rate of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. These results show marked similarities in brain MAO distribution between monkey and man. Or the three monkey species, the African Green monkey had the lowest MAO activity in its cerebral microvessels, which constitute the blood-brain barrier, although the small number of observations in each group did not allow statistical analyses of the differences.
