Learning-facilitated synaptic plasticity describes the ability of hippocampal synapses to respond with persistent synaptic plasticity to the coupling of weak afferent stimulation, which is subthreshold for the induction of plasticity, with a spatial learning experience. The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) is critically involved in enabling the persistency of multiple forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We compared the effects of pharmacological allosteric antagonism of mGluR5 in learning-facilitated plasticity with plasticity that had been induced solely by patterned afferent stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway to the CA1 stratum radiatum of adult freely behaving rats. Intracerebroventricular injection of the selective mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) had no effect on basal synaptic transmission but significantly prevented both long-term depression (LTD) elicited by electrical stimulation and LTD facilitated by novel object-place configuration learning. NMDA receptor antagonism also prevented learning-facilitated LTD. Habituation to the objects was prevented by MPEP application. Whereas reexposure to the object-place configuration (after 7 days) failed to facilitate LTD in control animals, those who had been treated previously with MPEP expressed LTD, suggesting that inhibition of learning contributed to the initial prevention of LTD. These data support a pivotal role for mGluR5 in both hippocampal LTD and the acquisition of object-place configurations.
