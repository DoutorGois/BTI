The basal firing rate and the responsiveness to dynorphin and leu-enkephalin of the neurons in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus were studied in intact male, castrated male, castrated female, and castrated female rats injected s.c. with 20 micrograms estradiol benzoate (EB) for 3 days. Most of the neurons studied had low spontaneous firing rate (less than 5 Hz) and burst-like activity in all the groups. The basal firing rates in castrated males and females were not different from those in intact males and castrated females treated with EB, respectively. However, neurons in intact and castrated males had significantly higher firing rates than those in castrated females with and without EB treatment, respectively. When effective, both iontophoretically applied dynorphin and leu-enkephalin evoked predominantly excitatory responses. Either castration of males or EB treatment to castrated females did not affect the neuronal responsiveness to these peptides. On the other hand, the responsiveness of neurons to leu-enkephalin, but not to dynorphin, was significantly different between castrated male and female rats. These results suggest that sex steroids do not affect the basal firing rate as well as the responsiveness to opioid peptides of the pyramidal cells in the hippocampus in adult animals. However, sex differences in the basal firing rate and in the responsiveness to leu-enkephalin might account for the differences in hippocampal functions between male and female rats.
