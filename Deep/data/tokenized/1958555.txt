Using specific antisera to purified rat liver 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD), we showed that the antigen is widely distributed in rat organs. Enzyme activity and immunoreactivity generally corresponded. Highest by both criteria were liver, testis, kidney and lung. In some tissues (epididymis, pancreas and duodenum) activity was found, but antigen corresponding to 11-HSD at a Mw of 34 kDa was absent. It is suggested that these tissues have alternate enzyme forms. The 11-HSD of brain and liver were compared. Brain enzyme may control selective binding of aldosterone to Type I receptors in the hippocampus and other regions. Rat brain 11-HSD resembled that of liver or kidney in most characteristics. It differed in (a) its steroid specificity: cortisol was a good substrate for liver 11-HSD, and a poor substrate for brain enzyme; (b) stability of 11-oxoreductase (11-OR) component. Brain 11-OR was not readily inactivated; 11-OR from other tissues lost activity rapidly and spontaneously. The variations in properties of 11-HSD in specific tissues may reflect aspects of its various specific functions.
