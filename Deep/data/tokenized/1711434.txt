Different regions of the prosencephalon and mesencephalon of the adult hamster brain displayed differences in the immunofluorescence expression of astrocytic proteins, namely glial fibrillary acidic protein and J1-31 antigen (30 kD protein). Neither of these proteins could be detected in layers II-VI of the cerebral cortex. However, varying degrees of immunostaining were detectable in perivascular glia, stria medullaris thalamus, the basal cerebral peduncle and the dentate molecular layer of the hippocampus. Vimentin was conspicuous in neurons, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes in major fibre tracts. These observations are discussed in relation to interspecies differences in the expression of intermediate filament proteins.
