Rat hippocampal slices were perfused with epidermal growth factor (EGF) at a concentration of 10(-8) M. EGF is a well known mitogen which exhibits neurotrophic action on neurons of the CNS. During extra- and intracellular recordings in the pyramidal cell body layer of the CA1-region no influence of EGF on evoked potentials was seen if single-pulse or paired-pulse stimulation was used. Furthermore EGF has no influence on the resting membrane potential of the cells investigated. However after tetanic stimulation a significant increase in the magnitude of long-term potentiation was observed. Therefore it is concluded, that EGF might be involved in modulation of neuronal plasticity.
