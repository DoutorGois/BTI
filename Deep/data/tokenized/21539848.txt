Lithium-pilocarpine, a relevant model of temporal lobe epilepsy was used to test the neuroprotective and antiepileptogenic effects of carisbamate. Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult rats by lithium and pilocarpine. Carisbamate (30, 60, 90, and 120 mg/kg) was injected at 1 and 9 h after SE onset and continued twice daily for 6 additional days. The reference groups received diazepam instead of carisbamate. Neuroprotection was assessed during the first 24 h of SE with Fluoro-Jade B and after 14 days with thionine staining. SE severity and epileptic outcome were assessed by video, and surface and depth electroencephalographic recordings. At the two highest doses, carisbamate treatment reduced SE severity; produced strong neuroprotection of hippocampus, ventral cortices, thalamus, and amygdala; prevented mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; and delayed or suppressed the occurrence of spontaneous motor seizures. Rats with no spontaneous motor seizures displayed spike-and-wave discharges that share all the characteristics of absence seizures. In conclusion, carisbamate is able to induce strong neuroprotection and affect the nature of epileptogenic events occurring during and after lithium-pilocarpine status epilepticus, reflecting marked insult- and disease-modifying effects.
