Xanthurenic acid (XA), an endogenous kynurenine, is a known vesicular glutamate transport (VGLUT) inhibitor and has also been proposed as an mGlu2/3 receptor agonist. Changes in these systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders; however, little is known of how XA affects synaptic transmission. We therefore investigated the effects of XA on synaptic transmission at two hippocampal glutamatergic pathways and evaluated the ability of XA to bind to mGlu2/3 receptors. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from either the dentate gyrus (DG) or CA1 region of mouse hippocampal slices in vitro. Addition of XA to the bathing medium (1-10 mM) resulted in a dose-related reduction of fEPSP amplitudes (up to 52% reduction) in both hippocampal regions. In the DG, the VGLUT inhibitors Congo Red and Rose Bengal, and the mGlu2/3 agonist LY354740, also reduced fEPSPs (up to 80% reduction). The mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495 reversed the LY354740 effect, but not the XA effect. LY354740, but not XA, also reduced DG paired-pulse depression. XA had no effect on specific binding of 1 nM [(3)H]LY341495 to membranes with human mGlu2 receptors. We conclude that XA can modulate synaptic transmission via a mechanism that may involve VGLUT inhibition rather than activation of mGlu2/3 receptors. This could be important in the pathophysiology of nervous system disorders including schizophrenia and might represent a target for developing novel pharmacological therapies.
