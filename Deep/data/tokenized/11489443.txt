Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter has been proposed to play an important role in the regulation of intracellular Cl(-) concentration in neurons during development. In this study, the expression pattern of the cotransporter in different regions of rat brain was examined at birth (P0), postnatal days 7 (P7), P14, P21, and adult by Western blotting analysis. In cortex, thalamus, cerebellum and striatum, the cotransporter expression level was low at P0 and significantly increased at P14 (P<0.05). The expression peaked at P21 and was maintained at the same level in adulthood. However, in hippocampus, a peak level of the cotransporter expression was detected in adult brain. The immunocytochemistry study of adult rat brain revealed that an intense staining of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter protein was observed in dendritic processes of CA1-CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In contrast, abundant immuno-reactive signals of the cotransporter were found in somata of thalamic nucleus. Immunofluorescence double staining demonstrates that the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter was expressed in astrocytes within cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus and cerebellum. In addition, co-localization of the cotransporter and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or with aquaporin 4, was found in perivascular astrocytes of cortical cortex and white matter. The results indicate that a time-dependent expression of the Na(+)-K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter protein occurs not only in cortex but also in hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum. In addition, the cotransporter is expressed in astrocytes and perivascular astrocytes of adult rat brain.
