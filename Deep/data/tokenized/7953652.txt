The present study utilized in vitro gerbil and rat hippocampal slices to compare responses to experimental ischemia without species differences in the cerebrovasculature as a variable. Ischemic depolarization occurred faster in the gerbil (2.53 +/- 0.05 min) than in the rat (4.59 +/- 1.1 min). These results indicate that the gerbil's greater propensity to neuronal damage following short ischemic periods may be due to greater sensitivity of the gerbil brain itself.
