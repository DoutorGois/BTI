We compared the effects of electrical stimulation of primary dissociated neuronal cultures cultured on microelectrode arrays in terms on the expression of c-fos transcriptional factor that is involved in plastic reorganization in neurons. Dissociated hippocampal neurons cultured on multielectrode arrays were exposed to two stimulation protocols: high-frequency and low-frequency stimulations. Expression of c-fos was evaluated using immunofluorescence. Both high-frequency and low-frequency stimulations significantly increased c-fos expression in comparison with non-stimulated control. These findings indicate that c-fos expression can be induced in neuronal cell culture by different types of electrical stimulations and can be used for studying plasticity processes in microphysiological in vitro systems.
