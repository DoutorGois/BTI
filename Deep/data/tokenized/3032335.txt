This work examines the effects of olfactory bulbectomy on Na+, K+-ATPase activity and ouabain binding in the olfactory tubercle. The activity and number of enzyme sites were reduced significantly in olfactory tubercle, but not in corpus striatum or hippocampus, 14 and 21 days after bulbectomy. Enzyme activity and ouabain binding returned to normal by 42 days after the lesions. The time of the reduction in Na+, K+-ATPase coincides with that observed earlier for dopaminergic sprouting and increased dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase activity.
