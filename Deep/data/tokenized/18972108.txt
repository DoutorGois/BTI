Rats use place (allocentric) or stimulus-response (egocentric) learning strategies for foraging under ethological and/or experimental conditions, proposed to be conveyed by hippocampus or neostriatum, respectively. We investigated here the effect of a reversible blockade of neostriatum on learning strategies assessed by a cross maze paradigm, comparing A x C (phenotypically similar to wild rats) versus Long-Evans rat strains. The rats were trained to reach a consistently baited-arm (west arm), starting from the same arm (south arm). The learning strategy was evaluated at days 11 and 19, when test trials were performed placing the rat in a start-box at the arm (north arm) opposite to that when starting the training, following a saline or lidocaine injection into the neostriatum. Rats entering to the baited-west arm were considered to be place learners and those entering to the unbaited-east arm were response learners. It was found that Long-Evans rats injected with saline were place learners on day 11 and response learners on day 19, but were place learners on both days when injected with lidocaine. A x C rats injected with saline were response learners on days 11 and 19, and place learners on both days when injected with lidocaine. Thus, rat strain influences the memory strategy for solving a cross maze paradigm. Long-Evans, but not A x C rats, shift from place (allocentric) to response (egocentric) learning along the training. When neostriatum was blocked by lidocaine, both rat strains elicited a place learning strategy only.
