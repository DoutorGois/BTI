Progressive neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be a consequence of the neurotoxic properties of amyloid-beta peptides (A beta). T-817MA (1-{3-[2-(1-benzothiophen-5-yl) ethoxy] propyl}-3-azetidinol maleate) was screened as a candidate therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD based on its neuroprotective potency against A beta-induced neurotoxicity and its effect of enhancing axonal regeneration in the sciatic nerve axotomy model. The neuroprotective effect of T-817MA against A beta(1-42) or oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity was assessed using a coculture of rat cortical neurons with glia. T-817MA (0.1 and 1 microM) was strongly protective against A beta(1-42)-induced (10 microM for 48 h) or H2O2-induced (100 microM for 24 h) neuronal death. T-817MA suppressed the decrease of GSH levels induced by H2O2 exposure (30 microM for 4 h) in cortical neuron culture; therefore, T-817MA was likely to alleviate oxidative stress. Besides the neuroprotective effect, T-817MA (0.1 and 1 microM) promoted neurite outgrowth in hippocampal slice cultures and reaggregation culture of rat cortical neurons. T-817MA also increased the growth-associated protein 43 content in the reaggregation culture of cortical neurons. These findings suggest that T-817MA exerts neuroprotective effect and promotes neurite outgrowth in rat primary cultured neurons. Based on these neurotrophic features, T-817MA may have a potential for disease modification and be useful for patients with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.
