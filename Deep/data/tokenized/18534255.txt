Vitamin D (VD), is a steroid hormone with multiple functions in the central nervous system (CNS), producing numerous physiological effects mediated by its receptor (VDR). Clinical and experimental studies have shown a link between VD dysfunction and epilepsy. Along these lines, the purpose of our work was to analyze the relative expression of VDR mRNA in the hippocampal formation of rats during the three periods of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: (1) control group; rats that received saline 0.9%, i.p. and were killed 7 days after its administration (CTRL, n=8), (2) SE group; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 4h after SE (SE, n=8), (3) Silent group--7 days; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 7 days after SE (SIL 7d, n=8), (4) Silent group--14 days; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 14 days after SE (SIL 14d, n=8), (5) Chronic group; rats that received pilocarpine and were killed 60 days after the first spontaneous seizure, (chronic, n=8). The relative expression of VDR mRNA was determined by real-time PCR. Our results showed an increase of the relative expression of VDR mRNA in the SIL 7 days, SIL 14 days and Chronic groups, respectively (0.060+/-0.024; 0.052+/-0.035; 0.085+/-0.055) when compared with the CTRL and SE groups (0.019+/-0.017; 0.019+/-0.025). These data suggest the VDR as a possible candidate participating in the epileptogenesis process of the pilocarpine model of epilepsy.
