The serotonin content increased in adrenals within 20 min after immunization of rats with sheep red blood cells, and diminished in ventral part of the anterior hypothalamus, hippocampus and in thymus. The number of antigen--responsive cells was increased twofold in bone marrow after the 1000-fold increase of the antigen dose. On the 4-5th days, the dependence of antibody-forming cells and rosette-forming cells number on the antigen dose was still observed in the spleen. The correlation between the serotonin level in the above brain structures and immunocompetent organs and the intensity of immune responses is discussed.
