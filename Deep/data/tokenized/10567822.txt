We report 3 cases presenting ictal vomiting during partial seizures of temporal lobe origin. Two patients had complex partial seizures accompanying vomiting characteristics. Ictal vomiting occurred early in the course of the seizure when rhythmic discharges involved predominantly the left hemisphere, the language dominance hemisphere. The other patient had ictal vomiting in simple partial seizures which originated from the right temporal lobe or the language nondominant side. All 3 patients underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with promising outcomes. Pathologic diagnosis included hippocampal sclerosis in 2 patients and astrocytoma in 1 patient. In our patients, ictal vomiting does not lateralize temporal lobe epilepsy and is not specific to pathology.
