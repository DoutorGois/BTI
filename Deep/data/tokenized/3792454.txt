Systemic injections of arginine vasopressin (AVP, 0.08 pressor units/kg i.p.) to mature rats (10-13 months) trained on a positively reinforced timing task prevented the age-related discrepancies in the content of temporal memory and the increases in sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake (SDHCU) in the frontal cortex observed in control rats when the rats became aged (27-30 months). AVP administration had no effect on muscarinic receptor density as measured by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding or on choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) levels in either the hippocampus or the frontal cortex.
