Extracellular matrix proteins are induced by activity in adult brain but the time course of these responses, and hence the possibility of their involvement in use-dependent synaptic plasticity, is not known. To evaluate this issue, the influence of seizures on fibronectin expression was evaluated in the adult and developing hippocampus. In adult rats, kainic acid-induced seizures increased fibronectin mRNA and immunoreactivity (ir) by about 1 h after the first behavioral seizure. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that fibronectin mRNA was increased in broadly distributed glial cells as well as within discrete neuronal populations that normally express this transcript. Western blots demonstrated that increased fibronectin-ir was evident in both soluble and non-soluble fractions at the same time point. Immunocytochemical colocalization confirmed that fibronectin-ir was indeed elevated in broadly distributed glial fibrillary acidic protein-ir astroglia. Seizures had no detectable effect on fibronectin-ir in the hippocampus of nine day old rats. Together with previous results, the above findings suggest that intense physiological activity triggers a 'matrix response' (i.e., release proteases, activate integrins, secrete matrix proteins) that is sufficiently rapid to participate in the consolidation of long-term potentiation (LTP). The absence of such reactions in the immature hippocampus is in accord with the hypothesis that matrix proteins generated by mature astroglia impose temporal and spatial limitations on axonal remodeling.
