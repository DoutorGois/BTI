A nerve growth factor (NGF) precursor form of about 24 kDa was identified in homogenates of rat thyroid and hippocampus by immunoprecipitation using three sera raised against a synthetic peptide that reproduces the sequence -71 to -46 of the proNGF molecule. Besides this species, a 31 kDa protein, as well as a cleavage product of 12 kDa were also immunoprecipitated in both tissues by one of these sera.
