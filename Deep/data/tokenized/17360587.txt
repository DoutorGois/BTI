A key feature of memory processes is to link different input signals by association and to preserve this coupling at the level of synaptic connections. Late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity thought to encode long-term memory, requires gene transcription and protein synthesis. In this study, we report that a recently cloned coactivator of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), called transducer of regulated CREB activity 1 (TORC1), contributes to this process by sensing the coincidence of calcium and cAMP signals in neurons and by converting it into a transcriptional response that leads to the synthesis of factors required for enhanced synaptic transmission. We provide evidence that TORC1 is involved in L-LTP maintenance at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in the hippocampus.
