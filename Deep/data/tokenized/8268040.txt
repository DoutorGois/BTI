The implantation of electrodes for intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recording as presurgical evaluation of patients with intractable epilepsy is at present most important for planning epilepsy surgery. This method is most effective in temporal lobe epilepsy. We carried out intracranial EEG by means of insulated micro guide wire for endovascular surgery in two temporal lobe epilepsy cases, and spike discharges could be detected in lesional medial temporal lobe. Case 1 is a 29 year-old-male suffered from intractable complex partial seizure (CPS) for 18 years. He was diagnosed as left temporal lobe epilepsy and performed removal of amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. Case 2 is a 16 year-old-lady suffered from drug resistant CPS for 4 years. Under the diagnosis of right temporal lobe epilepsy, temporal lobectomy was performed. As the presurgical evaluation, under the implantation of subdural strip electrode in both cases, we carried intra-arterial EEG after angiography. Seeker Lite-10 guide wire was insulated with Tracker-10 unibody infusion catheter at sphenoidal portion of middle cerebral artery, and frequent interictal spike discharge was detected in lesional medial temporal lobes by two methods simultaneously.
