The complex circuitry of the CA3 region and the abundance of collateral connections has made it difficult to study the mossy fiber pathway in hippocampal slices and therefore to establish the site of expression of long-term potentiation at these synapses. Using a novel cell culture system, we have produced long-term potentiation of the elementary synaptic connections on single CA3 pyramidal neurons following tetanic stimulation of individual dentate gyrus granule cells. As is the case for the hippocampal slice, this potentiation was independent of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation, was simulated by application of forskolin, and its induction did not require any modulatory input. The increase in synaptic strength was accompanied by a reduction in the number of failures of transmission and by an increase in the coefficient of variation of the responses and was prevented by presynaptic injection of an inhibitor of protein kinase A. These findings show that mossy fiber long-term potentiation has a presynaptic locus and that its expression is dependent on protein kinase A.
