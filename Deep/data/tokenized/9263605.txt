Nerve growth factor (NGF) and other neurotrophins are proteins involved in neuronal survival and differentiation. Much experimental evidence is now drawing attention into a role of neurotrophins in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity processes. We now show that slices from rats chronically deprived of NGF, by intraventricular injection of alpha D11 hybridoma cells, which produce monoclonal antibodies against NGF, display a reduced probability of induction of long-term depression at the mossy fibre-CA3 synapse.
