PURPOSE: To determine the effect of repeated intermittent apnea and resuscitation with 100% vs. 21% oxygen enriched gas on levels of key regulatory proteins contributing to cell death (Bax, Caspase-3) or protecting neurons from hypoxic/ischemic injury (Bcl-2, p-Akt, p-CREB). METHODS: The anaesthetized, mechanically ventilated newborn piglets underwent 10 episodes of apnea with resuscitation either with 100% or with 21% oxygen. Following 6h recovery the animals were sacrificed painlessly, the brain dissected out and used to determine levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3, p-Akt and p-CREB in the striatum, frontal cortex, midbrain and hippocampus were studied. RESULTS: In hippocampus and striatum, Bcl-2 expression was higher with 100% vs. 21% group (173+/-29% vs. 121+/-31%, p<0.05 and 189+/-10% vs. 117+/-47%, p<0.01, respectively) whereas the Bax expression was lower (88+/-3% vs. 100+/-9%, p<0.05 and 117+/-5% vs. 133+/-10%, p<0.05, respectively). Expression of Caspase-3 in the striatum, was lower with 100% vs. 21% group (197+/-35% vs. 263+/-33%, p<0.05, respectively) but not different in the hippocampus. p-Akt expression was higher with 100% vs. 21% oxygen in the hippocampus and striatum (225+/-44% vs. 108+/-35%, p<0.01 and 215+/-12% vs. 164+/-16%, p<0.01, respectively). The p-CREB expression was higher with 100% vs. 21% oxygen resuscitation in the hippocampus (217+/-41% vs. 132+/-30%, p<0.01) with no changes in striatum. Much smaller or insignificant differences between 100% vs. 21% oxygen groups were observed in the frontal cortex and midbrain, respectively. CONCLUSION: In neonatal piglet model of intermittent apnea, selectively vulnerable regions of brain (striatum and hippocampus) are better protected from apoptotic injury when resuscitation was conducted with 100%, rather than 21%, oxygen.
