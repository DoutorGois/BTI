The rat model of multi-infarct was adopted in this study to elucidate the protective mechanism of Sailuotong capsule (Sailuotong) in recovery period of multiple cerebral infarction. The effects of Sailuotong on levels of Glu, GABA and the expression of NMDA receptor subtypes including NR1, NR2A and NR2B, were detected. The multi-infarct model rats were established by injecting embolizing microsphere via internal carotid artery, and were given Sailuotong treatment (16.5 and 33.0 mg x kg(-1)) for 60 days. The pathological changes in brain ultrastructure were observed by transmission electron microscope. The levels of Glu and GABA in brain tissue were measured with high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of NMDA receptors including NR1, NR2A and NR2B in neurons was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Compared with the sham rats, abnormal changes were observed in ultrastructures of neurons, neuroglia cells and synapses of model rat brains. Moreover, significant decrease of Glu and GABA, as well as the elevated expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B were detected in brain tissues. Sailuotong (16.5 and 33.0 mg x kg(-1)) could improve ultrastructure of cerebral tissue, facilitate synthesis of Glu and GABA, and down-regulate expression of NR1, NR2A and NR2B in neurons. The results demonstrated that Sailuotong could exert neuroprotective effects to some extent in the recovery phase of multiple cerebral infarction by promoting expression of NMDA receptors and synthesis of Glu and GABA.
