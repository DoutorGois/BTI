Addition of histamine (0.1 mM) to guinea-pig hippocampal slices causes a 20- to 30-fold increase in the accumulation of cyclic AMP compared with basal levels. This accumulation represents a balance between cyclic AMP production by adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP breakdown mediated by phosphodiesterase (PDE). However, brain tissues are known to contain several different PDE isozymes. To determine which are involved in this response to histamine, the effect of isozyme-specific PDE inhibitors on cyclic AMP accumulation was examined in the hippocampus. MB 22948 (0.1 mM), an inhibitor of PDEs I and II, had no significant effect on the response to either 1 microM or 0.1 mM histamine. SKF 94120 (0.1 mM), a PDE III inhibitor, was also without effect in the presence of 1 microM histamine, although with 0.1 mM histamine, it caused a weak (1.25-fold compared with control), but statistically significant, enhancement of cyclic AMP accumulation. However, both rolipram (0.1 mM), a PDE IV inhibitor, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1 or 1 mM), an inhibitor of all forms of PDE, significantly increased cyclic AMP accumulation (2.8- to 6.5-fold compared with controls), and the relative size of this effect decreased with increasing histamine concentration. It is concluded that PDE IV is the main PDE isozyme involved in cyclic AMP turnover in guinea-pig hippocampal slices responding to histamine.
