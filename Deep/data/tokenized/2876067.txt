Male Fischer-344 rats were given a single intrastriatal injection of kainic acid (KA; 1 microgram/rat), which caused recurrent motor seizures lasting 3-6 hr. During the convulsive period, native Met5-enkephalin-like (ME-LI) and dynorphin A (1-8)-like (DYN-LI) immunoreactivities in hippocampus decreased by 31 and 63%, respectively. By 24 hr after dosing, the hippocampal opioid peptides had returned to control levels, and by 48 hr ME-LI had increased 270% and DYN-LI 150%. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that ME-LI and Leu5-enkephalin-like (LE-LI) immunostaining in the mossy fibers of dentate granule cells and the perforant-temporoammonic pathway had decreased visibly by 6 hr and had increased markedly by 48 hr following KA. A visible decrease in DYN-LI in mossy fiber axons within 6 hr was followed by a substantial increase by 48 hr. To determine whether the increases in hippocampal ME-LI reflected changes in ME biosynthesis, levels of mRNA coding for preproenkephalin (mRNAenk) and cryptic ME-LI cleaved by enzyme digestion from preproenkephalin were measured. Following the convulsive period (6 hr), mRNAenk was 400% of control, and by 24 hr, cryptic ME-LI was 300% of control. Increases in native and cryptic ME-LI and in mRNAenk were also noted in entorhinal cortex, but not in hypothalamus or uninjected striatum. Our data suggest that KA-induced seizures cause an increase in ME release, followed by a compensatory increase in ME biosynthesis in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.
