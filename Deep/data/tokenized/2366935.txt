The influence of the stimulation of the CA3 field of the dorsal hippocampus on the course of a motor polarization dominant produced by the action of a constant current on the sensorimotor area of the rabbit cortex was investigated. It was demonstrated that stimulation of the hippocampus by a 1 mA current (0.5 msec; 100 Hz; 0.2 sec) against the background of the optimum of the dominant elicits its [the dominant's] inhibition, which is manifested in the suppression of the motor "dominant" reaction of the forelimb in response to test stimuli, and in the abolition of the coherent associations of the theta-range electrical activity of the sensorimotor cortex and the CA3 field of the dorsal hippocampus. On the other hand, stimulation of the hippocampus with a weak current (30-50 microA; 0.5 msec; 30 Hz; 0.2 sec) at the optimum of the dominant reinforces it [the dominant], eliciting a movement of the "dominant" extremity, and against the background of an unstable dominant promotes it activation and stabilization and restores the dominant in the following days during its extinction.
