Administration of cortisol on the 13th, 15th, and 17th days of postnatal ontogenesis was shown to exert a long-lasting modifying effect upon the hypophysis-adrenal system's (HAS) stress reactivity in the rat litter. The effect involved a longer duration of hormonal response to immobilisation stress: a longer-lasting elevation of the corticosterone level in the blood plasma suggesting a diminished sensitivity of the HAS to feed-back signal. In hippocampus, frontal cortex and hypothalamus of the experimental rats, a decrease in receptor binding of labeled corticosterone was revealed.
