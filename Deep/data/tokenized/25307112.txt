In this study, we investigated the effects of a normal diet (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD) on delayed neuronal death in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region after transient cerebral ischemia. In the HFD-fed gerbils, ischemia-induced hyperactivity was significantly increased and neuronal damage was represented more severely compared to the ND-fed gerbils. Ischemia-induced glial activation was accelerated in the HFD-fed gerbils. Cytokines including interleukin-2 and -4 were more sensitive in the hippocampal CA1 region of the HFD-fed gerbils after ischemia-reperfusion. Additionally, we found that decreased 4-HNE and SODs immunoreactivity and protein levels in the hippocampal CA1 region of the HFD-fed gerbils after ischemia-reperfusion. These results indicate that HFD may lead to the exacerbated effects on ischemia-induced neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region after ischemia-reperfusion. These effects of HFD may be associated with more accelerated activations of glial cells and imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and/or antioxidants after transient cerebral ischemia.
