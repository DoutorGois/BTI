1. Psychotropic drugs ameliorate psychotic symptoms only after repeated administration. 2. To assess the neurochemical effects of chronic haloperidol and lithium administration, microdialysis was performed simultaneously in the prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the striatum after haloperidol, and separately in the lateral hypothalamus and the hippocampus after lithium. 3. Chronic administration of haloperidol decreased dopamine turnover in the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. It did not affect the nucleus accumbens detectably. 4. No tolerance to haloperidol developed in any of the three regions. 5. Lithium enhanced the response of the serotonergic system to amphetamine in the lateral hypothalamus but not in the hippocampus. 6. The antipsychotic effect of haloperidol might be related to dopamine turnover decrease in the prefrontal cortex. 7. The antidepressant effect of lithium might be related to enhancement of serotonin responsiveness in the hypothalamus.
