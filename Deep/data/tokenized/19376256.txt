While the essential neural circuitry for delay eyeblink conditioning has been largely identified, much of the neural circuitry for trace conditioning has yet to be determined. The major difference between delay and trace conditioning is a time gap between the presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US) during trace conditioning. It is this time gap, which accounts for the additional memory component and may require extra neural structures, including hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. A metabolic marker of energy use, radioactively labeled glucose analog, was used to compare differences in glucose analog uptake between delay, trace, and unpaired experimental groups (rats, Long-Evans), to identify possible new areas of involvement within forebrain and midbrain. Here, we identify increased 2-DG uptake for the delay group compared to the unpaired group in various areas including: the medial geniculate nuclei (MGN), the amygdala, cingulate cortex, auditory cortex, medial dorsal thalamus, and frontal cortices. For the trace group, compared to the unpaired group, there was an increase in 2-DG uptake for the medial orbital frontal cortex and the medial MGN. The trace group also exhibited more increases lateralized to the right hemisphere, opposite to the side of US delivery, in various areas including: CA1, subiculum, presubiculum, perirhinal cortex, ventral and dorsal MGN, and the basolateral and central amygdala. While some of these areas have been identified as important for delay or trace conditioning, some new structures have been identified such as the orbital frontal cortex for both delay and trace groups.
