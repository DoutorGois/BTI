Using a Western blot method it was been shown that a aontent of beta-CaMKII subunit was decreased on 40 % in hippocampus of Krushinskii-Molodkina rats (rats, genetically prone to audiogenic seizures) in comparison with normal Wistar rats. Additionally, we have investigate the temporal modifications of alpha/beta-CaMKII subunits in dependent from number audiogenic fits (n = 1 or n = 5). The level of beta-CaMKII in hippocampus of naive KM rats and KM rats in 24 h after single audiogenic seizure was not different, but it was increased on 56 % through 72 h after convulsion fit. In contrast, both 5-fold seizures and 20-fold seizures (audiogenic kindling) reduced the beta-CaMKII levels in comparison with naive group. The levels of alpha-subunit protein kinase in hippocampus these experimental groups of animals were not different. We suggest a hypothesis, that modifications alpha/beta ratio can be viewed as specific "homeostatic mechanism", which provide for neuronal function in hippocampus, thereby changing the rules governing synaptic plasticity in dependence from preliminary neuronal activity.
