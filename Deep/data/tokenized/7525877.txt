The changes in the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the cytosolic fraction of the rat hippocampus subjected to severe hypoglycemia were analyzed. A marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 43-kDa protein was observed at 30 min of isoelectric EEG and 30 min and 1 h of recovery. Immunostaining of the same blot with antibody against mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase demonstrated a double band of approximately 42 and 43 kDa. The increased tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase during hypoglycemic coma and the early recovery period suggests that MAP kinase may be involved in neuronal degeneration and repair.
