Several studies have suggested that the concentration of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in the central nervous system (CNS) is influenced by the level of CNS activation. Hibernation in the ground squirrel and estivation in the lungfish result in region-specific decreases in TRH concentrations. Repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS) and amygdaloid kindling have been shown to result in elevations of TRH in limbic brain regions. In the present study, limbic seizures induced by systemic administration of kainic acid resulted in substantial increases in the TRH content of posterior cortex and of dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and in moderate elevations in anterior cortex, amygdala/piriform cortex and corpus striatum. Maximal elevations in TRH were observed 2-4 days after kainic acid administration, and by 14 days TRH levels were similar to control values, with the exception of the dorsal hippocampus, which exhibited more prolonged elevations in TRH levels. Prior exposure to limbic seizure activity attenuated the magnitude of TRH elevation in response to a second administration of kainic acid in the posterior cortex but in no other region. These results indicate that seizure-related processes or events influence TRH systems in the CNS. Neuronal populations involved in limbic seizure induced damage may be involved in the modulation of posterior cortical TRH levels.
