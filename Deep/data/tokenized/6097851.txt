The effects of trimethyltin (TMT) on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell activity was studied using an in vitro brain slice preparation. TMT (0.6 micron) reduced the orthodromic population spike and increased the threshold for population spike generation. The excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) were reduced by TMT (0.6-1.1 micron) in a dose dependent manner. The antidromically driven population spike was attenuated by TMT (0.8 micron). These results indicate that TMT alters hippocampal synaptic transmission by depression of the postsynaptic CA1 neuron. An increased perfusion time decreased the TMT dose which produced a depressive effect.
