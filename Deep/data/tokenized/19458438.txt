We investigated a long-term exercise-induced neuroplasticity and spatial memory recovery in 15 rats in a treadmill as follows: normal control rats (NC), streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic control rats (DC), and STZ-induced diabetic rats exercising in a treadmill (DE). As per the DE group, the running exercise in a treadmill was administered for 30 minutes a day for 6 weeks. Neuronal immediate-early gene (IEG) expression (c-Fos) in the hippocampus and radial arm maze (RAM) tests were measured and revealed that the c-Fos levels in DE were significantly higher than those in NC and DC (p < 0.05). Behavioral data analysis indicated that spatial memory performance scores, obtained from the RAM test, were significantly different among the three groups (p < 0.05). The memory scores of NC and DE were higher than those of DC (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that exercising in the treadmill increased neuronal immediate-early gene expression associated with neuroplasticity, thereby improving spatial memory. This is the first experimental evidence in literature that supports the efficacy of exercise-induced neuroplasticity and spatial motor memory in diabetes care.
