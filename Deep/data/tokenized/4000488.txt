Early infantile autism is a behaviorally defined syndrome that is often associated with abnormalities on neurologic examination and seizures. We report on the brain of a 29-year-old autistic man as compared with that of an age- and sex-matched normal control, using gapless sections of whole brain. Abnormalities were found in the hippocampus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex, septal nuclei, mamillary body, selected nuclei of the amygdala, neocerebellar cortex, roof nuclei of the cerebellum, and inferior olivary nucleus.
