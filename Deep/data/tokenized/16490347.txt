Hippocampal reduced glutathione (GSH) levels diminish after status epilepticus (SE), which precedes damage to mitochondrial enzymes, which is associated with cell death. The rat perforant pathway stimulation model was used to assess whether intraperitoneal administration of the GSH precursor N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) protected against these changes. NAC (300 mg/kg) treated animals exhibited the same GSH decrease post SE as vehicle treated. Furthermore, NAC treatment had no protective effects on mitochondrial dysfunction.
