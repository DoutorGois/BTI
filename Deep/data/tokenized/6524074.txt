A single intravenous administration of ethanol (0.5 g/kg) to rabbits had different effects on the excitability of feeding and defensive motivational centers of the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus. Ethanol abolished both inhibitory effects of the dorsal hippocampus and facilitatory action of the midbrain reticular formation on alimentary and defensive motivations. It elicited new power distributions of the main rhythms of general electrical cortical activity in the background and under stimulation of limbic-midbrain structures. Analysis of the activity of organello-specific enzymes in limbic-midbrain neurones revealed disturbances of cellular energetic processes caused by ethanol.
