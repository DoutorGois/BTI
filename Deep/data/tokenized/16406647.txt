We investigated whether succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency alters gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) receptor characteristics due to elevation of GHB levels in the mouse brain. The membrane homogenate binding and quantitative autoradiography using [3H]NCS-382 revealed no significant changes in the affinity (Kd), receptor density (Bmax), or displacement potency (IC50) in various brain regions of Aldh5a1-/- vs. Aldh5a1+/+ mice.
