The Milan hypertensive strain (MHS) of rats, in addition to having hypertension, is also characterized by a genetic deficiency in calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor of calpain. Since this protease has been implicated in long-term potentiation (LTP), we have investigated whether induction of this form of plasticity was altered in this strain of rats as compared to control animals (Milan normotensive strain, MNS). Progressive induction of LTP by increasing numbers of high frequency trains resulted in a greater degree of potentiation measured with all inducing protocols in MHS as compared with MNS animals. This difference was not related to the hypertension, since another hypertensive strain (the SHR strain) and a segregated Milan hypertensive strain, expressing only the hypertension but not the calpastatin deficiency (the MHNE strain), exhibited an LTP indistinguishable from control rats. Treatment of MHNE rats for 2 months with isovalerylcarnitine, a compound that increases calpain activity, also resulted in a greater amount of LTP induced by high frequency trains. These effects were not related to an enhancement of the NMDA receptor dependent component of responses to burst stimulation. These results are consistent with the idea that conditions under which calpain activation is facilitated are associated with a greater degree of synaptic potentiation.
