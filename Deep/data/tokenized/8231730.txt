We used oligonucleotide in situ hybridization and film autoradiography to quantitate the distributions of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha, beta, gamma, and epsilon mRNAs in subregions of rabbit hippocampus. Levels of each of the hippocampal PKC isozyme mRNAs and patterns of their regional distributions were remarkably invariant between individuals. Within stratum pyramidale, the highest levels of PKC alpha mRNA were in the CA2 region, while PKC beta mRNA was maximally expressed in CA1, and PKC epsilon mRNA in CA3; PKC gamma mRNA was abundantly expressed throughout Ammon's horn. Previous experiments employing quantitative autoradiography for [3H]PDBU (Olds et al., Science, 245 (1989) 866-869) revealed an increase in membrane-bound PKC in the CA1 region of rabbit hippocampus up to 3 days following classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response. We report here that there were no differences in levels of PKC alpha, beta, gamma, or epsilon mRNA between conditioned and control rabbits in any hippocampal region one day after training. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that PKC is post-translationally activated and translocated to the membrane during memory storage.
