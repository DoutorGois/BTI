OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) on neurogenesis and learning & memory of manganese poisoning mice. METHODS: Healthy adult Kunming mice were divided into 5 groups, the control group (A), the manganese poisoning (by manganese chloride peritoneal injection) group (B), the manganese poisoning and treated with gastric perfusion of high, medium, low dosage LBP groups (C, D and E). The spatial learning & memory capacity of mouse was determined by Morris water maze training test. The neurogenetic cells were labelled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The average escape latency was significantly higher and the times of passing through platform lower in group B than those in group A (P<0.05). BrdU positive cells in groups C, D and E were significantly more than those in group B (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: LBP could enhance the learning & memory capability of the manganese poisoning mice by promoting neurogenesis in hippocampus.
