The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of sparing contralateral hippocampus during partial brain radiotherapy in high grade gliomas. 20 previously treated patients were replanned to 60 Gy in 30 fractions with sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arctherapy (VMAT) using the following planning objectives: 100 % of PTV covered by 95% isodose without violating organs at risk (OAR) and hot spot dose constraints. For each, standard intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans were generated, as well as sparing IMRT and VMAT plans which spared contralateral (hemispheric cases) hippocampus. When the three plans were compared, there was equivalent PTV coverage, homogeneity, and conformality. Sparing IMRT significantly reduced maximum, mean, V20, V30 and V40 hippocampus doses compared with standart IMRT and VMAT (p < 0.05). VMAT significantly reduced maximum left lens and mean eye doses compared with standart IMRT and sparing IMRT (p < 0.05). Brainstem, chiasm, left and right optic nerves, right eyes and lens doses were similar. VMAT significantly reduced monitor units compared with standart IMRT and sparing IMRT (p < 0.05). It is possible to spare contralateral hippocampus during PBRT for high grade gliomas using IMRT. This approach may reduce late cognitive sequelae of cranial radiotherapy.
