Kainate receptors are ionotropic receptors, also reported to couple to G(i)/G(o) proteins, increasing neuronal excitability through disinhibition of neuronal circuits. We directly tested in hippocampal synaptosomes if kainate receptor-mediated inhibition of GABA release involved a metabotropic action. The kainate analogue, domoate (3 microM), inhibited by 24% [(3)H]GABA-evoked release, an effect reduced by 76% in synaptosomes pre-treated with pertussis toxin. Protein kinase C inhibition attenuated by 82% domoate-induced inhibition of GABA release whereas protein kinase C activation did not change kainate receptor binding. Thus, domoate inhibition of GABA release recruits G(i)/G(o) proteins and a protein kinase C pathway.
