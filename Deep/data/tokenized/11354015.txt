The effect of acetylcholine (ACh) on evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) was studied in cell cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons with established synaptic connections. Spontaneous IPSCs and IPSCs evoked by extracellular stimulation of a single presynaptic neuron were recorded. ACh inhibited the evoked IPSCs in most of the connections, although facilitation was also observed. Regardless of inhibitory or facilitatory effects on the evoked IPSCs, an enhanced spontaneous synaptic input to the postsynaptic neurons was usually observed. ACh-induced changes in the evoked IPSCs were usually accompanied by changes in paired pulse depression (PPD), which are thought to reflect presynaptic mechanisms of modulation. However, the time course of PPD changes did not always match that of the IPSC changes, suggesting a contribution of other, possibly postsynaptic, mechanism(s). To analyze this possibility, effects of ACh on responses to direct application of exogenous GABA were studied. In a proportion of the neurons (40%) ACh reversibly decreased GABA responses, indicating that postsynaptic mechanisms may also contribute to the inhibitory ACh effect on GABAergic transmission. We conclude that several different modulatory mechanisms of ACh action participate in the regulation of GABAergic transmission at the level of synaptic connection of a single GABAergic neuron.
