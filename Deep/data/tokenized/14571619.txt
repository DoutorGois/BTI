OBJECTIVE: To establish an experimental animal model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with clinical and pathological specificity conformed to AD in human, and to observe the effect of Zhinao Capsule (ZNC) on learning, memory and patho-morphological parameters in the model. METHODS: The experimental AD model of rats was improved and established by combined injection of beta-amyloid protein (beta-AP) to lateral ventricle and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) to brain. The learning and memory function of the model rats were tested by step-through test and water-maze test, and the number and cross area of beta-AP deposited macula in cerebral cortex and CA1 region of hippocampus were estimated quantitatively using immunohistochemical method and image pattern analysis. RESULTS: The improved AD animal model showed both the specificity of behavior (learning and memory impairments) and the typical pathological specificity (beta-AP deposited macula). ZNC could effectively improve the impairment of learning and memory and reduce the number and cross area of beta-AP deposited macula in cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA1 region in the AD model rats. CONCLUSION: The AD rat model induced by the combined injection of beta-AP and TGF beta 1 is a good animal model simulated to the clinical reality, which could be used to screen and evaluate the anti-dementia agents. ZNC could display anti-dementia effect of the AD model rats.
