Transient topographical amnesia (TTA) is the temporary inability to find one's way in familiar or unfamiliar surroundings due to the inability to use well known environmental landmarks for route finding. The syndrome has not been described as having any obvious aetiology and has been thought to be caused by a vascular deficit in right hemispheric structures which are crucial for topographic recognition, i.e. parietal association and parahippocampal cortex. The patient described in the present study complained of several critical episodes of TTA and tonic rigidity of the left limbs. Neuropsychological assessment was normal except for a deficit in spatial memory tasks. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain showed an angioma at the border of areas 24d and 23 of the right cingulate cortex. Because area 23 is strategically located in a network that links the parietal associative (area 7a) and parahippocampal cortices, and because these cortical areas are involved in topographical orienting processes, we suggest that a transient functional inactivation of the network caused by epileptic discharges spreading from the damaged cingulate cortex towards the parahippocampal and parietal association cortex could account for the spatial disorder. Similar discharges spreading from area 24d towards the primary motor cortex and/or the spinal cord could account for the episodes of tonic rigidity of the left limbs.
