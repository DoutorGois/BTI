Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism has previously been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related cognitive impairment. We aimed to determine the relationship between BDNF Val66Met and beta-amyloid (Abeta) on cognitive decline, hippocampal atrophy, and Abeta accumulation over 36 months in 165 healthy adults enrolled in the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study. In healthy adults with high Abeta, Met carriers showed significant and moderate-to-large declines in episodic memory, executive function, and language, and greater hippocampal atrophy over 36 months, compared with Val/Val homozygotes. BDNF Val66Met was not found to be related to rates of change in cognition or hippocampal volume in healthy adults with low Abeta. BDNF Val66Met did not relate to the amount of Abeta or to the rate of Abeta accumulation in either group. High Abeta levels coupled with Met carriage may be useful prognostic markers of accelerated cognitive decline and hippocampal degeneration in individuals in the preclinical stage of AD.
