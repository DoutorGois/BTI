Aging is an important risk factor for stroke. We evaluated the effects of aging on cell susceptibility to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in slices of the hippocampus from Wistar rats aged 2, 11 and 24 months. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released to the incubation media and free radical content were markedly increased in the 24-month group submitted to OGD. These results confirm that hippocampal tissue from old animals is more susceptible to ischemia-reoxygenation injury.
