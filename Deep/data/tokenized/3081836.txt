The effects of a recently synthesized analogue, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue, DN-1417, on evoked responses and long-term potentiation (LTP) of the perforant path input to the dentate gyrus were examined in normal rats and after hypophysectomy. Eighty micrograms of DN-1417 injected i.c.v. reduced granule cell excitability with a small increase in the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and reduced LTP of the EPSP. However, DN-1417 slightly increased the potentiation of the population spike. Similar results were obtained in a rat 7 days post-hypophysectomy. It is concluded that the effects of DN-1417 on LTP are similar to those of TRH and may be unrelated to its endocrine actions.
