The modulatory effect of endogenous diadenosine polyphosphates on synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampal slices has been re-examined with a non-hydrolysable Ap4A analogue diadenosine-5',5'>>-P1,P4-[beta,gamma-methylene]tetraphosphate (AppCH2ppA). We have shown that AppCH2ppA at low micromolar concentrations induce inhibition of orthodromically evoked population spikes, without affecting of excitatory postsynaptic currents and antidromic spikes recorded in the CA1 zone of hippocampus. Such a spatially selective neuronal inhibition may influence dendritic electrogenesis in pyramidal neurons and consequently mediate control of neuronal network activity in hippocampus.
