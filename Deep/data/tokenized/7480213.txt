To study the possible mechanism through which honokiol and magnolol elicit their central depressant effects, we examined the influence of these two phenolic compounds on 25 mM K(+)-stimulated release of [3H]acetylcholine (ACh) from the rat's hippocampal slices. Honokiol, but not magnolol, elicited a concentration-dependent enhancement of K+-evoked ACh release. Addition of either tetrodotoxin, pilocarpine, or methoctramine had no effect on honokiol-enhanced ACh release. These results suggest that honokiol enhanced K(+)-evoked ACh release directly on hippocampal cholinergic terminals via receptors other than the M2 cholinergic subtypes.
