Swelling-induced release of taurine was investigated in vivo in hippocampus by microdialysis or in vitro in cultured neocortical neurons or astrocytes. Swelling was induced either by increasing the extracellular K+ concentration or by exposing the cells to hyposmotic conditions. It was found that the drug phenylsuccinate, which inhibits the mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier as well as biosynthesis of neurotransmitter glutamate, inhibits swelling-induced taurine release both in vivo and in cultured cells. Thus, phenylsuccinate may be used to investigate the mechanism involved in taurine release associated with regulatory volume decrease in cells.
