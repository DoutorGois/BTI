Intracerebroventricular injections of angiotensin II caused 108, 62, and 54% increases in monoamine oxidase A activities in rat hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striatum, respectively. These activatory effects were abolished by simultaneous injections of eledoisin. No significant changes of monoamine oxidase B activities were found under the same experimental conditions. Neither angiotensin II nor elodoisin changed substrate/inhibitor affinities of both isoenzymes. These data indicate that angiotensin II and tachykinin transmitter systems may exert opposite, long-term regulatory effects on monoaminergic neurons in rat brain.
