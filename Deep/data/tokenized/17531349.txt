Stroke is devastating as currently no therapies are available that can prevent stroke-induced neurological dysfunction in humans. With the recent observations that acute insults to adult brain stimulate new neuronal formation in various species of animals, optimism is building for a possible regeneration of stroke-damaged brain. This article reviewed the advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the various steps of neurogenesis with an emphasis on the endogenous mediators and exogenous promoters of neural progenitor proliferation, migration and survival in the post-ischemic adult brain.
