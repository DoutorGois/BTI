Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical, is widely present in the environment. It has been reported that perinatal exposure to low doses of BPA that are less than the tolerable daily intake level (50mug/kg/day) affects anxiety-like behavior and dopamine levels in the brain. Although the dopaminergic system in the brain is considered to be related to anxiety, no study has reported the effects of low-dose BPA exposure on the dopaminergic system in the brain and on anxiety-like behavior using the same methods of BPA exposure. To investigate the relationship between alterations in anxiety-like behavior and changes in the dopaminergic system in the brain induced by BPA, we examined the effects of BPA on anxiety-like behavior using an open field test in juvenile and adult mice and measured DA and DOPAC levels and the DOPAC/DA ratio in the dorsal hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMY), and medulla oblongata (MED) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in adult mice. In males, BPA decreased the time spent in the center area of the open field in both juveniles and adults. In addition, BPA increased DA levels in the dorsal HIP and MED and decreased the DOPAC/DA ratio in the dorsal HIP, AMY, and MED in adults. The activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B, the enzyme that metabolizes DA into DOPAC, was reduced in the MED. In females, those changes were not observed. These results suggest that an increase in anxiety-like behavior induced by perinatal exposure to BPA may be related to decreases in DA metabolites in the brain, and there are sex differences in those BPA effects.
