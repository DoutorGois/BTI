Superfusion of hippocampal slices with 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) antagonized kainate-induced bursts and bursts of unknown origin in the CA3 region. CNQX also increased the latency of and eventually blocked evoked bursts which persist following kainate washout. In contrast, D-(-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid did not alter burst latency or block bursts unless applied subsequent to CNQX. We conclude that the quisqualate type receptor has a prominent role in burst generation with a smaller contribution from N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.
