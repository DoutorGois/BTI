Adenosine, an endogenous neuroprotective agent, can be produced in the synaptic cleft from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis via the concerted action of two enzymes: ATP diphosphohydrolase and 5'-nucleotidase. The aim of the present study was to investigate such enzymatic activities in the hippocampus of rats subjected to single (2- or 10-minute) or double (2+10 minute, with a 24-hour interval in between, named preconditioned group) ischemic episodes. Ischemia was produced by four-vessel occlusion method. Histological analysis showed no cell death in 2-minute ischemia, and up to 90% of pyramidal CA(1) cell loss in the 10-minute ischemic group. As predicted, double ischemic rats displayed a significant cytoprotective effect (around 60%). Preconditioned rats presented a delayed enhancement in ATP diphosphohydrolase activity (for ATP and adenosine diphosphate hydrolysis) after 48 hours of reperfusion. 5'-nucleotidase activity was increased immediately after ischemic insult (for all groups) and after a late reperfusion period (48 hours). We suggest that preconditioning causes delayed changes in enzymatic activities that would conceivably lead to increased adenosine production. This effect could be related to cytoprotection seen in preconditioned rats.
