Choline supplementation during gestation in rats leads to augmentation of spatial memory in adulthood. We hypothesized that prenatal (E12-E17) choline supplementation in the rat would lead to an enhancement of hippocampal synaptic plasticity as assessed by long-term potentiation (LTP) at 3-4 mo of age. LTP was assessed blindly in area CA1 of hippocampal slices with first suprathreshold (above threshold for LTP generation in control slices) theta-burst stimulus trains. The magnitude of potentiation after these stimuli was not different between slices from control and prenatally choline supplemented animals. Next, threshold (reliably leading to LTP generation in control slices) or subthreshold theta-burst stimulus trains were applied to slices from control, prenatally choline-supplemented, and prenatally choline-deprived rats. Threshold level stimulus trains induced LTP in slices from both the control and choline-supplemented rats but not in those from the choline-deficient rats. Subthreshold stimulus trains led to LTP induction in slices from prenatally choline-supplemented rats only. These observations indicate that prenatal dietary manipulation of the amino acid, choline, leads to subsequent significant alterations of LTP induction threshold in adult animals.
