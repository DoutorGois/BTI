Cell surface proteoglycans (PGs) have been implicated in neuronal growth, migration and differentiation and can play pivotal roles both in cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions during the development of the nervous system. We have previously shown that glutamate activation of excitatory amino acid receptors induces the synthesis and release of PGs with neurite-promoting activity from hippocampal neurones. In this study, we have investigated the activity-dependent regulation of mRNA expression of two PGs in fetal hippocampal neurones using a competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and correlated this expression with neuronal growth. Both cerebroglycan (CBG), a glycosylphatidylinositol-anchored heparan sulphate PG, and neurocan, a developmentally regulated chondroitin sulphate PG, are expressed in hippocampal neurones. Exposure of hippocampal neurones to 100 microM glutamate for 5 min resulted in an increase in CBG mRNA levels and an increase in axonal and dendritic length. The increase in CBG mRNA levels following glutamate exposure was mediated via both N-methyl-D-aspartate and metabotropic receptor activation.
