A mutation in the gene Girk2 that encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel is the genetic defect causing the behavioral and pathologic abnormalities of the weaver mutant mouse. Of the pathologic abnormalities, the best studied is the neuronal degeneration that occurs in the cerebellar cortex and in the midbrain dopaminergic neurons. A detailed characterization of the topographic and temporal expression of Girk2 is fundamental to elucidate the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in these mutant mice. In this study we utilized in situ hybridization to determine the expression of Girk2 mRNA during prenatal and postnatal development in the murine central nervous system (CNS). Girk2 expression was seen in multiple regions of embryonic CNS including the cerebellum and midbrain. During postnatal development, the highest expression was seen in the cerebellum, midbrain and hippocampus. However, since the developing cerebellum undergoes significant neuronal loss due to the degeneration of granule cell precursors, Girk2 mRNA expression in this area decreases progressively.
