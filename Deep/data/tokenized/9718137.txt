The neuronal cell damage caused by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in brain has been reported to be associated, at least in part, with many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. We recently observed vacuolation and astrocytosis in the brains of ME7 scrapie strain-infected C57BL mice. To investigate if these phenomena might have a relationship to iNOS, the level of iNOS expression was measured immunohistochemically and molecular biologically in the brains of scrapie-infected C57BL mice. The number and size of astrocytes were increased and immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was significantly enhanced. iNOS immunoreactivity was observed in the astrocytes of the scrapie-infected group, but not in the control group. iNOS mRNA levels were increased in scrapie-infected mice compared to the levels in non-infected mice of the same age. Our results suggest that iNOS induction in reactive astrocytes is a part of the neurodegenerative mechanisms in scrapie infection.
