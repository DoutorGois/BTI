The central nervous system is generated from neural stem cells during embryonic development. These cells are multipotent and generate neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The last few years it has been found that there are populations of stem cells also in the adult mammalian brain and spinal cord. In this paper, we review the recent development in the field of embryonic and adult neural stem cells.
