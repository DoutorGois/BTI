P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) has been reported participating in neuroinflammation in multiple neurological diseases. We explored the role of P2X7R in a rat status epilepticus (SE) model induced by coriaria lactone (CL) and its association with neuroinflammation. Thirty minutes after intracerebroventricular infusion with P2X7R antagonists Brilliant blue G (BBG), A-438079, A-740003, or agonists 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP), SE was induced by intramuscular injection of CL in Sprague-Dawley rats. Seizures severity was recorded according to the Racine scale and Morris water maze test was performed. P2X7R expression was measured by western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to assess pro-inflammation cytokines expression, neuronal loss, and astrocyte activation. The results showed P2X7R level began to increase at 1 day, peaked at 2 days, and gradually decreased to baseline by 2 weeks in rat hippocampus after SE. P2X7R activation induced NF-kappaB phosphorylation, along with increased IL-1beta and IL-6 expression. Pretreatment with P2X7R antagonists ameliorated SE-induced neuroinflammation, neuronal damage, and astroglial and microglial activation to variable extent. In addition, these antagonists ameliorated seizure severity and improved cognitive function. These findings suggest P2X7R activation plays a critical role in epileptogenesis via regulation of neuroinflammation and blocking P2X7R may be a novel therapeutic strategy for epilepsy.
