The aim of the present study was to elucidate the distribution of glutathione immunoreactivity in the normal hippocampus and after kainate-induced neuronal injury. A specific antibody was used that recognizes both the reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms of glutathione. Immunoreactivity to glutathione was observed in neurons, but few immunolabeled glial cells were observed in the normal hippocampus. After kainate injection, a decrease in glutathione immunoreactivity was observed in pyramidal neurons from as early as 1 day after injection. In contrast, dense staining to glutathione was observed in large numbers of reactive astrocytes at 3 days to 6 weeks after kainate injection. This suggests upregulation of glutathione synthesis in these cells. One possibility is that the high content of glutathione is protective to reactive astrocytes. Another possibility is that the high glutathione concentration in reactive astrocytes may be protective to neurons around the glial scar.
