A comparative analysis of the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the expressions of Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) and Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBC) was investigated in order to extend our understanding of the mechanism of GABA receptor-mediated acid-base balance using a gerbil model. In vigabatrin (VGB, GABA degradation inhibitor) treated gerbils, both NHE1 and NBC immunoreactivities in the hippocampus were significantly elevated, as compared with the controls. Analogous to VGB treatment, baclofen (GABAB receptor agonist) treatment also evoked elevations of both NHE1 and NBC expressions in the hippocampus, whilst their expressions were unaffected by muscimol (GABAA receptor agonist) treatment. Therefore, our findings suggest that GABAB receptor-mediated regulation of NHE1 and NBC expressions may participate in acid-base balance in the gerbil hippocampus.
