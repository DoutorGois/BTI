D-galactose, a reducing sugar, induces oxidative stress resulting in alteration in mitochondrial dynamics and apoptosis of neurons. Curcumin and hesperidin are antioxidants possessing multimodal functions; hence, their contribution in minimizing D-galactose induced ageing was assessed in the present study. A week prior to D-galactose treatment (150 mg/kg; s.c. for 56 days), animals were treated with curcumin alone, hesperidin alone and a combination of curcumin (50 and 100 mg/kg; orally) with hesperidin (10 and 25 mg/kg; orally) for 63 days. A naive control was also maintained. Behavioural studies, tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, mitochondrial complexes, protein and lipid oxidation and glutathione levels were assessed in the brain mitochondrial fraction. Western blot analysis of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3 and histological assessment of the CA1 region of the hippocampus were carried out. D-galactose induced significant cognitive deficits, biochemical changes and histological alterations. Individually, curcumin was more effective than hesperidin in reducing the levels of oxidized lipids, proteins, cleaved caspase-3 expression and mitochondrial enzymes. The combination reduced the expression of cleaved caspase-3, malondialdehyde, improved mitochondrial enzymes and glutathione levels. In combination, curcumin and hesperidin protect the morphological facets and improve biochemical functions of neurons thereby improving cognition.
