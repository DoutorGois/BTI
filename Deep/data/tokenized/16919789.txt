Laboratory diagnosis is essential to confirm suspected cases of equine rabies and to determine the medical care needed for human postexposure antirabies prophylaxis. Equine rabies transmitted by the vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, has increased gradually in the State of Sao Paulo. The present study has several objectives, the most important being the evaluation of fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and virus-isolation laboratory tests performed with different equine nervous system tissues (cortical, hippocampus, cerebellar, brainstem and cervical medullar) to determine the tissue for which the two techniques have the highest sensitivity. Analysis by FAT of these five regions of the central nervous system (CNS) from 35 animals showed that there was a greater amount of viral antigen in the brainstem and cervical medullar tissues than in the hippocampus, cortical and cerebellar tissues. While there were no significant differences in the mortality rate of mice inoculated with suspension prepared from the different tissues, a trend towards higher mortality rate was detected with brainstem and cervical medullar tissues. Laboratory diagnosis was not affected by whether the animal had been vaccinated or not, or whether it had died following the natural course of the disease or as a result of euthanasia. Isolation of the rabies virus in equine salivary glands demonstrated the potential risk for humans exposed to infected animals.
