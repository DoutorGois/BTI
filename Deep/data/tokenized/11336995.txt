Previous research has provided convincing evidence that rats can learn to anticipate the individual elements of a stimulus series consisting of differing amounts of food reinforcement. Rats prepared with lesions of the dorsal striatum or hippocampus were initially trained to acquire a three-element series consisting of 21 sucrose pellets, followed by 0- and 7-pellets (Noyes standard), respectively. During the initial 30 days of training, the animals were run in two adjacent runways; the runways included either of a white, rough runway or a black, smooth runway as additional series cues. Thus, training included both floor (S-R) cues and the series (inter-item memory) cues. Anticipation was defined as faster running on the 21- than on the 7-pellet element and 7- than on the 0-pellet element. While anticipation developed more slowly in the lesion groups than in the control group, all animals eventually demonstrated the ability to track the elements of the series. Reversal of the floor cues disrupted tracking in the hippocampus-lesioned and control animals; dorsal striatum-lesioned rats were also affected but did continue tracking. As a final test, shifting the order of the series produced a marked disruption in performance in the dorsal striatum-lesioned rats but not in the hippocampus-lesioned or control rats. The results are consistent with the proposal that integrated neural mediation is required for anticipation, with a system that includes the dorsal striatum necessary for the promotion of a reinforced approach response and a system that includes the hippocampus necessary for associating and temporarily maintaining an internal record of the different elements of the stimulus series.
