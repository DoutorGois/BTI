The elevation of nitric oxide (NO) within the central nervous system (CNS) is known to be associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as HIV-associated dementia (HAD), brain ischemia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. NO is enzymatically formed by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). There are two forms of NOS, the constitutive and the inducible form. The constitutive form is present in endothelial cells (eNOS) and neurons (nNOS). The inducible form (iNOS) is expressed in various cell types including astroglia and microglia of the CNS. Using an animal model, we investigated the involvement of eNOS in the pathology of prion disease. We showed dramatic upregulation of eNOS immunoreactivity in reactive astroglial cells in the hippocampus in the prion disease animal model, scrapie in mice. Expression of eNOS was upregulated in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of whole brain. In the hippocampal region, eNOS was widely overexpressed in various components of the cell. We found that eNOS dramatically accumulated in hippocampal mitochondria and was particularly prevalent in structurally dysfunctional mitochondria. In association with the accumulation of eNOS in mitochondria, we showed that mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD or SOD2), cytochrome c, and ATP activity were downregulated both in whole brain and in the hippocampal region. These results indicate that eNOS plays a role in the development of dysfunctional mitochondria and this, in turn, could induce some of the histopathological changes seen in prion diseases.
