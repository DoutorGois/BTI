Loss of the cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus and failure of central (presumably hippocampal) suppressive control of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity are important features of Alzheimer's dementia. We have examined the effects of electrolytic lesions of the medial septal cholinergic innervation on mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptor mRNA expression in rat hippocampus using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Expression of both MR and GR mRNA was significantly increased in a subregions of the hippocampus, but not neocortex, with the greatest increase in the CA1 area for MR mRNA and dentate gyrus for GR mRNA. Since glucocorticoids potentiate the effects of neurotoxins in the hippocampus, the increased expression of receptors following loss of cholinergic inputs in Alzheimer's disease may increase hippocampal neuronal vulnerability.
