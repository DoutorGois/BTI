The brain is a key target of ethanol teratogenicity, in which ethanol can produce neurodegeneration in selected areas, including the hippocampus and cerebellum. The research objective was to test the hypothesis that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure, via maternal ethanol administration, produces differential time course of decreased linear density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Timed pregnant guinea pigs received chronic oral administration of ethanol, isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding, or water throughout gestation (term, about gestational day (GD) 68), and the offspring were studied at GD 62 (near-term fetus), postnatal day (PD) 1 (neonate), PD 5, and PD 12 (early postnatal life). Ethanol treatment, compared with isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding and water treatments, decreased brain, hippocampal, and cerebellar weights at GD 62, PD 1, PD 5, and PD 12. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell linear density and cerebellar Purkinje cell linear density were unaffected at GD 62. Ethanol treatment produced 25, 30, and 30% decreases in linear density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells at PD 1, PD 5, and PD 12, respectively, and a 30% decrease in linear density of cerebellar Purkinje cells at PD 12 only. At PD 5, Purkinje cell profile linear density remained unaffected; however, ethanol treatment appeared to increase linear density of apoptotic Purkinje cell nuclei, as determined by a modified TUNEL method. The data demonstrate that chronic prenatal ethanol exposure produces apparent differential time course of decreased linear density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells in the developing guinea pig.
