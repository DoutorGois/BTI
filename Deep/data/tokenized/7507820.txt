The effects of single and repeated doses of trimethyltin (TMT) treatment on the central nervous system (CNS) of the marmoset were investigated. For the acute-dose experiment adult animals were administered 3 mg/kg of TMT chloride (ip) and were then observed for changes in behavior. Within 24 hr postinjection all animals developed tremors, ataxia, and unresponsiveness. Half of the animals had severe clinical deterioration and died at 2 to 3 days following treatment. Surviving marmosets were sacrificed and the brain was subsequently perfusion-fixed for light microscopic examination. Neuronal degeneration was observed in many cells of the Ammon's horn and fascia dentata of the hippocampus. For the chronic-dose experiment, adult marmosets received (ip) weekly doses of 0.75 mg/kg of TMT chloride for 24 weeks. No evident clinical signs or behavioral changes were observed in any of the treated animals. Histological examination revealed neuropathological changes comparatively similar but less severe than those observed in the acute-treated animals. The differences in toxicity effects between acute and chronic TMT administration are compared and discussed.
