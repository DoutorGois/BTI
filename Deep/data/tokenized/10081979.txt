The effects of ageing and of chronic antidepressant treatment upon 5-HT transporter sites ([3H]paroxetine binding) in the rat hippocampus was examined. [3H]paroxetine binding to transporter sites was decreased with ageing in the hippocampus of control rats (38% decrease in dentate gyrus and CA4). Amitriptyline (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had no significant effect on [3H]paroxetine binding in 10 months old rats, but increased binding sites in 24 months rats in all hippocampal subregions (greatest increase of 109% in CA1 compared to saline controls). These data indicate an age-related decrease in hippocampal serotonin transporter sites and upregulation of these sites following 10 weeks of amitriptyline. The observed increase in transporter sites following amitriptyline may contribute to the general lower effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants with ageing.
