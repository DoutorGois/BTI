Following high frequency stimulation of the perforant path the density of axospinous synapses from the middle third of the molecular layer of the rat dentate gyrus did not change significantly. By contrast, within this synaptic population the density of axospinous synapses containing synaptic spinules increased markedly. We interpret these results in terms of a structural modification related to enhanced synaptic efficacy.
