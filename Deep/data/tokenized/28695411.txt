Curcumin is a naturally occurring phenolic yellow chemical isolated from the rhizomes of the plant Curcuma longa (turmeric), and is a major component of the spice turmeric. Curcumin has protective effects against rotenone-induced neural damage in Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims at providing new evidence for the validity of the rotenone rat model of PD by examining whether neuronal activity in the hippocampus is altered. Male albino rats were treated with rotenone injections (2.5 mg/ml intraperitoneally) for 21 days. We examined the effects of curcumin (200 mg/kg) on behavior and electrophysiology in a rat model of PD induced by rotenone. Motor activity was assessed by cylinder test. The electrical activity of neurons was measured in hippocampus. Rotenone causes significant reduction of neuronal activity. The results show that curcumin can improve the motor impairments and electrophysiological parameters and may be beneficial in the treatment of PD.
