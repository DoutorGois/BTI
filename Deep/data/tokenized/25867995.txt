It is well known that estradiol (E2) replacement therapy is effective on restoring memory deficits and mood disorders that may occur during natural menopause or after surgical ovarian removal (ovariectomy, OVX). However, it is still unknown the effectiveness of acute and localized E2 administration on the effects of chronic OVX. Here we tested the hypothesis that the intra-hippocampal E2 infusion, as well as specific agonists of estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta), are able to mend novel object recognition (NOR) memory deficit and depressive-like behavior caused by 12 weeks of OVX. We found that both ERalpha and ERbeta activation, at earlier stages of consolidation, recovered the NOR memory deficit caused by 12 w of OVX. Conversely, only the ERbeta activation was effective in decreasing the depressive-like behavior caused by 12 w of OVX. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of OVX on hippocampal volume and ERs expression. The structural MRI showed no alteration in the hippocampus volume of 12 w OVX animals. Interestingly, ERalpha expression in the hippocampus decreased after one week of OVX, but increased in 12 w OVX animals. Overall, we may conclude that the chronic estrogen deprivation, induced by 12 weeks of OVX, modulates the hippocampal ERalpha expression and induces NOR memory deficit and depressive-like behaviors. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that the acute effects of E2 on NOR memory and depressive-like behavior are still apparent even after 12 weeks of OVX.
