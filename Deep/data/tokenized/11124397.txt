The objective of the study was to investigate the influence of restraint stress on the effects of 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP7), an NMDA receptor antagonist, injected into the hippocampus of rats submitted to the elevated plus maze (EPM). Male Wistar rats with cannulas aimed to the dorsal hippocampus were forced immobilized for 2 h. Twenty four hours later they received bilateral injections of saline or AP7 (10 nmol/0.5 microl), and were tested in the EPM. In another experiment the animals received the treatment immediately before or after the restraint period, and were tested in the EPM 24 h later. AP7 had no effect in any anxiety measure in non-stressed rats. In stressed animals the drug increased the percentage of open arm entries when injected before the test in the EPM. When administered immediately after the restraint period, AP7 increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms and tended to do the same with the percentage of entries in these same arms. The results suggest that interference with hippocampal NMDA receptors modify the anxiogenic effect of restraint stress in an EPM.
