Predicting seizurogenic properties of pharmacologically active compounds is difficult due to the complex nature of the mechanisms involved and because of the low sensitivity and high variability associated with current behavioral-based methods. To identify early neuronal signaling events predictive of seizure, we exposed transgenic NF-kappaB/EGFP reporter mice to multiple low doses of kainic acid (KA), postulating that activation of the stress-responsive NF-kappaB pathway could be a sensitive indicator of seizurogenic potential. The sub-threshold dose level proximal to the induction of seizure was determined as 2.5mg/kg KA, using video EEG monitoring. Subsequent analysis of reporter expression demonstrated significant increases in NF-kappaB activation in the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus 24h after a single dose of 2.5mg/kg KA. This response was primarily observed in pyramidal neurons with little non-neuronal expression. Neuronal NF-kappaB/EGFP expression was observed in the absence of glial activation, indicating a lack of neurodegeneration-induced neuroinflammation. Protein expression of the immediate-early gene, Nurr1, increased in neurons in parallel to NF-kappaB activation, supporting that the sub-threshold doses of KA employed directly caused neuronal stress. Lastly, KA also stimulated NF-kappaB activation in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures established from NF-kappaB/EGFP reporter mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate the potential advantages of using genetically encoded stress pathway reporter models in the screening of seizurogenic properties of new pharamacologically active compounds.
