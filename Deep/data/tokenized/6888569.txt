The effects of phencyclidine (PCP) on synaptic transmission were studied in the hippocampal slice. Population spikes evoked by orthodromic or antidromic stimulation were recorded from CAl pyramidal cells. Bath applied PCP (10(-4) M) reduced moderately both the orthodromic and antidromic population spikes. Lower concentrations, 5 X 10(-6) to 5 X 10(-5) M of PCP, which did not depress the population spikes, reduced inhibition of the orthodromically evoked spike in a dose dependent reversible manner. Diazepam (10(-6) to 10(-5) M) restored the inhibition despite the continued presence of PCP. It is suggested that PCP-induced seizures and other signs of hyperexcitability could be a result of reduced inhibition.
