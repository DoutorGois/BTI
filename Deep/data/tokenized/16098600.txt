The aim of this work is to define neurotoxins doses to have efficient and specific depletion of noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission in cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus of Swiss mice after intraperitoneal administration of, respectively, N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride (DSP-4) and para-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (PCPA). The neurotransmitters concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography with amperometric detection. The minimal single dose necessary to produce a highly significant decrease of NA levels (p<0.01 in comparison with control group) in hypothalamus (-44%), hippocampus (-91%), striatum (-40%) and cortex (-68%) was 50mg/kg but DA and 5-HT levels were modified, respectively, in hypothalamus and striatum. Three doses of PCPA 300 mg/kg over 3 consecutive days involve a profound depletion of 5-HT transmission in all discrete brain areas but NA and DA levels were also significantly reduced. In conclusion, DSP-4 has a different efficacy in discrete brain areas with a noradrenergic specificity which is not absolute, PCPA has a similar efficacy in all brain areas but is unspecific of 5-HT transmission.
