Morphological and electrophysiological evidence has been accumulated in recent years to indicate that a functional gradient exists along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus such that spatial memory is associated primarily with the dorsal (septal) sector while the functions of the ventral sector are not yet clearly defined. Also, the ventral hippocampus (VH) is reported to express a much smaller long term potentiation of responses to afferent stimulation than the dorsal sector. In the present study, we first confirmed that CA1 region of VH slices expresses significantly smaller LTP than the dorsal hippocampus. Strikingly, much larger LTP was obtained in VH slices following low frequency priming stimulation applied prior to the tetanic stimulation. DHPG ((S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine hydrate) a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, produced a similar potentiating effect on LTP as that produced by the priming stimulation. In both cases, the spectral analysis of spontaneous electrical activity recorded from the same location in the slice revealed an increase in peak amplitude around 30 Hz. MCPG, a metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, and both thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, inhibitors of Ca(2+) release from stores, blocked the potentiating action of both DHPG and the priming stimulation. These results indicate that the ventral hippocampus possesses different network properties compared to the dorsal hippocampus and that its ability to undergo plastic changes is controlled by a metabotropic glutamate receptor.
