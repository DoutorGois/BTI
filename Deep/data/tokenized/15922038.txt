Independent component analysis (ICA) is proposed for analysis of neural population activity from multichannel electrophysiological field potential measurements. The proposed analysis method provides information on spatial extents of active neural populations, locations of the populations with respect to each other, population evolution, including merging and splitting of populations in time, and on time lag differences between the populations. In some cases, results of the proposed analysis may also be interpreted as independent information flows carried by neurons and neural populations. In this paper, a detailed description of the analysis method is given. The proposed analysis is demonstrated with an illustrative simulation, and with an exemplary analysis of an in vivo multichannel recording from rat hippocampus. The proposed method can be applied in analysis of any recordings of neural networks in which contributions from a number of neural populations or information flows are simultaneously recorded via a number of measurement points, as well in vivo as in vitro.
