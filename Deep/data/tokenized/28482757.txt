While chronic stress induces dendritic atrophy in the hippocampus and impairs learning and memory, supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) is known to improve learning and memory of control rats. Whether n-3 PUFA supplementation improves dendritic morphology, synaptic transmission, and memory of chronically stressed rats remains unknown. In this work, we randomly assigned male Sprague-Dawley rats in four experimental groups: two unsupplemented groups, control and stress, and two supplemented groups with n-3 PUFA (DHA and EPA mix), control + n-3 PUFA and stress + n-3 PUFA. Dendritic morphology and synaptic transmission in the hippocampus were evaluated by Golgi stain and patch-clamp tools, respectively. The Y-maze and Morris water maze were used to analyze the effects of chronic stress on memory. Supplementation with n-3 PUFA improved dendritic architecture and restored the frequency of inhibitory post-synaptic currents of hippocampal pyramidal neurons of rats from stress group. In addition, n-3 PUFA supplementation improved spatial memory. Our results demonstrate that n-3 PUFA supplementation had three beneficial effects on stressed rats: prevented or compensated dendritic atrophy in CA3; restored the probability of GABA release in CA1; and improved spatial memory. We argue that n-3 PUFA supplementation can be used in treating stress-related psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety.
