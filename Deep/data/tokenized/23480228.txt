Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may cause neuropsychiatric problems, such as anxiety disorder, that have negative effects on cognitive functions and behavior. We investigated the effects of progesterone on traumatic brain injury induced anxiety in 7-day-old rat pups subjected to contusion injury. Progesterone treatment decreased TBI induced anxiety and serum corticosterone levels, and increased serum IGF-1 levels. Moreover, progesterone treatment increased amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampal neuron density. We found a negative correlation between serum corticosterone levels and anxiety tests, and a positive correlation between serum IGF-1 levels and anxiety tests. In addition, progesterone treatment decreased serum corticosterone compared to the controls and sham. Our results indicate that single dose progesterone may be effective for treating anxiety caused by TBI.
