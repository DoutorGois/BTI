We used two models of status epilepticus (SE) to study trafficking of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. SE is associated with increased surface expression of NR1 subunits of NMDA receptors, and with an increase of NMDA synaptic and extrasynaptic currents suggesting an increase in number of functional NMDA receptors on dentate granule cells. The therapeutic implications of these results are discussed.
