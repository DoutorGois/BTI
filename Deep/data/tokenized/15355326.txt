As a synaptosomal protein, SNAP-25 plays a role in a number of neuronal functions including axonal growth, dendrite formation, fusion of synaptic vesicles with membrane and the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Using a learning/memory behavior screening, we identified SNAP-25 as one of the differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus upon behavioral training. The inhibition of SNAP-25 with intracerebroventricular antisense oligonucleotide caused a deficit in long- but not short-term memory for step-down inhibitory avoidance. Intra-CA1 infusion of the SNAP-25 antisense oligonucleotide impaired long-term contextual fear memory and spatial memory and interfered with the LTP of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region. The inhibitory effect on LTP was not mediated by a pre-synaptic mechanism because paired pulse facilitation of synaptic transmission was not affected after administration of the antisense oligonucleotide. Together, the results suggest that SNAP-25 in the CA1 region is involved in memory consolidation.
