OBJECTIVE: To search for an appropriate animal model that is more closely related to human to study cAMP-response element binding protein target gene Staufen and to identify its location. METHODS: The phylogenetic tree was constructed with Staufen protein (STAUFEN) sequences of different species, and the most suitable animal model was selected by analyzing relativity among them. The Staufen fragments were amplified with reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into a vector and then the sub-clone was transformed into bacteria, selected, amplified, extracted and sequenced. Staufen probes were in vitro transcribed and hybridized in situ on the cryosections of the mouse brain. The cryosections were stained and observed. RESULTS: The clustering patterns of the phylogenetic tree indicated that the mouse and human Staufen1 had 99.7% protein sequences similarity. The mRNA of Staufen was located in CA1, CA2, CA3 and DG hippocampus regions shown by in situ hybridization. CONCLUSION: The mouse is a preferable animal model for research on Staufen transcription in hippocampus.
