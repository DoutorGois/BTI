A modified HPLC method is described for the determination of amino acids [aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, taurine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)] in brain tissue utilizing precolumn derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA)-tert-butyl-thiol and electrochemical detection. A simple extraction procedure was employed and DL-homoserine used as internal standard. A neurotoxin previously shown to affect brain amino acids (trimethyltin, TMT) and a psychoactive compound hypothesized to act on these neurochemicals (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, THC) were administered to adult male rats and amino acids were measured. Results revealed a gradient of distribution of most amino acids, with lowest levels posteriorly in the brain stem and increasing to the highest values in anterior cortical regions. TMT increased glutamine significantly in all brain regions examined, but increased glycine and decreased taurine only in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. No significant changes in any amino acid were found in hippocampus after THC treatment. The results establish the validity and usefulness of this HPLC method for detecting neurotoxicity-related changes in brain amino acid metabolism.
