OBJECTIVE: To study the oxidative damage of SWCNTs in striaturn and hippocampi of mice. METHODS: Forty male ICR mice were divided into experiment group (12.5 mg/kg SWCNTs) and control group (saline containing 0.1% Tween80) randomly. Each group was subdivided into 1, 7, 14 and 28 days group, 5 mice in each subgroup, then treated with tail intravenous injection for 5 continuous days. The striatum and hippocampus were isolated on the ice bath and homogenized in saline. SOD, GSH-Px, and MDA in the supernatants were measured with xanthine oxidize, GSH consumption in enzymatic reaction and TBA methods. RESULTS: After exposure to 12.5 mg/kg SWCNTs for 5 d, SOD activity in striaturn and hippocampi decreased on 1st day and reached the minimum on 7th day, then increased gradually. The SOD activity in the SWCNTs treatment groups on 7th day were significantly decreased when compared to control (P < 0.05). Comparison with control group, GSH-Px activity in striaturn obviously decreased on 7th day then increased on 14th day, the difference between 7th day and 14th day was significantly (P < 0.05). GHS-Px activity in the hippocampi in SWCNTs group on 7th day and 14th day was significantly lower than that in control group (P < 0.05), then increased to the level of control group on 28th day. MDA contents of striaturn and hippocampi in SWCNTs group reduced on 1st day, then gradually increased on 7th day and 14th day, then reduced, MDA contents on7th day and 14th day n SWCNTs group were significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of present study indicated that SWCNTs could decrease antioxidase activity and increase the Lipid peroxide in striaturn and hippocampi of mice.
