PURPOSE: To explore if hypothermia can reduce the harmful effects of ionizing radiation on the neurogenic regions of the brain in young rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postnatal day 9 rats were randomized into two treatment groups, hypo- and normothermia, or a control group. Treatment groups were placed in chambers submerged in temperature-controlled water baths (30 degrees C and 36 degrees C) for 8 h, after receiving a single fraction of 8 Gy to the left hemisphere. Seven days' post-irradiation, we measured the sizes of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the granule cell layer (GCL) of the hippocampus, and counted the number of proliferating (phospho-histone H3+) cells and microglia (Iba1 + cells). RESULTS: Irradiation caused a 53% reduction in SVZ size in the normothermia group compared to controls, as well as a reduction of proliferating cell numbers by >50%. These effects were abrogated in the hypothermia group. Irradiation reduced the number of microglia in both treatment groups, but resulted in a lower cell density of Iba1 + cells in the SVZs of the hypothermia group. In the GCL, irradiation decreased both GCL size and the proliferating cell numbers, but with no difference between the treatment groups. The number of microglia in the GCL did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothermia immediately after irradiation protects the SVZ and its proliferative cell population but the GCL is not protected, one week post-irradiation.
