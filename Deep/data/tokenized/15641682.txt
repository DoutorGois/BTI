By using Fura-2/AM, the effects of magnesium (Mg2+) on the glutamate-induced increase of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) in the cultured hippocampal neurons and the features were investigated by integrated photoelectric detecting system. The experiments were designed to three groups (The drug was spit to the cells for 20 s): Group A receiving 1 x 10(-5) mol/L glutamate; Group B receiving 1 x 10(-5) mol/L glutamate and 1 x 10(-5) mol/L Mg2+ simultaneously; Group C receiving 1 x 10(-5) mol/L glutamate again after [Ca2+]i in group B back to the baseline. The results showed that in group A, [Ca2+]i was obviously increased. In group B, the changes in [Ca+] i and the peak value were significantly decreased. Moreover, the elevation of Phase 1 was slowed down and Phase 2 was shortened to some extent, and the plateau phase between them was relatively prolonged. In group C, calcium oscillation similar to that in group A occurred, but both the Phase 1 and Phase 2 were shortened and the delta[Ca2+]i was slightly decreased. It was suggested that Mg2+ could quickly inhibit the rise of [Ca2+]i induced by glutamate in the cultured hippocampal neurons in rats.
