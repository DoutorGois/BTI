Neurotrophic effects (NTEs) of various brain regions of 4-week-old rats were examined in primary culture of rat embryonic cerebral hemispheres. Extracts of the hippocampus, brainstem and septal nucleus highly enhanced the survivability of neuronal cells and the division of non-neuronal cells by 9 days. The septohippocampal tract (fimbria fornix) was cut and the effect on the neurotrophic activity in the hippocampus was examined. The NTEs of hippocampal extracts remained unchanged 3 days after septal deafferentation, was significantly increased by 7 days, peaked at 14 days and returned to the basal level by 21 days.
