Chronic lead exposure causes a variety of impairments in learning and memory and cognitive function. Synaptic plasticity in hippocampus is an extensively studied cellular model of learning and memory, which includes long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in two forms. Depotentiation (DP) is another form of synaptic plasticity. Previous studies show that chronic lead exposure can damage the induction of LTP/LTD in hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) areas. In the present study, we investigated the repair and protection on lead-caused synaptic plasticity impairment by galantamine, using field potential recording on chronic lead exposure rats. The results showed that chronic lead exposure impaired LTP/DP induction in DG area of the hippocampus, and galantamine caused a significant increase on the amplitudes of LTP/DP of lead-exposed rats, but only a small increase in non-exposed group. These results suggest that galantamine could reverse the lead-induced impairments of synaptic plasticity in rats and might be an effective medicine to cure the cognitive deficits induced by lead.
