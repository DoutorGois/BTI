Hippocampal atrophy and neuron loss are early and reproducible findings in Alzheimer's disease, and recent magnetic resonance imaging studies indicate that hippocampal atrophy may also be present in Parkinson's disease (PD). To determine whether or not cell loss occurs in PD, we estimated the total neuron and glial cell numbers as well as the total volume unilaterally in the hippocampi of eight demented PD patients and eight control subjects. Cell numbers were estimated in the neuron-containing layers of CA1, CA2-(3), CA4, the dentate gyrus, and subiculum using the optical-fractionator technique. The Cavalieri method was used to estimate the volume of the total hippocampus and its subregions. We did not find significant differences in cell numbers or volumes in PD brains when compared with control subjects. Our results thus indicate that hippocampal atrophy and cell loss are not necessarily involved in the memory impairment and dementia observed in PD.
