Alteration of creatine kinase BB-isoenzyme (CK-BB) was investigated in the vulnerable CA1 region of the hippocampus of ischemic and postischemic gerbil brains using immunoelectron microscopy. CK-BB existed in the neuronal perikarya, dendrites and axons as well as in astroglias in the normal gerbil brain. Immunocytochemical reaction products were associated with microtubules and polyribosomes. Propagation of ischemic and postischemic damage with disintegration of microtubules was observed in the dendro-somatic direction in neurons, which progressed in parallel with dispersion and loss of the immunocytochemical reaction for CK-BB in the dendroplasm. After reperfusion for longer than 24 h, CK-BB was also observed in the extracellular space. The present result supported the notion that loss of the immunohistochemical reaction for CK-BB which has been observed by light microscopy after cerebral ischemia, was at least partly due to dispersion of this enzyme caused by disintegration of microtubules and extracellular leakage of this enzyme, although other processes, including degradation of CK-BB per se, were also possible. The loss of CK-BB from the neuronal structure may delay the recovery from ischemic damage and may eventually lead to neuronal death.
