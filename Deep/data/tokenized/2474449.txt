Using intracellular recordings from slice preparations, we studied the effects of the peptide galanin on the properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons from rat ventral hippocampus. Galanin, applied in the superfusing medium, had a weak and inconsistent effect on the membrane potential or on the afterhyperpolarization which follows a train of spikes. Galanin, which is localized in some cholinergic neurons of the septo-hippocampal pathway, did not affect the action of acetylcholine or carbachol on CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, it did have a presynaptic inhibitory effect on the cholinergic terminals, blocking the slow cholinergic excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) induced by the release of endogenous acetylcholine on the pyramidal neurons. This effect was reversible and mimicked by atropine. These results suggest that the peptide galanin, colocalized with acetylcholine in some septo-hippocampal neurons might play a role in the control of acetylcholine release.
