Changes in the water solubility of proteins in the brain tissue of Wistar rats were investigated: (i) during aging (in 3-32 month animals) and (ii) 24 h after killing 3 month animals. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry. In both cases we observed a considerable difference in the protein solubility, i.e., that the ratio of water-soluble to water-insoluble proteins changed. A change of protein solubility was largest in the brain regions especially sensitive to the oxygen supply (hippocampus, striatum, hypothalamus and cortex) and is statistically significant already in 14 month animals.
