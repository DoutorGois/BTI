In CT images the atrophy of medial parts of temporal lobes was evaluated in 60 patients with Alzheimer-type dementia. In the genotype of 30 patients at least one APOE epsilon 4 allele was identified, the other 30 patients served as the control group. The results of in vivo measurements of temporal lobe atrophy in the examined patients did not show statistically significant relations with APOE genotype which was probably due to entirely different nature and application of both tests.
