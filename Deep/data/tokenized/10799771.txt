The possibility that brain aging in rats exhibits regional variations of the type found in humans was studied using lysosomal chemistry as a marker. Age-related (two vs 12months; male Sprague-Dawley) differences in cathepsin D immunostaining were pronounced in the superficial layers of entorhinal cortex and in hippocampal field CA1, but not in neocortex and field CA3. Three changes were recorded: an increase in the intraneuronal area occupied by labeled lysosomes; clumping of immunopositive material within neurons; more intense cytoplasmic staining. Western blot analyses indicated that the increases involved the active forms of cathepsin D rather than their proenzyme. Shrinkage of cathepsin-D-positive neuronal cell bodies was observed in entorhinal cortex but not in neocortical sampling zones. Age-related lysosomal changes as seen with cathepsin B immunocytochemistry were considerably more subtle than those obtained with cathepsin D antibodies. In contrast, a set of glial and/or vascular elements located in a distal dendritic field of the middle-aged hippocampus was much more immunoreactive for cathepsin B than cathepsin D. The areas exhibiting sizeable changes in the present study are reported to be particularly vulnerable to aging in humans. The results thus suggest that aspects of brain aging common to mammals help shape neurosenescence patterns in humans.
