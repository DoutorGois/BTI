Pluronic F-68, an 80% hydrophilic member of the Pluronic family of polyethylene-polypropylene-polyethylene tri-block copolymers, protects non-neuronal cells from traumatic injuries and rescues hippocampal neurons from excitotoxic and oxidative insults. F-68 interacts directly with lipid membranes and restores membrane function after direct membrane damage. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of Pluronic F-68 in rescuing rat hippocampal neurons from apoptosis after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD progressively decreased neuronal survival over 48 h in a severity-dependent manner, the majority of cell death occurring after 12 h after OGD. Administration of F-68 for 48 h after OGD rescued neurons from death in a dose-dependent manner. At its optimal concentration (30 mum), F-68 rescued all neurons that would have died after the first hour after OGD. This level of rescue persisted when F-68 administration was delayed 12 h after OGD. F-68 did not alter electrophysiological parameters controlling excitability, NMDA receptor-activated currents, or NMDA-induced increases in cytosolic calcium concentrations. However, F-68 treatment prevented phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and BAX translocation to mitochondria, indicating that F-68 alters apoptotic mechanisms early in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The profound neuronal rescue provided by F-68 after OGD and the high level of efficacy with delayed administration indicate that Pluronic copolymers may provide a novel, membrane-targeted approach to rescuing neurons after brain ischemia. The ability of membrane-active agents to block apoptosis suggests that membranes or their lipid components play prominent roles in injury-induced apoptosis.
