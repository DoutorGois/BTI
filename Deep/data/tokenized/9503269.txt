Novel antagonists of the glycineB site of the NMDA receptor (MRZ 2/570, MRZ 2/576), and an AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX were tested in 3-min global ischaemia in gerbils. Untreated animals showed after 14 days a loss of almost 90% of pyramidal neurones in the CA1 region, which was prevented by NBQX, and reduced to 50% by both glycineB antagonists. NBQX produced a delayed, long lasting (up to 24 hr) hypothermia while hypothermia with both glycineB antagonists was transient.
