In this study we investigated the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and c-fos mRNA in the hippocampal formation after febrile seizures (FSs) with in situ hybridization histochemistry using riboprobes. The induction of BDNF mRNA was firstly observed in the dentate gyrus at 30 min after FSs. The expression in the dentate gyrus peaked at 3 h and returned to basal level at 24 h. It was also observed in the CA3 of hippocampus from 2 to 3 h. The induction of c-fos mRNA was observed in the dentate gyrus at 30 min and 1 h. These observations suggest that BDNF and c-fos are the genes whose expression can be altered by FSs and might be related to pathologic alterations after FSs.
