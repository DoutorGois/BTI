The distribution of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in monkey brain was examined by immunoperoxidase immunohistochemistry. An antiserum to ACTH that recognized the C-terminal portion of the molecule was used. Immunoreactive ACTH was visualized as an intraneuronal constituent with a widespread distribution throughout the brain. Reactive cell bodies were seen only in the region of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Dense axonal networks were seen in the hypothalamus, mesencephalic gray, and in the region around the anterior commissure. No staining was seen in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, or striatum. ACTH or fragments of ACTH may function as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in primate brain.
