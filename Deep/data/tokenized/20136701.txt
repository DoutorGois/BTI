Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by accumulation of extracellular deposits of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in brain regions that are important for memory and cognition. The buildup of Abeta aggregates in the AD is followed by the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and activation of neuroinflammatory reactions. The present study investigated whether melatonin possesses a neuroprotective effect against Abeta-induced toxicity. For this purpose, organotypic hippocampal slices were cultured and exposed to 25 microm of Abeta(25-35) in the absence or in the presence of melatonin (25, 50, or 100 microm). In addition, the authors have investigated the involvement of GSK-3beta, tau protein, astroglial, and microglial activation, and cytokine levels in the melatonin protection against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. Melatonin prevented the cell damage in hippocampus induced by the exposure to Abeta(25-35). In addition, melatonin significantly reduced the activation of GSK-3beta, the phosphorylation of tau protein, the glial activation and the Abeta-induced increase of TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. On the basis of these findings, we speculate that melatonin may provide an effective therapeutic strategy for AD, by attenuating Abeta-induced phosphorylation of tau protein, and preventing GSK-3beta activation and neuroinflammation.
