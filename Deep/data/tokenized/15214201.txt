Ganstigmine (CHF2819) is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine in rat hippocampus and ameliorates scopolamine-induced amnesia. In this article, we examined whether and how ganstigmine might prevent or rescue the neurodegenerative phenotype in AD11 antinerve growth factor (anti-NGF) mice, a transgenic model for Alzheimer's disease. The effects of ganstigmine were compared with those obtained after administration of donepezil. Results demonstrate that intraperitoneal and oral administration of ganstigmine and donepezil can reverse the cholinergic and behavioral deficit in AD11 mice but not the amyloid and phosphotau accumulation, uncovering different mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in AD11 mice.
