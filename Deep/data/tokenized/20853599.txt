Nitric oxide (NO), a potential candidate for a modulator of convulsive activity, is a mediator in several pathological events in the central nervous system. The polyamines, spermidine (Spd) and spermine, are neuromodulators influencing the metabolism of L-arginine and NO production. Here we examined the effects of Spd on NO production and arginase activity during convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). Male Wistar rats were allocated into four experimental groups of 8 animals each and received the following treatments: I (control)--saline, intraperitoneally (i.p.); II (PTZ)--seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (100mg/kg bw i.p); III (Spd)--Spd (1 mg/kg bw i.p.) 50 min before PTZ application; IV (Mid)--antiepileptic Midazolam (100 mg/kg bw) 45 min before PTZ. In brain cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem homogenates, nitrite + nitrate levels and arginase activity were determined. Spermidine showed proepileptic effects. shortening seizure latency and inducing a more profound increase of NO production than PTZ in all brain structures. PTZ reduced arginase activity, whereas Spd pretreatment increased enzyme activity, with the most profound effects in cerebellum and brainstem. The results point out the importance of polyamine and arginine metabolism in the brain during seizures, suggesting a regulatory role for polyamines and arginase in NO production.
