Generally accepted features of alcoholic fetopathy are delayed maturation and retarded dendritic development of neocortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. The present study investigates the effects of a membrane stabilizing agent (CDP-choline) on Purkinje cells of chronically alcohol intoxicated newborn rat pups, employing a Golgi impregnation technique. Both quantitative and qualitative data indicate that CDP-choline modifies the alcohol induced lesion.
