Under chronic experiment of 15 rabbits the hippocampal electrogram character has been studied under electrical, cholinergic, monoaminergic stimulation of the hypothalamus before and after unilateral electrocoagulation of stria terminalis. The synchronizing hypothalamic influence caused by the given stimuli on hippocampal theta-rhythm has been shown to be completely and irreversibly blocked up by the stria terminalis lesion. A leading role of the amygdala-hypothalamic interrelations in hippocampal theta activity formation is suggested.
