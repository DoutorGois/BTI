Isovaline is a non-proteinogenic amino acid that has analgesic properties. R-isovaline is a proposed agonist of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptor in the thalamus and peripheral tissue. Interestingly, the responses to R-isovaline differ from those of the canonical GABA(B) receptor agonist R-baclofen, warranting further investigation. Using whole cell recording techniques we explored isovaline actions on GABA(B) receptors coupled to rectifying K+ channels in cells of recombinant and native receptor preparations. In AtT-20 cells transfected with GABA(B) receptor subunits, bath application of the GABA(B) receptor agonists, GABA (1 muM) and R-baclofen (5 muM) produced inwardly rectifying currents that reversed approximately at the calculated reversal potential for K+ R- isovaline (50 muM to 1 mM) and S-isovaline (500 muM) did not evoke a current. R-isovaline applied either extracellularly (250 muM) or intracellularly (10 muM) did not alter responses to GABA at 1 muM. Co-administration of R-isovaline (250 muM) with a low concentration (10 nM) of GABA did not result in a response. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons that natively express GABA(B) receptors, R-baclofen (5 muM) induced GABA(B) receptor-dependent inward currents. Under the same conditions R-isovaline (1 or 50 muM) did not evoke a current or significantly alter R-baclofen-induced effects. Therefore, R-isovaline does not interact with recombinant or native GABA(B) receptors to open K+ channels in these preparations.
