Insulin, as a peptide hormone, has recently gained attention for its pro-cognitive, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system (CNS). Most studies have indicated anxiogenic and neuroinflammatory effects of methamphetamine (MA) and other psychostimulants, even after periods of abstinence. The present study aimed to examine whether intranasal (IN) insulin treatment with high CNS bioavailability and minimal systemic side effects, can reverse the anxiety-like behavior and neuroinflammation induced by repeated MA administration. In male wistar rats, escalating doses of MA (1-10mg/kg, i.p.) were administrated twice a day for 10 consecutive days. IN insulin treatment (0.5IU/day, for 7days after MA discontinuation) attenuated MA-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze task, and significantly decreased the levels of glial cell markers (GFAP and Iba1), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) as well as COX2 and NF-kappaB players of neuroinflammation, in the hippocampus of MA-treated animals. These findings introduce insulin as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of MA aversive symptoms.
