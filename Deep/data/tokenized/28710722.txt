The present study investigated the possible effect of BMMS in protecting against memory impairment in an Alzheimer's disease model induced by scopolamine in mice. Another objective was to evaluate the involvement of oxidative stress and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice. Male Swiss mice were divided into four groups: groups I and III received canola oil (10 ml/kg, intragastrically (i.g.)), while groups II and IV received BMMS (10 mg/kg, i.g.). Thirty minutes after treatments, groups III and IV received scopolamine (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)), while groups I and II received saline (5 ml/kg, i.p.). Behavioral tests were performed thirty minutes after scopolamine or saline injection. Cerebral cortex and hippocampus were removed to determine the thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) levels, non-protein thiols (NPSH) content, catalase (CAT) and Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activities. The results showed that BMMS pretreatment protected against the reduction in alternation and latency time induced by scopolamine in the Y-maze test and step-down inhibitory avoidance, respectively. In the Barnes maze, the latency to find the escape box and the number of holes visited were attenuated by BMMS. Locomotor and exploratory activities were similar in all groups. BMMS pretreatment protected against the increase in the TBARS levels, NPSH content and CAT activity, as well as the inhibition on the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity caused by scopolamine in the cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, no significant difference was observed. In conclusion, the present study revealed that BMMS protected against the impairment of retrieval of short-term and long-term memories caused by scopolamine in mice. Moreover, antioxidant effect and protection on the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase activity are involved in the effect of compound against memory impairment in AD model induced by scopolamine.
