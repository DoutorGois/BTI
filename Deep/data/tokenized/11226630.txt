The expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 8 (mGluR8) was studied in the rat hippocampus after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (APISE) by light immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. At 1 day APISE, mGluR8 immunoreactivity was up-regulated in the entire molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. At 7 days APISE, mGluR8 immunoreactive cells began to appear in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA1, and by day 31, they were seen in all layers of CA1. By electron microscopy and double labelling study, the mGluR8 immunoreactive cells were identified as astrocytes. The present novel finding of induced expression of mGluR8 in astrocytes APISE suggests that it may be linked to gliosis.
