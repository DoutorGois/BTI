Caloric restriction (CR) can attenuate the aging-related decline in learning and memory in rats. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this effect could lead to therapies for human memory impairment. We tested the hypotheses that aging is associated with a decline in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor that enhances learning and memory, and that CR increases hippocampal BDNF. We compared BDNF protein levels in hippocampal subregions of young, middle-aged and old rats fed CR or ad libitum (AL) diets. Mean BDNF levels in the dentate gyrus and CA3 did not differ with diet but increased with age. In CA1, BDNF levels were slightly higher in CR than AL rats at middle and old age but did not change across lifespan. These data suggest that mnemonic impairments with age do not reflect a decrease in hippocampal BDNF. Furthermore, if CRs attenuation of aging-related memory changes is mediated by BDNF, then it must be through a small, CA1-specific increase and does not involve reversal of an aging-related decline in BDNF.
