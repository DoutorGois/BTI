The effect of adrenal gland hormones on brain NGF-producing cells and on NGF target cells was studied in young adult rats. The results showed that adrenalectomy causes a decrease in the NGF level in the hippocampus and of choline acetyltransferase in the septum. These studies suggest that adrenal gland hormones are involved in the regulation of NGF in specific brain structures.
