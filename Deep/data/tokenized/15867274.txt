Although specialized cortical pathways that process specific sensory stimuli and/or execute cognitive functions have been identified, the neuro-specificity for food-related stimuli has not been clearly demonstrated. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare neural systems associated with the appreciation of foods and nonfoods. Healthy, normal weight, right-handed men and women (n = 12; age 29.8 +/- 1.8 y, BMI 21.8 +/- 0.8 kg/m(2)) were imaged by fMRI while fasting. Real food and nonfood items were presented to subjects both visually and tactilely, during scanning. Subjects were instructed to pay attention to the items. A randomized 2 x 2 block design consisted of 4 conditions: visual food, visual nonfood, tactile food, and tactile nonfood. Brain regions that were significantly activated to a greater extent during the presentation of foods compared with nonfood items included the anterior cingulate, superior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and the insula. These findings support the claim that the presence of food (either seen or felt) elicits a unique cortical response that is differentiated from nonfood items. This neural substrate specialized for processing of foods informs models of food-related behavior.
