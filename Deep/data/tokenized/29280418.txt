OBJECTIVES: Consumption of high-fat and high-sugar diets in Western countries has increased significantly causing major global health problems including metabolic syndrome and obesity. In addition, studies have suggested that obesity can lead to learning and memory deficits. In this context, the use of natural compounds with low costs, minor side effects and increased antioxidant activity, such as teas, could reduce the damages induced by obesity. We investigated the effect of white, green, red, and black teas (Camellia sinensis) and their possible neuroprotective mechanisms in an experimental obesity model induced by a cafeteria diet (CD). METHODS: Female Swiss mice (20-30 g) were used; they received a normal diet or a hypercaloric diet (CD) during 8 weeks. Concomitantly, some mice received orally white, green, red, or black teas (1% dose) or water. RESULTS: The mice subjected to CD showed weight gain, body fat accumulation, increased glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides, associated to recognition memory deficits and increased reactive species (RS) levels and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the hippocampus. All teas significantly reduced AChE activity and partially reduced fat accumulation. Green and red teas reduced memory deficit. White, green, and black teas reduced RS levels, while only green and black tea reduced plasma triglyceride levels. DISCUSSION: According to the results obtained it is possible to conclude that green tea was better than other teas in reducing effects of the CD model, being able to protect a greater number of parameters.
