This study reports the effects of low level developmental Pb exposure on specific brain regions like hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres of antioxidant enzyme activities. Wistar dams were exposed to 50 ppm, 100 ppm and 500 ppm of Pb acetate in drinking water during pregnancy and lactation (gestation day 6 through PND 21 (post natal day) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GR) were determined in the hippocampus, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres of pups during treatment period (PND 7, 14, and 21 days) and also during withdrawl period (PND 35, 45, 60 and 90 days). During treatment period, SOD activity significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in all regions of all the treated groups with maximum decrease in 500 ppm treated group of 21 days, while GSH-Px and GR activities increased with maximum increase in 21 days aged 500 ppm group. During withdrawl period, the activities of all enzymes were significantly (p < 0.05) reversed. Thus the perinatal exposure of dams to variable dosages of low level lead results in characteristic neurochemical alterations in rat brain regions due to impaired antioxidants function.
