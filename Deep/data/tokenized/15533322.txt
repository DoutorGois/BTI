Adult green mice marrow stromal cells were co-cultured with hippocampal slices. Differentiation to neuron-like or non-neuron-like cells occurred exclusively inside slice boundaries starting at day 3, and then decreased gradually over 35 days. Neuron-like cells tended to form network-like connections around day 14. The use of retinoic acid greatly increased the number of differentiated cells, and the most effective concentration was 10(-6) M. NeuN immunohistochemistry was positive in 9.6+/-1.7% of morphologically differentiated neuron-like cells. Both GFAP and Iba1 immunostaining were negative. We concluded that bone marrow stromal cells can be differentiated into neurons, and direct contact with the host brain tissue is essential for this to occur. Retinoic acid significantly increases the number of differentiated cells, as has been reported with other stem cells.
