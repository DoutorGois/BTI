Possible effect of trophic factors from embryonic cerebellar graft transplanted in adult Lurcher mutant mice on LTP as electrophysiological marker of learning and memory process was studied. Also the combination of the transplantation and long-term forced motor training was investigated. An evaluation of LTP ability in four animal groups (transplanted, sham-operated, with and without forced motor activity) and comparison among them showed the highest LTP improvement in the group with combination of both influences (ie. transplantation and motor training).
