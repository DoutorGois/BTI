The spontaneous electrical activity of the hippocampus as well as its responses to commissural stimulation were recorded in waking rats. Changes in magnitude of the early and late components of the response to commissural stimulation were associated with the behavioural state of the rat. The magnitude of the initial potential was higher in non-theta 'states' than in theta 'states', whereas the opposite was true for the late potential.
