To assess the role of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) in regulating cellular antioxidant defenses, we studied the induction of CuZnSOD mRNA by an in situ hybridization technique and of CuZnSOD protein by an immunocytochemical method in the gerbil hippocampus following 5 min of transient global ischemia. For hybridization, we synthesized 48-mer oligonucleotide (base 465-512) complementary to rat CuZnSOD mRNA. Northern blot analysis showed hybridization to a single band of molecular weight 0.65 kb. After 5 min of ischemia, the signal became stronger at 3 and 24 h and returned to the control level 3 days later. In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed an increase in labeling throughout the hippocampus, especially in the granular layer 3 h following ischemia. The increase was prolonged only in the CA1 pyramidal layer after 24 h and was eliminated within 3 days or later. Conversely, analysis by Western blotting revealed that the insult produced few effects on the induction of CuZnSOD protein. Immunocytochemistry for CuZnSOD revealed a reduced immunostaining in the CA1 pyramidal layer at 24 h of recirculation when the persistent expression of CuZnSOD mRNA was shown in the same area. Our findings suggest that the expression of endogenous CuZnSOD is temporarily stimulated by an ischemic insult without increasing the protein level. The prolonged increase in mRNA and the decrease in the protein of CuZnSOD in the CA1 neurons seem to imply an important role of the endogenous antioxidant enzyme that protects against the detrimental effects of superoxide radicals on delayed neuronal death.
