The distribution of bone marrow cells in brain areas during the acute period after pilocarpine-induced status epiepticus (SE) was investigated here. To achieve this, we generated chimeric mice by engrafting bone marrow cells from enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgenic mice. GFP(+) bone marrow-derived cells were found throughout the brain, predominantly in the hippocampus. As expected, these cells exhibited the characteristics of microglia. The pattern of distribution, proliferation, and differentiation of GFP(+)cells changes as a function of intensity and time following SE. This pattern is also a consequence of the inflammatory response, which is followed by the progressive neuronal damage that is characteristic of the pilocarpine model.
