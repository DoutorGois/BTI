Econazole--an agent that suppresses Ca2+ influx triggered by depletion of internal Ca-stores in non-excitable cells--was bath-applied to submerged slices from Sprague-Dawley rats. Econazole (15-20 microM) had no consistent effect on afferent volleys, EPSPs or population spikes; but in seven out of nine slices, it prevented the induction of tetanic long-term potentiation (LTP) of field EPSPS. By contrast, all slices showed a marked LTP of population spikes. Ca2+ influx induced by tetanic depletion of Ca2+ stores may be essential for LTP of excitatory synaptic transmission.
