The distribution of afferents to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) was studied following iontophoresis of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the nucleus. This report describes the descending connections to this structure. The PVN receives a substantial input from limbic system structures, especially from the lateral septal nucleus and the ventral portion of the subicular cortex. A small number of labeled cells were found in the amygdala, primarily the medial nucleus. Of the circumventricular organs, the subfornical organ and OVLT both project to the PVN, the former very strongly. In both the preoptic area and hypothalamus, medial cell groups have more input than do the lateral areas. Labeled cells were found in the medial and hypothalamus, medial cell groups have more input than do the lateral areas. Labeled cells were found in the medial and lateral preoptic areas, suprachiasmatic nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus, retrochiasmatic and lateral hypothalamic areas. Of particular interest is the finding that the PVN receives input from the contralateral PVN and ipsilateral SON. Of the other diencephalic structures only the zone incerta showed a consistent number of labeled cells. The results are discussed in relationship to the possible neural structures that might mediate the response of the PVN neurons to adrenalectomy.
