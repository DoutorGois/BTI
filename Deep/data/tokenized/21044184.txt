Secretogranin II (SgII), or chromogranin C, is thought to participate in the sorting and packaging of peptide hormones and neuropeptides into secretory granules and large dense-core vesicle (LDCVs), and also functions as a precursor of neuropeptide secretoneurin. Although SgII is widely distributed in the brain and is predominantly localized at terminals of mossy fibers in the hippocampus and cerebellum and climbing fibers in the cerebellum, its cellular expression and ultrastructural localization remain largely unknown. In the present study, we addressed this issue in the adult mouse brain by multiple-labeling fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence and by preembedding and postembedding immunoelectron microscopies. SgII was expressed in various neurons, distributed as either tiny puncta or coarse aggregates in the neuropil, and intensely accumulated in perikarya of particular neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive interneurons and mossy cells in the hippocampus and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Coarse aggregates were typical of terminals of mossy fibers and climbing fibers. In these terminals, numerous immunogold particles were clustered on individual LDCVs, and one or two particles also fell within small synaptic vesicle-accumulating portions. SgII was further detected as tiny puncta in neural elements lacking LDCVs, such as parallel fibers of cerebellar granule cells, somatodendritic elements of various neurons and Bergmann glia. Thus, SgII is present in LDCV and non-LDCV compartments of various neural cells. The wide subcellular localization of SgII may reflect diverse release sites of neuropeptides and secretorneurin, or suggests its role in the sorting and packaging of molecules other than neuropeptides in non-LDCV compartments.
