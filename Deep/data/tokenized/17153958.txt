Emoxypine, thiotriazoline, and NN-103 (a 4-hydrazinoquinasoline derivative) exhibit a pronounced neuroprotective action during acute cerebral stroke. Emoxypine and thiotriazoline are more effective in inhibiting death of neurons in the sensomotor area of the frontal cortex, while NN-103 is more active in the hippocampus. The ischemic death of neurons in the sensomotors area of the frontal cortex with equal probability takes place by karyopyknosis or cytolysis, while in the hippocampus, mainly by cytolysis. All preparations (except for piracetam) with antioxidants properties are powerful membranoprotective agents, which is confirmed by a considerable decrease in the rate of cytolysis both in the cortex and in the hippocampus. The use of piracetam in the case of acute cerebral stroke increases the rate of neuronal death in various areas of the cortex, up to complete destruction of nerve tissues with the formation of cysts (in hippocampus). The tested preparations exhibit different mechanism of neuroprotection: emoxypine and NN-103 (in the sensomotor area of the frontal cortex and hippocampus) and thiotriazoline (in the hippocampus) produce the neuroprotection action on the background of increased activity of transmissions and transcription processes, while thiotriazoline (in the sensomotor area of the frontal cortex) offers neuroprotection on the background of inhibited transcription and transmission activity.
