Somatostatin biosynthesis is activated during and following kindling epileptogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this phenomenon translates into enhanced release of the peptide and whether it is involved in kindling maintenance. A marked increase in somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (somatostatin-LI) was observed in hilar interneurons of the hippocampus and in their presumed projections to the outer molecular layer 1 week, but not 1 month, after the last kindled seizure. No overt changes were observed in the striatum or in the cortex. Compared with sham-stimulated controls, (a) in the hippocampus, high-K+-evoked somatostatin-LI release was unchanged in synaptosomes taken from rats killed 7 days after the last kindled seizure but was bilaterally reduced after 30 days; (b) in the striatum, it was increased (mainly ipsilaterally to stimulation) 7, but not 30, days after the last seizure; and (c) in the cortex, somatostatin-LI release was bilaterally increased in synaptosomes taken from kindled rats 30, but not 7, days after the last seizure. This study shows that distinct changes occur in synaptosomal somatostatin-LI release after kindling acquisition, depending on the brain area analyzed and on the time elapsed from the last generalized seizure.
