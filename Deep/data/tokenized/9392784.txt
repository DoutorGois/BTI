Lead acetate (116 mg/kg/day), arsenic (11 or 13.8 mg/kg/day as sodium arsenite), a lead-arsenic mixture or vehicle were administered to adult mice through gastric intubation during 14 days. Then, the regional content of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (DOPAC), 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), arsenic, and lead were quantified. Compared with the accumulation after single element exposures, the mixture elicited a higher accumulation of lead and a lower arsenic accumulation in the brain. Compared to controls, lead induced only an augmentation of DOPAC (200%) in the hypothalamus. By contrast, the mixture provoked increases of DOPAC in the hypothalamus (250%), DA and 5-HIAA in the striatum (67 and 187%, respectively) and NE decreased in the hypothalamus (45%). Although these alterations were similar to those produced by arsenic alone, the mixture provoked a 38% decrease of NE in the hippocampus and increases of 5-HT in midbrain and frontal cortex (100 and 90%, respectively) over control values, alterations that were not elicited by either metal alone. These results demonstrate an interaction arsenic/lead on the central monoaminergic systems of the adult mouse.
