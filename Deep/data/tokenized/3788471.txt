Anastomoses in the region of the posterior cerebral arteries were found in all of 40 brains examined. Anastomoses were channel-like, plexiform or combined. The former measured from 0.07 mm to 1.1 mm in diameter. They were most often found among the interpeduncular perforating vessels (71.2%), and between the branches of the posterior and anterior cerebral arteries (75.7%). The functional significance of the anastomoses is discussed.
