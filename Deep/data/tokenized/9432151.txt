PURPOSE: Our goal was to determine whether the size of the lateral ventricle influences asymmetry of the fornix in patients with mesial temporal sclerosis. METHODS: The cross-sectional area of the lateral ventricle was measured along with the thickness of the fornix in 18 patients with pathologically proved mesial temporal sclerosis. Two additional patients with ventricular asymmetry and seizures but without mesial sclerosis were also studied. RESULTS: Ten of 18 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis had equally sized ventricular areas or less than a 25% difference between the two sides. In seven of these 10, the left and right fornices were equal; in the other three patients, the fornix was thinner on the side of mesial sclerosis. Among the eight patients with ventricular area differences greater than 25%, the larger ventricle was on the side of mesial sclerosis in five cases. In all of these, the ipsilateral fornix was thinner. In three of eight cases, the contralateral ventricle was larger; in two, the left and right fornix were equal; and in one, the fornix contralateral to the side of mesial sclerosis was smaller. The greatest difference in fornix thickness was noted in patients with ventricular asymmetry greater than 40%, regardless of side or presence of mesial temporal sclerosis. CONCLUSION: The size of the lateral ventricle may influence the apparent thickness of the fornix.
