Glia show marked heterogeneity in terms of electrophysiology in the developing brain, and two major types can be identified based on GFAP or NG2 expression. However, it remains to be determined if such an electrophysiological diversity holds for the adult brain and how GFAP and NG2 lineage glia are associated with different electrophysiological phenotypes during the course of development. To address these fundamental questions, we performed in situ whole cell recording from morphologically identified glia from the rat hippocampal CA1 region from postnatal (P) days 1-106 and double-stained postrecorded cells with GLAST and NG2 antibodies. We found glia express mostly voltage-gated outward K(+) currents and also have inward Na(+) currents in the newborn (P1-P3), but these are no longer present after P22. They consist equally of GLAST(+) and NG2(+) cells in the newborn, but are mainly NG2(+) in juvenile animals (P4-P21). Glia showing voltage-gated outward and inward K(+) currents are also present at P1, peak at P5 and decline to a stationary level of approximately 10% in the adult. They are GLAST(+) astrocytes from newborn to juvenile but NG2(+) glia in the adult. Electrophysiologically passive glia first appear at P4 and increase to 91% in adults, of which 85% are GLAST(+). These results indicate that glial electrophysiological diversity occurs predominantly in the developing brain. While most glia in the NG2 lineage preserve a certain amount of voltage-gated ion conductances, mature GLAST(+) astrocytes are electrophysiologically passive.
