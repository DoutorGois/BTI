The in vitro effects of piracetam treatment on the fluidity of membranes from the hippocampus of Alzheimer's Disease patients (AD) and non-demented controls were studied. Hippocampal membranes of AD patients showed a significant lower hydrocarbon core fluidity compared with membranes from elderly non-demented controls. Preincubation with piracetam enhanced the hydrocarbon core fluidity of hippocampal membranes from AD-patients as well as elderly controls in a concentration depending fashion, although the effect was more pronounced for the AD membranes. In the presence of piracetam, the difference of the membrane fluidity between AD and control membranes was not longer apparent.
