It has been demonstrated previously that performance on the modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (Nelson, 1976) is compromised by hippocampal sclerosis, particularly of the right hemisphere (Corcoran and Upton, 1993). Further evidence in support of this claim is presented here in the form of a case study. The findings from this case demonstrated that performance on the same task was not impaired following a right sided frontal lobectomy but was found to be deficient consequent to seizure recurrence in the right temporal lobe and following right temporal lobe removal. The clinical and theoretical significance of this case is discussed.
