The distributions of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NPY receptors in rat brain have been compared. High densities of NPY-like fibers and terminals are present in the hypothalamus and the endopiriform nucleus with corresponding low densities of NPY receptor binding sites. Conversely, low densities of fibers and terminals are observed in the thalamus, stria terminalis and hippocampus with corresponding high densities of binding sites. Various hypotheses are discussed to explain those apparent mismatches including the existence of other classes of receptors and possible paracrine actions of NPY-like peptides in the brain.
