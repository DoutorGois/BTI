Functional interactions between glucocorticoids and the endocannabinoid system have been repeatedly documented; yet, to date, no studies have demonstrated in vivo that glucocorticoid hormones regulate endocannabinoid signaling. We demonstrate that systemic administration of the glucocorticoid corticosterone (3 and 10 mg/kg) resulted in an increase in the tissue content of the endocannabinoid N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA) within several limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus), but not the prefrontal cortex, of male rats. Tissue AEA content was increased at 10min and returned to control 1h post-corticosterone administration. The other primary endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, was found to be elevated by corticosterone exclusively within the hypothalamus. The rapidity of the change suggests that glucocorticoids act through a non-genomic pathway. Tissue contents of two other N-acylethanolamines, palmitoylethanolamide and oleolyethanolamide, were not affected by corticosterone treatment, suggesting that the mechanism of regulation is neither fatty acid amide nor N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D. These data provide in vivo support for non-genomic steroid effects in mammals and suggest that AEA is a mediator of these effects.
