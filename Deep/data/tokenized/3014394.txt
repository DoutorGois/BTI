The distribution of phencyclidine (PCP) receptors in the rat brain was determined by autoradiography using 1-(1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl)piperidine ([3H]TCP). [3H]TCP appeared to bind to PCP receptors as only PCP-like drugs and sigma-opioids inhibited the binding of [3H]TCP. The areas of the rat brain with the highest density of radiolabeled binding sites were the superficial layers of cerebral cortex, hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Moderate densities of binding sites were found in the medial geniculate nuclei, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, interpeduncular nucleus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray and cerebellum. Low densities of binding sites were observed in spinal cord, most of the brainstem, the substantia nigra and most of the hypothalamus.
