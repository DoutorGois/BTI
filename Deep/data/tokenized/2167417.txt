The binding of [3H] DAMGO, a highly selective ligand for mu-opiate receptors, to membranes of discrete brain regions and spinal cord of 10 week old spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was determined. The brain regions examined were hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, corpus striatum, pons and medulla, midbrain and cortex. [3H] DAMGO bound to membranes of brain regions and spinal cord at a single high affinity site. The receptor density (Bmax value) and apparent dissociation constant (Kd value) of [3H] DAMGO to bind to membranes of hippocampus, corpus striatum, pons and medulla, cortex and spinal cord of WKY and SHR rats did not differ. The Bmax value of [3H] DAMGO in membranes of hypothalamus and midbrain of SHR rats was significantly higher than in WKY rats but the Kd values in the two strains did not differ. On the other hand, the Bmax value of [3H] DAMGO in membranes of amygdala of SHR rats was lower than that of WKY rats but the Kd values in the two strains were similar. It is concluded that SHR rats have higher density of mu-opiate receptors in hypothalamus and midbrain but lower density in amygdala in comparison with WKY rats, and that such differences in the distribution of mu-opiate receptors may be related to the elevated blood pressure in SHR rats.
