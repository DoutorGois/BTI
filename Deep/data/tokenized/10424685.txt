In a previous study we showed that phosphorylation of the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal slices from immature rats (P12-P16) is regulated by a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR). The subtypes of these receptors are divided into three groups and exhibit two distinct transduction signals: activation of phospholipase C and liberation of internal calcium (group I) or modulation of cAMP synthesis (groups II and III). Here we investigated the subtype of mGluR involved. Phosphorylation was strongly stimulated by the selective group II agonists DCG IV, L-CCG-I and 1S,3S-ACPD, whereas the group I agonist 3,5-DHPG and the group III agonist L-AP4 had no effect. These results show that the receptor regulating GFAP phosphorylation in the immature hippocampus has some of the properties of a group II mGluR.
