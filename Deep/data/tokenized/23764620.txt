The nuclear factor kappa-B family of transcription factors have been extensively studied in the immune system where they function to orchestrate the molecular response to immune challenge. However in recent years, members of this family have also been shown to play physiological roles in the development and function of the nervous system. The two best studied members of the nuclear factor kappa-B family are the p65 and the p50 proteins. In this review, we outline recent developments regarding the functions of these proteins in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis, neuronal growth and learning and memory and discuss the implications of their dysregulation during the development of the nervous system.
