The hippocampal theta rhythm in rats exhibited an age-dependent slowing in modal frequency. However, the theta rhythm of young rats with chronic respiratory infections showed a similar slowing. Respiratory disease-free hamsters also exhibited an age-dependent slowing of modal frequencies. These findings emphasize that the health status of the animal must be examined carefully in order to establish an age-dependent slowing in hippocampal rhythm.
