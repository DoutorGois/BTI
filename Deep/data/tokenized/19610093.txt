Recent studies have shown that kainate (KA) receptors are involved in neuronal cell death induced by seizure, which is mediated by the GluR6.PSD-95.MLK3 signaling module and subsequent JNK activation. In our previous studies, we demonstrated the neuroprotective role of a GluR6 c-terminus containing peptide against KA or cerebral ischemia-induced excitotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Here, we first report that overexpression of the PDZ1 domain of PSD-95 protein exerts a protective role against neuronal death induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in vivo and can prevent neuronal cell death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation. Further studies show that overexpression of PDZ1 can perturb the interaction of GluR6 with PSD-95 and suppress the assembly of the GluR6.PSD-95.MLK3 signaling module and therefore inhibit JNK activation. Thus, it not only inhibits phosphorylation of c-Jun and down-regulates Fas ligand expression but also inhibits phosphorylation of 14-3-3 and decreases Bax translocation to mitochondria, decreases the release of cytochrome c, and decreases caspase-3 activation. Overall, the essential role of the PDZ1 domain of PSD-95 in apoptotic cell death in neurons provides an experimental foundation for gene therapy of neurodegenerative diseases with overexpression of the PDZ1 domain.
