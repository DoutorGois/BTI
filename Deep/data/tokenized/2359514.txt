Neuropeptide Y (NPY) immunoreactivity and gene expression was investigated in the hippocampus after kainic acid-induced seizures and pentylenetetrazol kindling in the rat. Pronounced increases of NPY immunoreactivity were found in the terminal field of mossy fibers in both animal models. In kainic acid-treated rats the peptide progressively accumulated in the hilus and the stratum lucidum of CA3, 5-60 days after injection of the toxin and, at the later intervals, extended to the supragranular molecular layer of the dentate gyrus indicating sprouting of these neurons. Unilateral injection of colchicine into the hilus abolished NPY staining of the mossy fibers. Using in situ hybridization, in both animal models markedly enhanced expression of prepro-NPY mRNA was observed in the granular layer, containing the perikarya of the mossy fibers. It is suggested that sustained expression of the neuromodulatory neuropeptide NPY, in addition to the observed plastic changes, may contribute to altered excitability of hippocampal mossy fibers in epilepsy. Neither somatostatin immunoreactivity nor gene expression were enhanced in granule cells/mossy fibers.
