During the production of long-term potentiation (LTP) of the granular cell layer in hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and the enhancement of the ability of the memory retention in rats induced by ginsenosides (GSS), the effects of GSS on the number of silver-nucleolar organizer region (Ag-NOR) of neuron and the sprouting of mossy fiber (MF) terminals in hippocampus were studied. Giving GSS for 7 days, the amplitude of population spike (PS) increased by 87.71 +/- 1.91% and the onset and peak latency of PS decreased by 16.60 +/- 1.53%, and 13.5 +/- 0.87% respectively. Meanwhile, GSS could markedly promote the ability of memory retention in rats. In CA3 and DG area, the average number of Ag-NOR of single pyramidal and granular cell in the three GSS groups increased by 66.17 +/- 2.32% and 72.07 +/- 0.93% respectively (P < 0.01). Moreover in CA3, the average of rating scales of MF terminals sprouting in three GSS groups increased 1-3 times as compared with saline groups (P < 0.01). It is suggested that GSS could enhance the transcriptional activity of rDNA and the synthetic ability of protein in hippocampal neuron, as well as promote the sprouting of MF terminals in hippocampus for increasing the efficiency of transmission by hippocampal synapses.
