OBJECTIVE: To study anti-dementia effects and mechanism of grape peel extracts on imitative dementia rats modle. METHODS: The imitative dementia rats modle were established using health male Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose and NaNO2, simultaneity, administer physiological saline solution, Piracetam Tablets, low dose grape peel extracts, middle dose grape peel extracts, high dose grape peel extracts to intervene separately. Using neurobehavioral tests, antioxidation genus, cholinesterase genus and nitric oxide synthase, histopathological and morphological parameters and immunohistochemical methods etc measure index to observe and evaluate. RESULTS: Grape peel extracts can significantly ameliorate learning and memory function of imitative dementia rats modle, and improve SOD enzyme, NOS enzyme, CAT enzyme activity in rats brain, inhibite MDA enzyme, AchE enzyme activity, reduce the expression of beta-APP-positive immunoreactive neurocytes (beta-APP+) and beta-amyloid-positive immunoreactive neurocytes (beta-AP+) in cerebra cortex and Hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Grape peel extracts can inhibite oxygen free radicel to form, ameliorate cholinomimetic neural function, enhance NOS enzyme activity in the hippocampus and cerebra cortex, reduce the development of beta-AP deposited macula, grape peel extracts probability have a preventive action against early-aged dementia.
