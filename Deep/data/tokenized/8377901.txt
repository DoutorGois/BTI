Massive cerebral infarction due to the occlusion of a main cerebral artery is often unresponsive to medical treatment. Internal decompression with hippocampectomy was tried for two patients and satisfactory results were obtained without advancing cerebral edema. External decompression was also performed on 12 patients, but it was accompanied by intensified edema postoperatively. Satisfactory results were obtained in four cases, but three patients remained in vegetative states, and five patients died. The internal decompression with immediate hippocampectomy resolves compression to the brain stem without aggravating cerebral edema and may be more effective in preserving life than external decompression.
