Calmodulin is a small, acidic calcium-binding protein that regulates a number of calcium-dependent enzyme activities and is thought to be involved in neurotransmission. To begin to explore further the regulation of this important protein in the brain, we have cloned a rat calmodulin cDNA and designed an oligonucleotide probe based on this sequence. Both the cDNA and oligonucleotide probes revealed a markedly heterogeneous distribution of hybridization signal for calmodulin mRNA in the rat brain. The greatest apparent abundance of mRNA for calmodulin was seen in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, whereas many brain regions showed relatively low hybridization signal, including the striatum and portions of the hypothalamus and brainstem.
