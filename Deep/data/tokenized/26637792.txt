Manipulating neurotransmitter release from astrocytes neighboring the developing new neurons in the course of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, Sultan et al. (2015) reveal that glial influence on neurogenesis ranges from controlling basic precursor cell function well into the establishment of functional circuitry. This extends the concept of the "neurogenic niche" and its key role into advanced stages of adult neuronal development.
