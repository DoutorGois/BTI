The role for Wnt signaling modulation during synaptogenesis, neurogenesis and cell fate specification have been well characterized. In contrast, the roles for Wnt signaling pathways in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and adult physiology are only starting to be elucidated. Here, we have identified a novel series of Wnt pathway small molecule modulators, and report that these and other small molecules targeting the Wnt pathway acutely enhance excitatory transmission in adult hippocampal preparations. Our findings are consistent with a pre- and postsynaptic site of action, leading to both increased spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission that occurs in a transcription-independent fashion.
