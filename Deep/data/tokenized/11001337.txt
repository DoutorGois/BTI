Our purpose was to review the current role of invasive and semi-invasive EEG in the presurgical evaluation of candidates for epilepsy surgery. The use of stereotactically implanted intracranial depth (stereo-EEG), subdural strip and grid, and foramen ovale electrodes, as well as intraoperative electrocorticography and electrical brain stimulation ("functional mapping") at the Epilepsy Center University Hospital Zurich, from 1984 to 1998, is analyzed. Advantages and disadvantages of the various intracranial EEG techniques are critically discussed. Out of 422 selective amygdalohippocampectomies performed in Zurich, 54% had non-invasive, 32% had semi-invasive, and 14% had invasive presurgical EEG evaluation. Because patients currently referred to our center increasingly present with a complex history of disease, i.e., constitute so-called "difficult cases", there is trend to combine several invasive and semi-invasive, pre- and intraoperative neurophysiological techniques.
