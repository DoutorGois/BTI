It is almost axiomatic in neuroscience that postsynaptically induced NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) is a cellular substrate of memory. As a result, memory impairments caused by experimental reductions of NMDA currents are often interpreted as evidence that this form of plasticity is involved in memory formation. However, a recent Nature study indicates that not all NMDA-dependent LTP is induced postsynaptically.
