Calcium-binding proteins (CaPs) potentially play important roles in neurogenesis and neuronal survival. Calbindin-D28K (CALB) and calretinin (CALRET) in the medial basal hypothalamic (and preoptic area) (MBH) and hippocampus (HIPPO) from control and maternally separated male and female infantile rats were examined by Western analysis. Significantly greater levels of the CaPs in the MBH vs. the HIPPO may suggest enhanced or decreased neuroprotection, respectively, during the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP). Male infantile rats separated from their mother's from postnatal day 2-10 displayed significant changes in CALB and CALRET for the MBH (decrease) and HIPP (increase) brain sites suggesting possible modified (negative feedback) mechanism(s) in HPA dysfunction observed during postnatal life.
