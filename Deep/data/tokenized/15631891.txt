High-frequency stimulation of lateral perforant path is accompanied by a heterosynaptic long-term depression (LTD) of medial perforant path synaptic responses in both the dentate gyrus and the CA3 region of the hippocampus. We reported previously that LTP induction at lateral perforant path-CA3 synapses is unaffected by NMDA antagonists. However, it is not known if heterosynaptic LTD that is observed in the CA3 region following lateral perforant path stimulation also is independent from NMDA receptors. We address this question in anesthetized adult rats using systemic administration of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CPP. Induction of lateral perforant path-CA3 LTP produced a sustained heterosynaptic depression of medial perforant path-CA3 responses. Systemic administration of CPP (10 mg/kg) was ineffective in blocking the induction of LTP at lateral perforant path-CA3 responses. However, heterosynaptic LTD of medial perforant path-CA3 responses was blocked completely by CPP. These data indicate that NMDA receptors are not required for the induction of lateral perforant path-CA3 LTP, but are involved in the induction of heterosynaptic LTD that accompanies lateral perforant path activity. The requirement for NMDA receptors for heterosynaptic LTD suggests one functional role of NMDA receptors at termination fields of the lateral perforant path.
