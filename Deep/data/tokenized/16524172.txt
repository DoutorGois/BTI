OBJECTIVE: To provide the evidence of the relationship between brain injury and the time of injury. METHODS: Rats were contused on brain by fluid percussion, then were killed after injury for 15 min, 30 min, 1,3,6,12 h, and 1,4,7,14 d respectively. The expression of caspase-8 were detected by immunohistochemical technology on rat brain section and the results were assessed by image analysis system in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. RESULTS: The expression of caspase-8 in cortex and hippocampus could be detected in 30 min after injury, increased significantly in 3h, reached apex in 1d after injury, remained 4d before decreased. In addition, the expression of caspase-8 can be detected in 1h after injury and reached apex in 1d after injury, and remained 4d then reduced. CONCLUSION: It seems that the expression of caspase-8 should be a useful target for diagnosis of early brain injury.
