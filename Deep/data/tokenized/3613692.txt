Simultaneous administration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3, citrate, and aluminum-containing phosphate binders is frequently used in patients with chronic renal failure. In order to investigate whether citrate may represent a risk factor of aluminum intoxication, 16 Sprague-Dawley weanling rats were randomly assigned to four groups: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3 at 16 ng/kg/day was given to all groups except the control; in addition, two groups received either aluminum hydroxide at 160 mg elemental aluminum/kg/day, or aluminum citrate at 160 mg elemental aluminum/kg/day, respectively. The control group received only the vehicle. Extremely high aluminum concentrations were detected in the hippocampus of rats receiving aluminum compounds. This content of aluminum (microgram/g dry weight) was far higher than that found in other brain areas of the same animals (146.40 +/- 51.23 versus 4.49 +/- 0.62, P less than 0.001) as well as that detected in the hippocampus of the control animals (2.73 +/- 0.40). Thus, in non-uremic, weanling rats supplemented with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3, the administration of aluminum favors selective accumulation in the hippocampus. No differences between aluminum hydroxide and aluminum citrate administration were observed.
