This study aimed to examine the neuroprotective effects of Nigella sativa (N. sativa) in the hippocampus of propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroid rats during neonatal and juvenile growth. Twenty- five pregnant rats from early gestation (GD 0) were divided into five groups: (1) control (received drinking water), (2) PTU (received 0.005% PTU in drinking water), (3-5) PTU + NS 0.05%, PTU + NS 0.1%, PTU + NS 0.2% (along with PTU, received 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% W/V of N. sativa respectively) and treatment continued until postnatal day 60 (PN 60). The brains of male pups were removed for histological and stereological assessments. N. sativa extract significantly reduced the production of dark neurons and apoptotic cells in different areas of the hippocampus compared to the PTU group. Moreover, it significantly attenuated the effect of hypothyroidism on the volume reduction of the hippocampus. The results of the present study suggested that N. sativa extract has a potential ability to prevent the hippocampal neural damage after inducing hypothyroidism during neonatal and juvenile growth in rats.
