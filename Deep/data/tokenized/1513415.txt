The synthesis rate of brain acetylcholine (ACh) was estimated 30 min and 5 days following transient forebrain ischemia performed by 10 min bilateral carotid occlusion in gerbils. ACh synthesis was evaluated from the conversion of radiolabeled choline (Ch) into ACh after an i.v. administration of [methyl-3H]Ch. Endogenous and labeled Ch and ACh were quantified by HPLC. The synthesis rate of Ach was significantly decreased following 30 min of recirculation. The reductions reached 55.4% in the hippocampus, 51.2% in the cerebral cortex and 44.4% in the striatum. Five days after ischemia, the values returned to normal in the cerebral cortex and in the striatum, while ACh synthesis remained selectively lowered (-30.4%, p less than 0.01) in the hippocampus. These cholinergic alterations may account for both early and delayed post-ischemic behavioral and mnesic deficits.
