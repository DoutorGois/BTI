BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), as used for infant heart surgery, carry a risk of ischemic neurologic injury. Volatile anesthetics have neuroprotective properties against both global and focal ischemia at normothermia. The authors examined the hemodynamic and neuroprotective effects of desflurane in a piglet CPB-DHCA model. METHODS: Twenty piglets aged 5-10 days received a desflurane- (6-9% expired) or fentanyl-based anesthetic before and during CPB (before and after DHCA). DHCA lasted 90 min at 19 degrees C brain. Cardiovascular variables (heart rate, arterial pressure, blood gases, glucose, brain temperature) were monitored. On postoperative day 2, neurologic and histologic outcomes were determined. RESULTS: Cardiovascular variables before, during, and after CPB were physiologically similar between groups. The desflurane group had better neurologic performance (P = 0.023) and greater postoperative weight gain (P = 0.04) than the fentanyl group. In neocortex, the desflurane group had less tissue damage (P = 0.0015) and fewer dead neurons (P = 0.0015) than the fentanyl group. Hippocampal tissue damage was less in the desflurane group (P = 0.05), but overall, neuronal cell counts in the CA1 sector of the right hippocampus were similar to those in the fentanyl group. CONCLUSIONS: Desflurane-based anesthesia yields hemodynamics during CPB with DHCA that are similar to those with fentanyl-based anesthesia. However, desflurane-based anesthesia improves neurologic and histologic outcomes of CPB-DHCA in comparison with outcomes with fentanyl-based anesthesia.
