Erythropoietin (EPO) provides neuroprotection and neurorestoration after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The EPO doses used for treatment of TBI significantly increase hematocrit, which may affect the efficacy of EPO therapy for TBI. The aim of this study was to investigate whether normalization of hematocrit would affect EPO efficacy for treatment of TBI. Young adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: (1) Sham group (n=6); (2) TBI+ saline group (n=6); (3) TBI+ EPO group (n=6); and (4) TBI+ EPO+ hemodilution group (n=7). TBI was induced by controlled cortical impact over the left parietal cortex. EPO (5,000 U/kg) or saline was administered intraperitoneally at days 1, 2, and 3 postinjury. Neurological function was assessed using a modified neurological severity score (mNSS), footfault and the Morris water maze (MWM) tests. Animals were sacrificed 35 days after injury, and brain sections were stained for immunohistochemistry. Compared to the saline treatment, EPO treatment significantly reduced hippocampal cell loss, enhanced angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the injured cortex and hippocampus, and significantly improved sensorimotor functional outcome (lowered mNSS and foot faults) and spatial learning (MWM test). Normovolemic hemodilution effectively normalized the hematocrit and did not significantly affect the histological and functional outcome of EPO therapy for TBI. These data for the first time demonstrate that increased hematocrit does not affect therapeutic effects of EPO on histological and long-term functional outcomes in rats after TBI and also suggest that neuroprotection and neurorestoration of EPO treatment are independent of hematocrit.
