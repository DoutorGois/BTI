In this study, the effect of ovariectomy and amyloid Beta(1-42) (ABeta(1-42))on eight-armed radial maze performance, acetylcholine (ACh) release, Alpha7nACh receptor (Alpha7nAChr), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression, and apoptosis of CA1 neurons in the dorsal hippocampus were investigated in rat. The results showed that the dorsal hippocampus of sham rats contains 136.7 -/+ 16.7 to 160.4 -/+ 21.1 fmol/microl ACh, and respective 201 -/+ 22.9 and 416.6 -/+ 66.3 expression of mRNA for a7nAChR and GAPDH. Ovariectomy alone, after 4 weeks, did not impair memory, and neither induced apoptosis nor changed the basal ACh release. On the other hand, ABeta(1-42) (600 pmol/10 microl/body/day i.c.v. for 7 days) impaired memory, an effect characterized by increased error choices and reduced (50-59%) ACh release, but only with slight apoptosis. Moreover, ovariectomy combined with ABeta(1-42) induced memory impairment characterized by decreased numbers of correct choices and increased numbers of errors. This effect was accompanied by a decrease of the basal ACh level (67%), a7nAChR mRNA expression (52%) and a7nAChR/GAPDH ratio (44%) without induction of apoptosis in the dorsal hippocampus. The high K+-evoked ACh release was not altered in ovariectomized rats, but was decreased by ABeta(1-42) (43%) and ovariectomy + ABeta(1-42) (80%). These results suggest that ovariectomy-induced hormonal deprivation after 4 weeks, when accompanied by ABeta(1-42) accumulation in the dorsal hippocampus, could impair memory by decreasing ACh release and a7nAChR expression without inducing apoptosis in the CA1 field of the dorsal hippocampus.
