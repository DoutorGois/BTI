Kindling is characterized by a progressive intensification of seizure activity culminating in generalized seizures following repeated administration of an initially subconvulsive electrical or chemical stimulus. Since it is known that epilepsy induces morphological alterations in the limbic system, we examined the neuropathological consequences of kindling with a sensitive silver-staining method for the visualization of damaged neurons and Nissl staining for the estimation of the neuronal densities in different limbic areas. Wistar rats implanted with electrodes in the left basolateral nucleus were stimulated until 15 consecutive stage V seizures (scale of Racine). Amygdala-kindled animals had reduced cell density in the amygdala and increased density of fragments of degenerated axons. Reduced neuronal density and the occurrence of degenerated axons in kindled animals were more prominent in the ipsilateral than in the contralateral hemisphere. In addition, more degenerated axons were found in cortical structures of kindled than sham-operated animals. These results indicate that kindling induced morphological alterations that were not restricted to either the ipsilateral hemisphere or the stimulated region. These morphological changes might be responsible for the emotional and behavioral disturbances that can accompany epilepsy.
