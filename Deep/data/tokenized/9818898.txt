Surgical outcome in hippocampal atrophy (n = 44) and amygdalohippocampal atrophy (n = 14) were compared. Hippocampal atrophy had better seizure-free outcome than amygdalohippocampal atrophy (80% versus 50%, p = 0.043). Severity of hippocampal atrophy correlated with duration of epilepsy in patients with hippocampal atrophy (r = 0.4, p = 0.007), but not in those with amygdalohippocampal atrophy, suggesting that these two groups may have a different pathogenesis.
