The role of monoamines in the functional regulation of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system was studied using in vivo microdialysis of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus of awake unrestrained rats. Systemic administration of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine (2.0 mg/kg) resulted in a 170% increase in hippocampal ACh overflow. Similarly the catecholamine-releasing agent amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg) produced a 400% increase in ACh overflow. The effect induced by amphetamine, but not that of apomorphine, was blocked in animals pretreated with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT). The effect of amphetamine on ACh release was reduced by 75% after a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) but was not affected by 6-OHDA lesions of the noradrenergic dorsal and ventral bundles. However, baseline ACh overflow was increased by 130% by the dorsal and ventral bundle lesions. The serotonin-releasing agent p-chloroamphetamine (2.5 mg/kg) produced a 160% increase in hippocampal ACh release, and this effect was enhanced after a 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) lesion of the serotonin projection system. The results show that surgical or pharmacological manipulations of the ascending brainstem monoaminergic systems, which innervate wide areas of the forebrain, including the septum and the hippocampal formation, have pronounced effects on septo-hippocampal cholinergic activity. Thus, the present data provide support for the view that information regarding behavioral state and arousal is conveyed to the septo-hippocampal system via ascending monoaminergic systems.
