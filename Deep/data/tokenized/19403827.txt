Hippocampal interneurons synchronize the activity of large neuronal ensembles during memory consolidation. Although the latter process is manifested as increases in synaptic efficacy which require new protein synthesis in pyramidal neurons, it is unknown whether such enduring plasticity occurs in interneurons. Here, we uncover a long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmission at individual interneuron excitatory synapses which persists for at least 24 h, after repetitive activation of type-1 metabotropic glutamate receptors [mGluR1-mediated chemical late LTP (cL-LTP(mGluR1))]. cL-LTP(mGluR1) involves presynaptic and postsynaptic expression mechanisms and requires both transcription and translation via phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin and MAP kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase signaling pathways. Moreover, cL-LTP(mGluR1) involves translational control at the level of initiation as it is prevented by hippuristanol, an inhibitor of eIF4A, and facilitated in mice lacking the cap-dependent translational repressor, 4E-BP. Our results reveal novel mechanisms of long-term synaptic plasticity that are transcription and translation-dependent in inhibitory interneurons, indicating that persistent synaptic modifications in interneuron circuits may contribute to hippocampal-dependent cognitive processes.
