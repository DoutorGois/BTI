Recent work from our laboratory and others has shown that certain stressors increase expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1beta (IL-1) in the hypothalamus. The first goal of the following studies was to assess the impact of acute stress on other key inflammatory factors, including both cytokines and cell surface markers for immune-derived cells resident to the CNS in adult male Sprague Dawley rats exposed to intermittent footshock (80 shocks, 90 s variable ITI, 5 s each). While scattered changes in IL-6 and GFAP were observed in the hippocampus and cortex, we found the hypothalamus to be exquisitely sensitive to the effects of footshock. At the level of the hypothalamus, mRNA for IL-1 and CD14 were significantly increased, while at the same time CD200R mRNA was significantly decreased. A subsequent experiment demonstrated that propranolol (20mg/kg i.p.) blocked the increase in IL-1 and CD14 mRNA observed in the hypothalamus, while the decrease in CD200R was unaffected by propranolol. Interestingly, inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis via injection of metyrapone (50mg/kg s.c.) plus aminoglutethimide (100mg/kg s.c.) increased basal IL-1 mRNA and augmented IL-1 and CD14 expression provoked by footshock. Injection of minocycline, a putative microglial inhibitor, blocked the IL-1 response to footshock, while CD14 and CD200R were unaffected. Together, these gene expression changes (i) provide compelling evidence that stress may provoke neuroinflammatory changes that extend well beyond isolated changes in a single cytokine; (ii) suggest opposing roles for classic stress-responsive factors (norepinephrine and corticosterone) in the modulation of stress-related neuroinflammation; (iii) indicate microglia within the hypothalamus may be key players in stress-related neuroinflammation; and (iv) provide a potential mechanism (increased CD14) by which acute stress primes reactivity to later immune challenge.
