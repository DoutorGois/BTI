Administration of opioid agonists or antagonists has been reported to regulate proliferation or survival of neural progenitors in vivo. Here we report that beta-endorphin and selective mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonists stimulate proliferation of isolated rat adult hippocampal progenitors (AHPs). The AHPs were found to express DORs and MORs, but not kappa-opioid receptors. Incubation with beta-endorphin for 48 h increased the number of AHPs found in mitosis, the total DNA content, and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen. This proliferative effect from beta-endorphin on AHPs was antagonized by naloxone. The beta-endorphin-induced proliferation was mediated through phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and both intra- and extracellular calcium. These data suggest a role for the opioid system in the regulation of proliferation in progenitors from the adult hippocampus.
