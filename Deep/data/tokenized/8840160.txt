Based on their typical pattern of membrane currents, four populations of glial cells could be identified in thin brain slices of the postnatal hippocampus. In the present study, we applied the patch-clamp technique to glial cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, which are characterized by a complex pattern of different Na+ and K+ currents ("complex" cells). These cells were identified as non-neuronal cells, most likely astrocytes, by their glutamine synthetase immunoreactivity. Two types of glial Ca2+ currents could be identified that differed in their kinetics and pharmacological properties. A low-voltage activated (LVA), fast inactivating component was activated at membrane potentials positive to -60 mV and reached maximum current amplitudes at about -20 mV. This current was sensitive to amiloride and thus displayed properties of neuronal LVA currents. The threshold potential of the second Ca2+ current component was at about -40 mV, and peak currents were observed at 0 mV. In contrast to the LVA component, the inactivation of these high-voltage activated (HVA) currents slowed down with increasing depolarizations. This current was sensitive to low concentrations of Cd2+ but was not affected by amiloride. A small fraction of the HVA currents was sensitive to nifedipine, and omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx) was also found to reduce the glial HVA component. The study provides electrophysiological and pharmacological characterization of different types of Ca2+ currents in gray matter glial cells in situ.
