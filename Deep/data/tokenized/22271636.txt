The effects of low concentrations of caffeine and ryanodine on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and long-term potentiation (LTP) were studied in CA1 region of slices of dorsal and ventral hippocampus (DH and VH, respectively). There was a striking difference between the two regions in the magnitude of effect of both drugs, as well as the ability to interact with a tetanic stimulation to produce LTP. Low concentration of caffeine (1 mM) produced a postsynaptic increase in the slope of population EPSPs in VH, and facilitated LTP in this region. Low concentration of ryanodine (0.2 muM) was able to convert short-term potentiation (STP) to LTP in VH only. These effects are postsynaptic and they reflect a higher concentration of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the VH compared to the DH.
