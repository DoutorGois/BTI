Neurogenesis and cell death occur predominantly during the postnatal period in the dentate gyrus of the rat. Recent studies have shown that mitosis and apoptosis in this system are regulated by adrenal steroids, possibly through excitatory amino acids. Studies performed in other systems have identified genes that mediate cell birth and death, which may also participate in the development and maintenance of the dentate gyrus.
