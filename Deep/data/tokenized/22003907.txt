The present review is devoted to application of MRI techniques to the epileptic brain and the search for potential biomarkers of epileptogenicity and/or epileptogenesis in rodents that could be translated to the clinic. Diffusion-weighted imaging reveals very early changes in water movements. T(2)-weighted hypersignal indicates edema or gliosis within brain regions and is most often used along with histological assessment of neuronal loss. (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy measures the energy reserve of the tissue while (1)H spectroscopy assesses neuronal loss and mitochondrial dysfunction. (13)C spectroscopy analyzes, separately, neuronal and astrocytic metabolism and interactions between the two cell types. Finally, diffusion tensor imaging and tractography have been applied to the study of plasticity and show a good coherence with circuit changes assessed by Timm staining. The potential of these techniques as reliable biomarkers of epileptogenesis is still disputed. At the moment, one study has provided a reliable temporal evolution of the T(2) signal, predicting epileptogenesis in 100% of the cases, and further imaging approaches based on the techniques described here are still needed to identify potential early imaging biomarkers of epileptogenicity and/or epileptogenesis.
