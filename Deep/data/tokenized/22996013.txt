Bisphenol AF (BPAF), a newly introduced chemical structurally related to bisphenol A, is used extensively in fluoroelastomers and polyesters, and has been known to induce estrogen-dependent responses. However, the toxicity of BPAF is largely unknown except for its endocrine-related effects. In this study, we investigated the neurotoxicity of BPAF and underlying mechanisms of action using hippocampal cell line (HT-22) and mouse primary neuronal cells. We found that BPAF induced apoptosis in both HT-22 and primary neuronal cells. In order to clarify the underlying mechanisms of BPAF-induced apoptosis, various signaling molecules were evaluated. BPAF increased the level of intracellular calcium, followed by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). BPAF upregulated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase: extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB. Using specific inhibitors, we confirmed that calcium, ROS, p38, and JNK mediated the BPAF-induced apoptosis. In addition, BPAF inhibited microglial activation in a microglia/neuroblastoma coculture model by the reduction of nitric oxide production. We found that BPAF interrupted the normal physiologic functions of microglia at non-toxic levels. Taken together, our results suggest that BPAF, the substitute of BPA, also have neurotoxic properties.
