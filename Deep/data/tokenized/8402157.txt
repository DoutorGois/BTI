Transient forebrain ischemia was produced in gerbils by short-term occlusion of the common carotid arteries under halothane anesthesia. Histological analysis of brains 7 days post-ischemia demonstrated characteristic destruction of CA1 pyramidal cells. lambda Opiate binding (measured with [3H]naloxone in the presence of 300 nM diprenorphine) at 7 days post-ischemia was significantly increased in the stratum lucidum of the hippocampus (the mossy fiber layer), but not in any other region measured, including other hippocampal regions, cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, thalamus, and hypothalamus. The increase in mossy fiber lambda binding was slow to develop (no increase detected up to 48 h post-ischemia), and long-lasting (binding remained elevated at 32 days post-ischemia). While MK-801 significantly inhibited CA1 pyramidal cell destruction when administered 20 min prior to ischemia, the increase in mossy fiber lambda binding was still evident. None of seven different opioid agonists and antagonists examined had an effect on either the pyramidal cell damage or increased mossy fiber lambda binding seen 7 days after ischemia.
