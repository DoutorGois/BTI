This Special Issue of Neurobiology of Learning and Memory dedicated to Dr. Richard Thompson to celebrate his 80th birthday and his numerous contributions to the field of learning and memory gave us the opportunity to revisit the hypothesis we proposed more than 25years ago regarding the biochemistry of learning and memory. This review summarizes our early 1980s hypothesis and then describes how it was tested and modified over the years following its introduction. We then discuss the current status of the hypothesis and provide some examples of how it has led to unexpected insights into the memory problems that accompany a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders.
