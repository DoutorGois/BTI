The authors report the longitudinal study of a 53-year-old man with severe lobar atrophy confined to the left frontal and temporal lobes, including the left hippocampus, but sparing other cortical regions. He experienced profound cognitive deterioration, sparing only visuospatial memory. Despite these deficits, he could play golf at a high level of competence, following rules and etiquette as well as monitoring the ongoing game. The patient's golf performance may have been supported by residual visuospatial declarative memory and complex flexible implicit memory programs.
