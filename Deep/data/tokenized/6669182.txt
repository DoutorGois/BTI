Neurotoxins often produce substantial changes in cognitive functions, particularly memory. Animal models are useful to determine the pathological changes underlying these behavioral symptoms, and the psychological mechanisms responsible for them. Criteria for the development of productive animal models are presented. These are illustrated in the context of an animal model to evaluate changes in short-term memory that occur following damage to the central nervous system, particularly the hippocampus.
