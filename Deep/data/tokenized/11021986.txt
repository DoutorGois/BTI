Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a major mediator of adaptive responsiveness to stress. We measured changes in extracellular concentrations of catecholamine and indoleamines in freely moving rats in response to administration of CRF1 antagonist CP-154,526 by using in vivo microdialysis. Dialysis probes were placed stereotaxically in either the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex. We examined the response in the hippocampus or the prefrontal cortex to 32.0 mg/kg i.p. administration of CP-154,526. CP-154,526 reduced the extracellular concentration of norepinephrine (NE) from 30 min to 180 min and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) from 30 min to 60 min after injection in the hippocampus. CP-154,526 did not remarkably change dopamine (DA). There were no significant differences between CP-154,526 and vehicle in NE, 5-HT and DA in the prefrontal cortex. The present results indicate that CRF1 receptor antagonist produced a decrease in dialysate concentration of NE and 5-HT, but not DA, in the hippocampus. These results suggest that the CRH-1 receptor antagonist suppresses the release of NE and 5-HT in the hippocampus.
