To study functional connections in the limbic system (LS), a model was used of instrumental alimentary CR, elaborated in response to low-frequency hippocampus electrostimulation with testing of its generalization within the LS. The dependence was established of the generalization on activation of corresponding pathways between the signal and tested brain structures, the activation of pathways was estimated by EPs recorded in limbic structures in response to hippocampus stimulation (during CR performance), or vice versa (in generalization trials). It turned out that for the appearance of CR generalization, two-way connections between signal and tested brain structures or connections only to the signal structure are more important. One-way connections from the signal structure to tested ones, judging by data, are not important for appearance of the CR generalization in used model of conditioning.
