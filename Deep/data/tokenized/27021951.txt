Adolescent development is associated with major changes in emotional and cognitive functions, as well as a rise in stress-related psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. It is also a time of significant maturation of the brain, marked by structural alterations in many limbic and cortical regions. Though many elegant human neuroimaging studies have described the adolescent-related changes in these regions, relatively little is known about these changes in non-human animals. Moreover, both human and non-human data are lacking on how exposure to chronic stress may disrupt this structural maturation. Given the fundamental structure-function relationship in the nervous system, it will be important to understand how these normative and stress-induced structural alterations during adolescence influence psychological function, which in turn can modify future neural development. The purpose of this brief review is to describe the impact of stress on the structure of brain regions that continue to show structural maturation during adolescence and are highly sensitive to the effects of chronic stress exposure. Specifically, this review will focus on the amygdala, hippocampal formation, and prefrontal cortex, particularly from a morphological perspective. As many unanswered questions remain in this area of investigation, potential future lines of research are also discussed. A deeper appreciation of how stress affects adolescent brain development will be needed if we are to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate the increase in stress-related psychological dysfunctions often observed during this stage of development.
