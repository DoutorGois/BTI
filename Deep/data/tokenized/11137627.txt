Noradrenaline (NA) can be released by both exocytosis and by the membrane transporter responsible for transmitter uptake. Previously, we reported that S-nitrosocysteine (SNC), an S-nitrosothiol, stimulated [3H]NA release from the rat hippocampus. In this study, we investigated the involvement of the NA transport system in SNC-stimulated NA release from rat brain (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) slices. [3H]NA release by SNC in normal Na(+) (148 mM)-containing buffer from both slices was slightly, but significantly, inhibited by 1 microM desipramine, an NA transporter inhibitor. [3H]NA release in low Na(+) (under 14 mM)-containing buffer was inhibited by over 50% by desipramine. [3H]NA release by tyramine from both slices in normal and low Na(+) buffer was almost completely inhibited by desipramine. [3H]NA uptake into cerebral cortical slices was observed in low Na(+) buffer at 20-30% of normal Na(+) buffer levels. [3H]NA uptake in both normal and low Na(+) buffers was inhibited by desipramine and by SNC. Although [3H]NA uptake in normal Na(+) buffer was almost completely inhibited by 500 microM ouabain, the uptake in low Na(+) buffer was resistant to ouabain. These findings suggest the existence of a functional Na(+)-independent NA transport system and that SNC stimulates NA release at least partially via this system in brain slices.
