Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been developed as a drug to be used for treatment of stroke for hundreds of years. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, a serum pharmacological method was employed to investigate the effects of BYHWD on growth and differentiation of cultured neural progenitor cells derived from embryonic hippocampus. In culture medium containing BYHWD, the average neurite length of neural progenitor cells grew significantly longer than in control serum without BYHWD. Moreover, more neurofilament (NF) positive cells and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were detected in the presence of BYHWD. The concentration of intracellular Ca(2+) in progenitor cells cultured with BYHWD was significantly lower than that cultured without BYHWD. These results suggest that BYHWD may promote growth and differentiation of neural progenitor cells.
