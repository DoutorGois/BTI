Scopolamine was either continuously infused or injected once daily into C3H mice. Chronic infusion resulted in mice that were supersensitive to the hypothermia and tremor produced by the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine. Chronic scopolamine infusion did not alter brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activities but it did produce an increase in brain muscarinic receptors, as measured by quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) binding. The maximal increase in QNB binding was seen at the 0.2 mg/kg/hr dose. Further increase in dose resulted in a return to control QNB binding in all brain regions studied except cortex. These animals were still supersensitive to oxotremorine, suggesting a dissociation between receptor number and response to agonist. Animals injected once daily for 10 days with 5 mg/kg exhibited an increase in QNB binding while no increase was seen at 20 mg/kg/day. Chronic oxotremorine infusion resulted in tolerance to the hypothermia-producing effects of oxotremorine. This was accompanied by a decrease in brain QNB binding. Coinfusion of scopolamine with oxotremorine blocked both the tolerance development and receptor changes. These experiments demonstrate that chronic scopolamine treatment can elicit an increase in brain muscarinic receptors which is accompanied by supersensitivity to agonists. However, this effect is not clearly dose related, and a strict relationship between receptor number and agonist response does not exist.
