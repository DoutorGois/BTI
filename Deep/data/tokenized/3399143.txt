CA1 pyramidal neurons are selectively vulnerable to ischemia. 2-[14C]Deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiography was employed to measure local glucose utilization in the rat hippocampus after transient ischemia, under the condition of unilateral prevention of ischemic CA1 pyramidal cell necrosis by unilateral lesioning of Schaffer collaterals (left side). Columnar 2-DG uptake patterns in the CA1 region with intact Schaffer collaterals (right side) was observed 19-22 h after recirculation, though no laterality was noted 3 and 8 h after recirculation. In the right subiculum, higher 2-DG uptake was observed 19-22 h after recirculation in 5 out of 8 animals. These results suggest that Schaffer collaterals play a role in modulating glucose metabolism in the CA1 and subiculum during recirculation.
