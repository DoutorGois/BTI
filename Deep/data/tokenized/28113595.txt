In order to build hippocampal prostheses for restoring memory functions, we build sparse multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear dynamical models of the human hippocampus. Spike trains are recorded from hippocampal CA3 and CA1 regions of epileptic patients performing a variety of memory-dependent delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks. Using CA3 and CA1 spike trains as inputs and outputs respectively, sparse generalized Laguerre-Volterra models are estimated with group lasso and local coordinate descent methods to capture the nonlinear dynamics underlying the CA3-CA1 spike train transformations. These models can accurately predict the CA1 spike trains based on the ongoing CA3 spike trains during multiple memory events, e.g., sample presentation, sample response, match presentation and match response, of the DMS task, and thus will serve as the computational basis of human hippocampal memory prostheses.
