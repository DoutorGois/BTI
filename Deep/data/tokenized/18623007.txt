INTRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT: The contextual cues can modulate the conditioned response in numerous paradigms of learning. The brain mechanisms necessary for this contextual effect on learning are unknown. The objective of this review is to show the known aspects of the neurobiology of contextual learning and the contextual modulation of learning. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the hippocampus and amygdala participate in a different way in the context-learning relation, depending on the contextual cues and the behavioural paradigm used. Others areas, like nucleus accumbens, striatum, and several cortical areas, also could operate in some contextual learning.
