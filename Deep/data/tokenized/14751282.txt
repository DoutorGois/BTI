Apoptosis-linked gene-2 interacting protein X (Alix) is thought to be involved in both cell death and vesicular trafficking. We examined Alix expression 2 h, 6 h and 24 h after triggering seizure-dependent neuronal death by i.p. kainic acid injection. In the hippocampus, intense, transient immunolabelling was observed in the strata lucidum, oriens and radiatum, areas of high synaptic activity. The similarity of this distribution to those of synaptophysin and endophilin suggests a presynaptic localisation. Alix labelling was increased in neuronal cell bodies in kainate-sensitive regions before or concomitant with the first signs of oedema and/or neuronal eosinophilia. The increase persisted 24 h after kainate-injection in CA3 and the piriform cortex which are areas with massive swelling and numerous pyknotic neurons. This suggests that Alix may play an early role in the mechanisms leading to cell death. Taken together, our results suggest that Alix may be a molecular link between synaptic functioning and neuronal death.
