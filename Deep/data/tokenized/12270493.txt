Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been increasingly utilized in brain research to monitor non-invasively metabolites such as N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho). We present here studies of the effect of aging on the ratios of these metabolites measured in the rat brain in vivo and on choline transport and lipid synthesis in rat brain slices, in vitro. The in vivo studies indicated that the ratios of Cho/NAA and Cho/Cr increased in the aged hippocampus, whereas the ratio of Cr/NAA was similar in the aged and adult hippocampus. These three ratios remained similar in the cortex of adult and aged rats. The in vitro studies revealed that in the aged cortex and the aged hippocampus the activity of the low-affinity choline uptake increased, possibly compensating for a decrease in the high-affinity uptake activity and the rate of choline diffusion. The incorporation of choline into phospholipids exhibited high and low affinity kinetics which were not modified by aging.
