The cholinergic neurotoxin, AF64A-picrylsulfonate, was unilaterally infused into the dorsal hippocampus of Wistar rats (2 nmol/2 microliters/4 min; A 6.2, Ls 1.5, H 6.5, Paxinos and Watson). After 19 days the for immunohistochemical staining of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Morphometry and counting of ChAT-immunoreactive profiles revealed shrinkage and disappearance of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum and diagonal band of Broca at the lesioned brain side. These data indicate a retrograde degeneration of cholinergic neurons following injection of AF64A-picrylsulfonate into the dorsal hippocampus of the rat.
