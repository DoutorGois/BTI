A new class of in vitro Zn(II) chemosensor based on dipyrrin has been developed. 5-(Pyren-1-yl)-4,6-dipyrrin (PYDPY1) was synthesized and exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity to Zn(II) (K(d) of 20 muM) compared to other metal ions. PYDPY1 was applied to the visualization of Zn(II) concentration in hippocampal tissue.
