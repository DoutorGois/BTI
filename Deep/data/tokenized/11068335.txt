SNAP-25, synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa, is reported to be a t-SNARE (target receptor associated with the presynaptic plasma membrane) involved in the docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles. We present here the first ultrastructural localization of SNAP-25 in intact neurons by pre-embedding EM immunocytochemistry in rat brains, hippocampal slice cultures, and PC12 cells. In differentiated neurons, SNAP-25 labeling was clearly membrane-associated. The labeling was most prominent in the plasma membrane of axons and excluded from the plasma membranes of soma and dendrites. Furthermore, SNAP-25 did not appear to be restricted to the synaptic junctions. SNAP-25 labeling was seen in the cytoplasm of the soma and large dendrites, mostly associated with the Golgi complexes. There were also some SNAP-25 labeled tubulo-vesicular structures in the cytoplasm of the soma and the axons, but rarely in the smaller dendrites. In PC12 cells, after 5-10 minutes of high potassium (75 mM) stimulation in the presence of HRP, SNAP-25 labeling appeared, additionally, on HRP-filled early endosomes. After a longer (20-30 minutes) HRP incubation, most of the later stage endosomes and lysosomes were loaded with HRP but they were negative for SNAP-25. These results suggest that SNAP-25 is sorted out of these late endosomal compartments, and that the bulk of the SNAP-25 protein is probably recycled back to the axolemma from the early endosomes. In contrast, in those samples which were incubated with HRP for longer periods, there were still some SNAP-25-positive vesicular structures which were HRP-negative. These structures most likely represent anterograde vesicles that carry newly synthesized SNAP-25 from the soma to the axolemma by axonal transport. SNAP-25 appears to be sorted at the Golgi complex to reach the axolemma specifically. Its widespread distribution all along the axolemma does not support the view of SNAP-25 as a t-SNARE limited for synaptic exocytosis.
