Interaction between bioelectrical processes in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus was investigated on three Macaca mulatta performing a task of delayed spatial choice. It was found that the processes of short-term spatial memory are reflected in certain patterns of reciprocal correlations between EEG of the given structures. Different patterns correspond to tasks of different nature. The data obtained corroborate the hypothesis that the functional significance of brain structures may change instantaneously in the course of mnestic activity, depending on regulation requirements.
