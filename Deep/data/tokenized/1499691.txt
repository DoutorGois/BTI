In Alzheimer's disease, a characteristic neurochemical abnormality is the loss of cholinergic enzymes in the neocortex, reflecting the degeneration of basal forebrain neurons responsible for cholinergic innervation of the neocortex. It is hypothesized that basal forebrain neuronal degeneration results from a reduction in the level of trophic factors synthesized by neurons in the target regions of cholinergic projections. Data from a large number of animal lesioning studies tend to support this theory; however, most of these lesions also induce widespread, nonspecific injury responses in the CNS. To directly test the dependence of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons on target-derived neurotrophic support, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with moderate doses of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) on Gestational Days 14 and 15. Extensive morphometric analysis of offspring reveals that the prenatal administration of MAM during this period of neurogenesis results in the ablation of 40-70% of cortical neurons, without significant effects on the hippocampus or the genesis of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Examination of MAM-treated animals at several ages reveals no significant differences in neuronal density of cholinergic neurons as compared to controls. Extensive analysis of animal brains at several time points has failed to reveal any evidence of classical injury responses which might be responsible for preservation of basal forebrain neurons. These results contradict the theory that mature basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are critically dependent on the availability of target-derived neurotrophic factors and are therefore unlikely to be the major etiological factor in basal forebrain neuronal degeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.
