OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction on astrocytes after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. METHOD: Cerebral ischemia model in gerbils was produced by ligating bilateral common carotid artery. The dynamic expressin of GFAP were determined by immunochemistry after cerebyal ischemia for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 24 hours and 48 hours. RESULT: GFAP positive reactions reached a peak after cerebral ischemia for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 24 hours. Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction decreased the expression. GFAP positive reactions decreased after cerebral ischemia for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 48 hours, Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction increased the expression. CONCLUSION: The regulation of Bu Yang Huan Wu Decoction on astrocytes after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion may be related to repairing process after cerebral ischemia.
