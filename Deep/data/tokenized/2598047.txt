Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) facilitates long-term potentiation (LTP), a model of memory, and increases its substrate protein F1 (aka GAP43) phosphorylation in direct relation to synaptic enhancement. Unsaturated fatty acids (c-FAs) which activate purified PKC, when injected into hippocampus, enhance LTP. To determine if dietary c-FAs could alter memory itself as well as brain PKC substrate (F1) metabolism, rats were maintained for 10 weeks on fatty acid diets enriched in mono-unsaturated oleic acid (OA; 20% olive oil, w/w), or a mono- and di-unsaturated mixture of oleate/linoleate (O/L; 20% corn oil), or a saturated fatty acid diet of laurate/myristate (L/M; 20% hydrogenated coconut oil). The O/L diet group was superior to the OA and L/M groups in spatial memory performance after the first two weeks of acquisition and in later achievement of criterion performance. The O/L diet had a significantly higher hippocampal protein F1 in vitro phosphorylation than in both the OA and L/M in trained and non-trained animals. Significantly, animals that made fewer errors showed higher F1 phosphorylation (r = -0.70). Diet both increases brain PKC substrate phosphorylation and enhances maze learning, confirming the feasibility of enhancing learning and memory by dietary regimens derived from basic neurochemical studies of synaptic plasticity.
