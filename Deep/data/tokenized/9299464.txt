While analyzing active genes in the neonatal mouse hippocampus, we observed several novel genes that were abundantly expressed in this tissue. We report here cloning and sequencing of one of these transcripts, HiAT1 (Hippocampus Abundant Gene Transcript 1). The mRNA was 2.7 Kb in length, and the deduced amino acid sequence consisted of 490 amino acids with characteristics typical of members of the sugar transporter family. However, its overall sequence homology to known transporter cDNAs was only about 30%, suggesting strongly that it represents a novel sugar transporter gene. Northern hybridization analyses showed this transcript is detected in adult and embryonic brains, as well as in other tissues.
