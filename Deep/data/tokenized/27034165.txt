Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are widely expressed throughout the nervous system whereas their functions remain largely unclear. Here we investigated the effects of TRPC1 deletion on spatial memory ability of mice and the potential intervention by environmental enrichment (EE). Significant spatial memory impairment assessed by conditional fearing test, Y maze test and step-down test in TRPC1 knockout mice was revealed. The behavioral abnormality were attenuated by the treatment of EE. Proteomic analysis by two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) revealed that TRPC1 deletion caused differential expression of a total of 10 proteins (8 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated) in hippocampus. EE treatment resulted in differential expression of a total of 22 proteins (2 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated) in hippocampus of TRPC1 knockout mice. Among these differentially expressed proteins, the expression of alpha-internexin and glia maturation factor beta (GMF-beta), two proteins shown to impair memory, were significantly down-regulated in hippocampus of TRPC1 knockout mice by EE treatment. Taken together, these data suggested that TRPC1 regulated directly or indirectly the expression of multiple proteins, which may be crucial for the maintenance of memory ability, and that EE treatment modulated spatial memory impairment caused by TRPC1 depletion and the mechanisms may involve the modulation of EE on the expression of those dys-regulated proteins such as alpha-internexin and GMF-beta in hippocampus.
