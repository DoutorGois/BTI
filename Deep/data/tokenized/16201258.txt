To explore the mechanism of epilepsy induced by IL-1beta and IL-6, the changes of glutamic acid (Glu) and GABA immunoreaction in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats with seizure induced by IL-1beta or IL-6 were studied. Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group (intracerebroventricular injection (icv) of NS), IL-1beta group (icv injection of IL-1beta) and IL-6 group (i. c. v. injection of IL-6). 120 min after the icv injection of reagents of IL-1beta or IL-6, behavioral changes were observed and Glu and GABA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus were examined by means of immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that no seizure developed in the control group, while moderate seizure was observed in IL-1beta group and IL-6 group. Compared with the controls, the immunoreaction of Glu was significantly increased, while GABA was obviously decreased in IL-1beta group and IL-6 group after 120 min. Our study suggested that the IL-1beta and II-6 might promote and induce epilepsy by increasing Glu and decreasing GABA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
