In this issue of Neuron, Hardcastle et al. (2015) show that the spatial firing patterns of grid cells accumulate error, drifting coherently, until reset by encounters with environmental boundaries. These results reveal important aspects of the neural dynamics of self-localization from self-motion and environmental information.
