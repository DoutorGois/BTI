Calcium and calcium-calmodulin dependent phosphorylation of several protein bands was found altered in synaptosomal membranes prepared from ethanol treated rats. The ethanol induced effect on Ca++ and Ca++-calmodulin phosphorylation presented regional differences. In particular 32P incorporation was lower in the striatum and cerebellum, higher in the hippocampus and unmodified in the cortex. Part of the phosphorylated bands had an apparent molecular weight similar to that of the phosphoproteins involved in neurotransmission. These results extend previous observations indicating that calcium movement control is modified during chronic ethanol consumption and suggest that ethanol may interfere at various steps in the calcium-promoted events.
