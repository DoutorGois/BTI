Specific cytosolic binding for synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone was studied in several brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex) of immature (3-week) and mature (26-week) male rats, intact and adrenalectomized. A significant regional difference was observed in the concentration of in vitro [3H] dexamethasone binding in the brain of adrenalectomized rats at both ages, with the highest levels in the hippocampus. A marked decrease in specific binding was observed in all brain regions of adrenalectomized mature rats as compared to immature. The dexamethasone binding was significantly lower in all brain regions of normal intact animals as compared to adrenalectomized rats in both ages.
