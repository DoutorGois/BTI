Electrical stimulation of fibers in the stratum radiatum causes an excitatory postsynaptic potential in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus. Other excitatory inputs to or direct depolarization of these CA1 neurons during stimulation of the stratum radiatum caused a subsequent increase in the excitatory postsynaptic potential. This enhancement was characterized as a brief potentiation (2 to 3 minutes, similar to posttetanic potentiation) and a long-term potentiation (presumed to be involved in learning and memory). These potentiations are probably induced by an interaction of the postsynaptic cell or other presynaptic terminals with the test presynaptic terminals.
