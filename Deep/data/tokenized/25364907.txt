We recently discovered that the antidepressant sertraline is an effective inhibitor of hippocampus presynaptic Na+ channel permeability in vitro and of tonic-clonic seizures in animals in vivo. Several studies indicate that the pro-inflammatory cytokines in the central nervous system are increased in epilepsy and depression. On the other hand inhibition of Na+ channels has been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglia. Therefore, the possibility that sertraline could overcome the rise in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression induced by seizures has been investigated. For this purpose, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR in the hippocampus of rats administered once, or for seven consecutive days with sertraline at a low dose (0.75 mg/kg). The effect of sertraline at doses within the range of 0.75 to 25 mg/kg on the increase in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression accompanying generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines expression induced by lipopolysaccharide was also investigated. We found that under basal conditions, a single 0.75 mg/kg sertraline dose decreased IL-1beta mRNA expression, and also TNF-alpha expression after repeated doses. The increase in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha expression induced by the convulsive agents and by the inoculation of lipopolysaccharide in the hippocampus was markedly reduced by sertraline also. Present results indicate that a reduction of brain inflammatory processes may contribute to the anti-seizure sertraline action, and that sertraline can be safely and successfully used at low doses to treat depression in epileptic patients.
