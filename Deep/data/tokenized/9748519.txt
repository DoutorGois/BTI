Localization of fibroblast growth receptor (FGFR)-1 immunoreactivity was investigated immunochemically in postmortem brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched control cases using a rabbit polyclonal antibody and a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for FGFR-1. In control cases, FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was identified in astrocytes in white matter and in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. In AD cases, the immunoreactivity in reactive astrocytes surrounding senile plaques was increased. The pattern of FGFR-1 immunoreactivity was confirmed in selected cases by in situ hybridization for FGFR-1 mRNA. Immunoreactivity using a monoclonal antibody demonstrated a similar distribution pattern. The localization of FGFR-1 is consistent with previous reports on the involvement of FGF-1 and FGF-2 in AD.
