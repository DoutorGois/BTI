The postsynaptic density is an electron dense meshwork composed of a variety of molecules facilitating neuronal signal transmission. ProSAP2/Shank3 represents a crucial player at postsynaptic sites, assembling large multimeric platforms and anchoring numerous other molecules, thereby linking the functional synapse with the cytoskeleton. ProSAP2/Shank3 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including autism spectrum disorders. KvBeta2 (Kvbeta2) on the other hand serves as a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kvbeta2 is located at various sites in the neuron including the axon (binding to Kv1.2), the dendrites (binding to Kv4.2) and the synapse. Binding of Kvbeta2 to either Kv1.2 or Kv4 modulates not only the channel conformation but directs targeting of the channel protein complex to distinct loci within the cell. Thus an interaction between ProSAP2 and Kvbeta2 could have important roles at diverse cellular compartments and moreover during maturation stages. We report here on the direct protein-protein interaction of the postsynaptic density anchoring molecule ProSAP2 and the potassium channel subunit Kvbeta2, initially identified in a yeast-two-hybrid-screen. Furthermore, we characterize this interaction at synapses using primary hippocampal neurons in vitro.
