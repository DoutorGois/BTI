Mutations in gene encoding presenilin 1 (PS1) are responsible for the majority of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) cases. We studied PS1 localization in HEK293 cells and in primary neurons obtained from rat cortex and hippocampus. We first demonstrated that PS1-CTF, but neither PS1-FL nor PS1-NTF, is released into the medium as a soluble and membrane-associated form. After induction of apoptosis with staurosporine (Sts), we observed a dramatic increase in the level of PS1-CTF in the medium, both in HEK293 and in primary neurons. Immunocytochemical analysis suggested that the release of PS1-CTF might occur via membrane shedding. Abeta(1-42) treatment reduced PS1-CTF extracellular levels. This decrease was strongly associated to an impaired secretion of sAPP fragments, thus suggesting a role of PS1-CTF in the control of trafficking and generation of APP fragments.
