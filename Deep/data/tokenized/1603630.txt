The sp act of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase has been measured in individual regions of adult rat brain to see if site-specific differences in enzyme activity can aid in the understanding of brain abnormalities observed in well-treated galactosemic patients. The sp act in the cerebellum, brain stem, and midbrain were higher than in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Activity in the cerebellum was 2-fold greater than that found in the cortex. Steady state levels of mRNA of the enzyme in the cerebellum were twice that of the cortex corresponding to the ratio of enzyme sp act in the two regions. Measurement of the kinetic parameters in tissue from the cerebellum and cortex revealed that the regional specificity in enzyme activity observed in the brain represents differences in the Vmax. Inhibition of the enzyme by uridine and uridine triphosphate was essentially the same for all regions and was not influenced by the 2-fold differences observed in the levels of enzyme. Inhibition by uridine was significantly greater than that for uridine triphosphate.
