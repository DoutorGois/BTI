Using a modified version of a phenomenological model for the dynamics of synaptic plasticity, we examine some recent experiments of Wu et al. [(2001) J Physiol 533:745-755]. We show that the model is quantitatively consistent with their experimental protocols producing long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in slice preparations of rat hippocampus. We also predict the outcome of similar experiments using different frequencies and depolarization levels than reported in their results.
