Glucose transport into nonneuronal brain cells uses differently glycosylated forms of the glucose transport protein, GLUT1. Microvascular GLUT1 is readily seen on immunocytochemistry, although its parenchymal localization has been difficult. Following ischemia, GLUT1 mRNA increases, but whether GLUT1 protein also changes is uncertain. Therefore, we examined the immunocytochemical distribution of GLUT1 in normal rat brain and after transient global forebrain ischemia. A novel immunocytochemical finding was peptide-inhibitable GLUT1 immunoreactive staining in parenchyma as well as in cerebral microvessels. In nonischemic rats, parenchymal GLUT1 staining co-localizes with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in perivascular foot processes of astrocytes. By 24 h after ischemia, both microvascular and nonmicrovascular GLUT1 immunoreactivity increased widely, persisting at 4 days postischemia. Vascularity within sections of brain similarly increased after ischemia. Increased parenchymal GLUT1 expression was paralleled by staining for GFAP, suggesting that nonvascular GLUT1 overexpression may occur in reactive astrocytes. A final observation was a rapid expression of inducible heat shock protein (HSP)70 in hippocampus and cortex by 24 h after ischemia. We conclude that GLUT1 is normally immunocytochemically detectable in cerebral microvessels and parenchyma and that parenchymal expression occurs in some astroglia. After global cerebral ischemia, GLUT1 overexpression occurs rapidly and widely in microvessels and parenchyma; its overexpression may be related to an immediate early-gene form of response to cellular stress.
