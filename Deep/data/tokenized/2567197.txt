An ultra-filtration method for separating free Zn from its bound form with macromolecules was used to study the effect of excitatory amino acids on dissociation of Zn in the soluble fraction of rat hippocampus. L-Glutamate, L-aspartate and L-cysteic acid but not D-glutamate significantly increased the dissociated Zn at the concentration of 100 microM. 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate did not inhibit the effect of L-glutamate. Likewise, the stimulatory effect of N-methyl-DL-aspartate and quisqualate was observed at the concentration range between 1 and 100 microM. The effect of kainate was much less potent. Taurine and GABA had no stimulatory effect on the dissociation of Zn.
