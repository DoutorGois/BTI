During daily Food Restriction (FR), obese Neotomodon alstoni mice present decreased Food Anticipatory Activity (FAA) compared to lean mice. Here, we investigated whether FOS expression in hypothalamic nuclei involved in food synchronization and anticipation parallels decreased FAA during daily FR of obese N. alstoni. Locomotor activity of lean and obese mice in ad libitum feeding conditions was monitored for at least two weeks. Then, a gradual restriction of food access was followed to establish a 5h period of daily food access. FR was maintained during at least two weeks before sacrifice of mice at the starting point of the feeding period. Obese mice subjected to FR displayed an overall reduction of FOS-positive (FOS+) hypothalamic neurons, while lean mice in a similar protocol exhibited an increase in FOS+ neurons within the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei. These results are consistent with decreased FAA displayed by obese mice in comparison to lean mice. Furthermore, limbic system areas of lean mice, such as the cingulate cortex and the hippocampus, showed an increase in FOS during FR, while no responses were observed in obese mice. The daily food intake of obese mice was severely reduced during FR, compared to the ad libitum condition, whereas food intake in lean mice was not affected by FR. Current data suggests that decreased hypothalamic and limbic neuronal activation may contribute to the reduction of FAA in obese N. alstoni mice.
