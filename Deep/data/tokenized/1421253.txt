The effect of parathyroid hormone intraperitoneal injection at different stages of experimental uremia induced by subtotal nephrectomy on ultrastructural morphofunctional characteristics of hippocampus Ca3 field axospinal synapses was studied. A conclusion is made that the decrease of synaptic activity in the hippocampus field due to redistribution of calcium ions between spine cytoplasm and spine apparatus may take place after PTH injection and during uremia development.
