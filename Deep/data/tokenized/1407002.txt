The effects of the high affinity sigma (sigma) ligands 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine (DTG), (+)N-cyclopropylmethyl-N-methyl-1,4-diphenyl-1- ethyl-but-3-en-1-yl-amine hydrochloride (JO-1784), (+)3-[3-hydroxyphenyl]-N-(1-propyl)piperidine hydrochloride [(+)3-PPP] and haloperidol were studied on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline (NA) from preloaded hippocampal slices made from Sprague-Dawley rats. The [3H]NA release was evoked once by a 4 min exposure to NMDA, 40 min after the beginning of superfusion with a Mg+(+)-free Krebs' solution. In the absence of any drug, NMDA evoked a concentration-dependent [3H]NA release. Mg++ and EGTA abolished the [3H]NA release induced by NMDA. JO-1784 and (+)3-PPP potentiated in a concentration-dependent manner NMDA-induced [3H]NA release, without affecting the basal outflow. DTG concentration-dependently inhibited the overflow of [3H]NA evoked by NMDA, without affecting the basal efflux. Haloperidol, which did not modify NMDA-evoked [3H]NA release by itself, completely prevented the effects of JO-1784, (+)3-PPP and DTG. In contrast, spiperone, also a potent dopamine receptor antagonist but with low affinity for sigma binding sites, failed to prevent the potentiation of NMDA-evoked release of [3H]NA by JO-1784 and (+)3-PPP. The possible involvement of Gi/o proteins in the modulation by sigma ligands of NMDA-evoked [3H]NA release in the rat hippocampus was also investigated. To this end, Gi/o proteins were inactivated with pertussis toxin (PTX), injected locally 3 to 11 days prior to the experiment or with in vitro preincubation with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 30 min prior the experiment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
