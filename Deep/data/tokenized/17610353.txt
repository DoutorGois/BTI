Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health problem globally. Presently, there is no way to restore cognitive deficits caused by TBI. In this study, we seek to evaluate the effect of statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin) on the spatial learning and neurogenesis in rats subjected to controlled cortical impact. Rats were treated with atorvastatin and simvastatin 1 day after TBI and daily for 14 days. Morris water maze tests were performed during weeks 2 and 5 after TBI. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 1 day after TBI and daily for 14 days. Brain tissue was processed for immunohistochemical staining to identify newly generated cells and vessels. Our data show that (1) treatment of TBI with statins improves spatial learning on days 31-35 after onset of TBI; (2) in the non-neurogenic region of the hippocampal CA3 region, statin treatment reduces the neuronal loss after TBI, demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of statins; (3) in the neurogenic region of the dentate gyrus, treatment of TBI with statins enhances neurogenesis; (4) statin treatment augments TBI-induced angiogenesis; and (5) treatment with simvastatin at the same dose provides a therapeutic effect superior to treatment with atorvastatin. These results suggest that statins may be candidates for treatment of TBI.
