During the perinatal period, the brain undergoes substantial structural changes, synaptic rearrangements, and development of neuronal circuits which ultimately determine brain function and behavior. Environmental factors-such as exposure to adverse experiences-have major impact on brain function and structure during this sensitive period. These alterations can be long-lasting, and have been implicated in psychopathology such as cognitive decline and emotional dysfunction. Here we briefly review how early postnatal adversity determines structure and function of the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) areas, which are crucial for proper cognitive and emotional function.
