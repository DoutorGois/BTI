In situ hybridization procedures that have been used successfully for the localization of somatostatin and cholecystokinin mRNAs in neurons on cryostat sections of rat brain, were tested for applicability to vibratome sections of rat and guinea pig brain. Somatostatin and cholecystokinin mRNAs were localized to neurons in 30 microns thick vibratome sections of brain from both species by use of 32P labelled oligodeoxyribonucleotide (oligomer) probes. Somatostatin mRNAs was localized to neurons in the periventricular region of the preoptic area of rat, and guinea pig brain. Cholecystokinin mRNAs were localized to neurons of rat hippocampus. Hybridization signal, background and resolution achieved with vibratome sections were comparable to those obtained with the more commonly used cryostate sections.
