Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) brain levels and turnover rate were examined in the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER: zi/zi, tm/tm), a double mutant rat obtained by mating tremor heterozygotes (tm/+) with zitter homozygotes associated with epileptic seizures composed of spontaneously occurring tonic convulsion and absence-like seizure. DA and NE levels were also determined in age-matched male zitter, tremor and Kyo: Wistar rats. DA levels in caudate nucleus were significantly lower in adult age (10-12 weeks) SER, which showed epileptic seizures, and zitter rats than in adult Kyo: Wistar and tremor rats. DA levels in other areas such as thalamus-hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons medulla were not different among SER, zitter, tremor, and Kyo: Wistar rats at age 10-12 weeks. Except in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, there were no differences in brain DA levels between young seizure-free SER (age 5 weeks) and young Kyo: Wistar rats. Furthermore, the turnover rate of DA was significantly lower in caudate nucleus of adult SER than of Kyo: Wistar rat, whereas in pons-medulla there was no difference between the two strains. In contrast, NE levels in the thalamus-hypothalamus, midbrain, cerebellum and pons-medulla were higher in SER and zitter rats at age 10-12 weeks than in age-matched tremor and Kyo: Wistar rats. Higher NE levels were also observed in midbrain, cerebellum, and pons-medulla of young SER as compared with young Kyo: Wistar rats. Turnover rates of NE were significantly lower in pons-medulla and cerebellum of the adult SER than in those of Kyo: Wistar rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
