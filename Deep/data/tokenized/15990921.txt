In the central nervous system (CNS) generation of new neurons continues throughout adulthood, when it is limited to the olfactory bulb and hippocampus. The knowledge regarding the function of newly-generated neurons remains limited and is vigorously investigated using diverse approaches. Among these are genetically modified mice, most of them of knock-out type (KO). Results from 23 diverse KO mouse models demonstrate the importance of particular proteins (growth factors, nitric oxide synthases, receptors, cyclins/cyclin-associated proteins, transcription factors, etc.) in adult neurogenesis (ANGE) as well as separate it from developmental neurogenesis. These results bring us closer to revealing the function of newly generated neurons in adult brains.
