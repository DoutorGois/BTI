Convincing evidence indicates that apoptosis contributes to the unfavorable prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a significant cause of morbidity and case fatality throughout the world. Gelsolin (GSN) is a Ca(2+)-dependent actin filament severing, capping, and nucleating protein, as well as multifunctional regulator of cell structure and metabolism, including apoptosis. In the present study, we intended to investigate the expression pattern and cell distribution of GSN in rat brain after experimental SAH. GSN expression was examined in sham group and at 3, 6, 12 h, day 1 (1 day), 2, 3, 5, and 7 days after SAH by Western blot analysis as well as real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were performed to detect the localization of GSN. The level of GSN protein expression was significantly decreased in SAH group and reached a bottoming point on 1 day after SAH. GSN mRNA level was significantly decreased in SAH groups in comparison with the sham group, and reached a minimum value at 12 h after SAH. Immunohistochemistry showed that GSN was constitutively and obviously expressed in the cortex of the normal rat brain and significantly decreased in the rat cortex after SAH. In addition, immunofluorescence results revealed that GSN expression could be found in both neurons and microglias, as well as in glialfibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. The decreased expression of GSN could mainly be found in neurons and astrocytes as well, and GSN-positive microglias showed different cell morphological characteristics. Interestingly, the protein and gene levels of GSN seemed to be constant in the rat hippocampus of sham and SAH groups. These findings suggested a potential role of GSN in the pathophysiology of the brain at the early stage of SAH.
