The adrenalectomy in rats followed by a single hydrocortisone administration had no influence on the glutamate decarboxylase activity and maximum rate of [3H] GABA uptake by synaptosomes of hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebral hemispheres. Km of [3H] GABA uptake by synaptosomes in the above mentioned brain regions under adrenalectomy decreases sharply; hydrocortisone administration increases Km of mediator uptake by hippocampus synaptosomes, and hydrocortisone in vitro increases Km of [3H] GABA uptake by hypothalamus synaptosomes.
