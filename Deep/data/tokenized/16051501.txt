The test-retest reliability of activation patterns elicited by encoding and recognition of word-pair associates within the whole brain and a predefined medial temporal region of interest (ROI) was investigated. Twenty healthy right-handed subjects were studied within two sessions, either on the same day or 210-308 days later. Three quantitative measures of reliability were calculated for the contrasts encoding and recognition versus a control condition within the ROI and also for the whole brain: A group correlational analysis between the lateralization indices of the first and second session, correlations of the individual SPM(t) maps of the first and the second run, and overlap ratios between both sessions. For the ROI, correlational analysis of lateralization indices during both encoding trials was significant. Eighty percent of the individual positive correlation coefficients of SPM(t) maps during encoding, and 75% during recognition reached significance. The mean percentage of overlapping voxels was 18% during encoding and 19% during recognition. The reproducibility measures evaluated for the whole brain demonstrated significantly higher values compared to the ROI. For the group that stayed inside the scanner, better whole brain test-retest reliability was observed, and no influence of the memory process (encoding or recognition) on reproducibility was found.
