Estrogens have been implicated as possible therapeutic agents for improving cognition in postmenopausal women and have been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the utility of Premarin (Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Markham, ON, Canada), a conjugated equine estrogen and the most commonly prescribed hormone therapy, has recently been questioned. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Premarin at 2 different doses (10 or 20 mug) on hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory, hippocampal neurogenesis, and new neuronal activation using a rodent model of surgical menopause. Rats were treated daily with subcutaneous injections of Premarin and trained on the spatial working/reference memory version of the radial arm maze. Premarin impaired spatial reference and working learning and memory, increased hippocampal neurogenesis, but either decreased or increased activation of new neurons in response to memory retrieval as indexed by the expression of the immediate early gene product zif268, depending on the maturity of cells examined. This activation of new neurons was related to impaired performance in Premarin-treated but not control-treated female rats. These results indicate that Premarin may be impairing hippocampus-dependent learning and memory by negatively altering the neurogenic environment in the dentate gyrus thus disrupting normal activity of new neurons.
