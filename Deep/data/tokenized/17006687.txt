Rats with medial prefrontal cortex or sham lesions were trained on a visual discrimination task designed for the eight-arm radial maze. After reaching asymptotic performance on this task, both groups were divided into sub-groups that would experience reversal learning in the same or different context from original training. The results showed that both groups reversed in the different context had accelerated learning compared to the groups reversed in the same context. Reversal learning in rats with medial prefrontal cortex damage was faster than sham animals in the same context. These and other results from a transfer test suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex participates in the behavioral effects of a context-specific inhibitory association acquired during visual discrimination learning.
