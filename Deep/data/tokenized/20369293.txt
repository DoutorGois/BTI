Early life events lead to behavioral and neurochemical changes in adulthood. The aim of this study is to verify the effects of neonatal handling on spatial memory, nitric oxide (NO) production, antioxidant enzymatic activities and DNA breaks in the hippocampus of male and female adult rats. Litters of rats were non-handled or handled (10 min/day, days 1-10 after birth). In adulthood they were subjected to a Morris water maze or used for biochemical evaluations. Female handled rats showed impairment in spatial learning. They also showed decreased NO production, while no effects were observed in these parameters in male rats. No effects were observed on the number of hippocampal NADPH diaphorase positive cells. In the Comet Assay, male handled rats showed increased DNA breaks index when compared to non-handled ones. We conclude that neonatal handling impairs learning performance in a sex-specific manner, what may be related to NO decreased levels.
