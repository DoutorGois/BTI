Here, we show that oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) causes increased small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1 and SUMO-2/3 conjugation to substrate proteins in cultured hippocampal neurones. Surprisingly, the SUMO protease SENP-1, which removes SUMO from conjugated proteins, was also increased by OGD, suggesting that the neuronal response to OGD involves a complex interplay between SUMOylation and deSUMOylation. Importantly, decreasing global SUMOylation in cultured hippocampal neurones by overexpression of the catalytic domain of SENP-1 increased neuronal vulnerability to OGD-induced cell death. Taken together, these results suggest a neuroprotective role for neuronal SUMOylation after OGD.
