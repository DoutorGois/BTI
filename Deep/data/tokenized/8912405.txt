The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue, RX77368, on performance of a working memory test, using a delayed non-matching to position (DNMTP) procedure, in (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-induced septal-hippocampal lesioned rats. Following a post-surgery recovery period, pretrained rats were tested once daily on DNMTP, 30 min post-administration of RX77368 (1.0 mg kg-1, i.p.) or saline. AMPA-induced lesions significantly reduced percent correct responses during the second week of testing. Comparison of percent correct responses between days 1 and 13 of testing showed that sham rats significantly improved DNMTP performance, whereas lesioned rats did not. RX77368 significantly reduced general locomotor activity in sham rats in activity boxes, but did not disrupt non-mnemonic measures, such as locomotion and motivation, in the DNMTP test. RX77368 increased percent correct responses in AMPA-lesioned rats on days 8-10 and 11-13. There was also a significant improvement in percent correct responses achieved between day 1 and 13 in RX77368-treated lesioned and sham rats. These results showed that: (i) septal-hippocampal lesioned rats did not improve over the testing period; and (ii) on test days when a significant impairment was present, RX77368 partially improved DNMTP performance.
