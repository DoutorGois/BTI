In the hippocampi of individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy, cells in CA1, CA3, and the dentate hilus are often gone, but dentate granule cells and CA2 are relatively spared. Several animal models have been developed which mimic portions of this damage. In the present work, combined intraventricular kainate and forebrain ischemia produced a lesion most like that observed clinically; the dentate granule cells and a resistant cluster of pyramidal cells, which received mossy fiber input, were the only principle neurons remaining. This preparation may be valuable both in determining the nature of cells that survive and in understanding the consequences of such damage.
