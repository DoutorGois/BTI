In vivo extracellular acetylcholine release from brain hemispheric areas of 2-, 9-, and 18-month-old rats was measured by intracerebral microdialysis coupled with a radioenzymatic assay. Dialysis tubing was inserted transversally through both striata, frontal cortices and dorsal hippocampi 24 hours before the experiments. In the 2-month-old rats, the net average acetylcholine output, corrected for recovery and expressed in fmoles/min/single striatum, cortex and hippocampus, was 902.4 +/- 67, 303.9 +/- 14 and 334 +/- 32, respectively. In 18-month-old rats acetylcholine output was 53, 35 and 37% lower in striatum, cortex and hippocampus, respectively, than in young rats. The release from the striatum in the 9-month-old was intermediate between those of the 2- and 18-month-old rats. The intracerebroventricular injection of hemicholinium-3 caused a marked decrease in acetylcholine release from the striata of 2- and 18-month-old rats. If the decrease with hemicholinium was expressed as percent of the basal release there was no age-related difference between the young and old rats, indicating that the differences observed were due to the lower basal release found in the old rats. The possibility that the deficit in basal acetylcholine release with age may depend on a reduction of acetylcholine synthesis is discussed.
