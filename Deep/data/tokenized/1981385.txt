alpha 2-Adrenoceptors were localized in the chick brain by 'in vitro' receptor autoradiography using [3H]UK 14304 as a ligand. High or very high densities of binding sites were found in the hyperstriatum, tuberculum olfactorium, hypothalamic nuclei, tectum opticum and some medullary nuclei. Comparatively, intermediate densities were observed over the thalamic nuclei and locus ceruleus, among others. Low densities of alpha 2-adrenoceptors were detected in the paleostriatum, hippocampus and cerebellum. Our data indicate that alpha 2-adrenoceptors in the chick brain present similar properties and homologous anatomical distribution to those reported in mammalian brain.
