NMDA receptor activation leads to clathrin-dependent endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Although this process controls long-term depression (LTD) induction in the hippocampus, how it is regulated by neuronal activities is not completely clear. Here, we show that Ca(2)(+) influx through the NMDA receptor activates calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1 to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinasegamma661 (PIP5Kgamma661), the major phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2))-producing enzyme in the brain. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis revealed that the dephosphorylated PIP5Kgamma661 became associated with the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-2 at postsynapses in situ. NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis and low-frequency stimulation-induced LTD were completely blocked by inhibiting the association between dephosphorylated PIP5Kgamma661 and AP-2 and by overexpression of a kinase-dead PIP5Kgamma661 mutant in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, knockdown of PIP5Kgamma661 inhibited the NMDA-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis. Therefore, NMDA receptor activation controls AMPA receptor endocytosis during hippocampal LTD by regulating PIP5Kgamma661 activity at postsynapses.
