Evoked potentials, represented by population spikes and slow waves, have been recorded from the subiculum, along its whole dorso-ventral extent, following postsynaptic activation and discharge of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. These potentials can be associated with synaptic excitatory effects generated on radially oriented neurons by hippocampal impulses reaching the subiculum at any dorso-ventral level, according to a segmental organization.
