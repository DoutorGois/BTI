We investigated the changes of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) in the rat hippocampus after 10 min of cerebral ischemia induced by 4-vessel occlusion. The rats were allowed to survive for 4 h, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after ischemia. The distribution of SODs were determined by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against rat CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD. CA1 pyramidal neurons and granule cells of the dentate gyrus showed intense CuZn-SOD immunoreactivity, whereas CA3 and CA4 neurons showed weaker immunostaining than CA1 neurons in normal animals. The immunoreactivity was reduced by 4 h after ischemia in CA1, CA3, and CA4 neurons when no histological damage was observed. Mn-SOD immunostaining revealed more intense immunoreactivity in CA3 pyramidal neurons than in CA1 neurons in normal animals. Interneurons in the CA1 and CA3 regions and the dentate hilus also showed high Mn-SOD immunostaining. Although CA1 neurons lost Mn-SOD immunoreactivity by 1 day after ischemia, CA3 neurons and interneurons retained the immunoreactivity and preserved intact cell contour after ischemia. In addition, reactive glial cells, which were differentiated by immunocytochemical staining against glial fibrillary acidic protein for reactive astrocytes and histochemical staining for reactive microglial cells, were intensely stained for CuZn-SOD and Mn-SOD after ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
