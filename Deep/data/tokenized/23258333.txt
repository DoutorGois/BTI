The present study was to record and separate the voltage-gated calcium channel currents (VGCCs) in primary cultured hippocampal neurons. An improved method is described for efficient and stable recording of VGCCs from primary cultured hippocampal neurons. The procedure allows the obtained hippocampal neurons overcome the defects from acutely isolated hippocampal neurons and currents do not rundown apparently after 20 min of membrane rupture. Using whole-cell configurations of patch clamp technique, it is shown that the method does not damage the neuron membrane electrical properties, and successfully records a variety of VGCCs components in hippocampal neurons (such as L, N, P/Q, T, etc.).
