The heme oxygenase isozymes, HO-1 and HO-2, oxidatively cleave the heme molecule to produce biliverdin and the gaseous messenger, CO. The cleavage results in the release of iron, a regulator of transferrin, ferritin, and nitric oxide (NO) synthase gene expression. Biliverdin reductase (BVR) then catalyzes the reduction of biliverdin, generating the potent intracellular antioxidant, bilirubin. We report an age-related decrease in HO-1 and HO-2 expression present in select brain regions including the hippocampus and the substantia nigra, that are involved in the high order cognitive processes of learning and memory. The age-related loss of monoxide-producing potential in select regions of the brain was not specific to the HO system but was also observed in neuronal NO-generating system. Furthermore, compared to 2-month old rats, the ability of aged brain tissue to respond to hypoxic/hyperthermia was compromised at both the protein and the transcription levels as judged by attenuated induction of HO-1 immunoreactive protein and its 1.8 Kb transcript. Neotrofin (AIT), a cognitive-enhancing and neuroprotective drug, caused a robust increase in HO-1 immunoreactive protein in select neuronal regions and increased the expression of HO-2 transcripts. The potential interplay between regulation of HO-2 gene expression and the serum levels of the adrenal steroids is discussed. We suggest the search for therapeutic agents that reverse the decline and aberrant stress response of HO enzymes may lead to effective treatment regimens for age-associated neuronal deficits.
