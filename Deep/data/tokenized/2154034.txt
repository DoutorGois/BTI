2,3-Dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX) is an analog of the quinoxalinedione antagonists to the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate receptor. NBQX is a potent and selective inhibitor of binding to the quisqualate subtype of the glutamate receptor, with no activity at the NMDA and glycine sites. NBQX protects against global ischemia, even when administered 2 hours after an ischemic challenge.
