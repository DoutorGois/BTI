Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species generation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. In the present study, the neuroprotective effects of selegiline against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in hippocampus-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) were evaluated. NSCs isolated from neonatal Wistar rats were pretreated with different doses of selegiline for 48 h and then exposed to 125 microM H2O2 for 30 min. Using MTT and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the effects of selegiline on cell survival, apoptosis and the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and heat shock protein 4 (Hspa4) in pretreated stem cells were assessed compared with a control group lacking pretreatment. The results indicated that the viability of cells pretreated with 20 microM selegiline was significantly increased compared with the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, 20 microM selegiline increased the mRNA expression of Bcl-2 and Hspa4 (P<0.05 vs. control) and suppressed oxidative stress-induced cell death (apoptosis and necrosis; P<0.05 vs. control and 10 microM groups). From these findings, it was concluded that selegiline may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of neurological diseases mediated by oxidative stress.
