We investigated the mechanism(s) of action of two new putative antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), (S)-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (BIA 2-093) and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxyimino-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (BIA 2-024), by comparing their effects on the release of endogenous glutamate in hippocampal synaptosomes, with those of carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). The AEDs inhibited the release of glutamate evoked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) or veratridine in a concentration-dependent manner, being CBZ more potent than the other AEDs. Using conditions of stimulation (30 mM KCl), where Na(+) channels are inactivated, the AEDs did not inhibit either the Ca(2+)-dependent or -independent release of glutamate. The results indicate that BIA 2-093 and BIA 2-024 have sodium channel-blocking properties, but CBZ and OXC are more potent than the new AEDs. Moreover, the present data also indicate that Ca(2+) channels coupled to the exocytotic release of glutamate and the activity of the glutamate transporter were not affected by the AEDs.
