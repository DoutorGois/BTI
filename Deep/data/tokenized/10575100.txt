The phenomenon of ischemic tolerance has been closely associated with the expression of heat shock proteins but recently, stress tolerance not related to hsp72 has been reported. In the present study, we focused on ischemic tolerance induced by hypoxia and hyperthermia in neonatal rat brain and analyzed the expression of hsp72. In a neonatal rat model of hypoxic ischemia (H-I), preconditioning by whole-body hyperthermia or hypoxia was induced 24 h prior to the ischemia. Brain damage was histologically evaluated and the expressions of hsp72 were analyzed. Hyperthermic preconditioning at 41 degrees C for 15 min, as well as hypoxic preconditioning with 8% hypoxia for 3 h, had almost complete neuroprotective effects. However, we failed to detect the expression of hsp72 in any of preconditioning. Only the H-I insult itself induced hsp72 in the dorsal striatum and slightly in the thalamus and the hippocampus. Hyperthermic preconditioning has neuroprotective effects which are comparable to hypoxic preconditioning in immature brain. The expression of hsp72 is not likely necessary for the ischemic tolerance in immature brain.
