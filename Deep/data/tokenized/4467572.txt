Cell cultures from hippocampus of 16 and 17 days old embryonal rats were cultivated up to 4 weeks. After 24 hours in vitro on 18.4 percent of cells and after 5 days in vitro on 70 percent of cells processes could be recognized. These are neuroblasts. The cells reaggregated. Nerve fibers after 4 weeks in vitro are 200 to 300 mum long. Small and big neurons with 12 mum to 26 mum diameters of perikarya, bi- and multipolar neurons after 4 weeks in vitro were observed. In cultures and meningothel-monolayer developed. Maintenance and differentiation of cultures are possible only by sowing in at least 60,000 cells/ml medium. The advantage of cell culture opposite to organ culture exists in experiments with immediate selective influence.
