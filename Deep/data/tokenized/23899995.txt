Low prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle is associated with reduced sensorimotor gating found in schizophrenia. In rats with breeding-induced low PPI neuregulin (NRG1) methylation was significantly decreased in brain regions associated with this phenotype and with schizophrenia, i.e., the medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the ventral hippocampus, while methylation in the amygdala and dorsal hippocampus was less affected. The dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) promoter region showed negligible changes between groups. Rats with low PPI may be used to understand the reduced epigenetic regulation found in schizophrenia, and eventually lead to the development of novel therapies.
