As the result of chronic immobilization of rats, their EEG of the visual cortex and hippocampus showed an increased energetic capacity predominantly in the theta-frequency range, a lowered level of synchronization in response to light, reduced sleep duration due to the late falling asleep and waking at different stages. Their sleep became more superficial, the duration of its deeper stages (especially of the paradoxical sleep) decreased, the correlation between the sleep depth and muscular tone and heart-rate was disturbed. The rate of these disorders depended on individual characteristics of the animals nervous system.
