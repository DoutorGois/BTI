The evidence for the role of the amygdala in temporal lobe seizures is supported by this follow-up (2-20 years) of 100 patients who were treated surgically by excision of the antero-lateral temporal cortex, most or all of the amygdala and minimal resection of the hippocampus. The findings showed 53 patients seizure-free or with rare or occasional seizures, 10 patients with marked seizure reduction and 37 with moderate or less reduction of seizures. The results are the same as in another 100 patients where, in addition, half or more of the hippocampus was resected.
