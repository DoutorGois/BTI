PURPOSE: This study used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine metabolite abnormalities in the temporal and frontal lobe of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) of differing severity. METHODS: We investigated myoinositol in TLE by using short-echo MRS in 34 TLE patients [26 late onset (LO-TLE), eight hippocampal sclerosis (HS-TLE)], and 16 controls. Single-voxel short-echo (35 ms) MR spectra of temporal and frontal lobes were acquired at 1.5 T and analyzed by using LCModel. RESULTS: The temporal lobe ipsilateral to seizure origin in HS-TLE, but not LO-TLE, had reduced N-acetylaspartate (NA) and elevated myoinositol (MI; HS-TLE NA, 7.8 +/- 1.9 mM, control NA, 9.2 +/- 1.3 mM; p < 0.05; HS-TLE MI, 6.1 +/- 1.6 mM, control mI 4.9 +/- 0.8 mM, p< 0.05). Frontal lobe MI was low in both patient groups (LO-TLE, 4.3 +/- 0.8 mM; p < 0.05; HS-TLE, 3.6 +/-.05 mM; p < 0.001; controls, 4.8 +/- 0.5 mM). Ipsilateral frontal lobes had lower MI (3.8 +/- 0.7 mM; p < 0.01) than contralateral frontal lobes (4.3 +/- 0.8 mM; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MI changes may distinguish between the seizure focus, where MI is increased, and areas of seizure spread where MI is decreased.
