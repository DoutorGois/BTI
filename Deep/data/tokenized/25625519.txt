PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Neuroglobin (NGB) is a known neuroprotector and is up-regulated after ischaemia-hypoxia brain damage. However, no studies have investigated NGB levels after ischaemic pre-conditioning and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). METHODS AND PROCEDURES: This study subjected rats to different ischaemic pre-conditioning and MCAO regimens and assayed NGB levels in the hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus by immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: After 30 minutes of ischaemic pre-conditioning, the number of NGB-positive cells and NGB levels in the hippocampus, cortex and hypothalamus were increased with longer reperfusion times, peaked at 24-hours reperfusion and slightly decreased at 48-hours reperfusion. Similarly, the mRNA and protein expression levels of NGB were also up-regulated; they peaked at 24-hours reperfusion and slightly decreased at 48-hours reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: NGB may regulate neuroprotection against ischaemia and hypoxia-mediated brain damage after ischaemic pre-conditioning. The results provide additional evidence supporting the utility of ischaemic pre-conditioning and help elucidate its potential regulatory mechanism.
