The influence of aging (2, 6, 12, and 24 months) on hippocampal lipid composition and neurochemical markers (endogenous noradrenaline, serotonin levels, monoamine oxidase (MOA) activities) was studied in rats fed a control or an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-deficient diet. The n-3 PUFA deficiency reduced the 22:6 (n-3) level, compensated by the increase in 22:5 (n-6). However, the difference in 22:6 (n-3) content between control and deficient rats was less between 2 and 12 months and then became stable. There was an overall age-induced decrease in the major phospholipid classes phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) whereas the minor classes, phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylserine (PS), and sphingomyelin (SM), were greatly increased, regardless of diet. The n-3 PUFA deficiency induced a reduction in the PS level, concomitant with a higher level in MAO-B activity as compared to control rats at the age of 24 months. The age-related evolution of the MAO-B activity was parallel with that of noradrenaline levels in both dietary groups. The noradrenaline and serotonin levels were modified according to age but without effect of the n-3 PUFA deficiency. Results showed that the hippocampus sustained specific age-induced modifications in lipid composition and neurotransmission factors, often with a transition period between 6 and 12 months.
