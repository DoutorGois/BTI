NMDA receptors are glutamate-sensitive ion channel receptors that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission and are widely implicated in synaptic plasticity and integration of synaptic activity in the CNS. This is in part attributable to the high calcium permeability of the ion channel, which allows receptor activation to influence the intracellular calcium concentration and also the slow time course of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents. NMDA receptor activity is also regulated by the intracellular calcium concentration through activation of various calcium-dependent proteins, including calmodulin, calcineurin, protein kinase C, and alpha-actinin-2. Here, we have shown that calmodulin reduces the duration of native NMDA receptor single-channel openings from 3.5 +/- 0.6 msec to 1.71 +/- 0.2 msec in agreement with previous studies on recombinant NMDA receptors (Ehlers et al., 1996). NMDA receptor single-channel amplitudes and shut times were not affected. However, calmodulin reduced the duration of groups of channel openings called superclusters, which determine the slow time course of synaptic currents, from 121 +/- 25.4 msec to 60.4 +/- 11.6 msec. In addition, total open time, number of channel openings, and charge transfer per supercluster were all reduced by calmodulin. A 68% decrease in charge transfer per supercluster suggests that calmodulin activation will significantly reduce calcium influx during synaptic transmission. These results suggest that calmodulin-dependent inhibition of NMDA receptors will reduce the amplitude and time course of excitatory synaptic currents and thus affect synaptic plasticity and integration of synaptic activity in the CNS.
