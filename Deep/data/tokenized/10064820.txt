Immunohistochemical localization of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the monkey brain was investigated using a polyclonal anti-BDNF antibody produced in our laboratory. The antibody recognized a single band in monkey brain homogenates, and the estimated molecular weight was approximately 14 kDa, which corresponds well to the molecular weight of BDNF monomer. BDNF-like immunoreactivity was observed in the somata and processes of discrete neuronal subpopulations in the monkey brain. BDNF-positive neurons were widely distributed in various structures of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain, basal ganglia, diencephalon, brainstem and cerebellum. In addition, immunopositive glial cells were found in some brain regions. These data suggest that BDNF may exist widely in the monkey brain, and may be concerned with various types of neurons in the monkey central nervous system.
