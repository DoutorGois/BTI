Incubation of rat hippocampal slices in the presence of the synthetic cannabinoid (-)-11-OH-delta 8-dimethylheptyl tetrahydrocannabinol (HU-210) (100 nM) prevented the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP). Slices co-incubated with both HU-210 (100 nM) and the cannabinoid antagonist, SR141716A (100 nM), exhibited tetanically induced LTP, comparable to control slices. Intriguingly, coincubation with HU-210 and SR141716A prevented the induction of the early, short-term phase of LTP.
