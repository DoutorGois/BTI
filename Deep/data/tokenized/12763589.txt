The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), PPARdelta, PPARgamma and PPARalpha, comprise a subclass of the supergene family of nuclear receptors. As such they are ligand-regulated transcription factors whose major effects are mediated by altering expression of target genes. PPARdelta has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed in mammals. However, its primary biological role(s) has yet to be defined. Several recent studies have demonstrated that PPARdelta is the most highly expressed PPAR isoform in the central nervous system, but ambiguity still exists as to the specific brain sub-regions and cells in which it is expressed. Here, utilizing novel, isoform-selective PPARdelta riboprobes and an anti-peptide antibody, we performed a series of in situ hybridization and immunolocalization studies to determine the distribution of PPARdelta in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice. We found that PPARdelta mRNA and protein is expressed throughout the brain, with particularly high levels in the entorhinal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus, and lower levels in the corpus callosum and caudate putamen. At the cellular level, PPARdelta mRNA and protein were found to be expressed in oligodendrocytes and neurons but not astrocytes. Such results suggest a role for PPARdelta in both myelination and neuronal functioning within the CNS.
