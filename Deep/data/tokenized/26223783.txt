BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra, the presence of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alphaS) and evidence of neuroinflammation. Experimental studies have shown that the cerebral injection of recombinant fibrillar alphaS, especially in alphaS transgenic mouse models, can induce the formation and spread of alphaS inclusion pathology. However, studies reporting this phenomenon did not consider the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the injected alphaS, produced in E. coli, as a potential confound. The objectives of this study are to develop a method to remove the LPS contamination and investigate the differences in pathologies induced by alphaS containing LPS or alphaS highly purified of LPS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We were able to remove >99.5% of the LPS contamination from the alphaS preparations through the addition of a cation exchange step during purification. The alphaS pathology induced by injection of fibrils produced from alphaS containing LPS or purified of LPS, showed a similar distribution pattern; however, there was less spread into the cortex of the mice injected with alphaS containing higher levels of LPS. As previously reported, injection of alphaS fibrils could induce astrogliosis, and alphaS inclusions were present within astrocytes in mice injected with fibrils comprised of alphaS with or without cation exchange purification. Furthermore, we identified the presence of alphaS pathology in ependymal cells in both groups of mice, which suggests the involvement of a novel mechanism for spread in this model of alphaS pathology.
