Male laboratory rats prematurely weaned on the 15th day of life exhibited in adulthood an increase in seizure susceptibility in the septum, hypothalamus and hippocampus. The resting EEG of these animals exhibited characteristic changes demonstrated in the EEG spectrum power density by shifts in the power of individual frequencies. The administration of RNA to adult prematurely weaned animals affected in all structures under study the seizure susceptibility as well as the resting EEG, having caused in septum and hippocampus the return to values found in normally weaned rats. In hypothalamus the administration of RNA also changed the state given by the premature weaning but the return to normalcy was not complete.
