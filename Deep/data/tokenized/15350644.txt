Zac1, a new zinc-finger protein that regulates both apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, is abundantly expressed in many proliferative/differentiation areas during brain development. In the present work, we studied Zac1 gene expression and protein in experimental seizure models following i.p. injection of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or kainic acid (KA). Following KA treatment, an early and intense up-regulation of Zac1 is detected in the limbic areas, such as the hippocampus, cortex and amygdaloid and hypothalamic nuclei. Pre-treatment with MK-801, an antagonist of the NMDA receptors, fully blocks the effect of KA in the hippocampus, whereas it only attenuates KA-induced Zac1 up-regulation in the other areas of the limbic system. A reduced induction is obtained with PTZ-treated animals, specifically in the entorhinal and piriform cortices as well as in amygdaloid and hypothalamic nuclei. Thus, Zac1 is highly induced in the seizure models that generate strong neuronal stimulation and/or extensive cell damage (cell death), reinforcing its putative role in the control of the cell cycle and/or apoptosis. Moreover, strong induction is observed in the granular cells of the dentate gyrus (which are resistant to neurodegeneration) and in some glial cells of the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone, suggesting that Zac1 may be implicated in the mechanisms of neural plasticity following injury.
