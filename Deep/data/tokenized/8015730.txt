Repeated treatment with dl-pentazocine (5-10 mg/kg i.p.), but not d-methamphetamine (4.8 mg/kg i.p.), twice daily for 8 days diminished the specific [3H]1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) binding to the haloperidol-sensitive sigma sites in rat striatum and hippocampus. Either drug failed to cause any changes in the binding to the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex. The pentazocine-induced diminution in the striatum was accompanied by a decrease in the density with an increase in the affinity of the [3H]DTG binding. These data suggest that repetitive use of dl-pentazocine may influence the regulation systems of the sigma site in specific brain regions.
