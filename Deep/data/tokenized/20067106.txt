OBJECTIVE: To study the neuron apoptosis induced by i.p 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) and the expression of apoptosis-related factors in rat brain. METHODS: Twenty rats were divided into 4 groups. In group A, the rats were injected intraperitoneally with single dosage of saline, while the rats of group B, C, D were injected i.p with MDMA in different regimen, which were 20 mg/kg, single injection in group B, 20 mg/ kg twice a day (8 am and 8 pm), for 2 day in group C, as well as 20 mg/kg, twice a day (8 am and 8 pm) for 4 days. Neuron apoptosis were measured by TUNEL, and the expression of Caspase-3 and CytC were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with saline group, apoptosis neurons were detected at the related brain regions (such as frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum) of the rats in MDMA treated groups; Expression of Caspase-3 and CytC was observed at different level. Compared with group B, the number of apoptosis neurons of group C and D increased, and also the apoptosis-related factors in the brain tissue increased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: MDMA could induce neurons apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related factors such as Caspase-3 and CytC in rat brain.
