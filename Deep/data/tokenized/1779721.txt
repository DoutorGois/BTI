Recent investigations of epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, amnesia, and schizophrenia have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate changes in temporal lobe structures. Normal variations in these structures need to be defined before one can use these structures to describe abnormal conditions. Twenty-nine normal volunteers were studied by coronal MRI. Frequent findings include notching of the uncus by the tentorium or adjacent vessels (22/29) and asymmetry of the temporal horns (20/29). This finding of uncal notching strengthens the evidence against "incisural sclerosis" as the basis for hippocampal sclerosis. Temporal horn dilatation occurred in four. However, mild asymmetry of the temporal horn was seen frequently at its anterior tip (16/29) and may be related to head rotation. Asymmetry of the choroidal fissure was never marked. Mild asymmetry was common at the hippocampal head (pes). Mild enlargement of the right temporal lobe by visual inspection is not uncommon. Subtle asymmetry of the white matter between the hippocampus and the collateral sulcus occurred in six. The collateral sulcus does not always point to the temporal horn. The occipitotemporal sulcus may point to the temporal horn. Asymmetric uncal protrusion (0/29) and Sylvian fissure dilatation (4/29) occur rarely.
