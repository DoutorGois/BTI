The neural bases of repetition effects for faces and non-significant shapes was studied using Mooneys' faces presented upright (face) or upside down (shape) with a repetition interval of 8 min 30 s-1. Scalp potentials and current density maps on 30 electrodes were compatible with an involvement of the infero-temporal and fusiform gyri (from 50 to at least 250 ms), mainly on the right, for both faces and shapes; the hippocampus and adjacent areas (around 300 ms), specifically for faces; the medial temporal lobes (450-650 ms) again independent of stimulus meaning. These results suggest that the facilitation of perception due to repetition involves both neocortical specialized areas and the medial temporal lobe, with different timings of activation. They further suggest that memory updating takes place more rapidly for faces than for meaningless shapes and that face recognition may be, at least partly, functionally encapsulated.
