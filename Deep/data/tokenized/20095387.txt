It was shown by using elaborated method of cell zinc quantitative determination that phase alterations in cell zinc content occurs during stress. Zinc accumulation in cells in the first phase was accompanied by the increase of blood corticosterone and corticotropine levels. A decrease of zinc concentrations in cells in second phase was accompanied by a decrease in the levels of these hormones. Zinc deficiency in cells was observed after adrenalectomy and insular apparatus function removal. Cell zinc deficiency correction was achieved in the first phase by adrenaline and prednisolone injections and in second one--by insuline administration. Positive correlation of the changes of zinc content in hippocampus and blood corticotropine level indicates possible functional connection between hippocampus and hypophysis.
