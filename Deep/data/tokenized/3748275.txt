The distribution of [3H]kainate binding sites was determined by quantitative autoradiography in three vertebrate species: rat, monkey, and human. These animals displayed a similar pattern of binding site density in the hippocampus. Highest levels were found within the stratum lucidum and moderate levels in the inner portion of the dentate gyrus molecular layer. Although the distribution is similar, there is a lower density of binding sites in the stratum lucidum of primates than in rodents. Experiments using rat brain synaptic plasma membrane fractions indicated that inclusion of Ca2+ ions results in a selective reduction in binding at the high affinity sites. The Ca2+-inhibited and Ca2+-inhibited binding sites in the high affinity sites. The Ca2+ -inhibited and Ca2+ -insensitive binding sites in the rat hippocampus exhibited a similar distribution. Together, these results suggest that in a variety of mammalian species kainate receptors exhibit similar regional distributions, and that the high and low affinity kainate binding sites also exhibit similar regional distributions.
