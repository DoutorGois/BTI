Key proteins regulating serotonergic activity, specifically the serotonin transporter and 5-HT(1A) receptor, were examined in the midbrain raphe nuclei of young (3-4 months) and old (17-19 months) hamsters (N=7-10/group). An age-related decrease in the maximal density of serotonin transporter sites labelled with [(3)H]paroxetine (fmol/mg protein, Old: 396+/-13; Young: 487+/-27) was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) but not the median raphe nucleus (MRN), without affecting the affinity of [(3)H]paroxetine. In the DRN and MRN, the stimulation of [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding by the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, or the number of 5-HT(1A) receptor sites labeled with [(3)H] MPPF, was not different in old versus young animals. Thus in the DRN, aging decreased serotonin transporter sites without changing 5-HT(1A) receptor activation of G proteins or 5-HT(1A) receptor density. In the CA(1) region of hippocampus, 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding was increased in the older animals (% above basal, Old: 141+/-21; Young: 81+/-17) without changing specific [(3)H] MPPF binding sites, suggesting that the capacity of 5-HT(1A) receptors to activate G proteins is enhanced. Aging also appears to enhance this capacity in the dentate gyrus, because this region exhibited a constant level of 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding in spite of an age-related decrease in the number of [(3)H] MPPF binding sites (fmol/mg protein, Old: 203+/-21; Young: 429+/-51).
