The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) has been associated with a plethora of cellular functions ranging from cell cycle to neuroprotection. Mice lacking PrP(C) show an increased susceptibility to epileptic seizures; the protein, then, is neuroprotective. However, lack of experimental reproducibility has led to considering the possibility that other factors besides PrP(C) deletion, such as the genetic background of mice or the presence of so-called "Prnp flanking genes", might contribute to the reported susceptibility. Here, we performed a comparative analysis of seizure-susceptibility using characterized Prnp(+/+) and Prnp(0/0) mice of B6129, B6.129, 129/Ola or FVB/N genetic backgrounds. Our study indicates that PrP(C) plays a role in neuroprotection in KA-treated cells and mice. For this function, PrP(C) should contain the aa32-93 region and needs to be linked to the membrane. In addition, some unidentified "Prnp-flanking genes" play a role parallel to PrP(C) in the KA-mediated responses in B6129 and B6.129 Prnp(0/0) mice.
