A neuroprotective and nootropic drug Noopept increased the frequency of spontaneous calcium transients in neurons of CA1 radial layer in cultured rat hippocampal slices. In contrast, the drug exerted no significant effect on intracellular calcium concentration and its dynamics in neurons of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer.
