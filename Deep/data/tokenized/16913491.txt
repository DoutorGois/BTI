OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of green tea polyphenol (GTP) on the behaviour of Alzheimer' s Disease like mice induced by D-galactose and Abeta25-35. METHODS: D-galactose (120 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into mice for 12 weeks and Abeta25-35 (4nmol) was injected by icv to establish Alzheimer' s Disease like mice. The protective and therapeutic effects of GTP were determined by using water maze test, step down test, step through test and open field test. RESULTS: GTP ameliorated the deleterious effects of D-galactose and Abeta25-35, and thereby improved the animal' s learning and memory, prolonged latency time, and the error numbers were significantly reduced. At the same time the autonomic activities were significantly increased. CONCLUSION: GTP can improve the behaviour of Alzheimer' s Disease like mice induced by D-galactose and Abeta25-35.
