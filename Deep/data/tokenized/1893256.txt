In an autopsy study on Australian Aborigines (29 males, 27 females) and Caucasians (57 males, 37 females) the postnatal growth of the hippocampus was studied and described by mathematical growth functions. For male adults no significant difference in hippocampal volume was found. In contrast, hippocampal volume was significantly smaller for Aboriginal females compared to Caucasian females. Growth analysis showed slower growth rates and later half-value times for Aborigines compared to Caucasians. These results are discussed in relation to secular changes of growth parameters of the human brain during the last century, the socioeconomic and health status of Aborigines, and sexual differences in development and plasticity of the hippocampus.
