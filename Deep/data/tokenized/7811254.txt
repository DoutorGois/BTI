Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) in the septum and hippocampus are thought to be involved in memory and learning, and their receptors have been classified into three subtypes, V1a, V1b and V2. In this study, we tested for AVP V1a- and V2-receptor mRNAs in the hippocampus of adult rats by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. PCR product of the V2 receptor mRNA was detected in the hippocampus, but that of V1a receptor mRNA was not. This is the first demonstration of the existence of the V2 receptor mRNA in the hippocampus.
