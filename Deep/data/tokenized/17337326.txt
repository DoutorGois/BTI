Beta-adrenoceptors (ARs) in the hippocampus play an important role in regulating synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. However, little is known about the distributions of beta-ARs in the hippocampus, especially in the cornu ammonis (CA)1 and CA3 regions of Sprague-Dawley rats. Here, we report that beta1- and beta2-ARs in the CA1 and CA3 regions have differential subcellular distributions. Using double immunofluorescence labeling and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we found that almost all of the neuronal nuclei positive cells express beta1- and beta2-ARs, while few glial fibrillary acidic protein positive cells express them. Interestingly, beta1-ARs are predominantly distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm, whereas beta2-ARs are predominantly distributed not only in the membrane and cytoplasm, but also in the nucleus. The differential subcellular distribution of beta1- and beta2-ARs may have functional significance.
