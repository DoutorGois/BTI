The volumes of the components of the hippocampus of rats subjected to subcutaneous injections of silver during the first 4 postnatal weeks were compared to those of littermate controls. Of the 14 components measured, only the pyramidal cell layer was found to be significantly smaller in the treated animals. These findings indicate that the perikaria of the pyramidal cells are either the first elements in the developing hippocampus to show signs of silver toxicity or that they are the selective sites of silver neurotoxicity. The volumetric approach is shown to be a sensitive means by which small localized neurotoxic effects can be detected.
