Spatial integration refers to the superimposition of two separate spatial relationships between cues (C1-C2 and C2-C3) by a common linking element (C2). This linkage creates a new spatial relationship between cues that were never paired together (C1-C3). Several authors obtained conflicting results on spatial integration in both humans and animals. Using a dynamic 3D virtual environment, we provide the first clear evidence that humans can integrate two spatial relationships into a new spatial relationship that guides spatial navigation. This research is discussed in light of a spatial version of the temporal coding hypothesis (Savastano and Miller, 1998).
