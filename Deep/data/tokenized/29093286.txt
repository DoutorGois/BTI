Tong-Qiao-Huo-Xue Decoction (TQHXD) is a classical prescription in traditional Chinese medicine treating blood stagnation in the head and facial channels, especially cerebral ischemia. We investigate the effect of TQHXD on the expressions of related proteins of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and analysis of constituents in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on cerebral ischemic model rats. Here, we demonstrate that TQHXD protected the hippocampus neurons, reduced the opening of tight junction (TJ) and decreased the permeability of BBB by up-regulating ZO-1, occludin, claudin-5 expressions, down-regulating aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expressions. Meanwhile, we detected Muscone, ligustilide and hydroxysafflor yellow A in CSF on cerebral ischemic model rats. These compounds could be identified as the main active ingredients of TQHXD on protecting the damaged BBB. These results suggest that TQHXD could act as a potential neuroprotective agent against BBB damage for cerebral ischemia.
