The mossy fibers, a major intrinsic hippocampal pathway connecting the dentate granule cells with the pyramidal cells in CA4 and CA3, have been reexamined in rats using mainly Fink-Heimer silver impregnation methods for demonstration of degenerating axons. By extending isolated hippocampi and cutting sections normal to the long axis, simple two-dimensional reconstructions of both the lesions and the resultant degeneration could be made. In the hilus, the zone with the greatest concentration of degenerating boutons was found between the lesioned granule cells and the CA3 pyramidal cells abuting on the hilus; outside this zone the concentration declines rather rapidly. Degenerating boutons were also observed in low concentration up to 200-300 microgram septal and temporal to the lesion. The mossy fibers in CA3 nearest the hilus have an intrapyramidal course and display a lamellar organization with fibers from the granule cells of the medial blade lying deep to those from the dentate crest. These in turn lie deep to those from the graule cells of the lateral blade. A mediolateral difference in the projection of the graule cells on the CA3 pyramidal cells was discovered: fibers from the medial granule cells descend about 600 micrometer in the temporal direction, whereas fibers from the lateral granule cells descend about 1,200 micrometer. This causes a divergence of the fibers from one single level, especially of the part of the fibers, being farthest away from the hilus. The degree of descent of the fibers from each mediolateral position of the granule cells was constant at all septotemporal levels examined.
