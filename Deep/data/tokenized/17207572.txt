We examined the effect of occlusal disharmony in senescence-accelerated (SAMP8) mice on plasma corticosterone levels, hippocampal neuron number, and spatial performance in the water maze. The bite-raised condition was associated with an accelerated age-related decline in spatial memory, increased plasma corticosterone levels, and a decreased number of neurons in the hippocampal CA3 region. The findings suggest that the bite-raised condition in aged SAMP8 mice induces hippocampal neuron loss, thereby leading to senile memory deficits.
