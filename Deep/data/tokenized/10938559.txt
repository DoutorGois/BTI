Male rats were exposed to a low-intensity (300-500 nT) electromagnetic (EM) field designed to simulate primed burst potentiation (PB) for 30 min preceding a one-trial olfactory learning task involving two brief encounters with a juvenile rat during a baseline (reference) and an experimental (EM) trial. The amount of time spent engaged in behaviors defining social investigation (i.e., sniffing, grooming) during the second encounter of the experimental trial was significantly elevated in adult rats receiving continuous EM stimulation prior to the initial encounter. These results support the hypothesis that LTP-like stimulation disrupts the acquisition of a learning task if the stimulus is delivered before training.
