In postnatal day 7 rats, a unilateral intrastriatal injection of 12.5 nmol of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) reproducibly injures the ipsilateral striatum, adjacent hippocampus and overlying cortex. The severity of injury can be quantified by comparing cerebral hemisphere weights in animals sacrificed 5 days after the injection. Co-injection of NMDA and the glycine receptor antagonists kynurenic acid (KYN) or 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-CKA) reduced the severity of NMDA-induced damage in a dose-dependent fashion. One hundred nmol of KYN with 12.5 nmol of NMDA reduced average % damage from 19.3 +/- 0.9% (n = 9) to 2.3 +/- 0.5% (n = 6), P less than 0.001, ANOVA. Co-injection of 40 nmol of 7-CKA with 12.5 nmol of NMDA (n = 6) reduced average % damage from 17.1 +/- 1.6% (n = 15) to 3.0 +/- 0.6%, P less than 0.001, ANOVA. Concurrent injection of 1000 nmol glycine with 5 nmol NMDA did not increase the extent of NMDA-induced damage. Our results demonstrate that glycine receptor antagonists attenuate NMDA-induced brain injury in vivo.
