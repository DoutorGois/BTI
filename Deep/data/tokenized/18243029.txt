If we observe the evolution of the Alzheimer's disease of a premature entorhinal stage at an evolved stage of the neocortex, the succession of the confusions of the simple mnesic complaint in the aphasia, praxia, gnosia, visual, psychological and comportemental difficulties testify of the extension of the lesions in the neocortical structures. This neocortical regression seems to take the inverse road of the phylo- and ontogenetic evolution, where this hegemonic neocerebral cortex - which had grown again on the borders of the archeocortical and paleocortical barbarian empire - sees itself dispossessed of its conquests and gives free rein to these ancestral structures. We could compare the Alzheimer's disease with the fall of the neocortical empire at the age of nonsense.
