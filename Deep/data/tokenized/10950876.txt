The expression of a novel calcyclin (S100A6) binding protein (CacyBP) in different rat tissues was determined by Western and Northern blotting. Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant CacyBP purified from E. coli exhibited the highest reaction in the brain and weaker reaction in liver, spleen, and stomach. CacyBP immunoreactivity was also detected in lung and kidney. Densitometric analysis showed that the concentration of CacyBP in the soluble fractions of total brain and cerebellum is approximately 0.17 and 0. 34 ng/microg protein, respectively. Northern blotting with a specific cDNA probe confirmed the high level of CacyBP expression in the rat brain and lower levels in other tissues examined. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of rat brain sections revealed strong expression of CacyBP in neurons of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex. The in situ hybridization detected CacyBP in hippocampus as early as P7 (postnatal day 7) and a peak of expression at P21, and the expression signal was preserved until adulthood. In the entorhinal cortex, the peak of expression was observed at P7, whereas in the cerebellum it was seen at P21. The results presented here show that CacyBP is predominantly a neuronal protein.
