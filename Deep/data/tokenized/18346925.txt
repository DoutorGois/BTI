A case of familial frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism (FTDP) similar to progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) was reported. A 58-year-old man developed personality change followed by parkinsonism and dementia. Three family members showed similar symptoms. Cerebral atrophy was marked on the anterior frontotemporal lobes. The substantia nigra, hippocampus, peri-aqueductal gray matter and pontine nucleus were affected with globose neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and glial tangles. Argyrophilic grains were distributed in the CA1-CA2. NFT, glial tangles and argyrophilic grains expressed four-repeat microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). MAPT gene had no mutation. Familial occurrence of FTDP with PSP-like tauopathy is rare.
