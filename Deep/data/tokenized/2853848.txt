Potential age-related changes in L- and N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (L- and N-VSCCs) were assessed by the in vitro binding of [3H]isradipine ([3H]ISR, 150 pM) and [125]omega-conotoxin GVIA ([125I]omega-CT, 4 pM) to membranes prepared from discrete central nervous system regions of 0.5-, 2-, and 18-month-old rats. The rank orders of [3H]ISR and [125I]omega-CT binding, although differing, indicated that the highest binding was in neocortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus; radioligand binding was generally not affected by the variable of age. These results suggest that the nonidentical [3H]ISR and [125I]omega-CT binding sites are concentrated in those regions characterized by high densities of synaptic connections, and that these sites, as presumed components of L- and N-VSCCs, are relatively stable during the aging process.
