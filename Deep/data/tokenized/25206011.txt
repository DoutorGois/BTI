BACKGROUND: Kolaviron, isolated from seeds of Garcinia kola, have been shown to possess wide pharmacological properties. PURPOSE: The present study examined the effect of kolaviron on acetylcholinesterase activities in the hippocampus and striatum of adult Wistar rats. METHODS: In this study, histological and histochemical methods were used to investigate the effects of kolaviron on the histology of the hippocampus and striatum and on acetylcholinesterase activities in these brain regions. RESULTS: We showed that kolaviron produced no neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus and striatum. Kolaviron did not significantly alter (p<0.05) neuronal density in these brain regions. Kolaviron significantly reduced (p<0.05) acetylcholinesterase staining intensity, suggesting a likely inhibiting effect on this enzyme. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that kolaviron could act as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Kolaviron may be developed as a herbal-based natural product with therapeutic potential in the management of neurodegenerative disorders associated with disturbed cholinergic neurotransmitter systems.
