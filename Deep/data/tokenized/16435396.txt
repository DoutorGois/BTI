In vitro studies conducted by our research group documented that neural progenitor cells can be selected from human umbilical cord blood (HUCB-NPs). Due to further expansion of these cells we have established the first human umbilical cord blood-derived neural-like stem cell line (HUCB-NSC) growing in serum-free (SF) or low-serum (LS) medium for over 3 years. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the neurogenic potential of HUCB-NSCs cultured in SF and LS condition in different in vitro settings before transplantation. We have shown that the number of cells attaining neuronal features was significantly higher for cultures expanded in LS than in SF condition. Moreover, the presence of neuromorphogens, cultured rat astrocytes or hippocampal slices promoted further differentiation of HUCB-NSCs into neural lineage much more effectively when the cells had derived from LS cultures. The highest response was observed in the case of co-cultures with rat primary astrocytes as well as hippocampal organotypic slices. However, the LS cells co-cultured with hippocampal slices expressed exclusively a set of early and late neuronal markers whereas no detection of cells with glial-specific markers was possible. In conclusion, certain level of stem/progenitor cell commitment is important for optimal response of HUCB-NSC on the neurogenic signals provided by surrounding environment in vitro.
