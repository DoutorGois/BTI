The effect of guanidinoethane sulfonic acid (GES), an inhibitor of taurine uptake, was examined with respect to endogenous amino acids in the hippocampus of the freely moving rabbit. GES increased the extracellular levels of both taurine and phosphoethanolamine (PEA), other amino acids being unaffected. However, long-term oral administration of GES selectively reduced endogenous taurine levels. The effect of GES on PEA appeared to be a consequence of the elevated extracellular taurine as exogenously administered taurine per se increased PEA levels in the extracellular space. The findings are discussed in conjunction with the proposed membrane-stabilizing effects of taurine.
