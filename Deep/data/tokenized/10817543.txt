Imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, is one of the main drugs used for the treatment of depression. We investigated the effects of the repeated administration of imipramine (10 mg/kg po for 14 days, twice daily) on adenosine receptor-mediated actions using extracellular and intracellular recording techniques in the rat hippocampal slices. Adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine dose-dependently decreased the amplitude of population spikes and the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked in the CA1 cell layer and apical dendrites of the CA1 cells, respectively, by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway. As revealed by intracellular recording, a membrane hyperpolarization and a strong attenuation of excitatory synaptic transmission contribute to the decrease in the population spikes and fEPSPs induced by adenosine and 2-chloroadenosine. The repeated administration of imipramine enhanced the effect of adenosine (3 microM) and 2-chloroadenosine (0.15 microM) on fEPSPs while the inhibition of population spikes was not changed. When higher concentration of 2-chloroadenosine (0.25 microM) was tested, repeated imipramine administration enhanced its inhibitory effect on population spikes but not on fEPSPs. The present report provides evidence that the inhibitory effect of adenosine receptor activation in the hippocampus is enhanced by repeated treatment with imipramine.
