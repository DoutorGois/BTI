Levels of educational and occupational attainment, as components of cognitive reserve, may modify the relationship between the pathological hallmarks and cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined whether exposure of a Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD to environmental enrichment (EE) at a specific period during the amyloidogenic process favored the establishment of a cognitive reserve. We found that exposure to EE during early adulthood of Tg2576 mice--before amyloidogenesis has started--reduced the severity of AD-related cognitive deficits more efficiently than exposure later in life, when the pathology is already present. Interestingly, early-life exposure to EE, while slightly reducing forebrain surface covered by amyloid plaques, did not significantly impact aberrant inhibitory remodeling in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Thus, transient early-life exposure to EE exerts long-lasting protection against cognitive impairment during AD pathology. In addition, these data define the existence of a specific life time frame during which stimulatory activity most efficiently builds a cognitive reserve, limiting AD progression and favoring successful aging.
