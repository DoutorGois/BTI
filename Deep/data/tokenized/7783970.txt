The distribution and cellular localisation of somatostatin receptor subtype 4 (SSTR4) was investigated in the adult rat brain using the technique of in situ hybridisation with subtype specific oligonucleotide probes. Somatostatin receptor subtype 4 was found mainly in the hippocampus CA1 > CA2 > CA3 pyramidal cells and in the pyramidal cells in layers (IV-VI) of the cerebral cortex. Reverse transcription-PCR with SSTR4 specific primers confirmed the tissue distribution revealed by in situ hybridisation.
