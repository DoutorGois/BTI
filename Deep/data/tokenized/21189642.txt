AIM: To establish a model in vitro for screening antiepileptic drugs. METHODS: Perfusing guinea pig hippocampal slice with penicillin offers a stable epileptiform discharge which was tested by two commonly clinically used antiepileptic drugs, phenytoin sodium and phenobarbital sodium at different concentration. RESULTS: The experimental result showed that penicillin induced epileptiform discharge in the hippocampal slice and two antiepileptic drugs, phenytoin sodium and phenobarbital sodium inhibition of this discharge induced by penicillin. CONCLUSION: This electrophysiological model has the advantage of simplicity, flexibility and ease of quantitation and has potential value for screen antiepileptic drugs and epilepsy research.
