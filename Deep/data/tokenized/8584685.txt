1. Receptor binding and behavioral studies were performed to compare the effects of subchronic treatments with SM-9018, a novel 5-HT2 and D2 antagonist, and with haloperidol (HAL) on dopamine and 5-HT receptors in rats. 2. SM-9018 treatment (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) for 2 weeks did not significantly change the density (Bmax) of striatal D2 receptors or the incidence of stereotyped behavior induced by apomorphine (APO). By contrast, HAL treatment (3 mg/kg/day p.o., for 2 weeks) significantly increased the D2 receptor density by about 55% and markedly enhanced the behavioral response to APO. 3. The density of 5-HT2 receptors in the cerebral cortex was significantly reduced (about 20%) by SM-9018 treatment without being affected by HAL. However, the hyperthermic response of rats to p-chloroamphetamine (p-CAMP, a putative 5-HT releaser) was unaltered by either treatment. 4. Neither SM-9018 nor HAL treatment changed the density of 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus. 5. These findings suggest that SM-9018 is weaker than HAL in inducing up-regulation and supersensitivity of the striatal D2 receptors after the subchronic treatment.
