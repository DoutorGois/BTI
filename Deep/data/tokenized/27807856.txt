Exposure to early life stress has been associated with memory impairments related to changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling. However, the potential impact of physical exercise to reverse these effects of maternal separation has been under investigated. Mice were subjected to maternal separation during the first 2 weeks of life and then exposed to a 3-week running protocol during adolescence. The spontaneous object recognition task was performed during adolescence followed by analysis of hippocampal expression of exons I, IV, and IX of the BDNF gene. As expected, maternal separation impaired recognition memory and this effect was reversed by exercise. In addition, running increased BDNF exon I expression, but decreased expression of BDNF exon IV in all groups, while exon IX expression increased only in MS animals exposed to exercise. Our data suggest that memory deficits can be attenuated by exercise and specific transcripts of the BDNF gene are dynamically regulated following both MS and exercise.
