The effect of thyroid deficiency on the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; the marker for cholinergic neurons) was studied in different parts of the rat brain at ages 5, 10, 15 and 25 days, and at day 130 following 102 days of rehabilitation. During normal development, the activity of ChAT increased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and basal forebrain, and decreased in the cerebellum. Neonatal thyroid deficiency resulted in a marked retardation of the developmental patterns of the enzyme activity. In the hippocampus the effect diminished with age even during the period of thyroid hormone deprivation, while in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum the enzyme activity was restored to normal only after rehabilitation. In contrast, ChAT activity in the basal forebrain remained persistently reduced in comparison with controls. The results indicate that neonatal thyroid deficiency causes selective irreversible biological damage to subcortical cholinergic neurons.
