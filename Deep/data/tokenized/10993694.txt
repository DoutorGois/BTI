Brain inflammation may have a pathogenic role in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic neuroinflammation upon anatomical changes in two regions of interest in the temporal lobe using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging techniques. We show that chronic infusion of lipopolysaccharide into the fourth ventricle for 4 consecutive weeks enlarged the lateral ventricles and significantly decreased the size of the hippocampal formation and the temporal lobe region. These changes are comparable to those observed in humans during the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
