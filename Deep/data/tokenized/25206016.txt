Adult neurogenesis has been the center of attention for decades. Neuroscientists hope to understand the mechanism underlying this phenomenon that might provide a unique perception of brain repair in future. Neurogenesis is referred to the process in which neuronal stem cells and progenitors generate new neurons in non-pathologic setting. Although there are some similarities between two neurogenetic regions including hippocampus and olfactory bulb, however there are some important differences. Regardless of the unique functional roles of ongoing neurogenesis in olfactory bulb and hippocampus, the differences are in terms of consequence of neurogenesis, origin of newly born neurons, responding receptors to nicotine exposure, neuronal migration and GABAergic input between two regions. In this paper, we have briefly reviewed the differences of adult neurogenesis between olfactory bulb and hippocampus.
