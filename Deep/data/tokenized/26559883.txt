Ageing is characterized by chronically elevated inflammatory markers (IMs). Peripheral IM levels have been found in negative correlations with brain structural measures including global and lobar volumes and the hippocampus. This study investigated the relationship between 10 peripheral IMs and voxel-based gray matter (GM) volumes in nondemented older adults (n = 463). Two proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] and interleukin-1beta) and 2 vascular IMs (vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) were negatively correlated with regional GM volumes. TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta were both significantly correlated with GM volumes in the left occipitotemporal area, left superior occipital gyrus, and left inferior parietal lobule; TNF-alpha was also significantly correlated with the bilateral medial prefrontal cortices and approached significance for the correlations with the bilateral hippocampi. Significant GM correlations with vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 were located in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices, and with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the cerebellum and right hippocampus. The neuroanatomical correlation patterns of 2 proinflammatory cytokines and 2 vascular IMs might be reflective of the effects of neurodegenerative and vascular pathological processes in the ageing brain.
