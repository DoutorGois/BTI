The unit activity was studied in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of anesthetized and immobilized cats. The state of asphyxia was caused by disconnection of artificial respiration for 3-9 min. The hypoxia induced phasic changes of the neuronal activity. Hippocampal neurons revealed a higher resistance against oxygen deficiency as compared to other brain areas.
