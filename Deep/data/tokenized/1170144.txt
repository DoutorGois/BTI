Bilateral microinjections of clozapine into the corpus striatum of rats antagonize amphetamine-induced stereotypy, and develops catalepsy. These two neuroleptic effects are not seen after subcutaneous or oral administration of clozapine. The effects were a little weaker than those seen after chlorpromazine. No neuroleptic effects were observed, when placebo was injected intrastriatally, nor when clozapine was injected into the hippocampus or the thalamus.
