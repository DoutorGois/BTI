Physical exercise can induce immunohistochemical changes and cell proliferation in the hippocampus. One of the main effects of prolonged exercise is resting bradycardia, most probably caused by enhanced vagal activity. To investigate whether physical exercise can cause neurochemical and morphological changes in vagal afferent neurons, we performed immunohistochemical studies of nodose neurons using isolectin B4 (IB4), 200-kDa neurofilament protein (N52) and calretinin in adult female rats. To distinguish subpopulations of neurons projecting to the left ventricle, we applied a Fast Blue patch to the epicardial surface of the left ventricle. Treadmill running for 8 weeks significantly increased the size of N52-positive cardiac projecting neurons. Furthermore, the proportion of IB4-positive neurons among all nodose ganglia neurons was significantly higher in trained animals. These data indicate that exercise leads to plastic changes in nodose ganglia neurons that may initiate changes of vagal activity caused by prolonged exercise.
