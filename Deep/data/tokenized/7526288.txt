The actions of the sigma receptor ligand L-687,384 were studied on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced currents recorded from outside-out patches obtained from cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons and on NMDA-evoked rises in [Ca2+]i in the same preparation. L-687,384 did not change the magnitudes of unitary NMDA currents or frequency of channel-openings but diminished channel-open probability by decreasing mean open time. This action was consistent with a voltage-dependent open-channel block of the NMDA channel by L-687,384 with a blocking rate constant of 5.9 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 at -80 mV. L-687,384 also reduced NMDA-evoked rises in [Ca2+]i in Fura-2-loaded neurons with an apparent IC50 value of 49 +/- 8 microM. The results demonstrate that L-687,384 acts as an antagonist at the NMDA receptor-channel complex.
