The aqueous reaction medium of Karnovsky and Roots for the demonstration of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was modified to obtain a gel-incubation medium that prevents diffusion of the reaction product and the soluble part of AChE into the incubation medium and along the plane of the section. The incubation medium contained 27% polyvinyl alcohol and suitable concentrations of the components of the medium of Karnovsky and Roots. The application of this incubation medium to sections of rat hippocampus resulted in intense staining, with the reaction products being mainly localized in fibrous structures.
