OBJECTIVE: To investigate the functional connection between the marginal division of the striatum and hippocampus, a brain region that play a vital role in learning and memory. METHODS: Morphological localization of functional activity of the nervous system was employed. Kainic acid (0.01%) was stereotaxically injected into the hippocampus as a chemical stimulus, and immunohistochemistry method was used to show the expression of c-Fos in rat brain. RESULTS: c-Fos was intensely expressed in the hippocampus, amygdaloid nucleus, the bed nucleus of the stria terminals and cerebral cortex; in the striatum, a stretch in the marginal division where c-Fos-positive nuclei congregated was observed, while c-Fos expression was scarcely detectable in the caudate putamen and globus pallidus. CONCLUSION: Functional connection exists between the marginal division and hippocampus in rats.
