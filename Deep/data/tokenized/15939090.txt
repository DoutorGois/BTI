Ten-day-old rat pups (P10) subjected to acute hypoxia (down to 4% O2) had as adults increased aggression (handling test), memory impairment (water maze test), and decreased CA1 cell counts. Pups subjected to chronic hypoxia (10% O2 from P0 to P21) had increased aggression, hyperactivity (open-field test), and decreased CA1 cell counts. Chronic hypoxia with superimposed acute hypoxia resulted in consequences that were not different from those of chronic hypoxia.
