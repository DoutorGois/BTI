The effect of lateral fluid percussion injury on mitochondrial function in the rat brain was investigated by quantitative imaging of changes in the regional activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), a mitochondrial enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle for adenosine triphosphate production. Regional SDH was measured in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices, CA1 and CA2-3 of the hippocampus, thalamus, corpus callosum, caudate/putamen, and cerebellum 1 hour and 72 hours after low, medium, and high pressure injury. No regional difference between the hemispheres in the activity of SDH was observed in the sham group. The hippocampus showed high SDH activity. The CA2-3 regions showed the highest activity among the regions examined. The corpus callosum, which is white matter, showed the lowest. One hour after low pressure fluid percussion injury, only the frontal lobe showed significantly lower SDH activity than the sham control in the ipsilateral hemisphere, whereas after 72 hours SDH activity was significantly lower in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. SDH activity was significantly lower in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes in the medium and high pressure injury groups than in the sham control 1 hour after injury, and SDH activity in the CA1 and CA2-3 of the hippocampus was significantly decreased 72 hours after injury. No decrease in SDH activity was observed in any region of the contralateral hemisphere either 1 hour or 72 hours after injury. Mitochondrial dysfunction of the ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus following fluid percussion injury is correlated with the severity of injury and advances with time after injury. The results suggest that progression of mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with secondary bioenergetic deterioration.
