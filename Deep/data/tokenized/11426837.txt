The intravenous administration of synthetic cannabinoid agonists was recently shown to dose dependently increase acetylcholine release from the rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 401 (2000) 179]. We report here that the active ingredient of cannabis preparations, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol, administered at 10, 37.5, 75 and 150 microg/kg, dose dependently stimulated acetylcholine release from rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus estimated by means of in vivo brain microdialysis with vertical concentric probes. At these doses, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol induced behavioural stimulation. The administration of the CB1 receptor antagonist, ([N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazo le-3carboxamide]HCl) SR 141716A (200 microg/kg i.p.) significantly reduced the effect of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (75 microg/kg i.v.) on acetylcholine release from rat prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.
