We used subtractive hybridization to isolate clones of gamma 7, a 68 residue G-protein gamma subunit. Northern blotting and in situ hybridization reveal that the gamma 7 subunit mRNA is expressed primarily in medium-sized neurons of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens and neurons of the olfactory tubercle, and at low levels in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation and laminae II-III, and V of the neocortex. The gamma 7 mRNA is translocated into dendrites of neurons in the neostriatum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. gamma 7 is expressed at relatively very low concentrations in peripheral tissues. The selective pattern of gamma 7 expression within the brain is highly reminiscent of those of the striatum-enriched adenylyl cyclase ACST, dopamine receptors, and the alpha subunit of G(olf), suggesting that, in striatum, gamma 7 may be a subunit of a G(olf) alpha-containing G protein that couples dopamine receptors selectively to ACST.
