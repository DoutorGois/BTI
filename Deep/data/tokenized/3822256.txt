Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a widespread contaminant of drinking water sources. The effects of TCE on 2-deoxyglucose uptake by brain tissue were examined in pups from rat dams exposed to TCE in their drinking water. The pups were exposed throughout gestation and lactation. Deoxyglucose uptake in the cerebellum, hippocampus and whole brain of the pups during the first 21 days of life was measured using a modification of the 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) technique. We determined that TCE at a nominal concentration of 312 mg/l significantly depressed 2-DG uptake in the whole brains and cerebella of 7- to 21-day old pups. 2-DG uptake was also lower in the hippocampus of exposed pups at 7, 11 and 16 days, but returned to control levels by 21 days. No overt toxicity, such as lower body or brain weight, was observed at this exposure level. This decrease in 2-DG uptake reflects a decrease in glucose uptake and/or metabolism in the brains of animals exposed to TCE.
