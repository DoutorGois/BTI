Cannabinoids have been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in a plethora of neurodegenerative conditions. Over the past decade, some studies demonstrate that cannabinoids can interact with nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). We investigated protective properties of WIN55212-2 (WIN, a non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist) in beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced neurodegeneration in rat hippocampus and possible involvement of PPAR-gamma (PPAR-gamma). Abeta (1-42) was injected into the hippocampus of male rats. Animals were administered by intracerebroventricular rout the following treatments on days 1, 3, 5, 7: vehicle, WIN, GW9662 (selective PPAR-gamma antagonist) plus WIN, AM251 (selective CB(1) receptor antagonist) plus WIN, SR144528 (selective CB(2) receptor antagonist) plus WIN, each of antagonists alone. Injection of Abeta-induced spatial memory impairment and a dramatic rise in hippocampal TNF-alpha, active caspase 3, nuclear NF-kB levels and TUNEL-positive neurons. WIN administration significantly improved memory function and diminished the elevated levels of these markers, while antagonizing either CB(1) or CB(2) receptor subtype partially attenuated the protective effects. Intriguingly, WIN significantly increased PPAR-gamma level and transcriptional activity, the latter being partially inhibited with AM251 but not with SR144528. The enhancing effect on PPAR-gamma pathway was crucial to WIN-induced neuroprotection since GW9662 partially reversed the beneficial actions of WIN. Co-administration of the three antagonists led to the complete abrogation of WIN effects. Our findings indicate that WIN exerts neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions against Abeta damage through both CB(1) and CB(2) receptors. Of great note, both direct and CB(1)-mediated increase in PPAR-gamma signaling also contributes to WIN-induced neuroprotection.
