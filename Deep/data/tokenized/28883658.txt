Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is an important form of structural and functional plasticity in the mature mammalian brain. The existing consensus is that GABA regulates the initial integration of adult-born neurons, similar to neuronal development during embryogenesis. Surprisingly, virus-based anatomical tracing revealed that very young, one-week-old, new granule cells in male C57Bl/6 mice receive input not only from GABAergic interneurons, but also from multiple glutamatergic cell types, including mature dentate granule cells, area CA1-3 pyramidal cells and mossy cells. Consistently, patch-clamp recordings from retrovirally labeled new granule cells at 7-8 days post retroviral injection (dpi) show that these cells respond to NMDA application with tonic currents, and that both electrical and optogenetic stimulation can evoke NMDA-mediated synaptic responses. Furthermore, new dentate granule cell number, morphology and excitatory synaptic inputs at 7 dpi are modified by voluntary wheel running. Overall, glutamatergic and GABAergic innervation of newly born neurons in the adult hippocampus develops concurrently, and excitatory input is reorganized by exercise.
