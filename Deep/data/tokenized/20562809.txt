Dermal exposure to organophosphate pesticide is important because of its popular use. This study planned to compare the changes in serum acetylcholinesterase, paraoxonase and neuronal density of hippocampus and iso-cortex between two age groups of Swiss albino mice (18-day-old and 150-day-old) after dermal application of (1/2) LD50 of chlorpyrifos for 14 days. Statistically significant reduction was observed in serum acetylcholinesterase (Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05) and neuronal density (Independent samples t-test, p<0.05) in exposed groups compared to the control. The reduction in serum AChE and neuronal density was more pronounced in exposed adult mice than in exposed neonatal mice. The paraoxonase level was insignificant in control neonatal mice, whereas it was 890-fold more in exposed neonatal mice. Upregulated paraoxonase levels may be extrapolated to produce relatively lower reduction of cholinesterase and neuronal density in neonatal mice.
