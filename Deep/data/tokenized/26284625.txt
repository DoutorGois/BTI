Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among the elderly. Neuritic plaques whose primary component is amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles which are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, are known to be the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. In addition, impaired synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks is thought to be important mechanism underlying for the cognitive deficits observed in AD. Although various causative factors, including excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dysregulation and oxidative damage caused by Abeta, are involved in early onset of AD, fundamental therapeutics that can modify the progression of this disease are not currently available. In the present study, we investigated whether phloroglucinol (1, 3, 5-trihydroxybenzene), a component of phlorotannins, which are plentiful in Ecklonia cava, a marine brown alga species, displays therapeutic activities in AD. We found that phloroglucinol attenuates the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induced by oligomeric Abeta1-42 (Abeta1-42) treatment in HT-22, hippocampal cell line. In addition, phloroglucinol was shown to ameliorate the reduction in dendritic spine density induced by Abeta1-42 treatment in rat primary hippocampal neuron cultures. We also found that the administration of phloroglucinol to the hippocampal region attenuated the impairments in cognitive dysfunction observed in 22-week-old 5XFAD (Tg6799) mice, which are used as an AD animal model. These results indicate that phloroglucinol displays therapeutic potential for AD by reducing the cellular ROS levels.
