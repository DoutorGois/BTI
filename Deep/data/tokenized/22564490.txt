One major cause for discrepancies in results from animal experimental studies is the use of different animal strains and suppliers. We have previously reported that Wistar rats from five different suppliers display profound differences in ethanol intake and behavior. One of the neurobiological processes that could be underlying these differences is the endogenous opioid system, which has been implicated in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of alcohol. We therefore hypothesized that the differences between the supplier groups would also be evident in the endogenous opioid system. Radioimmunoassay was used to determine the levels of the opioid peptides Met-enkephalin-Arg(6)Phe(7) and dynorphin B in several brain areas of ethanol-drinking and ethanol naive Wistar rats from five different suppliers. In the ethanol naive animals, differences between the supplier groups were found in the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, dorsal striatum and hippocampus. In the ethanol-drinking rats, differences were found in the same structures, with the addition of medial prefrontal cortex and substantia nigra. Correlations between ethanol intake and peptide levels were also found in several of the areas examined. The structures in which differences were found have all been implicated in the transition from drug use to addiction and these differences may lead to different propensities and vulnerability to this transition. Because the endogenous opioids have been suggested to be involved in a number of neurobiological disorders the results do not only have implications for research on alcohol or drug addiction, but many other fields as well.
