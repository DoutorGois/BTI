Norepinephrine and trans-1-aminocyclopentyl-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) each individually stimulated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides and when tested in combination caused a stimulation that was 50-90% greater than additive in hippocampal and cortical slices of the rat but not in striatal slices. This synergistic augmentation of hydrolysis of phosphoinositide was evident with all stimulatory concentrations of norepinephrine and of ACPD up to 1 mM, at which point ACPD was inhibitory. A time-course study revealed no lag in the synergistic interaction and no down-regulation through 60 min of incubation of the augmented response to the combined agonists. The synergistic reaction was mediated by alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and by metabotropic excitatory amino acid receptors. Increased intracellular calcium, but not activation of protein kinase C, may play a role in mediating the synergistic interaction. Thus, a unique synergistic stimulatory interaction was found between two receptors coupled with phosphoinositide metabolism, a finding which also supports the suggestion that these two systems are co-localized in some cells.
