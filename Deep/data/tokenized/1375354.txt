Based upon our previous finding of the association of apolipoprotein E (apoE) immunoreactivity with cerebral amyloids and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), we examined immunohistochemically whether this is also the case for apolipoprotein B (apoB). Polyclonal antibody to apoB immunosustained senile plaque amyloid, vascular amyloid, subpial amyloid deposits and intracellular NFTs in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded brain sections from patients with Alzheimer disease. Hydrated autoclave pretreatment of the sections enhanced the staining of plaque amyloid. The results may suggest a role of apoB in amyloid and NFT formation.
