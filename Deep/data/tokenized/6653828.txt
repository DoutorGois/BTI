Binding of corticosterone by the cytosol receptors after hydrocortisone administration was studied in different tissues of rats. A decrease in the specific binding of corticosterone occurred within 24 hrs in all the structures under study. In 3 days the decrease only persisted in the hypophysis and hypothalamus. The data suggest a connection between the long lasting decrease in the cytosol reception of corticosterone in the hypothalamus and hypophysis and the blockade of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal system.
