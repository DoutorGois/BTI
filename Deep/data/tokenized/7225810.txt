The opioid peptides Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin and D-Ala2-Met-enkephalinamide were injected at various concentrations into the neocortex and hippocampus of rats to examine their effects on EEG activity and DC potentials. All three compounds were found to elicit spreading depression (SD) in both structures. Higher doses of Met-enkephalin were required to elicit SD as well as seizure activity. In the hippocampus the wave of SD was frequently preceded by seizure activity which was antagonized by naloxone pretreatment (40 mg/kg i.p.). Naloxone also prevented Leu-enkephalin-induced SD in the neocortex (but not in the hippocampus) and Met-enkephalin-induced SD in the hippocampus (but not in the neocortex). It failed to block SD elicited by D-Ala2-Met-enkephalinamide in both structures. Some of the various reported behavioral effects of intracranial injections of enkephalins could be artefacts of hippocampal and/or cortical spreading depression.
