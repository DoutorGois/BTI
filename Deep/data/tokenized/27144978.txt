The cytokine, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), is a key regulator of neuroinflammation linked to numerous neurodegenerative conditions and diseases. The present study used transgenic rats that overexpress a murine TNFalpha gene, under the control of its own promoter, to investigate the impact of chronically elevated TNFalpha on hippocampal synaptic function. Neuronal viability and cognitive recovery in TNFalpha Tg rats were also determined following an ischemic insult arising from reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Basal CA3-CA1 synaptic strength, recorded in acute brain slices, was not significantly different between eight-week-old TNFalpha Tg rats and non-Tg rats. In contrast, slices from TNFalpha Tg rats showed significantly greater levels of long-term potentiation (LTP) in response to 100 Hz stimulation, suggesting that synaptic networks may be hyperexcitable in the context of elevated TNFalpha. Cognitive and motor deficits (assessed on the Morris Water Maze and Rotarod task, respectively) were present in TNFalpha Tg rats in the absence of significant differences in the loss of cortical and hippocampal neurons. TNF overexpression exacerbated MCAO-dependent deficits on the rotarod, but ameliorated cortical neuron loss in response to MCAO.
