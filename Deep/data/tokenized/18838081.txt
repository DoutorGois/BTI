AIMS: Our objective was to investigate if oxidative stress is involved in the neural damage caused by lidocaine. MAIN METHODS: Male Wistar rats were used. The control group received 0.9% saline ip and the treated group received a single 60 mg/kg lidocaine dose ip. On days 1, 2, 5, and 10 after dosing, ten rats were sacrificed and their brains were quickly removed. The amygdala and hippocampus were dissected. Five samples were used to determine lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Another five were used to measure antioxidant activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase, Cu-Zn SOD (superoxide dismutase), Mn SOD, and total SOD. KEY FINDINGS: Ten days after injection of lidocaine, lipid peroxidation increases in the hippocampus because the ROS are enhanced from day 5, whereas in the amygdala lipid peroxidation and the ROS were enhanced only on the first day postinjection. Lidocaine causes an increased concentration of GSH and GSSG in the hippocampus from the first day. In the amygdala the GSH and GSSG content were increased at day 10. In the hippocampus the catalase activity was enhanced, whereas the total SOD and Cu-Zn SOD activities were decreased. In the amygdala the lidocaine enhances the activities of catalase and GPX, but no SOD isoenzymes were modified. SIGNIFICANCE: In this research we demonstrated that lidocaine affects the redox environment and promotes increases of the oxidative markers both in the hippocampus and amygdala but in a different pattern.
