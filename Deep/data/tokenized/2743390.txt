The distribution of MAP2 and actin in dendritic spines of the visual and cerebellar cortices, dentate fascia, and hippocampus was determined by using immunogold electron microscopy. By this approach, we have confirmed the presence of MAP2 in dendritic spines and identified substructures within the spine compartment showing MAP2 immunoreactivity. MAP2 immunolabeling was mainly associated associated with filaments which reacted with a monoclonal anti-actin antibody. Also, by immunogold double-labeling we colocalized MAP2 with actin on the endomembranes of the spine apparatus, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and in the postsynaptic density. Labeling was nearly absent in axons and axonal terminals. These results indicate that MAP2 is an actin-associated protein in dendritic spines. Thus, MAP2 may organize actin filaments in the spine and endow the actin network of the spine with dynamic properties that are necessary for synaptic plasticity.
