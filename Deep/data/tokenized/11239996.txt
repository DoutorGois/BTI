Pregnant Sprague--Dawley rats were treated once daily with 40-mg/kg cocaine or saline from gestation days (GD) 12 to 21. A third group of pregnant dams was used as a pairfed control. Male and female offspring were examined for stress endurance response as determined by the cold-water swim test on postnatal days (PND) 21, 30, 40, and 60. Male and female offspring exposed to cocaine in utero were found to have diminished tolerance and altered hormonal response to stress. Moreover, prenatal cocaine exposure has been associated with significant increases in severity of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 35 mg/kg) behavioral responses (tail twitches, wetdog shaking, and convulsion) as compared to control. Examining the experimental groups for pain sensitivity using the tail-flick and the hot-plate methods indicated that prenatal cocaine exposure altered pain sensitivity. NMDA receptor binding studies showed an increase in receptor density in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of the cocaine-treated group. These results indicate that gestational cocaine exposure is associated with long-term alterations in response to stress, NMDA receptor, and pain sensitivity in the rat offspring.
