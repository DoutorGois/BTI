The effect of postmortem storage at room temperature (24-26 degrees C, 0-4 h) and cold-room temperature (4 degrees C, (0-24 h) on the [(3)H]hemicholinium-3 binding sites in the brain hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of 3-month-old Wistar rats was studied. A slow decrease in the density of the binding sites was observed at both temperatures, which was best fit by a linear model common for all three brain regions. No systematic alterations of the affinity of the binding sites for hemicholinium-3 were found. The values obtained from experiments with animals were compared with the values measured in the frontal cortex of old men. Approaches to the evaluation of data obtained from postmortem samples of human brain tissue of patients with Alzheimer's disease are proposed.
