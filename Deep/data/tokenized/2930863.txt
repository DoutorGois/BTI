The amnestic effect of immediate post-training transcorneal electroconvulsive shock ECS (15.0 mA, 60 Hz, 2 sec) on step-down inhibitory avoidance learning (0.5 mA, 60 Hz training footshock) was studied in intact rats and in rats submitted to bilateral surgical transection of the dorsal fornix, to anterior or posterior hypothalamic deafferentation, and in sham-operated animals. Animals were tested for retention 24 hr after training. The amnestic effect of ECS was observed in all groups except in the one with the posterior hypothalamic lesion. Fornix-lesioned animals showed a moderate retention deficit which was considerably worsened by the ECS treatment. The results indicate that the amnestic effect of ECS requires integrity of posterior hypothalamic pathways. One possibility is that the amnestic effect of ECS may be mediated by posterior afferent fibers to the hypothalamus acting on hypothalamic opioid systems such as have been previously proposed to play a role in ECS-induced amnesia.
