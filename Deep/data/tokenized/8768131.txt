Exposure to inescapable foot shocks (ISs) decreased the dexamethasone receptor binding in the KHA rat hippocampus. Both the ISs and escapable foot shocks (ESs) enhanced the binding in the pituitary of the KLA rats as well as their plasma corticosterone. The data obtained suggest that the brain corticosteroid binding depends on the coping style of the subject as well as on the stress controllability factor.
