This study examined the effects of motor stimulation via treadmill on the behavior of male gerbils after external carotid ischemic brain lesion. The animals were assigned to five groups; ischemic with no stimulation (SIG), ischemic with stimulation (SIG 12/24/48/72h after surgery), non-ischemic with no stimulation (CC), non-ischemic with stimulation (CE) and sham, surgery without occlusion with no stimulation (SH). All the animals were tested in the open-field (OF) and rotarod (RR), 4 days after surgery in order to evaluate exploratory behaviors and motor performance. Data were submitted to one-way variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's post hoc comparisons. SIG and SIG 12 groups showed a significant decrease in motor response (crossing) when compared to the control group (CC) (F=20.65, P<0.05) in the OF. SIG 12 group showed an increase in grooming behavior (F=23.136, P<0.05) and all ischemia groups (SIG, SIG12/24/48/72) spent less time on the RR (F=10.40, P<0.05), when compared to the control group (CC). Histological analyses show extensive lesions in the hippocampus and neostriatum for all groups with ischemia (SIG, SIG12/24/48/72), which are structures involved in the organization of motor behavior. Interestingly, the most pronounced damage was found in animals submitted to motor stimulation 12h after ischemia which can be correlated to the increased number of grooming behavior showed by them in the OF. These findings suggest that motor stimulation through treadmill training improve motor behavior after ischemia, except when it starts 12h after surgery.
