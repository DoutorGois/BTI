Lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) in neonatal rats result in post-pubertal alterations in a number of cognitive, social and motor behaviors that bear some analogy to schizophrenia. Increased sensitivity to stress and psychostimulants and prefrontal functional changes in the lesioned animals suggest an involvement of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system. DA and norepinephrine (NE) interact in a number of ways in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to influence each other's functions. In order to assess the role of adrenergic system in the behavioral responses of neonatal VH (nVH) lesioned animals, we first examined cortical and subcortical bindings of alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors using [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-rauwolscine respectively, and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) using [3H]-nisoxetine. Sprague-Dawley rat pups, at post-natal day (PD) 7, received bilateral injections of ibotenic acid in the VH and were sacrificed pre (PD35)- and post (PD56)-pubertally. A significant increase in [3H]-prazosin binding was observed in the frontal and cingulate cortices of lesioned rats at PD56 without any significant change in the caudate putamen or nucleus accumbens. No significant difference was seen in [3H]-rauwolscine binding. A significant upregulation of NET binding was observed in subregions of the PFC and nucleus accumbens of PD56 lesioned rats. The functional relevance of changes in adrenergic markers on amphetamine-induced locomotor activity was examined by pre-treatment of PD56 rats with prazosin, an alpha-1 receptor antagonist. Prazosin at doses of 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg ip significantly reduced amphetamine-induced locomotion in sham but not in PD56 lesioned animals. Taken together, these results suggest that alterations in prefrontal alpha-1 receptors likely contribute to altered behavioral responses observed in post-pubertal VH lesioned rats.
