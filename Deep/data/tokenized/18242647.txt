Several lines of evidence implicate the prefrontal cortex in learning but there is little evidence from studies of human lesion patients to demonstrate the critical role of this structure. To this end, we tested patients with lesions of the frontal lobe (n=36) and healthy controls (n=35) on two learning tasks: the weather prediction task (WPT), and an eight-pair concurrent visual discrimination task ('Choose'). Performance of both tasks was previously shown to be disrupted in patients with Parkinson's disease; the Choose deficit was only present when patients were medicated. Patients with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were significantly impaired on Choose, compared to both healthy controls and non-OFC lesion patients. The OFC lesion patients showed a mild deficit on the first 50 trials of the WPT, compared to the control subjects but not non-OFC lesion patients. The selective deficit in the OFC patients on Choose performance could not be attributed to the larger lesion size in this group, and the deficit was not correlated with the volume of damage to adjacent prefrontal subregions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex). These data support the notion that the OFC play a role in normal discrimination learning, and suggest qualitative similarities in learning performance of patients with OFC damage and medicated PD patients.
