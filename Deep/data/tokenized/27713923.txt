The microRNA (miRNA) class of small (typically 22-24 nt) non-coding RNA affects a wide range of physiological processes in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). By acting as potent regulators of mRNA translation and stability, miRNAs fine-tune the expression of a multitude of genes that play critical roles in complex cognitive processes, including learning and memory. Of note, within the CNS, miRNAs can be expressed in an inducible, and cell-type specific manner. Here, we provide a brief overview of the expression and functional effects of the miR-132/212 gene locus in forebrain circuits of the CNS, and then discuss a recent publication that explored the contributions of miR-132 and miR-212 to cognition and to transcriptome regulation. We also discuss mechanisms by which synaptic activity regulates miR-132/212 expression, how miR-132 and miR-212 affect neuronal plasticity, and how the dysregulation of these two miRNAs could contribute to the development of cognitive impairments.
