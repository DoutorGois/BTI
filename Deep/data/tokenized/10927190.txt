We studied the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) on mouse brain monoamine levels in models of (1) chronic exposure (7 days) of EMF (60 Hz, 10 Gauss) to mice in a vertical orientation, (2) prolonged chronic exposure (84 days) of EMF (60 Hz, 10 Gauss) to mice in a horizontal mode, (3) acute exposure (6 h) of EMF (60 Hz, 10 Gauss) to senescence accelerated mice (SAM-P8) at ages 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in the horizontal mode, and (4) acute exposure (1 h) of EMF (60 Hz, 1, 3.3 and 10 Gauss) to restrained mice in the horizontal mode. No model except the restrained one changed their monoamine or metabolite levels by exposure to EMF. In the restrained group, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) was significantly increased in the hippocampus (HP) and hypothalamus (HY), homovanillic acid (HVA) was significantly increased in HY, and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) was significantly increased in HP and thalamus-midbrain (TM). None of these monoamine metabolite levels were changed when the mouse was restrained without EMF exposure. These results suggest that monoamine metabolism is influenced by EMF only when the exposure is in the same direction as the mouse position. Another possibility is that EMF enhances the restraint stress since stress is known to increase monoamine metabolism.
