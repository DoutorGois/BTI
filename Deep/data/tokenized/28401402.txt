Emerging reports indicate that activated PKC isoforms that translocate to the mitochondria are pro- or anti-apoptotic to mitochondrial function. Here, we concentrate on the role of PKCbeta translocated to mitochondria in relation to the fate of neurons following cerebral ischemia. As we have demonstrated previously ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) results in translocation of PKCbeta from cytoplasm to mitochondria, but only in ischemia-resistant regions of the hippocampus (CA2-4, DG), we hypothesize that this translocation may be a mediator of a protective signaling mechanism in this region. We have therefore sought to demonstrate a possible relationship between PKCbetaII translocation and ischemic resistance of CA2-4, DG. Here, we reveal that I/R injury induces a marked elevation of PKCbetaII protein levels, and consequent enzymatic activity, in CA2-4, DG in the mitochondrial fraction. Moreover, the administration of an isozyme-selective PKCbetaII inhibitor showed inhibition of I/R-induced translocation of PKCbetaII to the mitochondria and an increase in neuronal death following I/R injury in CA1 and CA2-4, DG in both an in vivo and an in vitro model of ischemia. The present results suggest that PKCbetaII translocated to mitochondria is involved in providing ischemic resistance of CA2-4, DG. However, the exact mechanisms by which PKCbetaII-mediated neuroprotection is achieved are in need of further elucidation.
