The stereotaxic administration of tetrodotoxin (TTX) was employed to induce the fully reversible inactivation of the fimbria-fornix complex (FF) and of the entorhinal cortex (EC), in order to ascertain the role of these structures in the memorization of a passive avoidance response (PAR). On permanently cannulated rats TTX (5 ng in 0.5 microliter saline) or saline (0.5 microliter) was injected uni- or bilaterally, respectively, in the FF and in the EC, 60 min before PAR acquisition, immediately after PAR acquisition and 60 min before PAR retrieval, always performed 48 h after the acquisition trial. It was shown that EC unilateral or bilateral pre-acquisition inactivation was followed by amnesia, while TTX inactivation in post-acquisition and pre-retrieval had no effects. Identical results were obtained by TTX administration in FF. The experimental evidence indicates that both EC and FF play a role during acquisition of PAR engram. The results are discussed in comparison with previous ones concerning dorsal and ventral hippocampus TTX inactivation effects on rat's PAR, and in relation to hippocampal and medial septal area connectivity.
