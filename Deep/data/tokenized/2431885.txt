Quantitative EEG profiles of aged and of young-adult Fisher-344 rats were studied over 10 consecutive recording (3 h) sessions. The individual recording sessions were spaced regularly over a 6-week period. In the aged rats, in recordings from both the frontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus, the EEG characteristics of a vigilance deficit state increased in prominence up through 8 recording sessions before a stable level was reached. A similar trend was not seen in the young-adult rats; instead, these rats showed a stable level of spectral voltage output in both leads over the entire period of the 10 recording sessions. Thus, the aged rat brain appears to suffer from a vigilance deficit state which is revealed most clearly by testing under the basal conditions brought about by thoroughly familiarizing the subjects with the test environment.
