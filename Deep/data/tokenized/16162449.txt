This study describes the pathological changes in 20 heroin addicts (12 male and 8 female) autopsied 24 h after sudden death. The central nervous system (including the pituitary body) and the adrenal medulla were studied, along with those from age-matched controls who died from traffic accidents. Immunohistochemistry and histological (Hematoxylin and eosin) observation were performed. Some neuronal cells in every region of the CNS were positive for opioid receptors but these cells were most numerous in the hippocampus. Positive opioid fibers were most abundant in the basal ganglia region. Histopathology indicated coagulative changes of cytoplasm and dissolution of Nissl bodies of neuron. Edema of nerve fibers was frequently demonstrated. Pituitary body showed an evident decrease or even absence of basophils in the pars anterior. The adrenal medulla featured a down regulation of chromaffin granules. Degeneration of CNS neurons and fibers, alterations in hormonal and blood pressure regulation therefore would be the prime targets of heroin addiction in human subjects.
