Chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1) has been implicated to induce the migration of neuroblastoma cells and is abundant in fetal brain but scarce in adult brain. Given the importance of neural cell migration in brain development, it is possible that the chemotaxis of CKLF1 is required during brain development. Therefore, it is essential to know the detailed expression profiles of CKLF1 during brain development first. However, the developmental expression patterns of CKLF1 still remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial expressions of CKLF1 during cerebral cortex postnatal development in rats. By reverse-transcription PCR/immunoblotting at multiple time points, the mRNA/protein expressions of CKLF1 were in abundance at birth, then decreased progressively within the next two weeks and almost disappeared in adulthood. By immunohistochemistry staining, an obvious expression of CKLF1 was observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, some specific nuclei and commissural fibers. Concluding, the temporal expression pattern of CKLF1 was coincident with the postnatal developmental stages and the spatial locations of CKLF1 were some destinations of neural cell migration or regions where myelination normally occurs during cerebrum postnatal development.
