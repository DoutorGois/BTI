Elucidation of the mechanisms of neuronal damage is an important task of modem neuroscience and is of paramount importance for medicine. Present work compares two models of excitotoxic neuronal damage induced by kainic acid and pilocarpine, in which inbred C57BL/6J (C57BL) and FVB/NJ (FVB) mice were used. Both models produced higher neuronal damage in FVB although mortality was higher in C57BL. No significant differences between two strains of mice were found in seizures severity. Kainic acid demonstrated greater tropism to hippocampus in comparison with pilocarpine. Hsp-70 and Egr-1 expression was not significantly different in C57BL and FVB. Analysis of the isolated mitochondrial fraction has shown different degree of free radical production in the strains studied, that could be one of the reasons for unequal susceptibility of their neurons to excitotoxic cell death.
