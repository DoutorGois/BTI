OBJECTIVES: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), or self-reported cognitive decline despite normal neuropsychological test performance, is a risk factor for objective cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). While brain mechanisms contributing to SCD are not well defined, studies show associations with vascular risk factors and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF), raising the hypothesis that those with SCD might be experiencing vascular dysregulation, or a disruption in the normal relationship between CBF and cognition. We examined whether the association between CBF and verbal memory performance differs between those with SCD (SCD+) and those without SCD (SCD-). METHODS: Linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate whether the voxel-wise relationship between arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI-measured CBF and verbal memory performance was modified by SCD among a group of 70 cognitively normal older adults (35 SCD+, 35 SCD-; mean age=72) matched on age, gender, and symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Results indicated that the SCD- group exhibited positive associations between verbal memory and CBF within the posterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus, whereas the SCD+ group displayed negative associations between verbal memory and CBF within the posterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that, while higher CBF is supportive of memory function in those without SCD, higher CBF may no longer support memory function in those presenting with SCD, perhaps reflecting neurovascular dysregulation.
