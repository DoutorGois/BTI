S-9977-2 is a new molecule with promnesic and antiamnesic properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of i.p. administration of S-9977-2 on histamine (HA) levels in several regions of the rat brain, and also in peripheral areas, using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection. S-9977-2 (0.025 mg/kg) induced an increase in the content of HA in the anterior hypothalamic region, with a significant effect 30 min after injection (1.77 +/- 0.36 nmol/g vs. 2.43 +/- 0.40 nmol/g; p < 0.01). It did not significantly modify HA levels in the posterior hypothalamic region, hippocampus, fronto-parietal cortex, blood, spleen, or adrenal glands. A clear tendency to increase HA content was observed in the hippocampus (0.16 +/- 0.03 nmol/g vs. 0.39 +/- 0.31 nmol/g, ns) and fronto-parietal cortex (0.55 +/- 0.45 nmol/g vs. 0.70 +/- 0.28 nmol/g; ns). S-9977-2 at doses of 0.005 and 0.125 mg/kg i.p. did not produce any significant change in HA levels in any of the samples tested 30 min after administration. The present results demonstrate that S-9977-2 increases HA levels in the anterior hypothalamus, which is the brain region with the highest content in histaminergic fibers. This fact suggests that the neuronal HA system might be involved directly or indirectly in the pharmacological actions of S-9977-2.
