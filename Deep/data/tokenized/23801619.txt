OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of recombinant human nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-transferase (NAMPT) on physiological/biochemical indexes and brain structure in mice. METHODS: Wild type human recombinant NAMPT (10, 30 and 100 mug/kg) or H247A mutant NAMPT (with very weak enzymatic activity) were administrated by intravenous injection in mice once every 3 d for 32 d. The changes of body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, serum glucose, serum total cholesterol and triglyceride were determined, and the morphology of neuron, astrocyte and microglia in hippocampus were observed. RESULTS: The injection of wild and mutated type NAMPT had no significant effect on body weight, blood pressure,heart rate, blood glucose, total cholesterol and triglyceride, and did not affect the morphology of neuron, astrocyte and microglia in hippocampus of mice. CONCLUSION: Elevation of plasma NAMPT may not induce metabolic and neuronal dysfunction in normal individual.
