The activity of glucose-1,6-bisphosphatase and the level of its substrate were measured in 16 gray areas and four fiber areas of mouse brain and 10 layers or sublayers of monkey retina. Because of the low activity of the enzyme and the small sample sizes, it was necessary to develop a method with two different amplification steps (overall amplification about 10(6]. The enzyme ranged in activity 100-fold from a low in monkey retina photoreceptor cells to a high in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus. However, in gray areas of the brain proper the range was only about fourfold. This, together with its requirement for IMP, suggests that the enzyme has a widespread metabolic function related to states of increased neuronal activity. Glucose-1,6-bisphosphate levels varied from 80 to 960 mu mol/kg dry weight in different areas of mouse brain and from 44 to 200 mu mol/kg dry weight in different layers of monkey retina. In general, the glucose bisphosphate levels correlated positively with the bisphosphatase activities; however, the three areas with the highest enzyme concentrations did not fit this pattern.
