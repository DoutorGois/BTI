Cerebral ischemia results in severe derangements of energy metabolism in the nervous tissue including activation of glycolytic pathway. Activity of cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the specific brain structures remains unclear. The recent study was aimed at investigation into the LDH activity in the cytoplasm of both hippocampal and cortical neurons in Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) at different durations of reperfusion after global ischemia. Analysis showed that the activity of LDH in pyramidal neurons of various hippocampal areas and neurons of II, III and V cortical layers after 7-minute forebrain ischemia depended on both localization of the neurons and duration ofreperfusion. In general, the changes in postischemic cytosolic LDH activity include significant decrease in the LDH activity 2 days after reperfusion with varying degree of recovery on day 7 of reperfusion.
