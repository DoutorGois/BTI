Hirano bodies are intraneuronal inclusions whose frequency increases with age and Alzheimer's disease. These paracrystalline inclusions have been shown previously using immunocytochemistry to share epitopes with actin, tropomyosin, alpha-actinin and vinculin. Hirano bodies have not previously been demonstrated to share components with neurofibrillary tangles, another intraneuronal inclusion characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we show that Hirano bodies bind antibodies to the microtubule-associated protein tau, a component of Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles.
