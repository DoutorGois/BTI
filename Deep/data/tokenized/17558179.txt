Low-cost, simple procedures for organotypic tissue cultures are desirable for high-throughput biological experiments such as large-scale medical/drug screening. We present a practical and economical method to cultivate brain slices using hydrophilic filtration membranes. With a cost reduction of more than 90%, this technique allows us to prepare hippocampal slice cultures that are morphologically and functionally indistinguishable from those obtained by the widely used Millicell-CM method.
