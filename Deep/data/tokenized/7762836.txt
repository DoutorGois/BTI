The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of various anesthetics on the formation of brain edema resulting from a focal cryogenic lesion. Thirty rabbits (six per group) were anesthetized with isoflurane (1 minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration [MAC] 2.1 vol%), fentanyl (bolus 5 micrograms/kg; infusion rate 1.0-0.5 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), thiopental (32.5 mg.kg-1.h-1), or alpha-chloralose (50 mg/kg). Control animals (sham operation, no lesion) received alpha-chloralose (50 mg/kg). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in perifocal brain tissue was measured by H2-clearance. Animals anesthetized with isoflurane required support of arterial pressure by angiotensin II (0.15 micrograms.kg-1.min-1). Six hours after trauma the animals were killed. Formation of brain edema was studied by specific gravity of cortical gray matter, white matter, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, putamen, and thalamus. Brain tissue samples were collected at multiple sites close to and distant from the lesion. Mean arterial pressure, arterial PCO2 and PO2, hematocrit, body temperature, and blood glucose were not different between groups during the posttraumatic course (except for an increased arterial pressure with alpha-chloralose compared to thiopental 4-6 h after trauma). The specific gravity of cortical gray matter was significantly reduced up to a distance of 6 mm from the center of the lesion in animals anesthetized with isoflurane, thiopental, or alpha-chloralose and up to 9 mm in animals given fentanyl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
