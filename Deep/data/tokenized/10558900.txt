Opioid binding properties of Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr-NH-NH-Gly-Mal (DSLET-Mal), a novel enkephalin-framed affinity label, was determined in rat brain membranes. In competition studies the ligand showed high affinity for the delta opioid sites, labelled by [(3)H][Ile(5,6)]deltorphin II (K(i) = 8 nM), whereas its binding to the mu ([(3)H]DAMGO) and kappa ([(3)H]EKC) sites was weaker. Preincubation of the rat brain membranes with DSLET-Mal at micromolar concentrations resulted in a wash-resistant and dose-dependent inhibition of the [(3)H][Ile(5,6)]deltorphin II binding sites (96% blocking at 10 microM concentration). Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of DSLET-Mal reduced the density of delta opioid receptors and had no effect on mu and kappa receptors, as determined by saturation binding studies. [Ile(5, 6)]deltorphin II-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding was determined in membrane preparations of different brain areas of the ICV-treated animals. In both frontal cortex and hippocampus DSLET-Mal significantly decreased G protein activation by the delta agonist, having no effect on DAMGO stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding. DSLET-Mal had qualitatively similar effects on both receptor binding and G protein activation. These characteristics of the compound studied suggest that DSLET-Mal can serve as an affinity label for further studies of the delta-opioid receptors.
