Rats with electrolytic lesions of the medial septum or ibotenic acid lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) were tested in an order memory task for an 8-item list of varying spatial locations within an 8-arm radial maze. Results indicated that rats with small medial septal lesions resulting in small AchE depletion of dorsal hippocampal formation were impaired only for the first, but not the last choice orders of the list. Animals with large medial septal lesions resulting in large AchE depletion of the dorsal hippocampal formation displayed an order memory deficit for all the choice orders of the list. In contrast, rats with small NBM lesions resulting in small AchE depletion of parietal and part of frontal cortex were impaired only for the last, but not the first choice orders of the list. Animals with large NBM lesions resulting in large AchE depletion of parietal and part of frontal cortex displayed an order memory deficit for all the choice orders of the list. The relationship between these findings and mnemonic symptomatology of Alzheimer's disease was discussed, as was the possible meaning of these results in providing an animal model for studying certain aspects of the disease.
