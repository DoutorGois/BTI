INTRODUCTION: Memory is initially stored as a transitory change that can become consolidated and converted into a long term memory trace. Consolidation largely depends on the emotional state. It is known that the hippocampus plays a role in the consolidation process of certain types of memory and that the amygdala might modulate the consolidation of the memory traces in other parts of the brain. The interaction between these two structures is crucial in many forms of learning and memory. METHOD: The hippocampus, as well as the amygdala, display a type of synaptic plasticity known as long term potentiation (LTP), which is considered to be a cellular memory mechanism. Recently, it has been reported that the consolidation of the hippocampal LTP may be modulated, like memory, by the emotional state and by the activation of the basolateral amygdala. These findings, taken as a whole, can help to explain how the processes of consolidation of memory take place. At the same time they also constitute a more physiological model of the learning and memory processes, which will provide us with a more accurate understanding of the mechanisms behind the consolidation of the memory.
