Electrical stimulation of the amygdaloid nuclei in conscious monkeys sufficient to produce after-discharge was found also to produce a prompt and usually large increase in plasma growth hormone (GH) levels if prestimulation values were low and stable. Plasma GH responses were observed to parallel and slightly precede changes in serum cortisol. Stimulation of the temporal tip of the hippocampus, just posterior to the amygdala, did not produce elevations of GH or cortisol despite the spread of after-discharge activity to the amygdala.
