The type 5 G protein beta subunit (Gbeta5) can form complexes with members of the regulator of G protein signaling 7 (RGS7) family, but its relevance to neuronal G protein signaling is unclear. We found that mouse RGS7-Gbeta5 complexes bound to G protein-gated potassium channels and facilitated their functional coupling to GABA(B) receptors in neurons. Our findings identify a compartmentalization mechanism that is critical for ensuring high temporal resolution of neuronal G protein signaling.
