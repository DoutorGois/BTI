Membrane-associated guanylate kinase-interacting protein (MAGUIN) has been identified as a protein binding postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 and synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM). MAGUIN has one sterile alpha motif, one conserved region in connector enhancer of ksr (Cnk) (CRIC), one PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ) and one pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. There are two isoforms, MAGUIN-1 and -2. MAGUIN-1 binds the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and S-SCAM by the C-terminus, whereas MAGUIN-2 does not bind to PSD-95 or S-SCAM. Here, we have determined that MAGUIN-2 is also localized at synapses and that the synaptic localization of MAGUIN depends on the pleckstrin homology domain. The overexpressed C-terminal PDZ-binding region inhibits the synaptic targeting of PSD-95. Furthermore, the synaptic targeting of MAGUIN does not require N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. These findings suggest that MAGUIN-1 and -2 are recruited to synapses by the PH domain and that MAGUIN-1 subsequently interacts with PSD-95 at synapses.
