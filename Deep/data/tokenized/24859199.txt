The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway serves critical functions in CNS development, but, apart from its proposed neuroprotective actions, its physiological role in the adult brain is unclear. We observed a prominent activation of TGF-beta signaling in the adult dentate gyrus and expression of downstream Smad proteins in this neurogenic zone. Consistent with a function of TGF-beta signaling in adult neurogenesis, genetic deletion of the TGF-beta receptor ALK5 reduced the number, migration and dendritic arborization of newborn neurons. Conversely, constitutive activation of neuronal ALK5 in forebrain caused a marked increase in these aspects of neurogenesis and was associated with higher expression of c-Fos in newborn neurons and with stronger memory function. Our findings describe an unexpected role for ALK5-dependent TGF-beta signaling as a regulator of the late stages of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which may have implications for changes in neurogenesis during aging and disease.
