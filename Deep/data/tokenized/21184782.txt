Alcohol abuse in schizophrenia exceeds rates in the general population and worsens illness outcomes. Neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL) rats model multiple schizophrenia dimensions including addiction vulnerability. This study compared NVHL vs. SHAM-controls in operant alcohol seeking and consumption. NVHLs enhanced consumption of combined ethanol/sucrose solution but neither ethanol or sucrose only solutions, consistent with increased vulnerability specific to carbohydrate-laden alcohol beverages typically consumed in early stages of human alcoholism.
