Concentrations of the alpha-subunits of GTP-binding protein, Go (Go alpha) and of Gi2 (Gi2 alpha) in 6 areas (the hippocampus, parahippocampus, putamen, caudate head, orbital frontal cortex, and lateral temporal cortex) of control and schizophrenic postmortem brains were investigated using the highly sensitive enzyme immunoassay method. There was a significant decrease in Go alpha in the hippocampus and caudate head of the right hemisphere in schizophrenic patients compared to controls; the ANOVA (a general linear model; SAS Type II) demonstrated a significant diagnosis x side interaction only in the hippocampus. In other areas of the brain, analysis by grouping under diagnosis, side, age, gender, and postmortem delay showed no significant deviations in Go alpha between controls and schizophrenics. The concentrations of Gi2 alpha did not differ significantly in any area. These findings contrasted with the results yielded by ADP-ribosylation, which showed decreased pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylated amounts in the hippocampus and putamen of the contralateral (left) hemisphere. Some abnormal receptor-Go or Gi 1 signalling in hippocampus, putamen or caudate head may be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.
