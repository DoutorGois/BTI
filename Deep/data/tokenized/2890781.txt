The action of a new type of anti-anxiety compound, 5-(3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-propoxy)indan (BP-528), was tested on benzodiazepine receptor bindings and on [3H]-GABA release. BP-528 did not alter [3H]-diazepam binding to rat cerebral cortical and hippocampal membranes either in the presence or absence of GABA; and the binding of [3H]-propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate at low concentration (0.04 nM), which labels only the type I benzodiazepine receptor, was not changed by BP-528. BP-528 did not interact with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, which is related to the anti-anxiety activity of benzodiazepines. This compound affected neither GABA binding nor GABA uptake. Ten micromolar BP-528 depressed high K+-induced [3H]-GABA release from preloaded rat hippocampal slices. However, the same concentration of BP-528 also inhibited high K+-induced calcium uptake by rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes.
