OBJECTIVE: To identify and describe the occurrence of neurological lesions that could have an effect on lamb mortality. PROCEDURE: The central nervous system was investigated macroscopically (n = 92) and microscopically (n = 72) in lambs dying in the perinatal period during 3 years in flocks of adult Corriedale ewes. The central nervous system was removed intact and samples of cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, mesencephalon, cerebellar cortex, medulla oblongata, and cervical spinal cord were scored microscopically for the severity of neuronal dead, cytotoxic and perivascular oedema, and haemorrhage. RESULTS: Neurologic findings between birth and 6 days included haemorrhages in meninges, brain congestion and oedema, neuronal ischemic necrosis, intraparenchymal haemorrhages in medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord, parasagittal cerebral necrosis, and periventricular leukomalacia. No significant lesions were found in anteparturient deaths or in those aged between 7 and 16 days. Oedema was more severe in the brain than in other regions of the central nervous system. Ischaemic neurons first appeared 24 hours post partum, increased linearly in number between 48 hours and 5 days post partum, and had a laminar distribution in the cerebral cortex, indicating a hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Haemorrhages were most severe in the gray matter of medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord, suggesting trauma due to instability of atlantoaxialis joint. CONCLUSION: Lesions in the central nervous system can explain most deaths at birth and within 6 days of birth. The lesions were hypoxic-ischemic and appeared to be related to birth injury.
