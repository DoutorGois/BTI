1. c-fos mRNA expression and Fos protein expression were investigated by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry after 30 min of forced restraint stress or pentylenetetrazol (PTZ; 64 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced seizures. 2. Forced restraint stress and PTZ-induced seizures generated c-fos mRNA expression of distinct intensities, but in similar brain regions, including the hippocampus, the amygdala, the piriform cortex, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, the habenula, and parts of the cerebral cortex. 3. The distribution of Fos-like immunoreactivity induced by stress or seizures only partially overlap. No Fos-like expression was found in the hippocampus or the habenula after restraint stress. Nevertheless, both areas presented Fos-like expression after PTZ-induced seizures. 4. Our results support the suggestion that immediate early gene expression in vivo may exhibit both region- and stimulus-specific expression.
