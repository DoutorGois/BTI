Ontogenic development of muscarinic receptors was examined in the hippocampus of rabbits (from P2 to P60) using radioautographic method. Muscarinic sites were labelled with (3H)-quinuclinidyl-benzilate and pharmacologically defined M1 and M2 receptor subtypes with (3H)-pirenzepine and (3H)-oxotremorine, respectively. The distribution of binding sites was compared to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in adjacent hippocampal sections. The two cholinergic components are progressively set up in the hippocampus during the first three postnatal weeks. The AChE staining was very low in all hippocampal fields in P2 rabbits. At P8 and after, the AChE staining was more pronounced in CA3 and CA4 than in CA1 and CA2. On the contrary, the M1 muscarinic binding sites were more abundant in CA1 and CA2 hippocampal fields than in CA3 and CA4 at all ages studied. M2 muscarinic binding sites were only distinguishable at P45 and have a relatively homogeneous distribution. This study shows a differential developmental evolution in the distribution of AChE and muscarinic M1 receptors, and no obvious correspondence between these two cholinergic markers was observed.
