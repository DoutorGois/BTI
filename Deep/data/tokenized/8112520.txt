1. The in vitro effect of ginsenoside Rg1 from Panax ginseng on the low- and high-KM cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (cAMP PDE) activity in the frontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus of young (4-5-month old) and aged (22-month old) rats has been studied. 2. Administered in increasing concentrations (from 5 x 10(-5) M up to 5 x 10(-4) M), ginsenoside Rg1 exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on the low- and high-KM enzyme activity in all brain structures studied in rats of both age groups. 3. Ginsenoside Rg1 exhibited inhibitory potency similar to that of theophylline. 4. The present results provide evidence for the CNS effects of ginsenoside Rg1 through inhibition of the intracellular level of cAMP.
