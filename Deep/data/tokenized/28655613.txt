In previous studies, we have demonstrated the beneficial effects of classic PPARgamma agonists on neuroprotection against Abeta oligomer neurotoxicity in a double transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer' disease (AD). INT-131, a novel, non-thiazolidinedione compound that belongs to a new family of drugs, selective PPARgamma modulators (SPPARMs), has provided an emerging opportunity for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. However, its role in the central nervous system has not been studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the putative neuroprotective role of INT131 in hippocampal neurons. We found that INT131 increased dendritic branching, promoted neuronal survival against Abeta amyloid, increased expression of PGC1-1alpha and modulated neuronal mitochondrial dynamics. Our results suggest that INT131, a drug that has been shown to be safe and effective in metabolic disorders, may constitute a new therapeutic alternative for AD.
