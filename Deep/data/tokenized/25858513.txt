INTRODUCTION: The aims of the present study were to develop an optimized microfluidic method for the production of the selective nicotinic acetylcholine alpha4beta2 receptor radiotracer [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB ([(18)F]-Flubatine) and to investigate its receptor binding profile and pharmacokinetic properties in rhesus monkeys in vivo. METHODS: [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB was prepared in two steps, a nucleophilic fluorination followed by N-Boc deprotection. PET measurements were performed in rhesus monkeys including baseline and preblocking experiments with nicotine (0.24 mg/kg). Radiometabolites in plasma were measured using HPLC. RESULTS: [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB was prepared in a total synthesis time of 140 min. The radiochemical purity in its final formulation was >98% and the mean specific radioactivity was 97.3 +/- 16.1 GBq/mumol (n = 6) at end of synthesis (EOS). In the monkey brain, radioactivity concentration was high in the thalamus, moderate in the putamen, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and lower in the cerebellum. Nicotine blocked 98-100% of [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB specific binding, and the non-displaceable distribution volume (VND) was estimated at 5.9 +/- 1.0 mL/cm(3) (n = 2), or 6.6 +/- 1.1 mL/cm(3) after normalization by the plasma free fraction fP. Imaging data are amenable to kinetic modeling analysis using the multilinear analysis (MA1) method, and model-derived binding parameters display good test-retest reproducibility. In rhesus monkeys, [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB can yield robust regional binding potential (BPND) values (thalamus = 4.1 +/- 1.5, frontal cortex = 1.2 +/- 0.2, putamen = 0.96 +/- 0.45, and cerebellum = 0.10 +/- 0.29). CONCLUSION: An efficient microfluidic synthetic method was developed for preparation of [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB. PET examination in rhesus monkeys showed that [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB entered the brain readily and its regional radioactivity uptake pattern was in accordance with the known distribution of alpha4beta2 receptors. Estimated non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) values in brain regions were better than those of [(18)F]2-FA and comparable to [(18)F]AZAN. These results confirm previous findings and support further examination of [(18)F]-(-)-NCFHEB in humans.
