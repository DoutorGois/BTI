A systematic approach needs to be used to review MR scans in epilepsy patients to avoid the common pitfalls engendered by the subtle nature of many epileptogenic lesions. One should always evaluate the hippocampus regardless of other MR findings to avoid missing dual abnormalities. False-positive and false-negative diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis can be avoided by evaluating the hippocampus after correcting for head rotation [by assessing the internal auditory canals and atria). Periventricular heterotopia can be successfully diagnosed by systematically studying the periventricular regions, especially those adjacent to the atria of the lateral ventricles. Gray matter lateral to the ventricles (excluding the caudate nucleus) is always an abnormal finding. Sulcal and cortical morphologic abnormalities are particularly difficult to diagnose unless a high index of suspicion is maintained. Cortical thickening is indicative of a developmental anomaly and should be screened in an organized manner. Because epilepsy is generally a cortical process, one must search for subtle cortical abnormalities, including focal atrophic abnormalities and lesions without mass effect. Diligence will offer its own rewards.
