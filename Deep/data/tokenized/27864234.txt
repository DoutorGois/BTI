Sympathetic nervous system activity is increased after cardiopulmonary arrest, resulting in vasoconstrictor release from the perivascular sympathetic nerves of cerebral arteries. However, the pathophysiological function of the perivascular sympathetic nerves in the ischemic brain remains unclear. A rat model of global cerebral ischemia (asphyxial cardiac arrest, ACA) was used to investigate perivascular sympathetic nerves of cerebral arteries via bilateral decentralization (preganglionic lesion) of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Decentralization of the SCG 5 days before ACA alleviated hypoperfusion and afforded hippocampal neuroprotection and improved functional outcomes. These studies can provide further insights into the functional mechanism(s) of the sympathetic nervous system during ischemia. NEW & NOTEWORTHY: Interruption of the perivascular sympathetic nerves can alleviate CA-induced hypoperfusion and neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus to enhance functional learning and memory.
