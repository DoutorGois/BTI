Quantitative histochemistry was used to study the effects of phenazepam, medazepam, diazepam, and nitrazepam on GABA-transaminase activity in different rat brain structures. Phenazepam and diazepam, which produced anxiolytic effect in low doses, selectively inhibited GABA-transaminase of the hippocamp. The degree of GABA-transaminase inhibition corresponded with pharmacological activity of the test benzodiazepines. It is assumed that inhibition of brain GABA-transaminase by benzodiazepines is linked with their interaction with GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.
