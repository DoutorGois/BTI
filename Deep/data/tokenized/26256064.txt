The present study examined the relationship between residual discharges from the temporal neocortex postoperatively and seizure outcomes, in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) who were treated with selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH). Abnormal discharges from the temporal neocortex are often observed and remain postoperatively. However, no recommendations have been made regarding whether additional procedures to eliminate these discharges should be performed for seizure relief. We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients with unilateral MTLE and HS, who underwent transsylvian SelAH. The mean follow-up period was 29 months (range: 16-49). In the pre- and postresection states, electrocorticography (ECoG) was recorded for the temporal base and lateral temporal cortex. The extent of resection was not influenced by the results of the preresection ECoG. Even if residual abnormal discharges were identified on the temporal neocortex, no additional procedures were undertaken to eliminate these abnormalities. The postresection spike counts were examined to determine the postresective alterations in spike count, and the frequency of residual spike count. The seizure outcomes were evaluated in all patients using the Engel classification. The postoperative seizure-free rate was 92.9%. No significant correlations were seen between a decreasing spike count and seizure outcomes (p=0.9259), or between the absence of residual spikes and seizure outcomes (p=1.000). Residual spikes at the temporal neocortex do not appear to influence seizure outcomes. Only mesial temporal structures should be removed, and additional procedures to eliminate residual spikes are not required.
