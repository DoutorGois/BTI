Interaction between the neocortical motor system and the limbic system was investigated in terms of the transfer of kindling. Premotor cortical kindling induced limbic seizures accompanied by dissociated hippocampal afterdischarges (AD) which outlasted the premotor AD. Subsequent kindling of the hippocampus was markedly retarded despite prolonged hippocampal AD. These results suggest that premotor cortical kindling induces a neuronal mechanism which prevents limbic access to the motor system.
