Rats were subjected to 15 min of forebrain ischaemia using the 4-vessel occlusion method. Following recovery they were trained using place navigation learning in a Morris water maze and forced choice rewarded alternation in a T-maze. Ischaemic rats were impaired in place navigation learning but the deficit was transient and there was no impairment of subsequent transfer test performance. Food-rewarded forced-choice alternation in a T-maze revealed a persistent impairment in ischaemic rats. The behavioural deficits were associated with neuropathological damage in the CA1 cell layer of the dorsal hippocampus with varying degrees of damage in layers CA2, CA3 and CA4. Granule cells in the dentate gyrus were not visibly affected. Variable amounts of lesion damage were found in the dorsolateral striatum. Ischaemic rats are therefore impaired on both place navigation and forced choice rewarded alternation, suggesting that ischaemic brain damage affects reference and working memory processes to different extents. Forced choice alternation may be the more sensitive method of assessing cognitive changes caused by forebrain ischaemia.
