The seeds of Nigella sativa are used worldwide to treat various diseases and ailments. Thymoquinone (TQ) that is present in the essential oil of these seeds mediates most of the plant's diverse therapeutic effects. The present study aimed to determine whether TQ protects against alpha-synuclein (alphaSN)-induced synaptic toxicity in rat hippocampal and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons. Here, we report that alphaSN decreased the level of synaptophysin, a protein used as an indicator of synaptic density, in cultured hippocampal and hiPSC-derived neurons. However, simultaneous treatment with alphaSN and TQ protected neurons against alphaSN-induced synapse damage, as revealed by immunostaining. Moreover, administration of TQ efficiently induced protection in these cells against alphaSN-induced inhibition of synaptic vesicle recycling in hippocampal and hiPSC-derived neurons as well as against mutated P123H beta-synuclein (betaSN) in hippocampal neurons, as revealed by experiments using the fluorescent dye FM1-43. Using a multielectrode array, we further demonstrated that the treatment of hiPSC-derived neurons with alphaSN induced a reduction in spontaneous firing activity, and cotreatment with alphaSN and TQ partially reversed this loss. These results suggest that TQ protects cultured rat primary hippocampal and hiPSC-derived neurons against alphaSN-induced synaptic toxicity and could be a promising therapeutic agent for patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.
