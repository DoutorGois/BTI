We previously reported the isolation of a novel apoptosis-related gene, human Nap1 (HGMW-approved symbol NCKAP1), the expression of which was strongly down-regulated in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human Nap1 proved to be an orthologue of rat Nap1 which binds to the adaptor molecule Nck in signal transduction. In order to further elucidate the function of human Nap1, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening. As a result of screening, we discovered a protein designated hNap1BP (human Nap1 binding protein) which is a member of the tyrosine kinase-binding protein family. In addition, hNap1BP bound to the SH3 domain of c-Abl and Nck. hNap1BP is expressed ubiquitously in various tissues like human Nap1, and intriguingly these genes are co-expressed in hippocampus and cerebral cortex in mouse brain where AD pathological features are strongly evident. Further functional analysis of hNap1BP may clarify its contribution to AD pathology.
