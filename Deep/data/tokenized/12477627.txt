It is well recognized that glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter, which is removed from the synaptic cleft by excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) located on the perisynaptic astrocytes and that neuronal death has been associated with an increased extracellular glutamate concentration. In this study, we have immunohistochemically demonstrated the expression of EAAT2 protein in the human brain after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The EAAT2 expression patterns can be divided into three types: continuous and highly extensive staining (E); continuous but sporadic staining (M); and sporadic pattern staining (S). In six of the nine short survival cases studied (1 h to 1 day), continuous and highly extensive staining for EAAT2 (E type) was observed in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. On the other hand, we were able to demonstrate weak staining (S and M types) in 5 of the 7 long survival cases (> or =1 day) and in 12 of the 14 very short survival cases (<1 h) studied. Similar findings were obtained in the contralateral cerebral cortex and also in the ipsilateral hippocampus. In addition, positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein was detected around the cerebral contusion, but the EAAT2-positive expression was not observed in the same region for all of the six short and long survival cases (> or =1 h) after TBI. These findings clearly showed the differences in EAAT2 expression in the cerebral cortex according to the survival time and severity of cerebral contusion after TBI. Therefore, we emphasized that EAAT2 might play an important role in contributing to extracellular glutamate concentrations and secondary brain injury after TBI.
