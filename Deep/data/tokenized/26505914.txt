A growing body of evidence suggests that the agglomeration of amyloid-beta (Abeta) may be a trigger for Alzheimers disease (AD). Central infusion of Abeta42 can lead to memory impairment in mice. Inhibiting the aggregation of Abeta has been considered a therapeutic strategy for AD. Endomorphin-1 (EM-1), an endogenous agonist of mu-opioid receptors, has been shown to inhibit the aggregation of Abeta in vitro. In the present study, we investigated whether EM-1 could alleviate the memory-impairing effects of Abeta42 in mice using novel object recognition (NOR) and object location recognition (OLR) tasks. We showed that co-administration of EM-1 was able to ameliorate Abeta42-induced amnesia in the lateral ventricle and the hippocampus, and these effects could not be inhibited by naloxone, an antagonist of mu-opioid receptors. Infusion of EM-1 or naloxone separately into the lateral ventricle had no influence on memory in the tasks. These results suggested that EM-1 might be effective as a drug for AD preventative treatment by inhibiting Abeta aggregation directly as a molecular modifier.
