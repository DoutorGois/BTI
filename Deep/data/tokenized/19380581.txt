Mass spectrometry and immunoblot analysis of a rat brain fraction enriched in type-II postsynaptic densities and postsynaptic GABAergic markers showed enrichment in the protein septin 11. Septin 11 is expressed throughout the brain, being particularly high in the spiny branchlets of the Purkinje cells in the molecular layer of cerebellum and in the olfactory bulb. Immunofluorescence of cultured hippocampal neurons showed that 54 +/- 4% of the GABAergic synapses and 25 +/- 2% of the glutamatergic synapses had colocalizing septin 11 clusters. Similar colocalization numbers were found in the molecular layer of cerebellar sections. In cultured hippocampal neurons, septin 11 clusters were frequently present at the base of dendritic protrusions and at the bifurcation points of the dendritic branches. Electron microscopy immunocytochemistry of the rat brain cerebellum revealed the accumulation of septin 11 at the neck of dendritic spines, at the bifurcation of dendritic branches, and at some GABAergic synapses. Knocking down septin 11 in cultured hippocampal neurons with septin 11 small hairpin RNAs showed (i) reduced dendritic arborization; (ii) decreased density and increased length of dendritic protrusions; and (iii) decreased GABAergic synaptic contacts that these neurons receive. The results indicate that septin 11 plays important roles in the cytoarchitecture of neurons, including dendritic arborization and dendritic spines, and that septin 11 also plays a role in GABAergic synaptic connectivity.
