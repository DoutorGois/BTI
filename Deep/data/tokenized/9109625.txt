Multiple-unit neuronal recordings were taken from the hippocampi of 10 male, New Zealand white rabbits during classical discrimination and reversal eyeblink conditioning using 2 tones as the conditioned stimuli (CS+ and CS-) and an air-puff unconditioned stimulus. During discrimination training, characteristic learning-related activity was seen in the hippocampus on trials when a conditioned response (CR) was executed. During early phases of reversal training, however, when high numbers of CRs were evident to both the new CS+ (the former CS-) and the new CS- (the former CS+), no learning-related activity was observed. Characteristic CR-related hippocampal activity to the CS+ was observed only after the rabbits began to learn the reversal response. These results suggest that the hippocampus may encode different features of eyeblink conditioning during discrimination and reversal learning.
