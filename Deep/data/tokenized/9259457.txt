The binding sites of [3H]nociceptin (also named Orphanin FQ), the endogenous ligand of the ORL1 (opiate receptor like 1) receptor, were localized in the central nervous system of the mouse using an autoradiographic procedure. A high density of binding sites was seen in the cerebral cortex, paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, amygdaloid complex, suprachiasmatic nucleus, medial thalamus and medial geniculate nucleus. Moderate binding was observed in the nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, lateral thalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal grey matter and pons. Finally, low levels of binding were seen in the striatum, olfactory tubercle, hypothalamus and substantia nigra. Thus, it appears that the ORL1 receptor is particularly abundant in the cerebral cortex and limbic system of the mouse brain.
