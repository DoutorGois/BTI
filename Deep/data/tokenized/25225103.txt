Rhythmic activity of the brain often depends on synchronized spiking of interneuronal networks interacting with principal neurons. The quest for physiological mechanisms regulating network synchronization has therefore been firmly focused on synaptic circuits. However, it has recently emerged that synaptic efficacy could be influenced by astrocytes that release signalling molecules into their macroscopic vicinity. To understand how this volume-limited synaptic regulation can affect oscillations in neural populations, here we explore an established artificial neural network mimicking hippocampal basket cells receiving inputs from pyramidal cells. We find that network oscillation frequencies and average cell firing rates are resilient to changes in excitatory input even when such changes occur in a significant proportion of participating interneurons, be they randomly distributed or clustered in space. The astroglia-like, volume-limited regulation of excitatory synaptic input appears to better preserve network synchronization (compared with a similar action evenly spread across the network) while leading to a structural segmentation of the network into cell subgroups with distinct firing patterns. These observations provide us with some previously unknown insights into the basic principles of neural network control by astroglia.
