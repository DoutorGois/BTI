A new model of temporary complete cerebral ischemia was developed and tested in 64 rats. With use of microsurgical techniques, both pterygopalatine and external carotid arteries were occluded and the basilar artery was coagulated to reduce potential collateral CBF during ischemia. After this preliminary five-vessel occlusion, temporary global ischemia was induced by occluding the common carotid arteries (CCAs) with microclips. To validate the method, CBF was measured autoradiographically in 24 anatomical regions at death after 5 min of ischemia or after 15 min of ischemia followed by 5 min of reperfusion. Mean arterial blood pressure and arterial blood gases remained stable under controlled endotracheal ventilation and anesthesia (halothane, 70% N2O, and 30% O2) throughout the CBF experiments, except for a 10-15% increase in mean arterial blood pressure for 1-5 min after bilateral CCA occlusion. After the initial five-vessel occlusion, the EEG did not change, and local CBF levels were comparable to those in anesthetized non-surgical controls. When the CCAs were occluded, the EEG flattened rapidly; after 5 min of ischemia, autoradiography showed no detectable blood flow in the forebrain and cerebellum. The local CBF levels measured after 15 min of temporary global ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion demonstrated relatively homogeneous postischemic hyperperfusion; only two of eight rats had several 1- to 3-mm areas of no-reflow. Survival studies showed increasing motor impairment after 10, 15, 30, and 60 min of temporary CCA occlusion. Ischemic neuronal damage was observed histologically in the hippocampus and basal ganglia 24 h after 10 min of temporary ischemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
