Emerging evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of depressive disorders (DDs) is associated with neuronal abnormalities in brain microtubule function, including changes in alpha-tubulin isoforms. Currently available antidepressant drugs may act by rescuing these alterations, but only after long-term treatment explaining their delayed therapeutic efficacy. The microtubule associated protein type-2 (MAP-2) modulates neuronal microtubule dynamics. Our hypothesis is that MAP-2 represents an innovative target for the treatment of DDs. The synthetic pregnenolone-derivative MAP4343 (3beta-methoxy-pregnenolone) binds MAP-2 in vitro and increases its ability to stimulate tubulin assembly. Here, we show that MAP4343 has antidepressant efficacy in rats and advantages compared with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine. A single injection of MAP4343 changes the expression of alpha-tubulin isoforms indicative of increased microtubule dynamics in the hippocampus of naive Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas fluoxetine had no effects. MAP4343 has positive efficacy in the rat forced swimming test (FST), the most used assay to screen potential antidepressant drugs by decreasing immobility behavior. In the rat isolation-rearing model of depression, administration of MAP4343 showed more rapid and more persistent efficacy compared with fluoxetine in recovering "depressive-like" behaviors. These effects were accompanied by modifications of alpha-tubulin isoforms in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest the potential therapeutic use of MAP4343 for the treatment of DDs, based on a unique mechanism of action.
