The goal of this work is to provide regional T(1) and T(2) values at a field strength of 7 T for the normal mouse brain at 6 weeks and 1 year old. A novel segmented snapshot FLASH sequence was used to measure T(1) in the hippocampus, corpus callosum, and the retrosplenial granular (RSG) cortex; T(2) measurements were made in the same regions using a single spin echo sequence repeated at six separate echo times. Both T(1) and T(2) measurements were validated with phantom measurements.
