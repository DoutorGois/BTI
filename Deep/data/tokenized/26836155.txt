Extensive loss of hippocampal neurons serves a pathological basis for irreversible cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, this characteristic cannot be replicated by transgenic mouse models, and its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we present evidence that different expression patterns of amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) secretases in human and mouse hippocampal neurons are a decisive cause of species difference in the susceptibility to Abeta pathogenesis. Cell bodies of both pyramidal and granular neurons did not appear to undergo Abeta deposits in the 10-month-old transgenic mutant human AbetaPP/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice. They expressed high levels of non-amyloidogenic alpha-secretase, and its neuroprotective products soluble AbetaPPalpha, but low levels of amyloidogenic beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, and a neurotoxic product, Abeta42 peptide. Unlike those found in the mouse, human hippocampal neuronal cell bodies expressed beta-secretase and gamma-secretase, but not alpha-secretase, which could increase Abeta generation, thus undergoing death in response to various pathological conditions. Increased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis at 48 h following local microinjection of alpha-secretase antibody ADAM10 into the hippocampus of AbetaPP/PS1 mice further suggests that high alpha-secretase expression in mouse neuronal cell bodies is a factor in the paucity of neuronal loss in AD-like pathology. Therefore, selective down-regulation of brain alpha-secretase in transgenic AD models will better replicate the disease spectrum, including decreased brain soluble AbetaPPalpha levels and massive neuronal loss in AD patients, and be beneficial for preclinical therapeutic evaluation of AD.
