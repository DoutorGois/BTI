The intrinsic proton buffering power (beta 1) of individual rat hippocampal and neocortical neurones maintained in culture has been investigated using the fluorescent dye 2', 7'-bis(carboxymethyl)-5, 6-(carboxyfluorescein) (BCECF). The steady-state intracellular pH (pH1) was estimated to be 7.03 +/- 0.04 (n = 22) in Hepes-buffered media and beta 1 estimated from the addition and removal of weak bases was ca 10 mM (pH unit)-1 at pH1 values near to 7. Estimates of beta 1 made from butyric acid challenges were inconsistent with estimates made at the same pH1, using NH4Cl withdrawal. However, estimating beta 1 with butyrate in the presence of the monocarboxylate ion transport inhibitor alpha-cyano-hydroxy-cinnamate (CHC) yielded beta 1 values commensurate with those measured using NH4Cl. Application of CHC alone lead to a rapid fall in pH1, suggesting a significant contribution of the monocarboxylate transporter to pH1 regulation. beta 1 was also estimated from a step increase in extracellular P(CO2). This yielded a value of 11 mM at an average pH1 of 7.1, which is similar to that of the other estimates reported here. beta 1 was found to increase with decreasing pH1: each unit drop in pH1 increased buffering power by about 60%. Blockade of pH1 regulation did not significantly affect estimates of beta 1. The change in buffering power with pH could be closely modelled from the known concentrations of free amino acids and organic phosphates.
