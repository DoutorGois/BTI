We have used synthetic markers of the glucocorticoid (GC) receptor (RU 28362) and of the mineralocorticoid (MC) receptors (RU 26752 and RU 28318) to characterize the specificity of the sites binding aldosterone (ALDO), dexamethasone (DEX) and corticosterone (CORT) in cytosol of hippocampus. The results obtained suggest that ALDO was bound mostly to a MC receptor, as the relative binding affinity (RBA) of the GC receptor marker (and that of the previously studied RU 26988) was negligible for this site, in contrast to the high RBA displayed by RU 26752. DEX was bound for a large part to a GC receptor, as RU 28362 competed for this site, although the MC receptor marker still showed some affinity. An intermediate effect of both marker types was obtained with CORT. RU 28318 was a weak competitor for either the GC or the MC binding site. Thus, RU 28362 and RU 26752 allowed the discrimination of two to three receptors in the hippocampus, similarly to those described in the kidney. Finally, we have demonstrated the usefulness of these synthetic markers in identifying MC binding sites in several brain regions and also in the hippocampus during ontogenetic development.
