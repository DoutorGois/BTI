The influence of two strains of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus on catecholamine metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mouse was studied by the intracranial inoculation of NMRI-IVIC mice, 24 days old. Doses of 300 LD50 of the moderately virulent Pixuna strain and 10(4) LD50 of the nonvirulent TC-83 strain were used. The animals were sacrificed 4, 7, 12, and 18 days after the inoculation, and the CNS contents of dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenaline were determined by a radioenzymatic method. The turnover of these compounds was studied with the aid of the enzymatic inhibitors pargyline and alpha-methyl tyrosine. With the Pixuna strain a decrease in the level and turnover of catecholamines was observed in all eight brain areas studied: cerebellum, pons-medulla, hypothalamus, mesencephalon, striatum, olfactory bulb-tuberculum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. In some regions the levels returned to normal in 12-18 days, but in the striatum, mesencephalon, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb-tuberculum, recovery was slower and required at least 18 days after inoculation. The levels of catecholamines in the brain of mice inoculated with the nonvirulent TC-83 strain were not modified, but there was a decrease in the turnover.
