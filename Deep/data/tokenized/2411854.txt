5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations were investigated in various regions of the brain on the day of normal and spontaneously prolonged dioestrus in the rat. The 5-HT/5-HIAA concentration ratio and 5-HT content were found to be higher in the medial-basal hypothalamus (MBH) and the fronto-parietal cerebral cortex (Bc), and lower in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area (PAHA), when dioestrus was prolonged. No significant difference was observed with 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in the hippocampus (Hipp). It was concluded that there are significant alterations in 5-HT activity in the MBH, PAHA and the Bc when dioestrus is spontaneously prolonged.
