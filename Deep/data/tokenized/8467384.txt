In an earlier study, we presented evidence to suggest that some of the particulate choline-O-acetyltransferase (ChAT) in rat hippocampal tissue might be linked to membranes by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. In the present report, we attempted to determine if any of this GPI-anchored ChAT might be intracellular. Internalization of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) from Bacillus thuringiensis into rat hippocampal synaptosomes by the DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) freeze/thawing procedure caused an increase in cytosolic and a decrease in membrane-bound ChAT. Incubation of a plasma membrane enriched subcellular fraction at 16 degrees C relative to 4 degrees C led to a conversion of the membrane-bound, amphiphilic ChAT into hydrophilic ChAT. This conversion was blocked by zinc, an inhibitor of GPI-PLC. The cytosolic fraction of ChAT immunoreacted on western blots with an antibody directed against the cross-reacting determinant (CRD) of the GPI anchor. We suggest that some of the membrane-bound ChAT in rat hippocampal tissue is GPI-anchored intracellularly; also, that an endogenous GPI-PLC-like enzyme acts to release it into the cytosol.
