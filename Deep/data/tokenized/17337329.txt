Liuwei Dihuang decoction (LW), a traditional Chinese medicinal prescription, enhances the cognitive function of CNS by significant modulating effects on some of the gene expressions. Expressions of genes, such as DUSP12, NSF, STUB1, CaMKIIalpha, AMFR, UQCRFS1 and other 11 novel genes without any functional clues changed significantly. These genes are involved in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family, the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) gene family, the serine/threonine protein kinases family, ubiquitin ligase, mitochondrial function and so on.
