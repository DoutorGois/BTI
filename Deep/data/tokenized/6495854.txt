Coherence and spectral functions of biopotentials of the hippocampus, amygdala, frontal and sensorimotor cortical areas were estimated in dogs during instrumental alimentary behaviour and during self-stimulation of emotionally positive brain areas. Formation of functional systems: frontal cortex--amygdala, frontal cortex--hippocampus, and sensorimotor cortex--amygdala, synchronously acting in delta- and theta bands of electrical activity, was observed at the stage of a stabilized motor habit. THe hippocampus and amaygdala poorly co-operated, probably reflecting their different roles in the organization of behaviour.
