Melatonin is known to improve cognitive deficits, and its functions have been studied in various disease models, including Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated effects of melatonin on cognition and the cholinergic system of the septum and hippocampus in a mouse model of scopolamine-induced amnesia. Scopolamine (1 mg/kg) and melatonin (10 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to mice for 2 and 4 weeks. The Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests revealed that both treatments of scopolamine significantly impaired spatial learning and memory; however, 2- and 4-week melatonin treatments significantly improved spatial learning and memory. In addition, scopolamine treatments significantly decreased protein levels and immunoreactivities of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), high-affinity choline transporter (CHT), vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (M1R) in the septum and hippocampus. However, the treatments with melatonin resulted in increased ChAT-, CHT-, VAChT-, and M1R-immunoreactivities and their protein levels in the septum and hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that melatonin treatment is effective in improving the cognitive deficits via restoration of the cholinergic system in the septum and hippocampus of a mouse model of scopolamine-induced amnesia.
