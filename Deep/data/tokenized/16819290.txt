Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a widely distributed protein kinase C (PKC) substrate and has been implicated in actin cytoskeletal rearrangement in response to extracellular stimuli. Although MARCKS was extensively examined in various cell culture systems, the physiological function of MARCKS in the central nervous system has not been clearly understood. We investigated alterations of cellular distribution and phosphorylation of MARCKS in the hippocampus following kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. KA (25 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to eight to nine week-old C57BL/6 mice. Behavioral seizure activity was observed for 2 h after the onset of seizures and was terminated with diazepam (8 mg/kg, i.p.). The animals were sacrificed and analyzed at various points in time after the initiation of seizure activity. Using double-labeling immunofluorescence analysis, we demonstrated that the expression and phosphorylation of MARCKS was dramatically upregulated specifically in microglial cells after KA-induced seizures, but not in other types of glial cells. PKC alpha, beta I, beta II and delta, from various PKC isoforms examined, also were markedly upregulated, specifically in microglial cells. Moreover, immunoreactivities of phosphorylated MARCKS were co-localized in the activated microglia with those of the above isoforms of PKC. Taken together, our in vivo data suggest that MARCKS is closely linked to microglial activation processes, which are important in pathological conditions, such as neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
