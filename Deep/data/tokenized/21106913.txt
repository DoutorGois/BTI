Rat aging from 4 to 12 mo was accompanied by hippocampus and frontal cortex mitochondrial dysfunction, with decreases of 23 to 53% in tissue and mitochondrial respiration and in the activities of complexes I and IV and of mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) (P < 0.02). In aged rats, the two brain areas showed mitochondria with higher content (35-78%) of oxidation products of phospholipids and proteins and with higher (59-95%) rates of O(2)(-) and H(2)O(2) production (P < 0.02). Dietary supplementation with vitamin E (2.0 or 5.0 g/kg of food) from 9 to 12 mo of rat age, restored in a dose-dependent manner, the decreases in tissue and mitochondrial respiration (to 90-96%) and complexes I and IV and mtNOS activities (to 86-88%) of the values of 4-mo-old rats (P < 0.02). Vitamin E prevented, by 73-80%, the increases in oxidation products, and by 62-68%, the increases in O(2)(-) and H(2)O(2) production (P < 0.05). High resolution histochemistry of cytochrome oxidase in the hippocampal CA1 region showed higher staining in vitamin E-treated rats than in control animals. Aging decreased (19%) hippocampus mitochondrial mass, an effect that was restored by vitamin E. High doses of vitamin E seem to sustain mitochondrial biogenesis in synaptic areas.
