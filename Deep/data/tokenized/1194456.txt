The afferent and efferent connections of the septum with the hippocampus (fornix) of with the hypothalamus and lower brain stem (medial forebrain bundle) were transected by means of an encephalotome near the point where these pathways enter or leave the septal area. A transection of the fornix that produced minimal direct damage to cellular components of the septum of hippocampus reproduced the effects of large septal lesions on responding in several temporally defined paradigms that involve periods of response suppression (differential reinforcement of low rates, discriminated Sidman avoidance, fixed interval). Transection of the medial forebrain bundle fibers that interconnect the septum with the hypothalamus and lower brain stem did not affect behavior in any of these paradigms. These observations should be veiwed in the context of the results of earlier investigations which demonstrated that transection of the medial forebrain bundle reproduces several other components of the septal lesion syndrome.
