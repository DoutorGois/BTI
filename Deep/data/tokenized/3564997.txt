An overweight female newborn with multiple congenital anomalies died shortly after birth. The parents were cousins. The following abnormal findings were noted: Broad, square-shaped head with flat nose, misshapen ears, cleft palate, receding chin, short neck with additional skinfolds, disproportionately short limbs, transverse palmar creases, distal digital hypoplasia with hypoplastic finger- and toenails. Autopsy disclosed a number of further malformations including: dysplasia of the hippocampus, atypical lobation of the lungs with cystic-adenomatoid malformation of the left upper lobe, malrotation of the intestine, bilateral cystic renal dysplasia, bilateral atretic ureters plus a right accessory hydroureter, hypoplastic urinary bladder, uterus and vagina duplex and elongated, partly cystic ovaries. The pattern of malformations in this girl is very similar to that of 7 previously reported patients including two sets of siblings and one instance of parental consanguinity. All patients died shortly after birth. For proper genetic counselling and for prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis in a further pregnancy, it is important to recognize patients with the Fryns syndrome.
