Peripheral inflammatory stimuli may activate a brain neuroinflammatory processes with consequences in brain function. The present study investigated if anthocyanins (ANT) consumption was able to prevent the memory loss, the neuronal damage, and the neuroinflammatory processes triggered by the intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. C57BL6 male mice were treated with ANT (30-100 mg/kg by gavage). With a single dose or during 10 days, before be challenged with LPS (250 mug/kg intraperitoneally single administration), a classical inductor of inflammation. The data obtained showed that ANT was able to confer protection against the memory impairment after 10 days of ANT treatment (100 mg/kg). This phytonutrient also prevented the hypothermia episode induced by LPS. Moreover, ANT prevented the increase in protein carbonyl, NOx, and MDA levels in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (4 and 24 h) in animal challenged with LPS. ANT showed a protective effect on the increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines content, especially Interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumoral necrosis factor-alpha and on the reduction of IL-10 induced by LPS. ANT 100 mg/kg prevented the infiltration of peripheral immune cells in the hippocampus at 24 h post-LPS administration. In parallel, LPS increased the activity of myeloperoxidase in cortex and hippocampus, and ANT prevented this effect, also reducing microglia (Iba-1) and astrocyte (GFAP) immunoreactivity. Thus, our data support that ANT are a promising therapeutic component against brain disorders associated with process of neuroinflammation. Graphical Abstract .
