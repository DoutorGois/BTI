Synthesis and release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the rat hippocampal slices were examined to clarify the mechanism of modulation of ACh synthesis. Treatment with 2-(4-phenylpiperidino)cyclohexanol (AH5183, 50 microM), an inhibitor of ACh transport from cytosol to synaptic vesicles, inhibited the increase in ACh content of the membrane-bound fraction which is readily releasable, but did not affect the cytosolic ACh content. Under these conditions, the total ACh content reached a plateau value. These results indicate that ACh synthesis is modulated by cytosolic ACh content but not by the vesicular fraction.
