OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of early environment on the learning-memory ability of rats and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), and to explore the influence of early environment on development of rat brain in developing stage and possible regulation mechanisms. METHODS: Forty-five newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups (15 rats in each group): enriched environment group (EE group), isolated environment group (IE group) and normal control group (NC group). The pups were nurtured separately in their groups. The learning-memory abilities of the rats were measured by "Y"-arm maze test 28 to 29 days after birth. The number of neural cells and the expression of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampal CA3 and frontal lobe were were detected by Nissl's staining and immunohistochemistry respectively. RESULTS: The results of the "Y"-arm maze test showed that rats in the EE group needed less training times, and retained a higher percentage of memory than the other two groups(P<0.01). Rats in the IE group needed more training times, and retained a lower percentage of memory than the NC group (P<0.01). By Nissl's staining, the numbers of neural cells in the hippocampal CA3 and frontal lobe were highest in the EE group followed by the NC group. They were lowest in the IE group (P<0.01). By immunohistochemistry, the expression of BDNF in the hippocampal CA3 and frontal lobe were highest in the EE group followed by the NC group. It was lowest in the IE group (P<0.01). Results were similar for expression of TrkB. CONCLUSIONS: Early environment can affect the long-term brain development and brain function of rats by influencing the expression of BDNF and its receptor TrkB in the hippocampus and frontal lobe.
