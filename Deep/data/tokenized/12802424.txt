The structural (number and area of chromocenters) and optical (relative optical density of chromocenters) characteristics of condensed chromatin in hippocampal CA3 neurons in rats differing by excitability of the nervous system (intact and exposed to short-term emotional painful stress) depended on the time of the day and genotypical characteristics of the experimental animals. The detected changes were independent, which attests to specificity of mechanisms determining these features and/or can be attributed to structural and functional heterogeneity of condensed chromatin (heterochromatin, euchromatin, etc.).
