The mechanism by which 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) depletes forebrain dopamine is not fully understood, but a necessary step involves the formation of neurotoxic MPP+ by monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B). The histamine neurons in the brain contain MAO-B and are a possible site for the production of MPP+. Two weeks after MPTP injections (2 X 50 mg/kg i.p.) in C-57 mice, striatal dopamine was reduced by more than 70%. However, histamine levels in neocortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus were unaffected by this neurotoxic dose of MPTP. Thus, as in Parkinson's disease, central histaminergic systems appear to be spared in the MPTP model.
