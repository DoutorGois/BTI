The distribution of lithium in the rat brain following chronic i.p. injections of lithium chloride has been determined by a radiographic dielectric track registration technique. The study indicated significant differences in lithium distribution in various areas of the brain. Consistently high levels were observed in the neocortex and putamen, and low concentrations in the cerebellum and white matter structures such as the corpus callosum and basis pedunculi. Intermediate levels were found in the thalamus, hypothalamus, septal nuclei, dentate gyrus, hippocampus and substantia grisea centralis.
