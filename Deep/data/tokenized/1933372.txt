Dextromethorphan, an agent that blocks the neuronal-damaging effects of hypoxemia in vitro, was tested for its ability to prevent the neurotoxic effects of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA). Rats were treated with either saline, PCA, dextromethorphan, or the combination of PCA and increasing doses of dextromethorphan. Dextromethorphan provided a dose-related protection against the serotonin (5-HT)-depleting effects of PCA. These observations may offer a clue as to the mechanism responsible for PCA-induced neurotoxicity.
