The relation between hippocampal epileptiform activity and 8-arm radial maze performance was assessed following repetitive afterdischarges (ADs) evoked by stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 region (kindling). Hippocampal kindling, whether to stage V (generalized) convulsions or to a preconvulsive stage, induced deficits in radial maze performance, evaluated by correct arm entries in 8 choices or total maze run (trial) time. The deficits persisted at least until 21 days after the last AD. Hippocampal interictal spikes (ISs) were induced by kindling, but the rate of ISs declined to near zero in a few days. The rate or presence of ISs was not related to maze performance.
