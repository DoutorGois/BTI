beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP), also known as Abeta peptide, has a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and is also likely to be involved in the development of refractory epilepsy. The mechanism behind the association between beta-APP and refractory epilepsy remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to examine the levels of APP mRNA and beta-APP protein in patients with refractory epilepsy. Tissue samples were obtained from patients with chronic pharmacoresistant epilepsy who underwent surgery. Levels of APP mRNA and beta-APP protein in epileptic temporal lobe and hippocampal tissue were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The expression levels of protein significantly increased in the temporal cortex and the hippocampus of the patients with epilepsy. beta-APP may thus contribute to the pathogenesis of refractory epilepsy.
