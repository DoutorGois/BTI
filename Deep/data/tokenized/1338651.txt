All Ca2+ antagonists blocked tetrodotoxin-sensitive Ca2+ current (TTX-ICa) more potently than Na+ current (INa). Phenytoin and MK-801, at concentrations which had no effect on INa, could block TTX-ICa concentration-dependently. Valproic acid and phenobarbital had no effect on both TTX-ICa and INa. In particular, flunarizine and phenytoin have more potent inhibitory effects on TTX-ICa than other test drugs. These results suggest that the abnormal excess-excitation of TTX-sensitive Ca(2+)-conducting channels may be one of the trigger factors generating epilepsy.
