Incubation of rat hippocampal slices for 30 min in medium containing 900, 700, or 500 microM of O2 did not significantly change ATP, ADP, or CP levels, but when O2 content dropped to 100-200 microM the levels of ATP and CP decreased by 2 to 5 times. Under the same conditions CPK maximal solubilization was shown. Corticosterone acetate (CSA, 160 microM) did not show a membranotropic effect, nor did it influence the macroerg pool under conditions of high O2 content, but when O2 concentration was 100 microM a twofold increase of ATP and CP levels was observed. This effect correlated with a twofold increase of CPK membrane permeability. The results of this study permit us consider that membrane labilization is not a reflection of CSA neurotoxic effect in hypoxia. A relationship between CSA antihypoxic effect and macroerg pool increase is discussed.
