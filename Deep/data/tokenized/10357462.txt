Cocaine was microinfused bilaterally (50 microg/0.5 microl/side) into the medial preoptic area (MPOA) or nucleus accumbens (NA), 2 regions within the rat brain neural circuit known to mediate maternal behavior (MB). Additionally, 2 sites not involved in this neural circuit, the dorsal striatum and dorsal medial hippocampus, were used as control sites. Microinfusion of cocaine into the MPOA or NA impaired MB, whereas infusion into the control sites did not. MB impairment was not temporally coincident with the increased locomotor activity, also documented after cocaine infusion into the MPOA or NA, arguing strongly that impaired MB is a direct, specific effect of cocaine in these areas, not a derivative of increased motor activity. This is the first demonstration that cocaine action on single central nervous system (CNS) sites can impair MB to the same extent as systemic injections. Thus, cocaine's simultaneous effect on multiple CNS sites is not required for MB impairment.
