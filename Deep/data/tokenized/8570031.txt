Treatment with either haloperidol or sulpiride for 14 days increased the levels of Gs alpha and Gi alpha in the rat hippocampus, but decreased those of Golf alpha and Gi alpha in the rat striatum. Levels of Gq alpha/G11 alpha and Go alpha were not affected by the drugs. These results demonstrate that haloperidol and sulpiride regulate G protein expression in the hippocampus and striatum quite differently.
