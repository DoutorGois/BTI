A long lasting evoked response, generated in the hippocampal field CA1-CA2 following postsynaptic sequential discharge of hippocampal pyramids and entorhinal neurons, has been analyzed by multiple simultaneous surface and depth recordings in the guinea pig dorsal hippocampal region. Results obtained suggest that it can be associated with postsynaptic excitatory potentials evoked in the distal portion of the apical dendrites of field CA1-CA2 pyramids by perforant neurons selectively discharged by impulses of hippocampal origin.
