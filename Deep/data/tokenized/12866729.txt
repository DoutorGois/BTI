We examined the anxiolytic-like activity of (1S,3R,4S)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3,4-tricarboxylic acid (ACPT-I) using the Vogel conflict drinking test, while antidepressant-like effects of this compound were evaluated using Porsolt's test. ACPT-I, a selective group III mGlu receptor agonist, produced a dose-dependent anticonflict effect after intrahippocampal injections and antidepressant-like effect in rats after intraventricular injections. These data suggest that selective group III mGlu receptor agonists may become a new class of anxiolytics and/or antidepressants.
