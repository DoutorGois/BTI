The conditions on the occurrence of hysteresis of the amount of phosphorylated receptors were determined depending on the rhythmic frequency of presynaptic neuronal activity using the full and simplified models of synaptic plasticity for pyramidal hippocampal neurones. It is assumed that this phenomenon lies at the basis of the conservation of long-term potentiation.
