Oxidative stress appears to contribute to neurodegenerative outcomes after ischemia, hypoxia, and hyperoxia. The AP-1 transcription factor is made up of a family of regulatory proteins that can be activated by oxidative stress. In the present study, we examined AP-1 DNA binding activity in terms of specific participating AP-1 proteins in rat brain after hyperoxia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 100% oxygen under isobaric conditions over time. The AP-1 DNA binding activity present in the rat hippocampus and basal forebrain was characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) and the participating AP-1 proteins identified by immunodepletion/supershift and Western blotting analyses. The Fos and Jun proteins were localized by immunohistochemistry to hippocampus. There were significant increases in AP-1 DNA binding in both hippocampus and basal forebrain after hyperoxia. There was also a significant increase in c-Jun protein levels and the proportion of c-Jun present in AP-1 DNA binding complexes in hippocampal nuclei after hyperoxia. These results suggest that AP-1 activation via c-Jun binding to DNA is an important component of brain responses to oxidative stress.
