The influence of the oxydiacetate (ODA) and thiodiacetate (TDA) ligands on the physicochemical and biological properties of the oxidovanadium(IV) ternary complexes of the VO(L)(B) type, where L denotes ODA or TDA and B denotes 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) or 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), has been investigated. The stability of the complexes in aqueous solutions, assessed based on the potentiometric titration method, increases in the following direction: VO(TDA)(bipy) < VO(ODA)(bipy) < VO(TDA)(phen) < VO(ODA)(phen). Furthermore, the influence of the TDA and ODA ligands on the antioxidant activity of the oxidovanadium(IV) complexes toward superoxide free radical (O2(*-)), 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) cation radical (ABTS(+*)) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH(*)) has been examined and discussed. The reactivity of the complexes toward O2(*-) increases in the following direction: VO(TDA)(phen) < VO(TDA)(bipy) approximately VO(ODA)(bipy) < VO(ODA)(phen). The antioxidant activity against ABTS(+*) and DPPH(*) free radicals is higher for phen complexes, whereas the thiodiacetate complexes are more reactive than are the corresponding oxydiacetate ones. Finally, herein, the cytoprotective activity of the complexes against the oxidative damage generated exogenously by hydrogen peroxide in the hippocampal neuronal HT22 cell line (the MTT and LDH tests) is reported. In a low concentration (1 muM), the cytoprotective action of thiodiacetate complexes is much higher than that of the corresponding oxydiacetate complexes. However, in the higher concentration range (10 and 100 muM), the antioxidant activity of the complexes is overcompensated by their cytotoxic effect.
