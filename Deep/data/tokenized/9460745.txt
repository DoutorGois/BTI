Regional levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein were measured in the rat brain using enzyme immunoassay following seizures evoked by hippocampal kindling stimulations. One stimulation, which induced a brief, single episode of epileptiform activity in hippocampus and piriform cortex but not in parietal cortex or striatum, gave rise to a transient increase of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in dentate gyrus and CA3 region and a decrease in piriform cortex. After 40 rapidly recurring seizures, with epileptiform activity also involving parietal cortex and striatum, increases were observed in dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1 regions, piriform cortex and striatum. Maximum levels were reached at 2-24 h and brain-derived neurotrophic factor then returned to baseline except in dentate gyrus, where elevated protein content was sustained for four days. The differential regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels in various forebrain structures, which only partly correlates to messenger RNA changes, could indicate regional differences in protein release, antero- or retrograde transport, or brain-derived neurotrophic factor promotor activation. The dynamic changes of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in regions involved in the generation and spread of seizure activity may regulate excitability and trigger plastic responses in the post-seizure period.
