PURPOSE: In this study 30 patients with symptomatic epilepsy caused by cavernomas were investigated in a postoperative follow up study to assess predictors for postoperative outcome with respect to indications, time and approach of surgery. METHODS: Thirty patients with cavernomas refractory to medical treatment were scheduled for surgery based on the findings of high-resolution MR imaging and intensive EEG-video monitoring. Postoperative outcome of epilepsy was assessed by follow-up examinations based on the basis of classification by Engel and the International League against epilepsy (ILAE). RESULTS: The following variables were associated with good postoperative outcome: (1) complete resection of hemosiderin fringe surrounding the cavernoma was correlated to less postoperative seizure frequency versus incomplete resection of the hemosiderin fringe according to the outcome protocol of ILAE. (2) Lower duration of epilepsy at the time of operation was correlated to a better postoperative outcome with a benefit for recovery. (3) Absence of hemorrhage before surgery and unifocal seizure onset was a predictor for a favorable outcome, whereas bilateral or multifocal seizure onset zones showed poorer postoperative outcomes. (4) In patients with dual pathology (hippocampal sclerosis in addition to a cavernoma), lesionectomy plus hippocampectomy as opposed to lesionectomy only, had a better outcome than single lesionectomy. CONCLUSION: Postoperative outcome in patients with cavernomas should be the topic of further prospective multicenter studies involving a large number of patients. In addition to the ideal operation time and handling of dual pathology the role of extended resection including perilesional hemorrhages should be taken into account.
