Several lines of evidence suggest that the brain exhibits reduced plasticity with aging. However, a variety of soluble neurite outgrowth-promoting factors, such as neurotrophins, are not decreased in the aged brain, and aged neurons do not possess dramatically reduced growth potential. The possibility that aging results in reduced baseline substrate-bound neurite outgrowth-promoting activity in the central nervous system (CNS) was evaluated using tissue section culture. There were clear differences between brain regions in the extent of neurite outgrowth on both young and aged brain sections. However, no differences in the extent of neurite outgrowth were observed as a function of age. These results suggest that aging of the rat CNS is not accompanied by major alterations in the baseline neurite outgrowth-promoting substrate properties of the tissue.
