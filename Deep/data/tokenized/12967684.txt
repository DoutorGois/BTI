Since melatonin receptors have been found in the hippocampus of mammals it has been suggested that melatonin can modulate neuronal functions of hippocampal cells. The effect of melatonin (10 nM/l and 1 microM/l) on frequency and amplitude of epileptiform field potentials (EFP) elicited by low Mg(2+) or by bicuculline was tested in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices of rats. In the low Mg(2+) model, melatonin, applied in a near physiological concentration of 10 nM/l, exerts no effect on EFP in slices prepared at night or during the day. In a concentration of 1 microM/l, however, melatonin enhances the frequency of EFP to approximately 140% in slices prepared during the day. This effect was suppressed through simultaneous administration of the melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole (10 microM/l). In contrast, melatonin did not affect epileptic activity in slices prepared at night. Epileptiform discharges elicited by blocking the GABAergic inhibition (bicuculline model) were not affected by melatonin, either during the day or at night. The results indicate that melatonin affects epileptic activity in a diurnal manner and that the action of melatonin is different in relation to the epilepsy model.
