We studied the long-term effects of a postnatal choline supplementation (from birth till weaning) in the truncated MeCP2-308 mouse model of Rett syndrome. Adult male mutant hemizygous (hz) mice showed a reduction of locomotor activity compared to wild type (wt) littermates. Early choline treatment restored wt-like locomotor activity levels in hz mice. Reduced striatal choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity and decreased levels of cortical mRNA NGF were found in hz mice. Choline supplementation increased striatal ChAT activity and also enhanced NGF and BDNF expression in cortical and hippocampal regions. As a whole, postnatal choline supplementation attenuates some of the behavioural and neurobiological abnormalities of the Mecp2-308 phenotype.
