The possible involvement of protein kinase A (PKA) in the muscarinic inhibition of the slow afterhyperpolarizing current (IAHP) was investigated in rat hippocampal pyramidal cells. IAHP was recorded using the whole cell method in hippocampal slices, and Rp-cAMPS, a PKA antagonist, was applied intracellularly. The inhibition of IAHP by carbachol was not affected by Rp-cAMPS. In contrast, Rp-cAMPS reduced the cAMP-dependent inhibition of IAHP by norepinephrine. The results show that phosphorylation by PKA does not contribute to the muscarinic effect on IAHP.
