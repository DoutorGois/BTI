OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) can protect against hippocampal neuronal death after traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to moderate TBI with a controlled cortical impact device while in a state of halothane-induced anesthesia. Then, GDNF or artificial cerebrospinal fluid ([aCSF]; vehicle) was infused into the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle. In eight brain-injured and eight sham-operated rats, GDNF was infused continuously for 7 days (200 ng/day intracerebroventricularly at a rate of 8.35 ng/0.5 microl/hour). An equal volume of vehicle was infused at the same rate into the remaining eight brain-injured and eight sham-operated rats. Seven days post-injury, all rats were killed. Their brains were sectioned and stained with cresyl violet, and the hippocampal neuronal loss was evaluated in the CA2 and CA3 regions with the aid of microscopy. A parallel set of sections from each brain was subjected to immunoreaction with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astroglia marker). In the aCSF-treated group, TBI resulted in a significant neuronal loss in the CA2 (60%, p < 0.05) and CA3 regions (68%, p < 0.05) compared with the sham-operated control animals. Compared with control rats infused with aCSF, GDNF infusion significantly decreased the TBI-induced neuronal loss in both the CA2 (58%, p < 0.05) and CA3 regions (51%, p < 0.05). There was no difference in the number of GFAP-positive astroglial cells in the GDNF-infused rats in the TBI and sham-operated groups compared with the respective vehicle-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: The authors found that GDNF treatment following TBI is neuroprotective.
