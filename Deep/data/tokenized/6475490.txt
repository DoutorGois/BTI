Relatively little work has been done on the structural effects of organic lead in the central nervous system (CNS), although this form of lead may be a significant fraction of total brain lead. We tested a number of easily measured light-histological parameters of neuronal development in rats for sensitivity to (a) normal growth between 18 and 28 days of life and (b) the effect of weekly injections of tetramethyl lead (TML), administered from 1 week after conception until post-natal day 6. Several of the histological parameters were found to be sensitive to normal growth, but none showed any effect of organic lead treatment. This was despite a small but significant decrease in brain weight, and a significant increase in body/brain weight ratio, with tetramethyl lead treatment. The body/brain weight ratio was the parameter most sensitive to tetramethyl lead treatment. Possible reasons for the disparity between weight and histological parameters are discussed, with reference to previous workers' findings concerning the effects of organic lead on the development of myelin in the CNS and the availability of organic lead to brain tissue.
