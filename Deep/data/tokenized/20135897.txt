Exploring stem cells is a fascinating task, especially in a discipline where the use of stem cells seems far-fetched at first glance, as is the case in psychiatry. In this article we would like to provide a brief overview of the current situation in relation to the treatment of mental diseases. For reasons that we will explain, this review will focus on affective disorders. The following section will give a more detailed account of stem-cell biology including current basic science approaches presenting in-vivo and in-vitro techniques. The final part will then look into future perspectives of using these stem cells to cure mental illnesses, and discuss the related challenges and opportunities.
