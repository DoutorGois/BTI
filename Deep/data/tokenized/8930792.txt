Iron is essential for a variety of intracellular functions. Accordingly, the transfer of iron from blood to brain is vital for normal brain function. In the CNS, the receptor for iron-transferrin is generally accepted to be located in endothelial cells, whereas its occurrence in other cell types is less well established. I have investigated the distribution of the transferrin receptor in the adult mouse central nervous system by immunohistochemistry by using a monoclonal antibody raised against the transferrin receptor protein. Immunoreactive cell types comprised brain capillary endothelial cells, excluding those of circumventricular organs, and choroid plexus epithelial cells. Moreover, transferrin receptor immunoreactivity was detected intraneuronally in several brain regions without access to peripheral blood. The immunoreactive cell bodies were mainly confined to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, habenular nucleus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, pontine nuclei, reticular formation, several cranial nerve nuclei, deep cerebellar nuclei, and cerebellar cortex. Transferrin receptor immunoreactivity was not detected in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or microglial cells. The occurrence of transferrin receptors at brain-barrier sites, i.e., the brain endothelium and choroid plexus epithelium, and the presence of the receptors intraneuronally are in accordance with the generally held belief that iron is released from liver transferrin and transported through capillaries and the choroid plexus into the brain interstitium. Subsequently, iron may be linked to brain transferrin synthesized within oligodendrocytes and choroid plexus epithelial cells followed by a concomitant uptake of iron-transferrin in neurons expressing transferrin receptors. The clinical importance of the intraneuronal transferrin receptor expression is discussed.
