A dysregulated immune system influencing pathways for cytokine regulation and growth factor expression is implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokines and growth factors with an ultra-sensitive immunoassay system in 43 medication-free suicide attempters and 20 healthy male volunteers. CSF vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and CSF interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels were significantly lower in suicide attempters compared with healthy controls. Further, CSF VEGF showed a significant negative correlation with depression severity. CSF IL-6 levels did not differ between suicide attempters and healthy controls. Low CSF levels of VEGF may represent a lack of trophic support to neurons and downregulation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus reflecting more severe depressive states. IL-8 has also been reported as important in neuroprotection as well as having chemokine activity in the innate immune response. The results support a role for an impaired innate immunity and dysregulation of neuroprotection in the pathophysiology of depression and suicidal behavior.
