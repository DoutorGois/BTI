Tyrosinemia type II is an inborn error of metabolism caused by a mutation in a gene encoding the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase leading to an accumulation of tyrosine in the body, and is associated with neurologic and development difficulties in numerous patients. Because the accumulation of tyrosine promotes oxidative stress and DNA damage, the main aim of this study was to investigate the possible antioxidant and neuroprotective effects of omega-3 treatment in a chemically-induced model of Tyrosinemia type II in hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex of rats. Our results showed chronic administration of L-tyrosine increased the frequency and the index of DNA damage, as well as the 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex. Moreover, omega-3 fatty acid treatment totally prevented increased DNA damage in the striatum and hippocampus, and partially prevented in the cerebral cortex, whereas the increase in 8-OHdG levels was totally prevented by omega-3 fatty acid treatment in hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the main accumulating metabolite in Tyrosinemia type II induce DNA damage in hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex, possibly mediated by free radical production, and the supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids was able to prevent this damage, suggesting that could be involved in the prevention of oxidative damage to DNA in this disease. Thus, omega-3 fatty acids supplementation to Tyrosinemia type II patients may represent a new therapeutic approach and a possible adjuvant to the curren t treatment of this disease.
