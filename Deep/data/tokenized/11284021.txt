Astrocytosis is a common feature of amyloid plaques, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), along with activated microglia, neurofibrillary tangles, and beta-amyloid (beta A) deposition. However, the relationship between astrocytosis and neurodegeneration remains unclear. To assess whether beta A-stimulated astrocytes can damage neurons and contribute to beta A neurotoxicity, we studied the effects of beta A treatment in astrocytic/neuronal co-cultures, obtained from rat embryonic brain tissue. We found that in neuronal cultures conditioned by beta A-treated astrocytes, but not directly in contact with beta A, the number of apoptotic cells increased, doubling the values of controls. In astrocytes, beta A did not cause astrocytic cell death, nor did produce changes in nitric oxide or prostaglandin E(2) levels. In contrast, S-100 beta expression was remarkably increased. Our data show for the first time that beta A--astrocytic interaction produces a detrimental effect on neurons, which may contribute to neurodegeneration in AD.
