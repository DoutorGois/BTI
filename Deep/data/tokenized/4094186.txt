Bifemelane hydrochloride (MCI-2016) increased high K+-evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release from cortical and hippocampal slices of rats. The increasing effect of MCI-2016 was abolished in the absence of Ca ion and by pretreatment of reserpine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.). These results suggest that monoaminergic neurons may be related to the enhancement of ACh release by MCI-2016. High K+-evoked ACh release from cortical slices was significantly decreased during aging. The decrease in ACh release was ameliorated by pretreatment of MCI-2016 (30 mg/kg, i.p.).
