Interactions between the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, caudate nucleus head and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus were studied during differentiation of temporal intervals in two rhesus monkeys by means of correlational analysis. The change in the signal significance of the experimental situation (time course of the investigated period) changed the animals activity. This was manifested in spatial-temporal dynamics of correlation coefficients. The participation of separate brain structures or their complexes in the differentiation of temporal intervals is discussed.
