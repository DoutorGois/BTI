In dorsolateral hippocampal lesioned, Sham and control animals, the total number of splenocytes was determined and macrophages, B cells and T cells were isolated and their percentage distribution in total splenocytes were determined. The leukocyte migration inhibition was studied in these groups using different fractions of splenocytes namely whole splenocytes, macrophage removed fraction, and nylon wool eluted T cell population. The same groups were also studied after an antigenic challenge. The results indicate alterations in the macrophages, adherent cell population as well as T cell population in lesioned and Sham animals and also in their immunized groups. These altered cell sub-populations may be responsible for the altered migration.
