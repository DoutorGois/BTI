We aimed at demonstrating that corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), a plasma glycoprotein binding glucocorticoids with high affinity in blood, endorses a major role under stress conditions by regulating free glucocorticoid access to the brain and thereby influences glucocorticoid-dependent behaviors. Hence, we compared CBG-deficient mice (Cbg-/-) and their controls (Cbg+/+) in a specific memory task, i.e. the delayed alternation behavior, requiring memory retrieval both under stress and nonstress conditions and previously shown to be dependent on hippocampal glucocorticoid levels. Our results evidence that Cbg-/- mice, unlike controls, remain insensitive to stress applied before memory retrieval. Furthermore, under stress conditions, we observed a blunted surge of corticosterone (CORT) in plasma and no free CORT rise in the hippocampus of Cbg-/-. Moreover, intrahippocampal infusion of CORT through implanted cannulae was used to mimic stress CORT rise before memory retrieval. This infusion of CORT reproduced memory retrieval impairments in Cbg-/- as in Cbg+/+ controls. Finally, we provide evidence that Cbg-/- mice exhibit a normal adrenal response to stress and ACTH. Given that CBG deficiency is known to markedly impact on CORT clearance from plasma, our current article demonstrates that Cbg-/- insensitivity in memory retrieval after stress results from the blunted CORT response due to increased CORT clearance. Overall, our data suggest that the impact of CBG genetic deficiency on various behavioral patterns reported previously stems from a smaller CORT reservoir in blood. Inasmuch as CBG discloses interindividual variations, such a parameter ought to be taken into account when studying stress-induced glucocorticoid action in brain.
