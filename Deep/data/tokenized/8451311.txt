The effects of the peripherally administered sufentanil citrate (S), a potent opioid agonist with high affinity for mu receptors on the spatial navigation task, were tested in normotensive Wistar (NR) and renal hypertensive rats (RHR). Rats were injected subcutaneously once daily in doses of 0.25 or 1 microgram/kg S before the water maze training. In NR rats, weak effects of 0.25 micrograms/kg S and impairments after 1 microgram/kg S were seen, whereas in RHR 0.25 and 1 microgram/kg S showed clearcut impairments. These data from the Morris water maze task support previous reports that RHR have an increased sensitivity for opioid agonists.
