Changes in neuropeptide Y (NPY) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d)-positive neurons in the hippocampus were investigated 5, 10 and 20 days after kainic acid (KA) administration using a double labeling method. The numbers of NADPH-d-positive-only and NPY/NADPH-d-positive neurons decreased in the CA1/2-CA3 regions of the hippocampus, 5, 10 and 20 days after KA administration, however, the number of NPY-positive-only neurons increased in the same regions 5 and 10 days after KA administration. In the dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus, the numbers of NPY-positive-only, NADPH-d-positive-only and NPY/NADPH-d-positive neurons increased 5 days after KA administration, and 20 days after KA administration, the number of NADPH-d-positive-only neurons decreased to levels similar to or lower than the level of the controls. However, the numbers of NPY/NADPH-d-positive and NPY-positive-only neurons in the DG region 20 days after KA administration remained at control levels. These results indicate that, NADPH-d-positive-only neurons are vulnerable to, and NPY-positive-only neurons are resistant to KA-induced seizures in the whole hippocampus, but that NPY/NADPH-d-positive neurons have different sensitivities in subregions of the hippocampus to KA-induced seizures. In addition, the present findings provide the first statistical and morphological evidence, which demonstrates that NPY-positive-only, NADPH-d-positive-only and NPY/NADPH-d-positive neurons in the hippocampus have different sensitivities to KA-induced seizures.
