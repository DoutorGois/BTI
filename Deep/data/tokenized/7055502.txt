Hippocampal unit responses were recorded during extinction of classically conditioned nictitating membrane (NM) behavior in the rabbit. Prior studies have shown that during the acquisition phase of nictitating membrane conditioning, the frequency of hippocampal cell firing increases at a faster rate (across trials) than learned behavior. Results reported here show that, during the early phases of extinction, conditioned hippocampal unit responses decrement at a faster rate than learned NM behavior. Furthermore, only certain components of the conditioned hippocampal unit response display robust spontaneous recovery across successive days of extinction training. In all, results show that changes in the activity of hippocampal neurons predict changes in learned behavior over trials of conditioning and extinction, and demonstrate that hippocampal cellular activity is particularly sensitive to stimulus configurations or environmental contingencies that produce changes in behavior.
