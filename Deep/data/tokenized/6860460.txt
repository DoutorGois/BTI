Both normal and commissure-sectioned rabbits were examined over a variety of visual discrimination tasks. The visual displays were projected at various distances within the frontal visual field of the rabbit. The learning of either a black-white or a vertical-horizontal problem was found to be normal in commissure-cut animals. Furthermore, no deficit in angular acuity was observed. However, when they were tested with the patterns displayed at 25 cm distance, large impairments were found in the commissure-sectioned animals.
