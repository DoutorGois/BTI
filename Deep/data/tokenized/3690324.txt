The effects of caffeine were investigated on the extracellular excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) recorded in the stratum radiatum of CA1 of the rat hippocampal slice in response to stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. Caffeine in concentrations from 500 microM to 10 mM caused an increase in the amplitude of the EPSP, which reached a peak after 5-10 min perfusion. This increase was antagonized by pretreatment with 20 microM trifluoperazine. Paired-pulse facilitation, augmentation and potentiation were strongly inhibited by caffeine. Augmentation was most sensitive to caffeine, being abolished by 500 microM caffeine. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation was not significantly inhibited by caffeine either by 5-10 min or by 60 min perfusion with 10 mM caffeine. Moreover, the caffeine-induced increase in the low-frequency EPSP could be reversed by 30 min washout, demonstrating that it was not an LTP type increase.
