MKC-231, a putative cholinergic activity, is reported to improve learning and memory impaired in AF64A-treated animals. MKC-231 enhances high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) known as the rate-limiting step of acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. We investigated the mode of action (MOA) of HACU enhancement by MKC-231. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of AF64A (3 nmol/brain) resulted in significant HACU reduction in hippocampal synaptosomes. Treatment with MKC-231 increased Vmax of HACU and Bmax of [3H]-HC-3 binding 1.6 and 1.7-fold, respectively. In studies of [3H]-MKC-231 binding and Biacore analysis, MKC-231 showed noticeable affinity for cloned high-affinity choline transporters (CHT1). The present study suggests that MKC-231 directly affects trafficking of CHT1 and increases the numbers of transporter, working for HACU, at the synaptic membrane.
