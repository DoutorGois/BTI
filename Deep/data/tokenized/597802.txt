Electrodes were implanted to dorsal hippocampus (CA1), ventral CA1, DOrsal dentate gyrus or ventral dentate gyrus. Epileptiform afterdischarge (AD) thresholds were lower in dorsal areas than in ventral areas. Dorsal areas, however, required a greater number of stimulations to develop ("kindle") a fully generalized convulsion than did ventral areas. Thresholds and kindling rates in the dentate gyrus were intermediate between dorsal and ventral CA1, except for the ventral dentate which had higher AD thresholds than ventral CA1. Secondary sites within the hippocampus subsequently kindled within a few stimulations following completion of kindling in the primary site, regardless of which hippocampal area served as the primary site.
