The novel mouse gene Nope was identified due to its proximity to the Punc gene on chromosome 9. With a domain structure of four immunoglobulin domains, five fibronectin type III repeats, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, Nope encodes a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface proteins. It displays a high level of similarity to Punc, as well as to guidance receptors such as the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer protein and Neogenin. Nope is expressed during embryonic development in the notochord, in developing skeletal muscles, and later in the ventricular zone of the nervous system. In the adult brain, Nope can be detected in the hippocampus. Radiation hybrid mapping of Nope, Punc, and Neogenin placed all three genes in close vicinity on mouse chromosome 9.
