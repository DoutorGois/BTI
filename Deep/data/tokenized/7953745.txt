The distribution and levels of the astrocytic gap junction protein, connexin43 (Cx43) was analyzed in various regions of brain as a function of time after neuronal loss and consequent reactive gliosis induced by bilateral carotid occlusion in rats. In the striatum 2 days after induction of ischemia, immunostaining intensity for Cx43 increased in animals exhibiting mild to moderate striatal damage, whereas areas of reduced staining surrounded by elevated levels of Cx43 immunoreactivity were observed in animals with severe ischemic damage. Immunolabelling of glial cell bodies was evident in ischemic, but not normal, striatum. Similar, though less dramatic, changes were seen at 7 days post-ischemia. Compared with the fine punctate pattern of Cx43 staining seen in normal striatum, ischemic striatal areas contained large aggregates of punctate profiles. In the hippocampus, increased immunostaining was seen at 2 and 7 days post-ischemia and, unlike normal hippocampus, neurons in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer were surrounded by a network of Cx43-immunoreactive puncta at the latter survival time. Immuno-EM analysis of ischemic tissue revealed numerous immunolabelled gap junctions among astrocytic processes in the vicinity of degenerating neurons and elevated levels of intracellular Cx43 immunoreactivity in astrocytic processes and cell bodies. No differences in protein levels or phosphorylation states of Cx43 were detected in either hippocampus or striatum by Western blot analyses of ischemic and control tissue. These results suggest that astrocytes respond to an ischemic insult by reorganizing their gap junctions, that the qualitative nature of their response is dependent on the severity of neuronal damage or loss, and that a pool of Cx43 normally undetectable by immunohistochemistry may contribute to the ischemia-induced elevations of immunolabelling for this protein.
