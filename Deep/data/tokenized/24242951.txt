Transient receptor potential channel 1 (TRPC1; a cation channel activated by store depletion and/or through an intracellular messenger) is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain. To study the physiological function of TRPC1, we investigated the role of endogenously expressed TRPC1 in glutamate-induced cell death, using the murine hippocampal cell line HT22. Knocking down TRPC1 mRNA using TRPC1-shRNA or blocking of TRPC channels using 2-APB (>/=200 muM) robustly attenuated glutamate-induced cell death after 24 h of incubation with 5 mM glutamate. Glutamate toxicity in HT22 cells seems to involve metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 since MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine), an mGluR5 antagonist (>/=100 muM), abrogated glutamate toxicity. Furthermore, a direct activation of mGluR5 by CHPG [(RS)-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine; 100 muM or 300 muM] promoted HT22 cell death. TRPC1 knock-down markedly reduced CHPG-induced cell death. These observations suggest that glutamate-induced cell death in HT22 cells activates mGluR5 receptors, which significantly increases Ca(2+) influx through TRPC1 channels. TRPC1 knock-down prevented glutamate- and CHPG-induced cell death, suggesting that glutamate-induced toxicity in HT22 cells is mediated through TRPC1 channels and an mGluR5-dependent pathway. Together, this work provides evidence for a novel receptor activation pathway of TRPC1 in glutamate-induced toxicity.
