Staufen1 (Stau1) is an RNA-binding protein involved in transport, localization, decay, and translational control of mRNA. In neurons, it is present in cell bodies and also in RNA granules which are transported along dendrites. Dendritic mRNA localization might be involved in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory. To determine the role of Stau1 in synaptic function, we examined the effects of Stau1 down-regulation in hippocampal slice cultures using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Biolistic transfection of Stau1 siRNA resulted in selective down-regulation of Stau1 in slice cultures. Consistent with a role of Stau1 in transporting mRNAs required for synaptic plasticity, Stau1 down-regulation impaired the late form of chemically induced long-term potentiation (L-LTP) without affecting early-LTP, mGluR1/5-mediated long-term depression, or basal evoked synaptic transmission. Stau1 down-regulation decreased the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, suggesting a role in maintaining efficacy at hippocampal synapses. At the cellular level, Stau1 down-regulation shifted spine shape from regular to elongated spines, without changes in spine density. The change in spine shape could be rescued by an RNA interference-resistant Stau1 isoform. Therefore, Stau1 is important for processing and/or transporting in dendrites mRNAs that are critical in regulation of synaptic strength and maintenance of functional connectivity changes underlying hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.
