Telemetrical recordings of the EEG and stereoelectroencephalographic (SEEG) studies of patients with generalized epilepsy demonstrated a high informativeness of these techniques. The existence of focal changes in the routine EEG recording require an obligatory control by telemetrical EEG studies. An absence of focal changes in the EEG and teleEEG recording may serve as an indication for teleSEEG studies with the use of durative deep electrodoes. In patients with generalized seizures a trigger focus in the frontal or temporal lobe may be found quite frequently.
