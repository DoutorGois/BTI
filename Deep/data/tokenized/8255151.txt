We investigated the effects of intrahypothalamic or hippocampal injection of GABA receptor agonists on hyperglycemia induced by hippocampal neostigmine. Prior to the injection of neostigmine (50 nmol) into the hippocampus (HPC), muscimol (0.01-1 nmol) or baclofen (1 nmol) was injected into the bilateral ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Muscimol suppressed the hyperglycemia in a dose-dependent manner, but baclofen affected it only minimally. In contrast, neither hippocampal muscimol (1 or 2.5 nmol) nor baclofen (1 nmol) suppressed the hippocampal neostigmine-dependent hyperglycemia. Intrahypothalamic muscimol (1 nmol) also decreased the changes in hepatic venous plasma glucagon and epinephrine significantly. These results indicate that intrahypothalamic muscimol suppresses hyperglycemia caused by cholinergic neurons originating from the HPC, indicating existence of the location specificity.
