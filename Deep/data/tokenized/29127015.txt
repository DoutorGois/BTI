Muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptors play an important role in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex. Potentiation of NMDA receptors as a consequence of muscarinic acetylcholine M1 receptor activation is a crucial event mediating the cholinergic modulation of synaptic plasticity, which is a cellular mechanism for learning and memory. In Alzheimer's disease, the cholinergic input to the hippocampus and cortex is severely degenerated, and agonists or positive allosteric modulators of M1 receptors are therefore thought to be of potential use to treat the deficits in cognitive functions in Alzheimer's disease. In this study we developed a simple system in which muscarinic modulation of NMDA receptors can be studied in vitro. Human M1 receptors and NR1/2B NMDA receptors were co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes and various muscarinic agonists were assessed for their modulatory effects on NMDA receptor-mediated responses. As expected, NMDA receptor-mediated responses were potentiated by oxotremorine-M, oxotremorine or xanomeline when the drugs were applied between subsequent NMDA responses, an effect which was fully blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. However, in oocytes expressing NR1/2B NMDA receptors but not muscarinic M1 receptors, oxotremorine-M co-applied with NMDA also resulted in a potentiation of NMDA currents and this effect was not blocked by atropine, demonstrating that oxotremorine-M is able to directly potentiate NMDA receptors. Oxotremorine, which is a close analogue of oxotremorine-M, and xanomeline, a chemically distinct muscarinic agonist, did not potentiate NMDA receptors by this direct mechanism. Comparing the chemical structures of the three different muscarinic agonists used in this study suggests that the tri-methyl ammonium moiety present in oxotremorine-M is important for the compound's interaction with NMDA receptors.
