BACKGROUNDS: Irradiation of the hippocampus plays a role in neurocognitive toxicity. Its delineation is complex and in practice different head position can vary hippocampus morphology on axial images; so atlas in a single standard position can result ineffective to describe different hippocampal morphologies in different head set-up. The purpose of our study was to develop a guide based on magnetic resonance imaging for hippocampus delineation in three different head set-ups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three patients were selected to elaborate our guide. Patients were submitted to a planning computed tomography of the brain district in different head positions: 1 degrees patient in neutral, 2 degrees patient in over-extended and 3 degrees patient in head hypo-extended position; axial images of 2-mm thickness were obtained. Computed tomography images were fused with diagnostic brain magnetic resonance images; then hippocampus was delineated according to RTOG atlas. Contours were revised by two neuro-radiologists with >5-year expertise in neuroimaging. RESULTS: A guide was developed for each of three head positions considered. RTOG atlas provided an easy and reliable guide for hippocampus delineation in neutral position of the head. Discrepancies were observed in cranial and caudal limit in case of head over/hypo-extension, as well as in hippocampal morphology near the encephalic trunk where hippocampus takes an oblong shape in over-extended set-up, and short and stocky in hypo-extension. CONCLUSION: Our guide can represent a useful tool for hippocampal delineation in clinical practice and for different anatomic variations due to different head positions. Certainly, it should be validated in practice.
