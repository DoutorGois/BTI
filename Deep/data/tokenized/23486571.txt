Experiments on rats have showed that neurodegenerative damage to the brain induced by injection of a neurotoxic beta-amyloid protein fragment beta25-35into the basal giant cell nuclei of Meynert activated caspase-3 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus on day 3 after injury. Intranasal administration of antibodies to glutamate in a dose of 300 mu g/kg 1 h after damage reduced enzyme activity in these structures in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.
