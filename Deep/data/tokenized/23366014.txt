Conducting polymers are promising materials for fabrication of microelectrode arrays for both neural stimulation and recording. Our ability to engineer the morphology and composition of polypyrrole together with its suitability as an electrically addressable tissue/cell substrate have been used to develop an inexpensive, disposable three-dimensional polymeric array for use in neuronal culture and drug discovery. These arrays could be interfaced with a fixed, parallel stimulation and optical imaging system, amenable to automated handling and data analysis.
