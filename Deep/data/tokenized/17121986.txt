The hippocampal formation is a highly plastic brain structure that undergoes structural remodeling in response to internal and external challenges such as metabolic imbalance and repeated stress. We investigated whether the extreme alterations in metabolic status that occur during the course of hibernation in European hamsters cause structural changes in the dendritic arborizations of the CA3 pyramidal neurons and their main excitatory afferents, the mossy fiber terminals (MFT), that originate in the dentate gyrus. We report that apical, but not basal, dendritic trees of Golgi-impregnated CA3 principal neurons are significantly shorter, less branched, and less spiny in hypothermic hamsters compared with active animals. After the induction of arousal from torpor, within 2 h, the apical dendritic lengths, branching patterns, and spine density estimations returned to levels found in active, euthermic hamsters. The ultrastructure of MFT in hibernating hamsters showed a significant reduction in synaptic vesicle density and in the percentage of MFT area covered by spine profiles. Awakened hamsters showed restoration of MFT morphology to that seen in active animals. MFT of torpid animals also showed a significant increase in the percentage area of mitochondrial profiles that remained higher 3 h after induced arousal from hibernation compared with euthermic controls. Thus, the torpid/awakening cycle of the hibernating European hamster causes a rapid and reversible morphological reorganization of intrahippocampal subregions involved in information processing. The reported reductions in morphological connectivity between the dentate gyrus and the CA3 subregions could underlie the cessation of exploratory activity and spatial navigation skills during hibernation.
