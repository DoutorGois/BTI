An investigation of the phase shifts between rhythmic constituents of the electrical activity of the hippocampus, somatosensory, motor, and visual areas of the neocortex of the rabbit during an increase in the frequency of stimulation of the reticular formation from 60 to 1000 imp/sec revealed the fluctuating character of the decrease in the phase shift in the theta range in pairings involving the visual area and of its increase in the remaining pairings. In the delta range, at the same time, an increase was observed in the phase angle in pairings between the hippocampus, somatosensory, and motor areas at a stimulation frequency above 200 imp/sec, while in the alpha range the changes in the phase shift were variously directed in character.
