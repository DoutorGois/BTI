Excessive glutamate receptor stimulation can produce rapid disruption of dendritic morphology, including dendritic beading. We recently showed that transient N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) exposure resulted in irreversible loss of synaptic function and loss of microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) from apical dendrites. The present study examined the initiation and progression of dendritic injury in mouse hippocampal slices following this excitotoxic stimulus. NMDA exposure (30 microM, 10 min) produced irregularly shaped dendritic swellings, evident first in distal apical dendrite branches, and later (20-90 min) involving most proximal dendrites. Over the same time course, immunoreactivity for the microtubule-associated protein MAP2 was progressively lost from apical dendrites, and increased in CA1 somata. This damage and MAP2 loss was Ca2+-dependent, and was not reversible within the time course of these experiments (90 min post-NMDA washout). Formation of regularly-spaced, spherical dendritic varicosities (dendritic beading) was rarely observed, except when NMDA was applied in Ca2+-free ACSF. Under these conditions, beading appeared predominant in interneurons, as assessed from experiments with GAD67-GFP (Deltaneo) mice. Ca2+-removal was associated with significantly better preservation of dendritic structure (MAP2) following NMDA exposure, and other ionic fluxes (sensitive to Gd3+ and spermine) may contribute to residual damage occurring in Ca2+-free conditions. These results suggest that irregularly shaped dendritic swelling is a Ca2+-dependent degenerative event that may be quite different from Ca2+-independent dendritic beading, and can be a predominant type of injury in CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices.
