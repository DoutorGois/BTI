Immunohistochemical techniques were used to localize dynorphin B and methionine-enkephalin in the mouse hippocampus. Methionine-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was found within the somata of interneurons distributed mainly in and around the CA1 stratum pyramidale and stratum granulosum as well as in the mossy fibers. Dynorphin B appeared to be confined to the mossy fiber pathway. In addition, we observed a difference between the inbred mouse strains DBA/2 and C57BL/6 with regard to the areas of the dynorphinergic mossy fiber projections: the intra- and infrapyramidal terminal fields were larger in the latter group.
