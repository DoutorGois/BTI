Oligomerization of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a seminal event in Alzheimer's disease. Abeta42, which is only two amino acids longer than Abeta40, is particularly pathogenic. Why this is so has not been elucidated fully. We report here results of computational and experimental studies revealing a C-terminal turn at Val36-Gly37 in Abeta42 that is not present in Abeta40. The dihedral angles of residues 36 and 37 in an Ile31-Ala42 peptide were consistent with beta-turns, and a beta-hairpin-like structure was indeed observed that was stabilized by hydrogen bonds and by hydrophobic interactions between residues 31-35 and residues 38-42. In contrast, Abeta(31-40) mainly existed as a statistical coil. To study the system experimentally, we chemically synthesized Abeta peptides containing amino acid substitutions designed to stabilize or destabilize the hairpin. The triple substitution Gly33Val-Val36Pro-Gly38Val ("VPV") facilitated Abeta42 hexamer and nonamer formation, while inhibiting formation of classical amyloid-type fibrils. These assemblies were as toxic as were assemblies from wild-type Abeta42. When substituted into Abeta40, the VPV substitution caused the peptide to oligomerize similarly to Abeta42. The modified Abeta40 was significantly more toxic than Abeta40. The double substitution d-Pro36-l-Pro37 abolished hexamer and dodecamer formation by Abeta42 and produced an oligomer size distribution similar to that of Abeta40. Our data suggest that the Val36-Gly37 turn could be the sine qua non of Abeta42. If true, this structure would be an exceptionally important therapeutic target.
