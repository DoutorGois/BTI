1-Aminocyclopentane-trans-1S,3R-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD), a compound which selectively activates a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), suppresses hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission. This depression is not antagonizable by L-2-amino-3-phosphonoproprionic acid (L-AP3), an agent which counteracts mGluR-induced phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism in several neuronal systems. Therefore, we believe that 1S,3R-ACPD activates a novel hippocampal mGluR subtype that is either insensitive to L-AP3 blockade and/or linked to an effector system that does not involve PI turnover.
