Spontaneous and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-evoked single-channel currents were studied in outside-out patches isolated from cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Both spontaneous and NMDA-evoked single-channel currents reversed at potentials close to 0 mV and exhibited multiple amplitude levels of similar amplitude. Both spontaneous and NMDA-evoked single-channel currents were inhibited by Mg2+ in a voltage-dependent manner and by 7-chlorokynurenic acid. The activity of spontaneous single-channel currents was reduced by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonists, but by one to three orders of magnitude less than expected assuming that the spontaneous activity is due to an ambient NMDA receptor agonist present in the extracellular solution. Our results suggest that, similar to other ligand-gated ion channels, NMDA receptor channels have a dual mode of activation--spontaneous and agonist induced.
