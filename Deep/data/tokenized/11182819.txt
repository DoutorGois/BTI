Quantitative cytochemical assay showed that single injection of delta sleep-inducing peptide increased monoamine oxidase activity (substrates: serotonin and tryptamine) in the caudate and accumbens nuclei and glutamate dehydrogenase activity in the hippocampus of stress-resistant Wistar rats chronically treated with L-DOPA. Enzyme activities in the sensorimotor cortex did not change. Delta sleep-inducing peptide had no effects on acetylcholine esterase and aminopeptidase activities in the brain of Wistar rats.
