Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rapidly enhances synaptic transmission among the hippocampal neurons. In order to examine which component of glutamate receptors participates in synaptic potentiation by BDNF, we have studied the effect of glutamate antagonists on excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) enhanced by BDNF, using cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons. In the presence of AP5, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, BDNF depressed the EPSCs. In contrast, BDNF enhanced the EPSCs in the presence of a non-NMDA antagonist CNQX. Our results suggest that BDNF acutely activates synaptic transmission via NMDA, but suppresses it via non-NMDA receptors in the hippocampus.
