1. Multi-unit activity (MUA) was recorded together with gross activity in different structures during various states of sleep in 43 rats. The records were made by means of telemetry from lateral hypothalamus, nucleus ruber, formatio reticularis, dorsal hippocampus and the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum (VMT) surrounding the nucleus interpeduncularis. 2. The records during paradoxical sleep showed slow rhythmic theta waves located in the VMT and the dorsal hippocampus. In these two structures the MUA was mainly organized in periodic patterns of discharges. In the other structures a continuous increment of the basic level of discharge was superimposed on the periodic patterns. 3. The similarity of the hippocampal and VMT records strengthens the hypothesis that the VMT region has anatomical and functional connections with the limbic system.
