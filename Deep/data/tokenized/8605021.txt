In the mammalian nervous system, several basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins have been identified that may play essential roles in neurogenesis or neural development. This paper describes a novel bHLH protein in rat brain, which has a bHLH domain highly homologous with that of MATH-2 and NeuroD. On the other hand, the amino-acid sequence of the other regions had little homology with those of the known proteins. This protein consists of 381 amino acids and was detected only in neural tissue, indicating that it has an important role specific to neuronal activities.
