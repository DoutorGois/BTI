The presence, pharmacological properties and anatomical distribution of serotonin-1A and serotonin-1B receptor subtypes were studied in the human brain by both radioligand binding assays and autoradiographic procedures. Frontal cortices and hippocampi from human brains obtained at autopsy without evidence of neurological disease were used in this study. [3H]5-HT was used to label both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor subtypes. 5-HT1A receptors were selectively labeled by [3H]8-hydroxy-2[di-N-propylamino]tetralin, while 5-HT1B receptors were labeled by (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]CYP) in the presence of 30 microM isoprenaline. The pharmacological profile of 5-HT1A receptors in human brain tissue was very similar to those previously found in rat and pig brain tissues. The general anatomical distribution of these sites was also similar to that found in the rat brain, although some differences were observed when analyzed at the microscopic level. In contrast to 5-HT1A receptors, it was not possible to identify 5-HT receptors having the pharmacological properties of 5-HT1B sites in the human brain, using either [3H]5-HT or [125I]CYP as ligands. The absence of identifiable 5-HT1B receptors in human brain preparations, a fact previously found in pig brain tissue, is discussed in terms of the existence of species differences in brain serotonin receptors.
