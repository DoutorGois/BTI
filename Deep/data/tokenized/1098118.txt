Specific neuronal staining for methadone was demonstrated by immunofluorescence in the brain tissue of ten addicts who had died from drug overdose. Areas of the brain most frequently involved were the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum and brain stem. Toxicological studies confirmed the presence of methadone in each case.
