A neural network model that exhibits stochastic population bursting is studied by simulation. First return maps of interburst intervals exhibit recurrent unstable-periodic-orbit(UPO)-like trajectories similar to those found in experiments on hippocampal slices. Applications of various control methods and surrogate analysis for UPO detection also yield results similar to those of experiments. Our results question the interpretation of the experimental data as evidence for deterministic chaos and suggest caution in the use of UPO-based methods for detecting determinism in time-series data.
