Nerve growth factor (NGF) has recently been implicated as a trophic agent in the survival and maintenance of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. To test the hypothesis that NGF may play a role in the age-related degeneration of basal forebrain neurons and decline of cerebral cholinergic function, we have used a monoclonal antibody to the NGF receptor, 192 IgG, to immunocytochemically visualize and compare rat basal forebrain neurons responsive to NGF in aged (30 months) and young adult (10 months) rats. In a subpopulation of aged rats, NGF receptor-immunoreactive cells in the basal forebrain appear vacuolated and shrunken, and the neuropil staining is markedly reduced. While no substantial decline in cell density is apparent in Nissl-stained sections, the number of NGF receptor-positive cell profiles within the vertical limb of diagonal band nuclei is reduced by an average of 32% in aged rats. Marked reduction in the expression of NGF receptors in aged rats may signify loss of capacity of the basal forebrain neurons to bind and transport NGF from their terminals in the hippocampus and cortex, subsequent decrease in NGF delivered to the cell bodies, and eventual cellular dysfunction and death of neurons in aging.
