OBJECTIVE: To investigate the difference in the expression profiles in the hippocampus, marginal division and other related brain areas for identification of genes specific to the hippocampus and marginal division. METHODS: Fetal hippocampus, marginal division, caudate putamen and amygdala were obtained and mRNA differential display technique was employed to study the gene expression in the 4 brain areas. RESULTS: Two differentially expressed fragments were isolated from each of the hippocampus and marginal division, and cloning and sequence analysis of one of the fragment 277 bp in length from the hippocampus showed total homology with the sequence of human clone AC0049. CONCLUSION: The 4 brain areas have different gene expression profiles.
