Three areas in the brain continuously generate new neurons throughout life: the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricles, the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and the median eminence in the hypothalamus. These areas harbour neural stem cells, which contribute to neural repair by generating daughter cells that then become functional neurons or glia. Impaired neurogenesis leads to detrimental consequences, such as depression, decline of cognitive abilities and obesity. Adult neurogenesis is a versatile process that can be modulated either positively or negatively by many effectors, external or endogenous. Diet can modify neurogenesis both ways, either directly by ways of food-borne molecules, or possibly by the modifications induced on gut microbiota composition. It is therefore critical to define dietary strategies optimal for the maintenance of the stem cell pools.
