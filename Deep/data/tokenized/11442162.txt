PURPOSE: To correlate the interictal spike field and region of seizure onset with the distribution of 1H-MRS abnormalities in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and improve our understanding of the clinical significance of 1H-MRS abnormalities. METHODS: Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) results were correlated in 31 consecutive patients with TLE. RESULTS: Lateralized 1H-MRS-based hippocampal abnormalities were recorded in 95% of the patients with unilateral interictal spikes, with a high degree of concordance for the lateralization side (90%). In 64% of the patients with normal or bilateral interictal EEG spikes, 1H-MRS provided lateralizing information. Bilateral 1H-MRS abnormalities, with or without lateralization, were 3 times more frequent than bitemporal EEG spikes. Anterior predominance of the 1H-MRS abnormalities was more frequent in patients with anterior temporal EEG spiking (50%), than in patients without this EEG distribution (18%). Similar association was noted between distribution of 1H-MRS abnormalities and region of EEG seizure onset. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a moderate level of concordance between the distribution of 1H-MRS and EEG abnormalities. 1H-MRS identifies abnormalities contralateral to the predominant seizure focus more often than does EEG and may provide lateralizing information in patients with nonlateralizing interictal EEG.
