The weight-lowering and gluco-regulatory actions of oxyntomodulin (Oxm) have been well-documented however potential actions of this peptide in brain regions associated with learning and memory have not yet been evaluated. The present study examined the long-term actions of a stable acylated analogue of Oxm, (dS(2))Oxm(K-gamma-glu-Pal), together with parent (dS(2))Oxm peptide, on hippocampal neurogenesis, gene expression and metabolic control in high fat (HF) mice. Groups of HF mice (n = 12) received twice-daily injections of Oxm analogues (both at 25 nmol/kg body weight) or saline vehicle (0.9% wt/vol) over 28 days. Hippocampal gene expression and histology were assessed together with evaluation of energy intake, body weight, non-fasting glucose and insulin, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and lipids. Oxm analogues significantly reduced body weight, improved glucose tolerance, glucose-mediated insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, islet architecture and lipid profile. Analysis of brain histology revealed significant reduction in hippocampal oxidative damage (8-oxoguanine), enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis (doublecortin) and improved hippocampal and cortical synaptogenesis (synaptophysin) following treatment. Furthermore, Oxm analogues up-regulated hippocampal mRNA expression of MASH1, Synaptophysin, SIRT1, GLUT4 and IRS1, and down-regulated expression of LDL-R and GSK3beta. These data demonstrate potential of stable Oxm analogues, and particularly (dS(2))Oxm(K-gamma-glu-Pal) to improve metabolic function and enhance neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, insulin signalling and exert protective effects against oxidative damage in hippocampus and cortex brain regions in HF mice.
