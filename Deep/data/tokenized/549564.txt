Nystagmic responses in intact, healthy rabbits given hippocampal stimulation were studied and the following results were obtained. Two types of mystagmic responses were derived from the hippocampus. 1) One was a horizontal nystagmic response with a middle amplitude and was directed to the right and the left. This type of nystagmic response was first induced in the 'pre- and post-stimulus' phase after repeated electric stimulation of the hippocampus and was found in almost every rabbit examined. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the development of nystagmic response and repetition of the stimulation. 2) The other was a horizontal nystagmic response with a small amplitude directed toward the side of the stimulation. This type of nystagmic response was induced in the 'during-stimulus' phase and was found in two rabbits. There was no positive correlation between development of nystagmic response of this type and repetition of the stimulation.
