Cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule widely expressed in the nervous system. Previously, we analyzed the expression of nine classic cadherins (Cdh4, Cdh6, Cdh7, Cdh8, Cdh9, Cdh10, Cdh11, Cdh12, and Cdh20) and T-cadherin (Cdh13) in the developing postnatal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) brain, and found differential expressions between mice and marmosets. In this study, to explore primate-specific cadherin expression at the embryonic stage, we extensively analyzed the expression of these cadherins in the developing embryonic marmoset brain. Each cadherin showed differential spatial and temporal expression and exhibited temporally complicated expression. Furthermore, the expression of some cadherins differed from that in rodent brains, even at the embryonic stage. These results suggest the possibility that the differential expressions of diverse cadherins are involved in primate specific cortical development, from the prenatal to postnatal period.
