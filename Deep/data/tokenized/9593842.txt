The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has shown to play an important role in the cognitive deficits associated with developmental lead (Pb) exposure. In this study, we examined the effects of low-level Pb exposure on NMDA receptor subunit gene expression in the developing rat brain. The pattern of NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and NR2C subunit mRNA in situ hybridization was consistent with previous studies. Brain levels of NR1 and NR2A mRNAs were lowest shortly after birth, increasing to reach peak levels by 14 or 21 days of age and subsequently decreasing at 28 days of age. NR2B mRNA levels were highest during early development and decreased as the animals aged. NR2C subunit mRNA was restricted to the cerebellum and a signal was not detectable until the second week of life. Lead exposure resulted in significant and opposite effects in NR1 and NR2A subunit mRNA expression with no changes in NR2B or NR2C subunit expression. The Pb-induced changes in NR1 and NR2A subunit mRNA were mainly present in the hippocampus. Hippocampal NR1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the CA1 (15.3%) and CA4 (26.8%) pyramidal cells from 14-day-old Pb-exposed rats. At 21 days of age, only the NR1 mRNA at the CA4 subfield remained significantly elevated (10.3%). Lead exposure caused reductions of NR2A mRNA levels (11.9-19.3%) in the pyramidal and granule cell layers of the hippocampus at 14 and 21 days of age. NR1 mRNA levels were also significantly increased (14.0%) in the cerebellum of 28-day-old rats with no change in NR2A mRNA at any age. No significant changes in subunit mRNA levels were present in cortical or subcortical regions at any age. The Pb-induced changes in hippocampal NMDA receptor subunit mRNA expression measured in the present study may lead to modifications in receptor levels or subtypes and alter the development of defined neuronal connections which require NMDA receptor activation.
