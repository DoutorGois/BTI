Isoaspartyl protein carboxyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is widely distributed in mammalian tissues. Using a polymerase chain reaction-generated 124-bp DNA fragment from brain cDNA as a probe, four different sizes (approximately 4.0, 2.5, 1.7, and 1.1 kb) of transcripts were detected with northern blot analysis. They were expressed predominantly in rat brain and testis. The major transcripts were 2.5 and 1.7 kb in the brain and 2.5 and 1.1 kb in the testis. One of the major transcripts specific to the testis (1.1 kb) was determined to study the structural difference of major transcripts in the two tissues. This testicular cDNA had neither the 5' (94 nucleotides) nor the 3' (594 nucleotides) end of previously reported brain cDNA corresponding to 1.7 kb. The mRNA levels and enzyme activities of different regions and developmental changes were examined in the brain. The mRNA levels and enzyme activities were concomitantly high in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Although they increased rapidly approximately 30 days after birth in the testis and decreased in aged rats, they increased gradually after birth and remained high during the aging of the brain. Both structural and developmental studies show that the expression of the PIMT gene in brain and testis is regulated in a tissue-specific manner.
