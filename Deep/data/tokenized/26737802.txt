Previously we demonstrated that noninvasive transcranial focal electrical stimulation (TFS) with sub-effective doses of diazepam reduces status epilepticus (SE)-induced neuronal damage. However, it was unclear if this neuroprotective effect is a consequence of the decrease in the glutamate release. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of TFS on gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate release in the hippocampus during pilocarpine-induced SE. After pilocarpine administration, the rats showed progressive behavioral changes that culminated in SE with a significant increase of GABA and glutamate (95 and 128% respectively), even more evident at the end of the experiment (120 and 182% respectively), 5 hours after pilocarpine injection and was associated with the prevalence of high-voltage rhythmic spikes and increased spectral power in the 4-90 Hz bands. The TFS application during the SE decreased the convulsive expression, the prevalence of high-voltage rhythmic spikes and spectral power in 4-8 Hz and 30-90 Hz bands. These effects were associated with lower release of GABA and glutamate in the hippocampus. These results support the anticonvulsive and neuroprotective effects induced by TFS.
