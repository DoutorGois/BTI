Aged rats (26 months) usually retained normal acetylcholine-dependent and serotonin-dependent forms of neocortical low-voltage fast activity and serotonin-dependent hippocampal rhythmical slow-wave activity. In a simple swim-to-platform test, aged rats (23 and 26 months) performed normally in acquisition and in retention over a 7-day period. The results are discussed in relation to the common assumption that aged rats provide a valid model of human senile dementia.
