Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) is a widely used technique for detecting neuronal activity in the brain of a living animal. Ceftriaxone (CEF) has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. The present study was aimed at clarifying whether, in an 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) rat model, the known CEF-induced neuronal protection was accompanied by neurogenesis and decreased loss of neuronal activity. After MPTP lesioning (day 0), the rats were treated with CEF (100mg/kg/day, i.p.) or saline for 15 days. They were then injected with MnCl2 (40mg/kg, i.p.) on day 13 and underwent a brain MRI scan on day 14, then the brain was taken for histological evaluation on day 15. The results showed that MPTP lesioning resulted in decreased neuronal activity and density in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic (DAergic) system and the hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) areas and reduced neurogenesis in the DG, but in hyperactivity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). These neuronal changes were prevented by CEF treatment. Positive correlations between MEMRI R1 values and neuronal density in the hippocampus were evidenced. Neuronal densities in the hippocampus and SNc were positively correlated. In addition, the R1 value of the STN showed a positive correlation with its neuronal activity but showed a negative correlation with the density of DAergic neurons in the SNc. Therefore, MEMRI R1 value may serve as a good indicator for PD severity and the effect of treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that CEF prevents loss of neuronal activity and neurogenesis in the brain of PD rats. CEF may therefore have clinical potential in the treatment of PD.
