Impaired adult neurogenesis has been observed in several neurodegenerative diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD). Here we report that the HIV-envelope glycoprotein gp120, which is associated with HAD pathogenesis, inhibits proliferation of adult neural progenitor cells (aNPCs) in vitro and in vivo in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of HIV/gp120-transgenic mice. We demonstrate that HIV/gp120 arrests cell-cycle progression of aNPCs at the G1 phase via a cascade consisting of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) --> MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (a cell-cycle checkpoint kinase) --> Cdc25B/C. Our findings define a molecular mechanism that compromises adult neurogenesis in this neurodegenerative disorder.
