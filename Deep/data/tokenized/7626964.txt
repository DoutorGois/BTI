This study characterized memory functions in geriatric schizophrenic inpatients with a battery of memory tests sensitive to neuropsychological impairments in either temporal or frontal brain regions. In patients clinically rated as cognitively impaired (n = 24), nearly all of these measures showed deficits relative to less impaired patients (n = 25). Factor analysis found consistent correlations between the tests and their putative cortical localization. Discriminant analysis suggested the pattern of impairments was not consistent with a generalized deficit. These results introduce the possibility, to be directly tested with neuropathological study, that the severe cognitive deficits in elderly schizophrenic patients are due to dysfunctions in either the temporal or frontal regions of the cerebral cortex, with the specific type of dysfunction varying across cases.
