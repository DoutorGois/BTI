The present studies have shown that chronic antidepressant treatment with desipramine, imipramine, zimelidine and alaproclate led to adaptive changes in both pre- and postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor mechanisms which appear to result in 5-HT sub- or supersensitivity development depending upon the 5-HT nerve terminal systems analyzed. The results underline the heterogeneity of the central 5-HT neurone systems in their responses to chronic antidepressant treatment. An involvement of 5-HT comodulators is postulated in the actions of antidepressants on central 5-HT synapses. Finally, the results point to the importance of 5-HT neurone systems as targets for the action for antidepressant drugs and they may mediate at least some of the therapeutic activity of antidepressant drugs.
