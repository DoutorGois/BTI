This study mainly describes the long-term effects of 20 min of cerebral ischemia on the profile of the presumed cholinergic theta rhythm in the rat dorsal hippocampal formation during ether anesthesia and injection of the muscarinic agonist agent arecoline. The experimental data were collected 4-5 months after ischemia. They show that ischemia results in a statistically significant reduction in both superficial and deep theta recorded from the CA1 area of the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus, respectively. Amplitude reduction is similar for both rhythms and co-varies positively with the extent of CA1 stratum pyramidale damage which, from light microscope observation, appeared to be the major neuroanatomical consequence of ischemic insult in the dorsal hippocampal formation. The medial septal nucleus-diagonal band of Broca complex involved in theta generation did not suffer visible anatomical damage. Moreover, no significant alteration in the spatial distribution and the density of hippocampal dentate acetylcholinesterase reaction product was seen in ischemic animals. These histological data were statistically confirmed by computerized image analysis. Finally, this is the first investigation to show that transient interruption of cerebral blood flow results in a long-lasting alteration of theta rhythm which is probably the major aspect of the basic activity of the hippocampal formation. Thus, the present findings obtained in the acute rat at 4-5 months postischemia confirm and extend, in most respects, our previous results collected in the chronic animal 2-29 days following 4-vessel occlusion. Possible significance of these findings for the hypothesis of the dependent generation sites of superficial and deep thetas in the hippocampus assumed to be crucial in learning and memory, is discussed.
