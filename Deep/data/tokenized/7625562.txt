We investigated the effect of ethanol on specific binding of [3H]MK-801 to the intrachannel phencyclidine (PCP) receptor site, as an index of change in the functional response of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)-associated ion channel. Saturation binding experiments were performed on synaptic membrane homogenates from adult rat cortex and hippocampus. [3H]MK-801 binding assays were conducted under conditions of basal, 10 microM glutamate, or 10 microM glutamate + 30 microM D-serine, with and without 50 or 100 mM ethanol. Association experiments of [3H]MK-801 binding (5 nM) were conducted under conditions of 0 or 10 microM glutamate, with varying concentrations of glycine (0.01, 0.10, and 10 microM) with and without 100 mM ethanol. Ethanol (50 and 100 mM) significantly decreased the percentage of high-affinity (open-channel state) MK-801 receptors with a concomitant increase in percentage of low-affinity receptors, but did not change high- and low-affinity constants of the two binding states. An ethanol-induced increase in the closed-channel receptor density in basal and activated conditions was suggested by the saturation experiments. Association experiments further explained this finding, in that ethanol (100 mM) significantly decreased fast component (open-channel) [3H]MK-801 binding in conditions of glycine (0.01-10 microM) only and activated conditions of glutamate + glycine (0.01-0.10 microM). However, the observed fast and slow kinetic rate constants of [3h]MK-801 binding, as well as total specific binding (fast + slow components), were not altered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
