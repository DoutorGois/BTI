Using in situ hybridization, the expression of the GABA receptor subtype B subunit 1 (GABA(B) R1) and subunit 2 (GABA(B) R2) following transient global ischemia in the gerbil hippocampus was investigated. In sham-operated animals, mRNAs of both subunits were mainly detected in hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons with lower expression levels of the GABA(B) R2 in the CA1 field. Four days after transient cerebral ischemia, neuronal message decreased in conjunction with neuronal death and both receptor subunits disappeared from the pyramidal cell layer. However, GABA(B) R1 and GABA(B) R2 were still expressed in a few cells. In situ hybridization of the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) remained unchanged after the ischemic insult. Double-labeling experiments revealed that in the postischemic hippocampus GABA(B) R1 and GABA(B) R2 were not present in GFAP-reactive astrocytes, but that the surviving parvalbumin-containing interneurons possessed GABA(B) R1 and GABA(B) R2 mRNA.
