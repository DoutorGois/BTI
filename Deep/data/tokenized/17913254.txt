The independent effects of ovarian and adrenal hormones on spatial place learning were examined in male and female Long-Evans hooded rats. Experimental groups received bilateral ovariectomy (females only) and adrenalectomy (both sexes), followed by hormone administration according to a predetermined schedule. Spatial and reversal training in the Morris water maze were used to measure behavioural performance in locating a hidden platform. General proficiency and strategies use were assessed using search times and time spent in the periphery, respectively. The number of direct and circle swims to the platform was used to assess memory for the location of the hidden platform. Experiment 1 investigated the roles of estradiol and progesterone in spatial navigation in the absence of high levels of adrenal steroids. The female group that received estradiol alone showed longer search times, greater periphery swimming, and fewer direct and circle swims to the target than all other female groups. Experiment 2 investigated the role of corticosterone (CORT) in spatial navigation in the absence of ovarian hormones. Male and female rats that received acute matched doses of exogenous CORT were equally impaired during spatial training. During reversal training, the impairment in search time, periphery swimming, and direct and circle swims persisted in the female CORT group only. Analysis of serum CORT levels in the male and female experimental groups revealed no significant differences. These data suggest that estradiol and CORT can independently impair acquisition of spatial navigation skills and strategies use in adult female rats.
