Quinolinic acid (QA) is a NMDA receptor agonist implicated in pathological conditions, such as neurodegenerative diseases and epilepsy. Time-course responses of different brain regions after QA i.c.v. infusion are not known. We aimed to investigate the time-course effects of QA infusion on oxidative stress-related parameters on different brain regions. In cerebral cortex, QA infusion promoted an early (1 h) decrease of NPSH levels and GR activity followed by a later increase in ROS production (8 h) and TBARS detection (24-72 h). In the hippocampus, QA promoted an increase in ROS production that lasted 8 h. Striatal tissue presented a later increase in ROS generation (8-72 h) after QA infusion. In the cerebellum, an increase in the GPx activity after 8 h was the only effect observed. These results show that oxidative stress induced by QA i.c.v. infusion is region and time dependent.
