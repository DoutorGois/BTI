Recent studies have shown that the dentate granular cells of the hippocampus are affected in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To gain a better understanding of the cytoskeletal alterations in these cells, we carried out immunocytochemical and immunoelectron microscopic analysis of the dentate gyrus of patients with primary degenerative dementias, using a monoclonal antibody against paired helical filaments (TG3). This antibody labeled a large number of spherical inclusions in the dentate granule cells of patients with AD and its Lewy body variant (LBV). These inclusions consisted of straight tubular structures (about 18-25 nm in diameter), similar to those found in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). These inclusions, although in a smaller number, were also found in demented patients with PSP, but not in those with diffuse Lewy body disease or age-matched controls. These findings indicate that the neurofibrillary alterations in the dentate granule cells of patients with AD, LBV and PSP share cytoskeletal similarities.
