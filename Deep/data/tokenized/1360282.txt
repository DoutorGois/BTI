The mechanism of aging is suggested to be related to oxygen free radicals. Free radicals, lipid peroxidation and SOD activity have been reported to be increased in the aged brain. A Japanese herbal medicine, Sho-saiko-to-go-keishi-ka-shakuyaku-to (TJ-960), which has scavenging activities against hydroxyl radicals, superoxide, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals, carbon-centered radicals and alpha-tocopheroxyl radicals, decreased carbon-centered radicals and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels in the aged rat brain after a 3-week oral administration of 5% TJ-960 solution. TJ-960 elevated superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the cytosol fraction of the hippocampus and hypothalamus of aged rats. It decreased norepinephrine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the hypothalamus and increased the 5-HT level in the cerebellum. TJ-960 treatment increased choline acetyltransferase activity in aged rats. As herbal medicines do not generally have harmful side effects, antioxidant TJ-960 appears to be a suitable prophylactic agent against some neuronal symptoms of aging.
