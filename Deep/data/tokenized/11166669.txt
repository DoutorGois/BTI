Cholecystokinin sulfated octapeptide (CCK-8S) was given to rats i.p. at single doses of 10 and 100 nmol/kg, respectively. It produced a modification in GABA levels in several areas of the rat brain. After 30 min of injection, the lower dose (10 nmol/kg) increased GABA levels in striatum by 31% (P<0.05). The higher dose (100 nmol/kg) enhanced GABA levels either in hippocampus by 78% (P<0.05) or in frontal cerebral cortex by 81% (P<0.05) and decreased in olfactory bulbs by 57% (P<0.01). Thus, these results show that systemic injection of CCK-8S, produced regional specific changes on GABA levels in brain, and these effects were dose-dependent. Systemic pretreatment with the CCK(B) receptor antagonist, PD 135,158, 1 mg/kg i.p., on the endogenous levels of GABA in certain regions was also studied. The selective CCK(B) receptor antagonist, PD 135,158, did not have an effect per se on the endogenous levels of GABA but prevents the action induced by the neuropeptide. We suggest that the action of CCK may be mediated via a selective action on the CCK(B) receptor subtypes.
