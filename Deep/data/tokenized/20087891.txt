The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in recognition memory was investigated by locally infusing oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) into perirhinal cortex, a region of the temporal lobe essential for familiarity discrimination. Antisense but not sense BDNF ODN impaired consolidation of long-term (24 h) but not shorter-term (20 min) recognition memory.
