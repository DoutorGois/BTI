Ethanol (0.5 g/kg) administered intravenously led to alterations in central mechanisms of feeding and escape, elicited by threshold electrical stimulation either of lateral or of ventromedial hypothalamic centers of the rabbit. Subsequent intravenous injection of substance P (30 mcg/kg) restored the excitability of the ventromedial hypothalamus and facilitatory effects on this motivational center of the midbrain reticular formation. The restoration of both inhibitory influences of the dorsal hippocampus and facilitatory ones of the midbrain reticular formation on the excitability of the lateral hypothalamus was also observed after SP administration. Data obtained suggest that oligopeptides could be used to increase the tolerance to ethanol or to cure the negative acute effects of alcohol in motivated behaviours.
