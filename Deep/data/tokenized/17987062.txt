The immunological response in the brain is crucial to overcome neuropathological events. Some inflammatory mediators, such as the immunoregulatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) affect neuromodulation and may also play protective roles against various noxious conditions. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the long-term effects of IL-6 in the brain remain unclear. We now report that IL-6 increases the expression and function of the neuronal adenosine A1 receptor, with relevant consequences to synaptic transmission and neuroprotection. IL-6-induced amplification of A1 receptor function enhances the responses to readily released adenosine during hypoxia, enables neuronal rescue from glutamate-induced death, and protects animals from chemically induced convulsing seizures. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-6 minimizes the consequences of excitotoxic episodes on brain function through the enhancement of endogenous adenosinergic signaling.
