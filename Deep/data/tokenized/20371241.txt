The NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor is fundamentally involved in cognitive functions. Recent studies demonstrated a functional interaction between the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu(5) receptor) and the NMDA-receptor in neurons. In rat hippocampal slices, it was shown that activation of mGlu(5) receptor by a positive modulator in the presence of a subthreshold agonist concentration potentiated NMDA-receptor mediated currents and phosphorylation of intracellular signalling proteins. In the present study, we investigated the functional interaction of mGlu(5) receptor and NMDA-receptor by the selective mGlu(5) receptor positive modulator ADX-47273 in-vitro and in-vivo. In rat primary neurons, this compound potentiated Ca(2+) mobilization in the presence of a subthreshold concentration of the mGluR(1/5) agonist DHPG (0.3 microM) with an EC(50) of 0.28+/-0.05 microM. NMDA-induced Ca(2+)-mobilization in primary neurons could be potentiated when neurons were pre-stimulated with 1 microM ADX-47273 in the presence of 0.3 microM DHPG. The specific mGlu(5) receptor antagonist MPEP and the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2 blocked this potentiation demonstrating the functional interaction of the NMDA-receptor and mGlu(5) receptor in neurons. Furthermore, ADX-47273 elicited an enhancement of NMDA-receptor dependent long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices that could be reversed by MPEP. After intraperitoneal administration to rats, ADX-47273 showed a dose-dependent reduction of NMDA-receptor antagonist (ketamine) induced hyperlocomotion, supporting the mechanistic interaction of the NMDA-receptor and mGlu(5) receptor in-vivo. In conclusion, these findings further support the idea of a functional interaction between the mGlu(5) receptor and NMDA-receptor, which may provide a pharmacological strategy for addressing CNS diseases with cognitive impairments linked to NMDA-receptor hypofunction.
