Complexin 2 is a protein modulator of neurotransmitter release that is downregulated in humans suffering from depression, animal models of depression and neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease in which depression is a major symptom. Although complexin 2 knockout (Cplx2-/-) mice are overtly normal, they show significant abnormalities in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. Here we show that Cplx2-/- mice also have disturbances in emotional behaviours that include abnormal social interactions and depressive-like behaviour. Since neurotransmitter deficiencies are thought to underlie depression, we examined neurotransmitter levels in Cplx2-/- mice and found a significant decrease in levels of noradrenaline and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with clorgyline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A, restored hippocampal noradrenaline to normal levels (from 60 to 97% of vehicle-treated Cplx2+/+ mice, P<0.001), and reversed the behavioural deficits seen in Cplx2-/- mice. For example, clorgyline-treated Cplx2-/- mice spent significantly more time interacting with a novel visitor mouse compared with vehicle-treated Cplx2-/- mice in the social recognition test (34 compared with 13%, P<0.01). We were also able to reverse the selective deficit seen in mossy fibre-long-term potentiation (MF-LTP) in Cplx2-/- mice using the noradrenergic agonist isoprenaline. Pre-treatment with isoprenaline in vitro increased MF-LTP by 125% (P<0.001), thus restoring it to control levels. Our data strongly support the idea that complexin 2 is a key player in normal neurological function, and that downregulation of complexin 2 could lead to changes in neurotransmitter release sufficient to cause significant behavioural abnormalities such as depression.
