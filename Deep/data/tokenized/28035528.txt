Delta opioid receptor (DOR) displays a unique, highly conserved, structure and an original pattern of distribution in the central nervous system, pointing to a distinct and specific functional role among opioid peptide receptors. Over the last 15 years, in vivo pharmacology and genetic models have allowed significant advances in the understanding of this role. In this review, we will focus on the involvement of DOR in modulating different types of hippocampal- and striatal-dependent learning processes as well as motor function, motivation, and reward. Remarkably, DOR seems to play a key role in balancing hippocampal and striatal functions, with major implications for the control of cognitive performance and motor function under healthy and pathological conditions.
