We studied the effects of single administration of ladasten (50 mg/kg) on the level of transcriptional factor CREB (cyclic AMP response binding element protein) phosphorylated by Ser133 in rat striatum, hypothalamus, and hippocampus. Transcriptional factors with affected DNA-binding activity were identified in brain cells.
