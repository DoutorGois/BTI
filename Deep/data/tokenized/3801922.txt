Rat hippocampal slices in 0, 0.25, 1.5 or 3 mM penicillin were exposed briefly to extracellular sinusoidal electric fields (20 s, 5 and 60 Hz, 20-40 mV/cm in tissue). Fields induced long-term (min) changes in population spike amplitudes in the CA1 cell layer. Post-field effects included both depression of strongly epileptiform responses and potentiation of weakly epileptiform and normal responses. Endogenous extracellular fields may participate in the dynamic regulation of the course of seizures.
