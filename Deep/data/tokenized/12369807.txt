Two variants of a continuous recognition training procedure were designed in order to query 2 forms of spatial memory. A continuous reinforcement condition (reflecting perceptual memory) and a differential reinforcement condition (reflecting episodic-like memory) were used to test rats on a 12-arm radial maze. After total hippocampal lesions, rats demonstrated intact performance on the continuous reinforcement condition, but impaired performance on the differential reinforcement condition. After parietal lesions, rats demonstrated the reverse pattern of performance: impaired performance on the continuous reinforcement condition and intact performance on the differential reinforcement condition. Thus, a double dissociation appears to exist between parietal cortex and hippocampus for the continuous reinforcement condition (reflecting perceptual memory) versus the differential reinforcement condition (reflecting episodic memory) for spatial location information.
