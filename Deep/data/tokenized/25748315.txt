This study was designed to investigate the protective effect of pratensein against cognitive impairment induced by amyloid beta (1-42) (Abeta1-42) in rats. Abeta1-42 peptide was injected bilaterally in the hippocampus of rat. Next, pratensein was administered orally for 3 weeks. Our findings demonstrated that treatment with pratensein ameliorated learning and memory deficits in Abeta1-42 rat model of AD. Pratensein treatment significantly attenuated neuronal degeneration and apoptosis in hippocampus. Moreover, the over-expression in IL-1beta and TNF-alpha as well as the extensive astrogliosis and microgliosis in hippocampus induced by Abeta1-42 were significantly reduced following administration of pratensein. Concomitantly, pratensein treatment significantly suppressed the activation of NF-kappaB in hippocampus. In addition, pratensein was able to increase the levels of synaptophysin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These results indicate that pratensein could significantly ameliorate Abeta1-42-induced spatial learning and memory impairment through reducing neuroinflammation via inhibition of glial activation and NF-kappaB activation, and restoring synapse and BDNF levels, suggesting that administration of pratensein could likely provide a therapeutic approach for AD.
