In the olfactory bulb, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines, is expressed after birth when the axons of olfactory epithelial neurons have made synapses in the bulb. It has been suggested that expression of TH is regulated trans-synaptically because on deafferentation of the bulb there is a marked decrease in the contents of TH, dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, which, however, return to normal levels after regeneration of the primary afferents. To date the molecular signalling involved in this trans-synaptic induction has not yet been characterized; I have therefore studied the expression of dopaminergic properties (presence of TH and dopamine uptake) in dissociated cell cultures from embryonic mouse olfactory bulb. I report that the number of dopaminergic cells increases fivefold when olfactory bulb neurons are co-cultured with olfactory epithelial neurons and that soluble factors, rather than cell interactions, mediate this effect. The dopaminergic-inducing factor is the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) which is present in chemosensory neurons of the olfactory epithelium and when added at nanomolar concentrations to olfactory bulb cultures mimics the effect of olfactory epithelial neurons. Significantly the induction of dopaminergic phenotypes brought about by olfactory epithelial neurons is abolished by an antiserum to CGRP. These observations show that CGRP is involved in the differentiation of dopaminergic olfactory bulb neurons.
