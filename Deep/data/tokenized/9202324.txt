The DNA-binding activities of AP-1 and Egr proteins were investigated in nuclear extracts of rat brain regions during ethanol withdrawal. Both DNA-binding activities were transiently elevated in the hippocampus and cerebellum 16 h after withdrawal. In the cerebral cortex, AP-1 and Egr DNA-binding activities increased at 16 h and persisted until 32 and 72 h, respectively. The AP-1 DNA-binding activities in all regions at all times after withdrawal were composed of FosB, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD. c-Fos was detected at all times in the cerebral cortex, at 16 h only in the hippocampus, and from 16 to 72 h in the cerebellum. Withdrawal severity did not affect the composition of the AP-1 DNA-binding activities. Two Egr DNA-binding activities were present in the cortex and hippocampus. The faster-migrating complex predominated in hippocampus, and only the slower-migrating complex (identified as Egr-1) was present in the cerebellum. The increase in DNA-binding activity of immediate early gene-encoded transcription factors supports their proposed role in initiating a cascade of altered gene expression underlying the long-term neuronal response to ethanol withdrawal.
