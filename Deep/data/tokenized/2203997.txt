The cellular localization and the distribution of the mas proto-oncogene/angiotensin receptor mRNA have been studied in the male rat brain using in situ hybridization with radiolabelled mas cRNA probes. Neuronal cell populations in the forebrain were selectively labelled. A strong specific labelling was demonstrated in the dentate gyrus, the CA3 and CA4 areas of the hippocampus, the olfactory tubercle (medical part), the piriform cortex and the olfactory bulb, while a weak to moderate labelling was present all over the neocortex and especially in the frontal lobe.
