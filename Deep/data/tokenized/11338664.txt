A novel series of potential antipsychotic agents were prepared by combination of condensed heterocycles containing bridgehead nitrogen with (2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine using phenoxyalkyl spacer of variable length. The affinity of the compounds was determined at rat cloned D3 and rat D2, 5-HT1A receptors by an vitro receptor binding assay. The D3 selectivity of the compounds was calculated from the Ki values.
