The perception of and memory for faces, with or without emotional content, were studied in 43 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who had undergone unilateral resection of the hippocampus and the amygdala and in 43 healthy participants for comparison. Each participant performed four tasks from the Florida Affect Battery (Facial Discrimination, Affect Discrimination, Affect Naming, Affect Selection) and two memory tasks (in one case of a face and in the other of a facial expression). Findings indicated that, although patients with unilateral temporal lobectomy (right or left) showed no difficulty in discriminating faces, they were not as good at remembering faces. Also, patients who had had a left temporal lobectomy showed impairment in discriminating facial expressions, in the memory of a facial expression and/or in naming facial expressions.
