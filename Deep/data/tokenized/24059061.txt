This study aims to assess the expression of Klotho and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and the association between Klotho and IGF-1 in rats with dementia model. Thirty rats were randomly divided into three groups. Morris water maze was used to investigate the learning and memory functions, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze the levels of Klotho and IGF-1. Klotho and IGF-1 levels in the model group were lower than those in other 2 groups. Morris water maze test showed that the model group had longer escape latency times and shorter step platform times compared to other groups. Line correlation model demonstrated that Klotho level was positively correlated with IGF-1 level in rats with dementia (P= 0. 029). The levels of Klotho and IGF-1 both reduced at hippocampus in rats with dementia model, suggesting that it may be a close relationship between Klotho and IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of dementia.
