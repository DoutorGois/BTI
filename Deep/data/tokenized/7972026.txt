An experimental drug, 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)piperidine, that facilitates glutamatergic transmission in brain after systemic administration was tested for its effects on the induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus of rats. Intraperitoneal injections of the drug markedly increased the degree and duration of long-term potentiation; similar results were obtained with an analogue of 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylcarbonyl)piperidine that was also found to improve retention of memory in a radial maze task and in an odor-matching problem. These results define tools for enhancing long-term potentiation in vivo and confirm an important prediction from the hypothesis that long-term potentiation is a substrate of memory.
