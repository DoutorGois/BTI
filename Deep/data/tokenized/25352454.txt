We previously reported that activated microglia are involved in amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance and that stimulation of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in microglia enhances Abeta clearance. Nevertheless, how microglia and alpha7 nAChR in microglia are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown. The present study aimed to collect fundamental data for considering whether microglia are potential targets for AD treatment and the appropriate timing of therapeutic intervention, by evaluating the temporal changes of Abeta, microglia, neurons, presynapses, and alpha7 nAChR by immunohistochemical studies in mouse models of AD. In an Abeta-injected AD mouse model, we observed early accumulation of CD68-positive microglia at Abeta deposition sites and gradual reduction of Abeta. Microglia were closely associated with Abeta deposits, and were confirmed to participate in clearing Abeta. In a transgenic mouse model of AD, we observed an increase in Abeta deposition from 6 months of age, followed by a gradual increase in microglial accumulation at Abeta deposit sites. Activated microglia in APdE9 mice showed two-step transition: a CD68-negative activated form at 6-9 months and a CD68-positive form from 12 months of age. In addition, alpha7 nAChR in microglia increased markedly at 6 months of age when activated microglia appeared for the first time, and decreased gradually coinciding with the increase of Abeta deposition. These findings suggest that early microglial activation is associated with alpha7 nAChR upregulation in microglia in APdE9 mice. These novel findings are important for the development of new therapeutic strategy for AD.
