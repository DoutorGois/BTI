Experimental studies suggest that the delivery of antiepileptic agents into the seizure focus might be of potential utility for the treatment of focal-onset epilepsies. Botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) causes a prolonged inhibition of neurotransmitter release after its specific cleavage of the synaptic protein synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25). Here, we show that BoNT/E injected into the rat hippocampus inhibits glutamate release and blocks spike activity of pyramidal neurons. BoNT/E effects persist for at least 3 weeks, as determined by immunodetection of cleaved SNAP-25 and loss of intact SNAP-25. The delivery of BoNT/E to the rat hippocampus dramatically reduces both focal and generalized kainic acid-induced seizures as documented by behavioral and electrographic analysis. BoNT/E treatment also prevents neuronal loss and long-term cognitive deficits associated with kainic acid seizures. Moreover, BoNT/E-injected rats require 50% more electrical stimulations to reach stage 5 of kindling, thus indicating a delayed epileptogenesis. We conclude that BoNT/E delivery to the hippocampus is both antiictal and antiepileptogenic in experimental models of epilepsy.
