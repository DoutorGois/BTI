The effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) on the survival of neurons projecting to the hippocampus from developing medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band was studied in vitro. The neurons had previously been labeled retrogradely in vivo with fluorescent latex microspheres. The microspheres were injected bilaterally into the hippocampus of 5-day-old rats. Twenty to 24 h after the injection, cells from the basal forebrain were dissociated with papain and cultured for 3-5 days. The number of microsphere-labeled neurons in the culture with supplementation of NGF was much greater than that without NGF. The result clearly indicates a survival-promoting effect of NGF on these projection neurons.
