The aminergic and cholinergic fibers innervating the hippocampus reach their target regions via the dorsal (dorsal fornix, fimbria, and cingulum) and ventral routes. The plasticity of this innervation after lesions of the dorsal pathway was investigated in the septal, medial, and temporal regions of the adult rat hippocampus. The extent and time course of sprouting was assessed by determining high-affinity uptake of [3H]noradrenaline and [3H]serotonin, and the activities of cholinergic enzymes 1 week to 6 months after partial or complete transection of the dorsal pathway. The initial decline in these terminal indices resulting from the transection of the medial or lateral half of the dorsal pathway reflected the distribution of their respective terminal sites in the three hippocampal regions. Longer survival after such lesions led to a substantial recovery of cholinergic and noradrenergic markers indicating reinnervation of the hippocampus by spared dorsal and/or by undamaged ventral afferent fibers. Whether the recovery was complete or not, the sprouting of spared dorsal fibers was maximum within a relatively shorter postlesion survival whereas that of the ventral afferents continued for a longer time. In contrast to the extent of noradrenergic and cholinergic restitution, very poor serotonergic recovery was seen in the same animal in spite of the availability of spared serotonergic afferent fibers and regardless of the duration of postlesion survival. The apparently finite capacity of spared axons for postlesion reinnervation was not increased by longer survival. Amplification of this property of central neurons by other interventions may supplement the approach of transplantation for recovery of function following injury.
