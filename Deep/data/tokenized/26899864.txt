Autophagy, the process of self-degradation of cellular components, has an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we investigated the effects of SP600125 as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor and bucladesine as a cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) analog on spatial memory and expression of autophagic factors in Abeta-injected rats. Male Wistar rats were used. Rats were randomly allocated into five groups as following: amyloid beta (Abeta)-only group, Abeta + SP600125 (30 mug/1 mu/side, n = 7) and/or bucladesine (100 muM/1 mul/side, n = 7), and the normal control (vehicle only) group. The treatments were administered bilaterally to the CA1 sub-region of the hippocampus stereotaxically. Spatial reference memory was performed using Morris Water Maze 21 days later. The expression of authophagy markers (beclin1, Atg7, Atg12, and LC3 II/LC3 I) in the hippocampus was evaluated using western blotting. Compared to the vehicle group, Abeta administration reduced spatial reference learning (P < 0.001) and memory (P < 0.01) and upregulated the expression of beclin1, Atg7, Atg12, and LC3 II/I (P < 0.0001). Compare to Abeta-only group, the administration of SP600125 and/or bucladesine improved spatial reference learning (P < 0.001) and memory (P < 0.01). Compared to the Abeta-only group, the treatment with SP600125 and/or bucladesine also reduced beclin1, Atg7, Atg12, and LC3 II/I (P < 0.0001) which was similar to amount of normal rats. In summary, it seems that the improvement of spatial memory by SP600125 and/or bucladesine in Abeta-injected rats is in relation with normalizing of autophagy to the physiologic level, possibly through neuroprotection and/or neuroplasticity.
