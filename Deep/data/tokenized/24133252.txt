Dendritic spines are actin-rich compartments that protrude from the microtubule-rich dendritic shafts of principal neurons. Spines contain receptors and postsynaptic machinery for receiving the majority of glutamatergic inputs. Recent studies have shown that microtubules polymerize from dendritic shafts into spines and that signaling through synaptic NMDA receptors regulates this process. However, the mechanisms regulating microtubule dynamics in dendrites and spines remain unclear. Here we show that in hippocampal neurons from male and female mice, the majority of microtubules enter spines from highly localized sites at the base of spines. These entries occur in response to synapse-specific calcium transients that promote microtubule entry into active spines. We further document that spine calcium transients promote local actin polymerization, and that F-actin is both necessary and sufficient for microtubule entry. Finally, we show that drebrin, a protein known to mediate interactions between F-actin and microtubules, acts as a positive regulator of microtubule entry into spines. Together these results establish for the first time the essential mechanisms regulating microtubule entry into spines and contribute importantly to our understanding of the role of microtubules in synaptic function and plasticity.
