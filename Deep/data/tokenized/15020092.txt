Experimental investigations into the dynamics of neuronal networks are a fundamental step towards understanding how the nervous system works. Memory formation and development are associated with changes in the electrical activity of the neurons. To understand the changes in the electrical activity, it is essential to conduct in vitro studies on individual neurons. Hence, there is an enormous need to develop novel ways for isolating and localizing individual neurons. To this end, we designed and fabricated a 4x4 multiple microelectrode array system to spatially arrange neurons by generating dielectrophoretic traps using gradient alternating current (AC) fields. We characterized the electric field distribution inside our test platform by using three-dimensional finite element modeling (FEM) and estimated the location of neurons over the electrode array. As the first stage in forming a neuronal network, dielectrophoretic AC fields were employed to separate the neurons from the glial cells and to position individual neurons over single electrodes. The extracellular electrical activity from a single neuron was recorded. The frequency spectrum of the electrical activity was generated using fast Fourier transformation analysis (FFT) to determine the characteristic burst rates of individual neurons.
