Grid cells, border cells, head-directions cells, and conjunctive correlates found in the Medial Entorhinal Cortex (MEC) indicate the presence of highly specialized neural circuits that process allocentric space. New technical advancements, as described by Tang et al. (2014) in this issue, offer an integrated approach to charting the function and organization of these circuits.
