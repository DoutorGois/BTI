This study traces the development of spatial memory abilities in monkeys and reports the effects of selective neonatal hippocampal lesions on performance across development. Two different versions of the visual paired-comparison (VPC) task were used. The VPC-Spatial-Location task tested memory for object-locations that could be solved using an egocentric spatial frame of reference and the VPC-Object-In-Place task taxed memory for spatial relations using an allocentric reference frame. Eleven rhesus macaques (6 neonatal sham-operated controls and 5 with neonatal neurotoxic hippocampal lesions) were tested on both tasks as infants (8 months), juveniles (18 months), and adults (5-6 years). Memory for spatial locations was present by 18 months of age, whereas memory for object-place relations was present only in adulthood. Also, neonatal hippocampal lesions delayed the emergence of memory for spatial locations and abolished memory for object-place associations, particularly in animals that had sustained extensive and bilateral hippocampal lesions. The differential developmental time course of spatial memory functions and of the effects of neonatal hippocampal lesions on these functions are discussed in relation to morphological maturation of the medial temporal lobe structures in monkeys. Implications of the findings for the neural basis of spatial memory development in humans are also considered.
