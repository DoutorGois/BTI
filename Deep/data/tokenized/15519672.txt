The immediate early gene c-fos is part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, which is involved in molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Mice that lack c-Fos in the brain show impairments in spatial reference and contextual learning, and also exhibit a reduced long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission (LTP) at CA3-to-CA1 synapses. In the present study, we investigated mice in which c-fos was deleted and replaced by fra-1 (c-fos(fra-1) mice) to determine whether other members of the c-fos gene family can substitute for the functions of the c-fos gene. In c-fos(fra-1) mice, both CA3-to-CA1 LTP and contextual learning in a Pavlovian fear conditioning task were similar to wild-type littermates, indicating that Fra-1 expression restored the impairments caused by brain-specific c-Fos depletion. However, c-Fos-mediated learning deficits in a reference memory task of the Morris watermaze were also present in c-fos(fra-1) mice. These findings suggest that different c-Fos target genes are involved in LTP, contextual learning, and spatial reference memory formation.
