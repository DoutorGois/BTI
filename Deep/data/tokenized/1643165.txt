An immunohistochemical and histopathological study using the ABC technique was carried out to examine time-sequential virus spread in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice after inoculation with the CVS strain of fixed rabies virus by different routes; intracerebral (ic), intraocular (io), intranasal (in), intramuscular (im) and subcutaneous (sc). Only the ic and io inoculations caused fatal infections, so that detailed analysis was conducted on mice inoculated by these two routes. In ic-inoculated mice, viral antigens were detected mainly in neurons in the cerebral cortex and in the pyramidal cells and granular cells of the hippocampus. After io inoculation, viral antigen was first detected in the trigeminal nerve ganglia, following which it spreads to the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In the hippocampus only a few cells were viral antigen-positive at the early stage after io inoculation. There were no inflammatory lesions or Negri bodies in the CNS of mice infected by either route. This suggests that clinical signs such as ataxia or depression leading to death may be due to the direct effect of the virus on the functions of neural cells, but not to inflammatory reactions. The ABC method will be useful for the early diagnosis of suspected patients or animals to have the disease when conventional histopathological and immunofluorescent antibody techniques can not detect lesions or viral antigens.
