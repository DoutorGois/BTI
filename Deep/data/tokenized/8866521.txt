We studied the neurotoxic glutamate release induced by high-K+ depolarization in rat hippocampal slice cultures. Depolarization with 90 mM K+ for 30 min caused a significant, three-fold increase in glutamate release. This release was not inhibited by removing extracellular Ca2+, but was significantly inhibited by replacement of extracellular Cl- with SO4(2-). These findings suggest that glutamate is released by mechanisms other than conventional vesicular release under the high-K+ condition.
