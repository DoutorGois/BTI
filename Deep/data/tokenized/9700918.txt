The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of ethylholine aziridinum ion (AF64A) were studied in neuroticized male Wistar rats. The cholinotoxin was bilaterally injected in the dose of 3 nmol. AF64A produced a significant decrease in arterial pressure and activity of respiratory enzymes succinate dehydrogenase and NADH-dehydrogenase in hippocampus and motor cortex. Increase in the local blood flow in the hippocampus and motor cortex had a compensatory character.
