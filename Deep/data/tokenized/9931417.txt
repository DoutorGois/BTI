We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones encoding a stomatin-like protein (hSLP-1) from a human cerebral cortex cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence (394 residues) revealed that hSLP-1 is a bipartite protein, containing a major stomatin-like part, starting at the N-terminus, and a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP)-domain at the C-terminal end, similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans protein UNC-24. Therefore, we conclude that hSLP-1 is the human homologue of UNC-24. In addition, the identification of an alternatively spliced variant demonstrated that two exon/intron boundaries are conserved in the hSLP-1 and unc-24 genes. Northern blot and RNA dot blot analyses showed that the 2. 2-kb transcript is mainly expressed in the brain, with the highest levels in the frontal lobe, cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, amygdala, temporal lobe, putamen, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. This high-level expression of hSLP-1 in the basal ganglia may also reflect the evolutionary link to UNC-24.
