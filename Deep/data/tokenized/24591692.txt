Calcium imaging has been used extensively to explore the role of action potential (AP) firing in the development of neuronal structure and synaptic function because increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)]i) reliably and, within a certain range, linearly reflect neuronal spiking activity. Patterns of APs in individual cells can be deduced from calcium recordings, which have typically been performed at the level of cell bodies. However, neurons are particularly susceptible to phototoxicity when they are illuminated at the soma. Furthermore, for some imaging experiments (e.g., those that address the interactions between dendrites and axons during synapse formation), the cell body of a given neuron may simply not be in the field of view. In these situations, it would be helpful to determine the spiking patterns of a neuron from the calcium activity in its subcellular compartments such as stretches of dendrites or axons. Here, we describe an approach for determining the relationship between AP firing and dendritic calcium transients by simultaneously imaging calcium transients in small dendritic stretches of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in slice cultures from neonatal rats and recording spiking activity with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in these neurons. These experiments allow us to correlate the electrophysiological spiking pattern with the accompanying changes in the calcium concentration in individual dendritic segments.
