Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) is widely used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but its mode of action remains largely unknown. Thus, this study was performed to examine the effect of repeated ECS treatment on the expression of A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) in the brain. Rats were treated with ECS daily for 10 days. The expression of AKAP protein was analyzed by Western blotting, and AKAP mRNA by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Repeated ECS treatment for 10 days resulted in increases in the levels of the protein and mRNA of AKAP150, yotiao, and ezrin in the rat hippocampus. Thus, repeated ECS treatment is suggested to increase the reactivity of glutamatergic synapses by increasing the expressions of the AKAPs, which can recruit protein kinase A to glutamate receptors.
