OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and erythropoietin in the hippocampus of aging rats, and to investigate the role of HIF-1alpha and erythropoietin in the aging of nervous system. METHODS: The expression of Nissl body, HIF-1alpha, and erythropoietin in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in different months was observed by Nissl staining and immunohistochemical technique. RESULTS: Nerve cells became bigger and appeared sparse, and the Nissl bodies decreased with age. HIF-1alpha positive cells increased significantly with age in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (P<0.05). The expression of erythropoietin presented a parabola with aging in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The increase from 3 to 18 months and the reduction from 18 to 30 months of erythropoietin positive cells had statistical significance (both P<0.05). CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha and erythropoietin are parallelly incremental before middle age, and are separated after middle age, suggesting decreased activity of HIF-1alpha and recession of protein synthesis function may be the main reasons for decreased expression of erythropoietin in the brain during aging. Strengthened endogenous HIF-1alpha activity and supply of exogenous erythropoietin may delay the aging of the nervous system.
