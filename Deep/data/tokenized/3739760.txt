The effect of anorectic dose of amphetamine on some correlates of arousal (hippocampal EEG and EOG activity) was examined in cats. After injection of amphetamine the frequency of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity and EOG activity increased when preinjection value of rhytmic slow activity was low, but decreased when it was high. Thus, amphetamine anorexia may be accompained with an increase as well as with a decrease of arousal level.
