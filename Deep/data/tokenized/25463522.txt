Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) after stroke enhances not only functional reorganization but also structural plasticity of the brain in the adult rats. We examined whether forced limb-use which mimicked CIMT could influence ischemia-induced neurogenesis, apoptosis and behavioral recovery in the aged rats. Aged rats were divided into a sham group, an ischemia group, and an ischemia group with forced limb-use. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by injection of endothelin-1. Forced limb-use began on post-stroke day 7 by fitting a plaster cast around the unimpaired upper limbs of rats for 3 weeks. Behavioral recovery was evaluated by tapered/ledged beam-walking test on postoperative day 32. The expression of doublecortin, neuronal nuclei, glial fibrillary acidic protein and Iba-1 were measured by single or double immunohistochemistry, and apoptosis was measured by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The production of neuroblasts in the subventricular zone (SVZ) was significantly increased after stroke. Forced limb-use enhanced the proliferation of newborn neurons in the SVZ, as well as increased the long-term survival of newborn neurons. Furthermore, forced limb-use suppressed apoptosis and improved the motor functions after stroke in the aged rats. Forced limb-use exerted few effects on inflammation. Neither the number nor dendritic complexity of newborn granule cells in the hippocampus was affected by forced limb-use. Forced limb-use is effective in enhancing neurogenesis and behavioral recovery after stroke even in the aged rats.
