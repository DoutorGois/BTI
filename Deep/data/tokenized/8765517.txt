UNLABELLED: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive cerebral cholinergic neuronal degeneration. Radiotracer analogs of benzovesamicol, which bind with high affinity to the vesamicol receptor located on the uptake transporter of acetylcholine storage vesicles, may provide an in vivo marker of cholinergic neuronal integrity. Five positional isomers of racemic iodobenzovesamicol (4'-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-IBVM) were synthesized, exchange-labeled with iodine-125, and evaluated as possible in vivo markers for central cholinergic neurons. Only two isomers, 5-IBVM (5) and 6-IBVM (10), gave distribution patterns in mouse brain consistent with cholinergic innervation: striatum >> hippocampus > or = cortex > hypothalamus >> cerebellum. The 24-h tissue-to-cerebellum concentration ratios for 5-IBVM (5) were 3-4-fold higher for striatum, cortex, and hippocampus than the respective ratios for 6-IBVM (10). Neither 8-IBVM (16) nor 4'-IBVM (17) exhibited selective retention in any of the brain regions examined. In the heart, only 5-IBVM (5) exhibited an atria-to-ventricles concentration ratio consistent with high peripheral cholinergic neuronal selectivity. The 7-IBVM (14) isomer exhibited an anomalous brain distribution pattern, marked by high and prolonged retention in the five brain regions, most notably the cerebellum. This isomer was screened for binding in a series of 26 different biological assays; 7-IBVM (14) exhibited affinity only for the delta-receptor with an IC50 of approximately 30 nM. Drug-blocking studies suggested that brain retention of 7-IBVM (14) reflects high-affinity binding to both vesamicol and delta-receptors. Competitive binding studies using rat cortical homogenates gave IC50 values for binding to the vesamicol receptor of 2.5 nM for 5-IBVM (5), 4.8 nM for 6-IBVM (10), and 3.5 nM for 7-IBVM (14). Ex vivo autoradiography of rat brain after injection of (-)-5-[125I]IBVM ((-)-[125I]5) clearly delineated small cholinergic-rich areas such as basolateral amygdala, interpeduncular nucleus, and facial nuclei. Except for cortex, regional brain levels of (-)-5-[123I]IBVM ((-)-[123I]5) at 4 h exhibited a linear correlation (r2 = 0.99) with endogenous levels of choline acetyltransferase. CONCLUSION: Vesamicol receptor mapping of cholinergic nerve terminals in murine brain can be achieved with 5-IBVM (5) and less robustly with 6-IBVM (10), whereas the brain localization of 7-IBVM (14) reflects high-affinity binding to both vesamicol and delta-receptors.
