Rats with bilateral electrolytic lesions of specific limbic nuclei show alterations in lymphoid cell number and in lymphocyte activation induced in vitro by concanavalin A (Con A). The number of splenocytes decreases after lesioning in the anterior hypothalamus (p less than 0.001), ventromedial hypothalamus (p less than .0.2), and mamillary bodies (p less than. 0.001). The number of thymocytes decreases after lesioning of the anterior hypothalamus (p less than 0.001) and increases after hippocampal lesioning (p less than 0.001). Spleen cell responsiveness to con A decreases subsequent to lesioning of the anterior hypothalamus, whereas reactivity was enhanced after lesion placement in the mamillary bodies (p less than 0.002), hippocampus (p less than 0.001), and amygdaloid complex (p less than 0.001). Thymocyte mitogen reactivity is increased by lesions of the hippocampus (p less than 0.001) and amygdaloid complex (p less than 0.001). These effects manifest themselves maximally 4 days after lesioning, with a return to normal by day 14. These preliminary data indicated that quantitative and qualitative lymphocyte functions are altered by ablation of selected brain nuclei, thereby suggesting the presence of neural modulation of immune function.
