The cell attached configuration of the patch clamp method has been used to determine the single channel properties of the ion channel coupled to activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by the endogenous NMDA agonist quinolinate. Openings of the NMDA channel were recorded from cultured CA1 hippocampal neurons over a hyperpolarizing potential range from cell resting potential. The slope conductance of the channel was 39 pS with 75 microM quinolinate, 1.8 mM Ca2+ and no Mg2+ in the patch pipette. The mean channel open times were decreased with hyperpolarization in an exponential manner with a mean slope of 0.6 ms/20 mV. Addition of Mg2+ to the pipette (at 30 microM) caused the mean open time, at a potential of -100 mV, to be decreased to a value about one-third that of control. The mean open times with quinolinate as the agonist were shorter for all potentials studied compared with activation of the NMDA receptor with NMDA or D-cis-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD). Both the mean open times and the channel amplitudes were significantly altered when the bath temperature was decreased; the Q10 values for both quantities were in excess of 2.8.
