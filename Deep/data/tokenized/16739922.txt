Possible mechanisms of antioxidant activity of glycyrrhizinic acid (GA) were studied. GA did not exhibit antiradical properties at the range of concentrations 1-100 mM as was shown in the experiments with stable radical 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl. These data were conformed by the study of GA influence on chemiluminescence of luminol in cell-free system with hydrogen peroxide. However, GA decreased generation of reactive oxygen species by PMA-FMLF-activated neutrophils. Addition of GA did not ifluence free radical level in neurons, however, cell preincubation with GA resulted in the decrease of free radicals production and the increase of intracellular glutathione level.
