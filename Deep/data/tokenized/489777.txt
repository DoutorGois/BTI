The time courses for the appearance and removal of degenerating terminals and the loss and reappearance of intact terminals were investigated in the partially denervated inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of the adult rat. Dense degeneration was evident in the neuropil within 26 hours following contralateral hippocampectomy. These profiles increased rapidly in number until the maximal degree was reached at two to three days postlesion, after which the degenerating terminals were quickly removed from the neuropil. A more rapid rate of removal occurred during the 3-to 5-day survival period than from 6 to 50 days postlesion. The intact terminal population dropped 35% within two days of the lesion and remained at this level until six to eight days postlesion when the number began to steadily increase. The time course for this reappearance can be divided into two phases: a period of rapid terminal addition from 6 to 15 days followed by a phase of slower acquisition. This recovery continued until the normal synaptic density was regained by 50 to 65 days postlesion. These results indicate that a substantial proportion of degenerating endings are removed well in advance of the time at which terminal proliferation begins, suggesting that certain changes other than merely the removal of competitive inputs must take place prior to growth of new terminals. Possible explanation suggested by the present results for the delay in the onset of sprouting include: (1) an absence of appropriate postsynaptic targets during the 2-to 5-day postlesion period and (2) inhibition of axonal growth by the glial cells which are phagocytizing the degenerating products. Beyond the sixth postlesion day the rate at which new terminals appear does correlate with the rate at which degeneration is removed. This suggests that once underway the time course for sprouting may be determined by the avaiabliity of postsynaptic sites.
