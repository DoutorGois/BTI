The distribution of neurotensin-containing cell bodies and fibers was examined in the central nervous system of the dog using light microscopic immunohistochemistry. A very large population of neurotensin-containing cell bodies was observed in the septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens septi, preoptic areas, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, olfactory tubercle, entorhinal cortex, ventral subiculum, anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, anteroventral thalamic nucleus, nucleus reuniens, lateral habenular nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Extremely dense networks of neurotensin-containing fibers were found in the globus pallidus, hypothalamus, infundibular stalk, ventral tegmental area, periaqueductal gray, interpeduncular nucleus, and spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve and substantia gelatinosa. However, the cerebral neocortex and cerebellum were negative for neurotensin in the present study. When the present findings are compared with those in other animals, it is clear that the major species-specific differences in distribution involve three immunonegative regions and four immunopositive regions in the dog: The former are the cerebral neocortex, mammillary body, and hippocampus; the latter are the cell bodies in the pyramidal layer of the olfactory tubercle, the superficial and middle layers of the entorhinal cortex and ventral subiculum, and the nerve fibers in the interpeduncular nucleus. The present study indicates a rather extensive network of neurotensin neurons in the central nervous system of the dog.
