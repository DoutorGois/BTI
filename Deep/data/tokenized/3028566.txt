Intracellular recordings from hippocampal pyramidal cells in the CA1 subfield of the 'in vitro' slice in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5-50 microM) revealed a long-lasting (up to 1.5 s) depolarizing potential which occurred either spontaneously or following orthodromic stimulation. This potential was: capable of blocking both direct and synaptic activation of the cell; sensitive to bath application of low concentrations of bicuculline methiodide; and associated to an extracellular current sink in the dendrites as suggested by the extracellular field potentials recorded at different levels along an axis perpendicular to the stratum pyramidale. It is concluded that the long-lasting depolarizing potential evoked by 4-AP is caused by the activation of GABA receptors localized in the dendritic region of the CA1 subfield.
