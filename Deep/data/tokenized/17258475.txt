The dedifferentiation agent "reversine" [2-(4-morpholinoanilino)-N6-cyclohexyladenine 2], which can induce myogenic lineage-committed cells to become multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells, was discovered by Shuibing Chen et al. in 2003. But its effects on neurons were unknown. Using patch-clamp technique, we found that reversine inhibits spontaneous synaptic transmission in cultured rat hippocampal neurons without influencing the dynamics function of potassium, sodium and calcium channels. This result suggests that reversine may also act as a dedifferentiation agent in neurons, and inhibiting the synaptic transmission maybe the early step of neuronal dedifferentiation.
