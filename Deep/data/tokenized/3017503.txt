The autoradiographic distributions of mu opiate receptors, labeled in vitro by [125I]D-Ala2-MePhe4-Met(o)5-ol-enkephalin (FK), and delta-opiate receptors, labeled by [3H]D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) in the presence of oxymorphone to block high affinity binding to the mu site, were examined and compared in the forebrain of the rat. The mu- and delta-receptors were differentially distributed in most structures. mu Binding sites were found in nearly all gray matter structures and showed heterogeneous patterns of density that were correlated with cytoarchitecture and neuronal connections. Laminar density profiles were seen in laminated structures such as olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Highest mu binding densities were in striatal patches and the habenular streak. delta Sites had distinct laminar patterns in the main olfactory bulb and cortex which differed from the mu patterns. The external plexiform layer of the main olfactory bulb had the greatest density of delta binding sites; cortex and striatum were also densely labeled. The septum, globus pallidus, preoptic area and hypothalamus were lightly labeled by both ligands. The magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei had negligible mu and delta labeling. The thalamus had dense mu but sparse delta sites. mu And delta binding sites were both present in the amygdala but had different distributions. Two fiber tracts--optic tract and fasciculus retroflexus--had FK labeling. In contrast, a portion of the corpus callosum was labeled by DADLE and not by FK. The results suggest an association of mu-opiate receptors with sensory, especially olfactory, and limbic projections in the forebrain, and delta-opiate receptors with intrinsic and commissural forebrain pathways.
