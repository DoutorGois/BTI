Gamma-hydroxybutyrate administered in anesthetic doses produces a time dependent increase in the levels of rat barin acetylcholine. A maximal increase in whole brain and subcortical levels of acetylcholine is observed about 15 min after administration of the lactone form of the drug. A similar GHB-induced increase in acetylcholine is observed in the striatum and a 75% increase in the hippocampus 15 min after administration of the drug. A good temporal correlation was not obtained between the increase in acetylcholine and the depth of anesthesia produced by the drug. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate did not cause a significant change in the striatal or hippocampal levels of choline. Possible mechanisms involved in the production of this increase in acetylcholine are discussed.
