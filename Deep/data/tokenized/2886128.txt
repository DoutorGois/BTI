(6-(7-Chloro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)-7-oxo-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-5H- 1,4- dithiino[2,3-c]pyrrol-5-yl)-4-methyl-1-piperazinecarboxylate (suriclone, RP 31264), a new anxiolytic, produced behavioral effects similar to those of diazepam and lorazepam, had a protective effect against electroshock convulsion and potentiated the sleeping effect of hexobarbital in mice. It inhibited crossed extensor reflexes in chicks and augmented the dorsal root reflex potential, the increase of which is considered to be an index of increased GABAergic presynaptic inhibition. Suriclone produced high-amplitude slow waves in the amygdala and cerebral cortex and desynchronization of theta waves in the hippocampus in rat electroencephalogram (EEG). These observations were quantitatively confirmed by power spectrum analysis of EEG. The mechanisms of action of suriclone on the CNS are discussed in relation to those of benzodiazepines.
