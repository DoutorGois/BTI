In 1991 the brains of 15 persons with an age of at least 60 years and without neurologic or psychiatric disorders were investigated prospectively. Different brain-areas (topographically exactly defined) were investigated for so-called brain-aging. Only the frequency of corpora amylacea and primitive senile plaques showed a tendency to increase in the elderly. A defined correlation to the calendaric age could not be stated.
