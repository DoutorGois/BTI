The long-term potentiation (LTP) in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) induced at hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neuron synapses by delivery of high frequency stimulation (HFS), a tetanus of 100 pulses at 100Hz, is decreased (depotentiation) by a train of low frequency stimulation (LFS) of 1000 pulses at 2Hz applied 30min later. Inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) activated both during the HFS and after the LFS are involved in this depotentiation, the former triggering, and the latter modifying, LTP induction (decreasing the amplitude of the LTP established by the priming HFS). Furthermore, the decrease in the LTP at CA1 synapses requires activation of IP3Rs during LFS and activation of calcineurin after LFS. These results suggest that, at hippocampal CA1 neuron synapses, HFS-induced IP3R activation, which is modulated by the subsequent LFS, results in postsynaptic protein dephosphorylation after the LFS, leading to a decrease in the field EPSP and in the HFS-induced LTP.
