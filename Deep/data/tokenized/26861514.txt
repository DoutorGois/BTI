Metformin (Met) is used to treat neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conversely, high-fat diets (HFD) have been shown to increase AD risk. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of Met on beta-amyloid (Abeta)-induced impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in AD model rats that were fed a HFD. In this study, 32 adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: group I (control group, regular diet); group II (HFD+vehicle); group III (HFD+Abeta); or group IV (Met+HFD+Abeta). Rats fed a HFD were injected with Abeta to induce AD, allowed to recover, and treated with Met for 8 weeks. The rats were then anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of urethane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for surgery, electrode implantation, and field potential recording. In vivo electrophysiological recordings were then performed to measure population spike (PS) amplitude and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slope in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by high-frequency stimulation of the perforant pathway. Blood samples were then collected to measure plasma levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoproteins, very low-density lipoprotein, and cholesterol. After induction of LTP, PS amplitude and EPSP slope were significantly decreased in Abeta-injected rats fed a HFD compared to vehicle-injected animals or untreated animals that were fed a normal diet. Met treatment of Abeta-injected rats significantly attenuated these decreases, suggesting that Met decreased the effects of Abeta on LTP. These findings suggest that Met treatment is neuroprotective against the detrimental effects of Abeta and HFDs on hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
