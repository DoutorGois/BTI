The actions of a behaviorally active luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone fragment, Ac-LHRH(5-10), on CA1 pyramidal cells were studied utilizing conventional intracellular recordings from the in vitro rat hippocampal slice preparation. The behaviorally active fragment (10(-7) M) and the natural decapeptide [LHRH(1-10), 10(-8) M] had similar actions on CA1 neurons: a long-duration depolarization associated with increased input resistance, a reduction in the slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP), and a decrease in accommodation. In contrast, a biologically inactive LHRH fragment [LHRH(1-6) at 10(-7) M] had no effect on electrical properties of CA1 neurons. These data suggest that Ac-LHRH(5-10), like LHRH(1-10), may have a modulatory action on hippocampal neurons.
