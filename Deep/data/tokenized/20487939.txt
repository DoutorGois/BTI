Results are discussed indicating that neurotransmitters affect steroid hormone activity not only by controlling via neuroendocrine events the hypophysial-gonadal and hypophysial-adrenal axes, but also by modulating cell responsiveness to steroids in target cells. Hyper- or hypoactivity of pineal nerves result in enhancement or impairment of estradiol and testosterone effects on pineal metabolism in vivo and in vitro. Pineal cytoplasmic and nuclear estrogen and androgen receptors are modulated by norepinephrine released from nerve endings at the pinealocyte level. Neural activity affects the cycle of depletion-replenishment of pineal estrogen receptors following estradiol administration. Another site of modulation of steroid effects on the pinealocytes is the intracellular metabolism of testosterone and progesterone; nerve activity has a positive effect on testosterone aromatization and a negative effect on testosterone and progesterone 5?-reduction. NE activity on the pineal cells is mediated via ?-adrenoceptors and cAMP. In the central nervous system information on the neurotransmitter modulation of steroid hormone action includes the following observations: (a) hypothalamic deafferentation depresses estrogen receptor levels in rat medial basal hypothalamus; (b) changes in noradrenergic transmission affect, via ?-adrenoceptors, the estradiol-induced increase of cytosol progestin receptor concentration in guinea pig hypothalamus; (c) cAMP increases testosterone aromatization in cultured neurons from turtle brain; (d) electrical stimulation of dorsal hippocampus augments, and reserpine or 6-hydroxydopamine treatment decrease, corticoid binding in cat hypothalamus. In the adenohypophysis changes in dopaminergic input after median eminence lesions or bromocriptine treatment of rats result in opposite modifications of pituitary estrogen receptor levels. Therefore all these observations support the view that neurotransmitters can modulate the attachment of steroid hormones to their receptors in target cells.
