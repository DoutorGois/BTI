5-HT (10 and 40 micrograms) and 8-OH-DPAT (1 and 5 micrograms) were locally applied into the dorsal or median raphe nuclei in awake, unrestrained, rats. All animals were also treated with the 5-HTP and DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015, 100 mg kg-1 SC, 30 min before decapitation. 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT were administered 5 min before NSD-1015. The regional brain in vivo rate of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activity was estimated by measuring the accumulation of DOPA and 5-HTP. The following brain regions were sampled: neocortex, hippocampus, dorso-lateral neostriatum, ventro-medial neostriatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, globus pallidus, septum and the amygdala. Compared to normal controls, there were small and inconsistent effects on forebrain 5-HTP accumulation by saline injections into the dorsal or the median raphe (an increase in 3 out of 36 experiments), whereas strong effects by the injection procedure were noted on forebrain DOPA accumulation (an increase in 15 out of 36 experiments). Injections of 5-HT (same effect by 10 or 40 micrograms) into the dorsal raphe, produced a decrease in 5-HTP accumulation in all forebrain areas except for the hippocampus and the septum, whereas no effects were seen in any area after median raphe injections. In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT preferentially produced a decrease in forebrain 5-HTP accumulation after median raphe injections and less, but statistically significant effects by dorsal raphe injections. The 8-OH-DPAT injection into the median raphe primarily affected limbic forebrain areas (hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, ventro-medial neostriatum, amygdala and the septum). This dissociation of the effects of 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT on forebrain 5-HT synthesis after local application into the dorsal or the median raphe strongly supports the contention of heterogeniety in the brain 5-HT receptor population in terms of receptor subtypes and/or receptor regulation.
