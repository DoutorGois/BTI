The glycoproteins and polyanionic substances distribution on the albino rat hippocampus has been investigated during the post-natal development by using histochemical methods. It was observed that the Ruthenium Red and the Colloidal Iron disclose the existence of special neurons, the ones observed with Ruthenium Red being different from those shown with Colloidal Iron. The Ruthenium Red-positive neurons present a different distribution from that of the Colloidal Iron--positive ones, observing that the latter appear only in 30 to 35 days old rats. It may be that the Colloidal Iron-positive neurons are cells endowed with a great neurotransmissive activity.
