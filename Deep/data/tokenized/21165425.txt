HPLC analysis showed that endogenous cyclopeptide cycloprolylglycine exhibiting mnemotropic and anxiolytic properties is nonuniformly distributed between brain structures in rats: its contents in the whole brain, cortex, and hippocampus were 29.2+/-1.6, 38.9+/-8.0, 126.4+/-32.4 nmol/g, respectively. Cycloprolylglycine distribution between subcellular fractions of brain neurons is also nonuniform: 60% cyclopeptide appeared in the nuclear fraction.
