The optimal duration of mild "therapeutic" hypothermia for neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is surprisingly unclear. This study assessed the relative efficacy of cooling for 48 h versus 72 h. Fetal sheep (0.85 gestation) received sham ischemia (n = 9) or 30 min global cerebral ischemia followed by normothermia (n = 8) or delayed hypothermia from 3 h to 48 h (n = 8) or 72 h (n = 8). Ischemia was associated with profound loss of electroencephalogram (EEG) power, neurons in the cortex and hippocampus, and oligodendrocytes and myelin basic protein expression in the white matter, with increased Iba-1-positive microglia and proliferation. Hypothermia for 48 h was associated with improved outcomes compared to normothermia, but a progressive deterioration of EEG power after rewarming compared to 72 h of hypothermia, with impaired neuronal survival and myelin basic protein, and more microglia in the white matter and cortex. These findings show that head cooling for 48 h is partially neuroprotective, but is inferior to cooling for 72 h after cerebral ischemia in fetal sheep. The close association between rewarming at 48 h, subsequent deterioration in EEG power and increased cortical inflammation strongly suggests that deleterious inflammation can be reactivated by premature rewarming.
