The effects of transient cerebral ischemia on phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor by protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA) were investigated. Adult rats received 15 min of cerebral ischemia followed by various times of recovery. Phosphorylation was examined by immunoblotting hippocampal homogenates with antibodies that recognized NR1 phosphorylated on the PKC phosphorylation sites Ser890 and Ser896, the PKA phosphorylation site Ser897, or dually phosphorylated on Ser896 and Ser897. The phosphorylation of all sites examined increased following ischemia. The increase in phosphorylation by PKC was greater than by PKA. The ischemia-induced increase in phosphorylation was predominantly associated with the population of NR1 that was insoluble in 1% deoxycholate. Enhanced phosphorylation of NR1 by PKC and PKA may contribute to alterations in NMDA receptor function in the postischemic brain.
