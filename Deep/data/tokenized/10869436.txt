We examined the learning and memory of neurotrophin-4 (NT4)-/- mice by using fear conditioning. In both cue and context conditioning, we found significant deficits in the NT4 mutants at 2 and 24 h after training but not at 30 min. Hippocampal slices from the mutant mice showed normal basal synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity, and decremental long-term potentiation (LTP) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. These findings, together with the normal short-term memory, suggest that the hippocampal development of NT4-/- mice is largely unaffected. However, consistent with the long-term memory defects, the long-lasting LTP at the same synapses was attenuated significantly in the mutant mice. Our results suggest that NT4 plays a physiological role essential for hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent long-term memory and hippocampal long-lasting LTP and that NT4 may be useful in the therapy of acquired disorders of learning and memory.
