Involvement of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) on glutamate receptor-mediated response was investigated in neuronal cells cultured from embryonic rat hippocampus. L-NG-Nitroarginine (NOARG), a NO synthase inhibitor, augmented NMDA- and kainate-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) measured by fura-2 fluorometry. However, quisqualate-induced response was not affected. The potentiating effect of NOARG was blocked by L-arginine, a substrate for NO synthase. NOARG was also effective when added after glutamate-induced response had reached a steady-state. Hemoglobin itself increased the basal level of [Ca2+]i at concentrations higher than 10 mM, and treatment of the cells with 1.0 mM hemoglobin had no effect on NMDA response. 8-Bromo-cyclic GMP was not effective on NMDA response. These results suggest that endogenous NO inhibits NMDA- and kainate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i as a negative feedback system independent of guanylate cyclase activation.
