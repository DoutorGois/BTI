Sixteen gerbils were subjected to 5 min of forebrain ischemia. Their brains were processed for immunohistochemical staining using monoclonal antibodies against a synaptic vesicle-associated protein 38 (SVP-38) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) after recirculation times of 10 min, and 1, 4, and 7 days. After 10 min recirculation, SVP-38 immunoreactive dots were observed only in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. After 1 day recirculation, SVP-38 immunostaining was diffuse and weak throughout the hippocampus, despite preservation of MAP2 immunoreactivity. After 4 and 7 days recirculation, SVP-38 immunoreactivity had been restored in the whole hippocampus, despite the complete loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity due to delayed neuronal death. Our results demonstrate an immediate and significant change in the immunoreactivity of a synaptic vesicle-associated protein at the beginning of the process of delayed neuronal death. Thus, changes in the immunoreactivity of synaptic vesicle-associated proteins such as SVP-38 appear to be one of the earliest indicators of the onset of neuronal death.
