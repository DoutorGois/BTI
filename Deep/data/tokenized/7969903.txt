The development and plasticity of axons and dendrites in mammalian neurons may depend on the presence and phosphorylation state of cytoskeletal proteins, including certain microtubule-associated proteins. One of these proteins, microtubule-associated protein 1B, is modified by different protein kinases, which give rise to two major types of phosphorylated isoforms. The distribution of these isoforms in cultured hippocampal neurons has been studied using antibodies to specific phosphorylation-sensitive epitopes. Mode I-phosphorylated MAP1B is largely restricted to developing axonal processes, particularly at their distal regions including their growth cones where no mode I-dephosphorylated MAP1B is present. Axonal maturation is accompanied by dephosphorylation of MAP1B at mode I sites. Thus, mode I-phosphorylated MAP1B may be a marker for axonal growth. In contrast, mode II-phosphorylated MAP1B is abundant in the axonal and somatodendritic compartments, and no increased dephosphorylation occurs during maturation. These results are compatible with a role for the mode I phosphorylation of MAP1B (which might be catalysed by proline-directed protein kinases) in supporting a rapid axonal-specific growth mechanism and a more general role for the mode II phosphorylation of MAP1B (which seems to be catalysed by casein kinase II) in controlling axonal and dendritic growth and remodeling.
