Lesions of the entorhinal cortex in neonatal rats cause the commissural projections to the dentate gyrus to spread from their normal location in the inner molecular layer into the outer molecular layer, a region normally occupied by afferents from the entorhinal cortex. These lesions also cause the short-latency response to commissural stimulation to spread into the outer molecular layer, a result suggesting that these abnormally located connections are operative.
