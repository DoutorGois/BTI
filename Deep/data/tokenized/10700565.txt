Neuronal protein synthesis is inhibited in CA1 pyramidal neurons for many hours after ischemia, hypoxia or hypoglycemia. This inhibition precedes cell death, is a hallmark characteristic of necrotic damage and may play a key role in the death of vulnerable neurons after these insults. The sequence of events leading to this inhibition remains to be fully elucidated. The protein synthesis failure after 7.5 min anoxia/aglycemia in the rat hippocampal slice can be prevented by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in a reduced calcium environment during the insult. In this study, we demonstrate that N-methyl-D-aspartate exposure directly causes a dose-dependent, receptor-mediated and prolonged protein synthesis inhibition in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The free radical scavenger Vitamin E significantly attenuates this damage due to low concentrations of N-methyl-D-aspartate (10 microM). Free radical generation by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (XOD) can directly damage protein synthesis in neurons of the slice. Vitamin E, ascorbic acid and N-acetylcysteine can each prevent the damage due to anoxia/aglycemia and to higher concentrations of N-methyl-D-aspartate (50 microM), provided calcium levels are reduced concomitantly. These findings indicate that both free radicals and calcium play a role in the sequence of events leading to protein synthesis failure after energetic stress like anoxia/aglycemia. They further suggest that the mechanism by which N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation damages protein synthesis involves free radical generation.
