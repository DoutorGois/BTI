The possibility that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the pathophysiology of brain injury caused by heat stress (HS) was examined using immunohistochemistry of a constitutive isoform of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (c-NOS) in a rat model. In addition, to discover the role of oxidative stress in inducing c-NOS activity in HS, the effect of a new antioxidant H-290/51 on HS-induced expression of c-NOS immunoreactivity was examined. Subjection of conscious young animals to a 4-h HS in a biological oxygen demand (BOD) incubator at 38 degrees C resulted in marked upregulation of c-NOS in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of stressed rats compared to normal rats kept at room temperature (21 +/- 1 degrees C). The c-NOS immunoreactivity was found in distorted neurons located in the edematous regions not normally showing c-NOS activity. Pretreatment with H-290/51 significantly attenuated the upregulation of c-NOS in animals subjected to HS, and the signs of neuronal distortion and edema were less pronounced. These results suggest that HS has the capacity to induce upregulation of c-NOS, and these effects can be reduced by prior treatment with H-290/51, indicating a possible neuroprotective effect of antioxidants in thermal brain injury.
