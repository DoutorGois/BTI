The Mongolian gerbil, with its spontaneous epileptiform seizures, was chosen as an experimental model of human epilepsy. Neurochemical parameters possibly related to the seizure process were studied. In the immediate seizure process amino acid profiles of cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were not different in seizuring animals when compared to seizure-resistance controls. Of two peptides analyzed, only somatostatin appeared elevated in the cortex 2 hr postictal (143 fmol/mg protein; controls, 123 fmol/mg protein); neuropeptide Y was not affected. A follow up of the time course of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP showed significant elevations of both substances as a consequence of seizures. Most prominent was a 5.5-fold increase in cyclic GMP in the cerebellum 30 sec after seizure onset.
