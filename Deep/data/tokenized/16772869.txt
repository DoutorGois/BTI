The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase SAPK/JNK phosphorylates tau protein at many of its proline-directed serine/threonine residues in vitro and is a likely candidate kinase to phosphorylate the pathologically relevant S422 site on tau. Since phosphorylation of tau, particularly at S422, is a relatively early marker of AD and seems to precede tangle formation, it appears likely that an early form of activated SAPK/JNK might be detected by immunohistochemical means around the time that tau begins to aggregate into tangles. We report here that an antibody to phospho-SAPK/JNK (p-SAPK/JNK) reacts with several types of lesions including granular bodies in limbic areas; NFTs in limbic cortex and temporal neocortex; occasional neuritic plaques in temporal neocortex; and select axons in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and inferior temporal cortex. In order to characterize the appearance of granular p-SAPK/JNK and determine if it appears early in disease, we employed an immunohistochemical study of postmortem limbic tissue from 20 cases ranging from Braak stages I-VI. By co-staining with anti-tau antibodies specific to different molecular events that occur during tangle evolution, we were able to identify the appearance of p-SAPK/JNK in early Braak stages with an increased elevation during the limbic stages of AD and during the early stages of the formation of individual hippocampal tangles.
