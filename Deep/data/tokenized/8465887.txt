Thirteen polydipsic and 40 nonpolydipsic chronic schizophrenic patients received the dexamethasone suppression test while stabilized on psychotropic medication regimens. Thirty-eight percent (N = 5) of those with polydipsia but only 5% (N = 2) of those without polydipsia were nonsuppressors of cortisol (i.e., had an abnormal response). It is suggested that hippocampal dysfunction could cause both polydipsia and cortisol dysregulation in these patients.
