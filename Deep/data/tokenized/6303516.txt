Exposure of rats to 25 min anoxia within 24 h following birth caused behavioural as well as biochemical changes during their development and maturity. Following postnatal anoxia, a significant increase in the concentration of the cholinergic muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus was noted at the early stages of development, between 6 and 20 days of age, but reached normal values at 40 days of age. However, at this age, significant increase in the concentration of beta-adrenergic receptors in the hippocampus was found, which remained significantly high during maturity and adulthood, as compared to controls. Rats submitted postnatally to anoxia exhibited hyperactivity in the open field which was maximal at 20-25 days of age and declined towards normal values at 40 days of age. At maturity, between 60 and 80 days of age, these rats showed poor performance in a complex 6-choice discrimination learning but not in simple differential conditioning. Possible correlations between the behavioural and biochemical findings are discussed.
