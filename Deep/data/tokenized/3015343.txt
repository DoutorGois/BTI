Acute injection of haloperidol into the lateral septum in mice produced an immediate and long-lasting increase in hippocampal sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake. Parallel electrophysiological investigations revealed that the increased septo-hippocampal cholinergic activity augmented CA1 pyramidal cell excitability and also accelerated the extinction of a conditioned reinforcement. These results constitute further evidence that septal dopaminergic terminals, via their control of septo-hippocampal cholinergic activity play a significant role in the modulation of hippocampal function.
