AF64A is a toxic analog of choline that disrupts high affinity choline transport and produces a persistent presynaptic cholinergic hypofunction. The observed neuroprotectant effects of Vitamin E in the AF64A model suggested that oxidative stress contributed to the cholinotoxicity of AF64A. The studies presented here examined whether intraventricular injection of AF64A produces oxidative stress in the brain of male Wistar rats. Indices of oxidative stress including thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), free radical generation using hydrogen peroxide-induced, luminol-dependent chemiluminescence (CL) and superoxide scavenging/generating activity were measured in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and the rest of the brain, without cerebellum, 1, 3 or 5 days after bilateral intraventricular injection of 3 nmol of AF64A or artificial CSF (sham surgery). The sham operation itself induced oxidative stress throughout the brain (increased TBARS, CL and superoxide generation). In addition to the oxidative stress of the sham surgery AF64A increased basal TBARS on day 1 and Fe/ascorbate-induced TBARS on days 3 and 5 throughout the brain. AF64A produced compensatory 'antioxidative' changes as well with increased superoxide scavenging activity observed on day 3 and decreased basal TBARS on day 5. AF64A also induced specific changes in the hippocampus including a decrease of CL and an increase of superoxide scavenging activity on day 5. The increased superoxide scavenging activity persisted up to 126 days. The results of the present study provide the first direct evidence that AF64A induces oxidative stress following intraventricular injection.
