Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) is a form of short-term, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity common to most chemically transmitting synapses, manifested as an enhancement in the amplitude of the second of two rapidly evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). The generally accepted explanation of PPF posits that residual intraterminal free [Ca(2+)] from the first action potential facilitates the probability of transmitter release evoked by the second stimulus. A common extension of this hypothesis postulates that any plastic change which alters the probability of transmitter release, should also alter the magnitude of PPF. In the present study, we examined the relationship between PPF and both stimulus- and chemically-evoked long-term depression of synaptic strength (LTD) at Schaffer collateral-CA1, commissural/associational-CA3 and mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in rat hippocampal slices. We observed no significant change in mean PPF associated with either electrically- or chemically-induced LTD at any of these synapses. However, a correlation analysis revealed a complex pattern of PPF changes with LTD, such that low initial PPF was correlated with increases in PPF, while high initial PPF was associated with decreases. Combined with previous findings supporting a presynaptic site for chemical and stimulus-evoked LTD, our current data suggests a complex set of neurosecretory modifications downstream of presynaptic Ca(2+) influx, may, at least in part, underlie the expression of LTD.
