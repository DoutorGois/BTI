Recent hypotheses to explain the neurobiology of depression underline the role played by stress in mood disorders. The endocannabinoid system is one of the major physiological substrates involved in emotional responses and stress. Thus, mice lacking CB(1) receptor exhibit a depressive-like phenotype and an increased vulnerability to deleterious effects of stress. In order to identify possible molecular pathways contributing to this phenotype, we have examined the gene expression profile of mutants at basal conditions and after the exposure to repeated stress. Several genes coding for neurotransmitter receptors, neurotrophic factors, neuropeptides and hormones receptors were differentially expressed in CB(1) knockout mice.
