Photic-induced seizures are usually generalized. There are several cases of focal seizures reported, and all have been shown to arise from the visual cortex. We report an unusual case of temporal lobe epilepsy, supported by electroclinical data and confirmed by a successful temporal lobectomy, with seizures induced by photic stimulation.
