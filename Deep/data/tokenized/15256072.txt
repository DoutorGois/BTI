To study effects of short-term cerebral ischemia, hippocampal slice cultures were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by a period of normoxic reoxygenation. Propidium iodide staining, and MTT/formazan-assay were used to evaluate cell viability and metabolic activity. CA1 pyramidal cells were analyzed at the light- and electron microscopic levels. Cell damage was found to be insignificant during the first hour after 10 min OGD but profound following 4 h, showing delayed neuronal cell damage caused by short-term OGD. Our model can be used to characterize the mechanisms of cell damage caused by mild cerebral ischemia. These data might apply to further development of neuroprotective tools for the treatment of brain diseases.
