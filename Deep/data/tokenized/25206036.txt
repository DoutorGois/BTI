BACKGROUND: Alcohol is a potent teratogen inducing oxidative stress as well as a massive wave of apoptosis in the developing brain as well as oxidative stress. It affects brain including cerebellum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex resulting into motor and cognitive deficits. Alcohol depletes folic acid from the body which is essential for synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein during cell division and proved to prevent many brain related malformations. PURPOSE: The objective of the present study was to study whether folic acid reduces behavioral impairments that were induced by prenatal exposure to ethanol in mice. METHODS: Pregnant mice were divided into different experimental groups. Group I termed as control receiving distilled water, group II received ethanol, group III ethanol and folic acid and group IV folic acid only from gestational days 6 to 15. The dams were allowed to deliver their offspring naturally and until weaning the pups remained with their natural mothers. At the age of 8-9 weeks, they were subjected to battery of various behavioral tests. RESULTS: The alcohol exposed dams showed decreased motor activity in open field test and decreased exploration and increased anxiety in elevated maze test as compared to controls. Folic acid administration reduced the intensity of these effects of alcohol in mice. CONCLUSION: The exposure to alcohol in utero produces long lasting effect on the developing pharmacological character of brain affecting postnatal behavioral expression which may be reduced by prenatal folic acid administration.
