The physiological development of monosynaptic response habituation in the rat dentate gyrus was compared to morphological development. Rapid Golgi techniques were coupled with in vitro studies of dentate granule cell habituation to several frequencies and intensities of monosynaptic excitation. Except for the youngest group, the degree of habituation increased as a function of age, paralleling the morphological development.
