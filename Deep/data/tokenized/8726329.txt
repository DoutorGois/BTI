Slices of hippocampus of the rat, preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA), were used to investigate the effects of toosendanin on the release of [3H]NA. Toosendanin potently enhanced spontaneous 3H outflow. Seventy-four percent of the enhancement was inhibited by reserpine pretreatment. The toosendanin-induced 3H overflow was in a concentration-dependent manner (5-60 microM) both in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. Under Ca(2+)-free conditions, the effect of toosendanin on 3H outflow was unchanged by TTX, but inhibited by Ca(2+)-chelator BAPTA-AM; dantrolene sodium failed to affect the toosendanin-induced 3H outflow, while 3,4-diaminopyridine showed an additive effect on the outflow with this substance. The findings suggest that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, toosendanin enhances [3H]NA release through the liberation of intracellular Ca2+ stores.
