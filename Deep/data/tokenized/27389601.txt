Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common age-related movement disorder and characterized by slowly progressive neurodegeneration resulting in motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. Moreover, non-motor symptoms, such as hyposmia, anxiety and depression reduce the quality of life in PD. Motor symptoms are associated with a distinct striatal dopaminergic deficit resulting from axonal dysfunction and neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN). Recent progress in stem cell technology allows the optimization of cellular transplantation strategies in order to alleviate the motor deficit, which potentially leads to a reactivation of this therapeutic strategy. Besides neurodegenerative processes impaired adult neurogenesis and consequentially reduced endogenous cellular plasticity may play an important role in PD. This article discusses the notion that non-motor symptoms in PD may partly be explained by reduced adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus.
