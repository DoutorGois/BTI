Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is emerging as a prominent therapeutic target of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of studies have been undertaken to develop GSK-3 inhibitors for clinical use. We report two novel GSK-3 inhibitors (C-7a and C-7b) showing good activity and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. IC50 of new GSK-3 inhibitors were in the range of 120-130 nM, and they effectively reduced the Abeta-oligomers induced neuronal toxicity. Also, new GSK-3 inhibitors decreased the phosphorylated tau at pThr231, pSer396, pThr181, and pSer202, and inhibited the GSK-3 activity against Abeta-oligomers induced neuronal cell toxicity. In B6;129-Psen1(tm1Mpm) Tg(APPSwe, tauP301L)1Lfa/Mmjax model of AD, oral administration of C-7a (20 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg) showed increased total arm entries and spontaneous alteration of Y-maze which was regarded as short-term memory. In particular, 50 mg/kg C-7a treated mice significantly decreased the level of phosphorylated tau (Ser396) in brain hippocampus. We suggest that new GSK-3 inhibitor (C-7a) is potential candidates for the treatment of AD.
