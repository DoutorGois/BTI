Removal of the entorhinal cortical projection to the hippocampus in adult rats decreased the density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the denervated dentate gyrus outer molecular layer at two days postlesion. Thirty days following the lesion (in adults and neonates) there is a small receptor density increase in the outer molecular layer (may be due to tissue shrinkage), and a larger increase in the lacunosum-moleculare. The receptor density decrease seen two days postlesion suggests the presence of presynaptic muscarinic receptors on the lost entorhinal cortical fibers. The distribution and extent of the receptor changes seen at 30 days postlesion are inconsistent with the cholinergic fiber reorganization which follows an entorhinal cortical lesion, but are consistent with a proposed model of non-cholinergic afferent mediated control of muscarinic receptor density in the rat hippocampus.
