1. Experiments were performed in rat hippocampal slices to examine the nature of GABAergic inhibition of inhibitory synaptic transmission. In these experiments the effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABAB) receptor agonist, baclofen, and of subtype-selective calcium channel blockers were tested with the use of intracellular recordings of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) and whole cell recordings of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). 2. Baclofen inhibited evoked and spontaneous (action-potential-dependent) monosynaptic GABAA-mediated IPSPs and IPSCs but had no effect on the frequency of tetrodotoxin-resistant (action-potential-independent) miniature IPSCs recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons. 3. Depolarizing GABAergic synaptic terminals by raising the extracellular potassium concentration caused an increase in action-potential-independent miniature IPSC frequency that could be inhibited by either baclofen or cadmium, a blocker of voltage-dependent calcium channels. In addition, under these depolarizing conditions, cadmium occluded the baclofen inhibition of miniature IPSCs. These data suggest that baclofen reduces only depolarization-induced, not quantal, GABA release and that it does so by decreasing presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium influx. 4. Experiments with subtype-selective calcium channel blockers demonstrate that the presynaptic action of baclofen was mediated through both omega-conotoxin-GVIA-sensitive and omega-agatoxin-IVA-sensitive, but not dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channels.
