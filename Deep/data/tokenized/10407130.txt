Maternal changes in dietary choline availability alter brain biochemistry and hippocampal development in the offspring resulting in lifelong behavioral changes in the offspring. In order to better understand the relationship between maternal diet, brain cytoarchitecture and behavior, we investigated the effects of choline availability on cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation in the fetal rat brain septum. Timed-pregnant rats on day E12 were fed AIN-76 diet with varying levels of dietary choline for 6 days. We found that choline deficiency (CD) significantly decreased the rate of mitosis in the progenitor neuroepithelium adjacent to the septum. In addition, we found an increased number of apoptotic cells in the septum of CD animals compared to controls (3.5+/-0.5 vs. 1.7+/-0.5 apoptotic cells per section; p<0.05). However, CD had no effect on apoptosis in the indusium griseum (IG), a region of cortex dorsal to the septum. Using an unbiased image analysis method and a monoclonal antibody we found a decreased expression of the TOAD-64 kDa protein, a marker of commitment to neuronal differentiation during fetal development, in the dorsal lateral septum of CD animals. CD also decreased the expression of TOAD-64 kDa protein in the IG and cortical plate adjacent to the septum. These results show that dietary choline availability during pregnancy alters the timing of mitosis, apoptosis and the early commitment to neuronal differentiation by progenitor cells in regions of the fetal brain septum, as well as hippocampus, two brain regions known to be associated with learning and memory.
