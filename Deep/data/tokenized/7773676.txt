In CA1-CA3 hippocampal slices, in vitro ethanol (EtOH) (10-100 mM) evoked, as a function of EtOH concentration, a differential release of aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu). Omission of Ca2+ ions from the superfusion media completely abolished the EtOH-induced release of Asp but not that of Glu. In addition, at 20 mM, EtOH enhanced K(+)-evoked release only of Asp. Finally, delayed changes were observed on NMDA-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline (NA) in the dentate gyrus (DG) after withdrawal from EtOH for 30 days.
