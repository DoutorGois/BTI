Pyramidal (CA1) cells in rat hippocampal slices were voltage clamped using a single electrode voltage clamp. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), depolarizing pulses from holding potentials of -60 to -70 mV elicited a slow inward calcium (Ca2+) current and two outward potassium (K+) currents: an A current and a slower, Ca2+-dependent K+ current. Noradrenaline (NA) (20 microM) depressed the amplitude of the K+ currents without affecting the Ca2+ current. The effect of NA could be blocked with propranolol and was mimicked by isoprenaline, suggesting that NA depresses the K+ currents by binding to beta-receptors.
