An increase in the cellular production of gap junction proteins and increased numbers of gap junctions in the neuronoglial syncytium of an epileptic focus have been proposed as a possible mechanism underlying synchronization of discharge. To study this issue, both Northern and Western blot analyses of the gap junction protein connexin 43 mRNA and protein abundance were performed on hippocampal tissue resected from patients presenting with a complex partial seizure disorder arising from the medial temporal area and the hippocampus in particular. Samples from 15 patients with medically intractable seizures were compared to those from 5 nonepileptic patients requiring temporal lobectomy in life-threatening situations. Six of the 15 epileptic patients underwent noninvasive electrographic recording, whereas the remaining 9 patients required intracerebral electrodes for extraoperative recording and therefore showed a more discrete focality than the noninvasive recordings. A decline in the mean levels of connexin 43 mRNA expressed predominantly in astrocytes was noted in the epileptic patient groups, particularly for those cases requiring intracranial electrode placement where ictal onset was more clearly established to be intrahippocampal. Quantitation of connexin 43 protein in both epileptogenic and nonepileptogenic hippocampal tissues showed no significant differences in expression. Although mean values for mRNA showed a decline, clinical outcomes postoperatively showed no correlation with either mRNA or protein expression individually in our epileptic population. The findings indicate that there is effectively no upregulation of mRNA and no increased production of connexin 43 protein in response to the development of epileptogenicity. Rather it appears the influence of gap junctions as a substrate of epileptogenicity in any mechanism(s) underlying synchrony or electrical propagation may be a function of the dynamic state (open versus closed) of the membrane-bound gap junction.
