The application of magnetic resonance imaging method showed that ischemia/hypoxia of the brain of neonatal rats made by the protocol suggested by Levine-Rice induces one-sided lesions in the areas of cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Unilateral ischemic injury leads to a long-term sensorimotor and behavioral distortions within 90-115 days after the operation which has been tested in animals by the battery of tests including Cylinder, Beam-walking, Staircase and Limb-placing test. Chosen battery of tests in combination with magnetic resonance imaging allows to reliably estimate the long-term sensorimotor recovery in adult animals suffered an injury in neonatal age.
