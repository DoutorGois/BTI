The capability of the adult brain to generate new hippocampal neurons after brain insults like stroke is decreasing during the aging process. Recent evidence further indicates that the proliferative properties of the precursor cells change in the aged brain. We therefore analyzed the early proliferative response of distinct precursor cell populations in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in 3 and 16 months old transgenic nestin-green-fluorescent protein mice 4 days after ischemic cortical infarcts. A detailed immunocytochemical analysis of proliferating precursors revealed a significant infarct-induced activation of the earliest radial glia-like precursor cells (type 1 cells) and the more differentiated precursor cell subtypes (type 2b cells) in young mice. In contrast the proliferation of early neuronal precursor cells (type 2a cells) was stimulated in the aged brain. Additional long-term experiments further demonstrated that this differential proliferative response of distinct precursor cells is associated with an enhanced number of newborn neurons in the young DG after stroke whereas this increase in neurogenesis was absent in the aged brain. However, our study demonstrates that even precursor cells in the aged hippocampus possess the ability to respond to remote cortical infarcts.
