The results of several studies have suggested that local circuit neurons, or interneurons, of area CA1 of hippocampus use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their neurotransmitter. However, when these cells were labelled by intracellular dye injection, and examined immunocytochemically with antisera raised against GABA, none of the interneurons were immunoreactive. Numerous non-injected interneurons in the same tissue section were clearly immunoreactive. These results suggest that intracellular dyes interfere with immunocytochemical staining of hippocampal interneurons.
