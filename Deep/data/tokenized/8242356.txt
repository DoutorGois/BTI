We have compared the cellular and synaptic properties of rodent dentate granule cells with those of humans. The human tissue was obtained from neurosurgical procedures which necessitated removal of the hippocampus for treatment of extra-hippocampal tumors which presented clinically with seizures. The hippocampi studied here were neuroanatomically similar to autopsy controls. The present studies have demonstrated that there are few differences between rodent and human granule cells as regards either their membrane properties or their synaptic physiology and pharmacology. The differences we noted were (1) less spike frequency adaptation in the human relative to rodent cells; and (2) perforant path stimulation reliably elicited both feedforward and feedback inhibition in the rodent cells, while in the human tissue feedback inhibition appeared to predominate. It is unclear if these changes are due to the seizure experience or if they represent true species differences.
