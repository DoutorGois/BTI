myo-Inositol is elevated in the Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) brain and may play a role in mental retardation. In the present study, we examined brain regions and peripheral tissues of Ts65Dn mouse, a recently characterized genetic model of DS, for abnormal myo-inositol accumulation. A GC/MS technique was used to quantitate myo-inositol and other polyol species (ribitol, arabitol, xylitol, and 1,5-anhydrosorbitol) in tissues from the Ts65Dn mice and control diploid mice. myo-Inositol was found to be elevated in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and brain stem but not in cerebellum of the Ts65Dn mouse. Among peripheral organs examined, liver and skeletal muscle were found to excessively accumulate myo-inositol. In all tissues, concentrations of polyol internal controls were normal. The Ts65Dn mouse is useful to study the possible effect of elevated myo-inositol on cellular processes.
