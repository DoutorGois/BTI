PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to deliver whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) for one to three brain metastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ten patients previously treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for one to three brain metastases underwent repeat planning using VMAT. The whole brain prescription dose was 32.25 Gy in 15 fractions, and SIB doses to brain metastases were 63 Gy to lesions >or=2.0 cm and 70.8 Gy to lesions <2.0 cm in diameter. The mean dose to the hippocampus was kept at <6 Gy(2). Plans were optimized for conformity and target coverage while minimizing hippocampal and ocular doses. Plans were evaluated on target coverage, prescription isodose to target volume ratio, conformity number, homogeneity index, and maximum dose to prescription dose ratio. RESULTS: Ten patients had 18 metastases. Mean values for the brain metastases were as follows: conformity number = 0.73 +/- 0.10, target coverage = 0.98 +/- 0.01, prescription isodose to target volume = 1.34 +/- 0.19, maximum dose to prescription dose ratio = 1.09 +/- 0.02, and homogeneity index = 0.07 +/- 0.02. For the whole brain, the mean target coverage and homogeneity index were 0.960 +/- 0.002 and 0.39 +/- 0.06, respectively. The mean hippocampal dose was 5.23 +/- 0.39 Gy(2). The mean treatment delivery time was 3.6 min (range, 3.3-4.1 min). CONCLUSIONS: VMAT was able to achieve adequate whole brain coverage with conformal hippocampal avoidance and radiosurgical quality dose distributions for one to three brain metastases. The mean delivery time was under 4 min.
