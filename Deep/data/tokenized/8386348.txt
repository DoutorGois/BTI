An immunoperoxidase technique was used to locate multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase (calcineurin) and kinase (CaM-kinase II) in the rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Immunoreactivities for both enzymes were highly concentrated in the brain regions, where pyramidal-shaped neurons revealed strong immunoreactivities in their perikarya and dendrites. Serial thin section analysis using the polyethylene glycol embedding procedure disclosed that the cellular distribution of calcineurin immunolabelling in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus was similar to that of CaM-kinase II. The present findings suggest that the phosphatase and kinase may interact with each other in such neuronal subsets.
