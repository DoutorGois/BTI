Rat pups were made hypothyroid by exposure to propylthiouracil in drinking water beginning at 1 week of age, and the degree of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal area CA1 determined from brain slices of animals ranging in age from 2 to 6 weeks. Serum T3 levels were less than 20% of that of age matched controls after 3 weeks of treatment, and remained at that level. Relative to the age-matched controls, LTP was reduced significantly after 2 weeks of treatment. These observations are consistent with the conclusion that LTP magnitude is a reflection of cognitive function, which is known to be depressed in hypothyroid conditions in both animals and man.
