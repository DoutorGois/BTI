Neuroinflammation and accumulation of beta-amyloid are critical pathogenic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the previous study, we have shown that systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused neuroinflammation with concomitant increase in beta-amyloid and memory impairments in mice. In an attempt to investigate anti-neuroinflammatory properties of obovatol isolated from Magnolia obovata, we administered obovatol (0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg/day, p.o.) to animals for 21 days before injection of LPS (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). We found that obovatol dose-dependently attenuates LPS-induced memory deficit in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tasks. Consistent with the results of memory tasks, the compound prevented LPS-induced increases in Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) formation, beta- and gamma-secretases activities and levels of amyloid precursor protein, neuronal beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and C99 (a product of BACE1) in the cortex and hippocampus. The LPS-mediated neuroinflammation as determined by Western blots and immunostainings was significantly ameliorated by the compound. Furthermore, LPS-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB DNA binding activity was drastically abolished by obovatol as shown by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The anti-neuroinflammation and anti-amyloidogenesis by obovatol were replicated in in vitro studies. These results show that obovatol mitigates LPS-induced amyloidogenesis and memory impairment via inhibiting NF-kappaB signal pathway, suggesting that the compound might be plausible therapeutic intervention for neuroinflammation-related diseases such as AD.
