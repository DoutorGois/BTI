Estrogens influence neuronal differentiation, migration, and survival in intact brains. In injured brains, estrogens can also be neuroprotective. In Experiment 1, following a unilateral penetrating injury to the hippocampus (HP), adult female zebra finches were injected once with BrdU to label mitotic cells then sacrificed 2 h, 1 day, or 7 days postinjection. Cell proliferation was dramatically enhanced in the ipsilateral HP, as well as in neuroproliferative areas including the subventricular zone (SVZ) proximal to the injury. This increase was seen at all time points investigated. Ovariectomy (OVX) substantially suppressed proliferation bilaterally especially in the SVZ indicating that gonadal hormones influenced cell proliferation in both the intact and injured hemisphere. To determine if estrogens were directly involved, estrogen was depleted in Experiment 2 through either OVX or administration of the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole (FAD). Birds were implanted with estradiol or blank followed 2 weeks later by a unilateral penetrating lesion to the HP. Injury-induced substantial proliferation, which was again significantly suppressed bilaterally in both OVX and FAD birds. Estrogen replacement reversed this effect in FAD but not OVX birds therefore the suppression following OVX may be due in part to nonestrogenic influences. Suppression of cell birth in FAD birds was indeed due to the removal of endogenous sources of estrogen. Results therefore indicate that estrogens are directly involved in the brain's response to injury and may be acting to provide a rich environment for the production and perhaps protection of new cells.
