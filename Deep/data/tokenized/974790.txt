The spontaneous activity of hippocampal and denate units was investigated in acute and chronic experiments on adult rats. Spontaneous unitary discharges from both regions were measured before and after brief tetanic stimulation of the entorhinal cortex. An increase in the frequency of spontaneous unit activity was obtained in units recorded from the dentate gyrus and CA3 field of the hippocampus for up to 20 min following stimulation. In chronic recordings of physiologically identified dentate units from freely moving rats similar results were obtained. The findings are discussed with reference to long lasting potentiation of synaptic activity in the perforant path-dentate granule cell connection.
