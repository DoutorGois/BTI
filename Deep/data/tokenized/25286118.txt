In early Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, reduction of sigma-1 receptors (sigma1R) is detected. In this study, we employed male heterozygous sigma1R knockout (sigma1R(+/-)) mice showing normal cognitive performance to investigate association of sigma1R deficiency with AD risk. Herein we report that a single injection (i.c.v.) of Abeta(25-35) impaired spatial memory with approximately 25% death of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 region of WT mice (Abeta(25-35)-WT mice), whereas it did not cause such impairments in sigma1R(+/-) mice (Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice). Compared with WT mice, Abeta(25-35)-WT mice showed increased levels of NMDA-activated currents (INMDA) and NR2B phosphorylation (phospho-NR2B) in the hippocampal CA1 region at 48 h after Abeta25-35-injection (post-Abeta(25-35)) followed by approximately 40% decline at 72 h post-Abeta(25-35) of their respective control levels, which was inhibited by the sigma1R antagonist NE100. In Abeta(25-35)-WT mice, the administration of NR2B inhibitor Ro25-6981 or NE100 on day 1-4 post-Abeta(25-35) attenuated the memory deficits and loss of pyramidal cells. By contrast, Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice showed a slight increase in the INMDA density and the phospho-NR2B at 48 h or 72 h post-Abeta25-35 compared to sigma1R(+/-) mice. Treatment with sigma1R agonist PRE084 in Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice caused the same changes in the INMDA density and the phospho-NR2B as those in Abeta(25-35)-WT mice. Furthermore, Abeta(25-35)-sigma1R(+/-) mice treated with the NMDA receptor agonist NMDA or PRE084 on day 1-4 post-Abeta(25-35) showed a loss of neuronal cells and memory impairment. These results indicate that the sigma1R deficiency can reduce Abeta(25-35)-induced neuronal cell death and cognitive deficits through suppressing Abeta(25-35)-enhanced NR2B phosphorylation.
