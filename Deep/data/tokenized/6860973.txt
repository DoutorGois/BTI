The combination of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde tracing and specific lesioning using 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) was applied to the midbrain raphe-hippocampal system. Serotonergic fibers from the median raphe nucleus (MRN) of the rat reach the dorsal hippocampus (HIPP) through the cingulum bundle (CB) and the fornix-fimbria (FF). Intracerebral microinjections of 5,7-DHT in these two bundles were made at various times before HRP injections into the dorsal HIPP. After both CB and FF lesion, the number of labeled cells in MRN is reduced to 49.6% at zero time (HRP injected immediately after 5,7-DHT) and to 6.5% after 2 days. There was no significant effect on the number of labeled cells in the locus ceruleus. Selective lesioning of 5-HT fibers in the CB or the FF revealed that raphe-CB-HIPP neurons and raphe-FF-HIPP neurons have a similar distribution pattern in the MRN, but that a dorsal group of neurons at the junction of MRN and dorsal raphe nucleus took the CB route exclusively to innervate the HIPP. The CB pathway was used by more neurons (55% of total number of labeled neurons) than was the FF (21%). An appreciable number of fibers (23%) appear to have branches in both pathways. Our findings are discussed with regard to the recovery of HIPP function seen after long term destruction of 5-HT fibers in the CB.
