The neuronal ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We now show that a component of the pathway, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uch-L1), is required for normal synaptic and cognitive function. Transduction of Uch-L1 protein fused to the transduction domain of HIV-transactivator protein (TAT) restores normal enzymatic activity and synaptic function both in hippocampal slices treated with oligomeric Abeta and in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Moreover, intraperitoneal injections with the fusion protein improve the retention of contextual learning in APP/PS1 mice over time. The beneficial effect of the Uch-L1 fusion protein is associated with restoration of normal levels of the PKA-regulatory subunit IIalpha, PKA activity, and CREB phosphorylation.
