C57BL/6 (B6) mice display better contextual learning than the DBA/2 (D2) mice. The possibility that GAP-43, is differentially affected as a function of strain and learning was investigated in the present study. No basal difference between C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice in the amount of hippocampal GAP-43 was observed, but naive D2 mice have slightly lower basal levels of GAP-43 phosphorylation than do B6 mice. Interestingly, alterations in hippocampal GAP-43 protein levels and phosphorylation state in response to training for contextual learning were observed only in B6 mice. Immediate-shocked mice, serving as nonlearning controls, showed no GAP-43 alterations, nor did D2 mice subjected to either training condition. These results suggest that modulation of hippocampal GAP-43 may be important for contextual learning and that strain-specific alterations in GAP-43 may be part of a disrupted pathway in D2 mice that is essential for learning.
