BACKGROUND: The cellular mechanisms underlying acute tolerance to alcohol are unclear. This study aimed to determine whether hippocampal neurons have the ability to develop acute tolerance to alcohol in behaving rats. METHODS: Intrahippocampal microdialysis was performed in freely behaving rats, and the firing of single neurons in the dialysis area was recorded. The control microdialysis fluid, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), was replaced with 1 M ethanol in ACSF for a 30 min period. One hour later, the ethanol perfusion was repeated. To test the functional integrity of the microdialysis probe in situ, each microdialysis session was completed with recording the effect of a 10-20 min perfusion of 500 microM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). The extracellular concentration profile of ethanol during intrahippocampal microdialysis with 1 M ethanol was estimated in a separate study in anesthetized rats. The ethanol content was measured in tissue slices surrounding the probe with gas chromatography (GC), and the generated data were analyzed with a mathematical model for microdialysis to estimate the concentration of ethanol at the recording site. RESULTS: The predominant effect of the first intrahippocampal microdialysis with ethanol was a decrease in firing rate in both pyramidal cells and interneurons. In contrast, such firing rate decrease did not develop during the second ethanol perfusion. Subsequent NMDA perfusion still induced robust changes in the electrical activity of the neurons. The estimated extracellular ethanol concentration at the recording site was 45-70 mM. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that hippocampal neurons have the ability to develop acute tolerance to a single exposure of clinically relevant concentrations of ethanol in behaving rats, without influences from the rest of the body.
