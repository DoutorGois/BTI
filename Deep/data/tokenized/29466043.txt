OBJECTIVE To investigate epilepsy-related neuropathologic changes in cats of a familial spontaneous epileptic strain (ie, familial spontaneous epileptic cats [FSECs]). ANIMALS 6 FSECs, 9 age-matched unrelated healthy control cats, and 2 nonaffected (without clinical seizures)dams and 1 nonaffected sire of FSECs. PROCEDURES Immunohistochemical analyses were used to evaluate hippocampal sclerosis, amygdaloid sclerosis, mossy fiber sprouting, and granule cell pathological changes. Values were compared between FSECs and control cats. RESULTS Significantly fewer neurons without gliosis were detected in the third subregion of the cornu ammonis (CA) of the dorsal and ventral aspects of the hippocampus as well as the central nucleus of the amygdala in FSECs versus control cats. Gliosis without neuronal loss was also observed in the CA4 subregion of the ventral aspect of the hippocampus. No changes in mossy fiber sprouting and granule cell pathological changes were detected. Moreover, similar changes were observed in the dams and sire without clinical seizures, although to a lesser extent. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings suggested that the lower numbers of neurons in the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus and the central nucleus of the amygdala were endophenotypes of familial spontaneous epilepsy in cats. In contrast to results of other veterinary medicine reports, severe epilepsy-related neuropathologic changes (eg, hippocampal sclerosis, amygdaloid sclerosis, mossy fiber sprouting, and granule cell pathological changes) were not detected in FSECs. Despite the use of a small number of cats with infrequent seizures, these findings contributed new insights on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of genetic-related epilepsy in cats.
