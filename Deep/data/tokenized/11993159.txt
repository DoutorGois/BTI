We studied the incidence of cerebral dysgenetic lesions(CD) in 39 operated patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy(MTLE) who had hippocampal sclerosis. Four patients had CD, such as menigocele at the ipsilateral temporal fossa, schizencephaly in the ipsilateral peri-Rolandic area, focal cortical dysplasia in the ipsilateral inferior temporal gyrus and periventricular nodular heterotopia at the bilateral inferior horns of the lateral ventricle. Histological examinations of the resected lateral temporal lobes from 29 MTLE patients revealed the presence of microdysgenesis (microscopic cerebral dysgenesis) in 28 patients, including heterotopic white matter neuron(24 cases), molecular layer neuron(14), oligodendroglial cell cluster(11), dilated perivascular space(10). These findings suggest that the congenital factors, as well as hippocampal sclerosis, may be involved in the development of MTLE.
