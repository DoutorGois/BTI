Two-wave-length visible cytophotometry showed an increase of nuclein acids (NAs) in neurons of the n. raphe dorsalis and the decrease in SA3 of the rat hippocampus after paradoxical sleep deprivation; the NA content was unchanged in gliocytes. A correlation between NA metabolism and function of structures is discussed.
