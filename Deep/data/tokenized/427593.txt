Destruction of the ascending noradrenergic innervation to the forebrain in rats by intracerebral injection of the selective neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (4 microgram in 2 microliter injected bilaterally into the dorsal bundle in the mesencephalon) was found to cause resistance to extinction of a continuously reinforced lever press response. However, this effect occurred only if the lesion were present during acquisition training on the reinforced schedule and not if intact animals were trained and the lesion inflicted after completion of acquisition training and just prior to the extinction phase. Thus, the behavioural effect that manifests itself during extinction appears to be due to subtle changes in the acquisition learning process. This is consistent with the predictions of an attentional theory of noradrenergic function and appears to exclude most other suggested explanations of the dorsal bundle extinction effect.
