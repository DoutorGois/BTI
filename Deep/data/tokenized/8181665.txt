The AP-1 transcription factor family consists of two groups of proteins, fos-related antigens (fra) and jun proteins. These transcription factors are usually expressed at low basal levels but they can be dramatically induced in a variety of cell types by many different stimuli, in which the quantity of AP-1 transcription factor and the DNA binding activity also rise. The quantity and DNA binding activity of transcription factors are not always at low levels. For example, early in brain development a high basal expression of AP-1 DNA binding activity exists. Similarly, adult rat adrenal gland contains high levels of AP-1 DNA binding activity whose regulation appears to be through post-translational modification (i.e., phosphorylation). Thus, AP-1 DNA binding activity is modulated in a developmental and tissue-specific manner.
