OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of acteoside on the expression of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in brain tissues of subacute aging mice induced by D-galactose (D-Gal) combined with aluminum trichloride (AlCl3). METHODS: Female Kunming mice were randomly divided into vehicle control group, D-Gal combined with AlCl3 group , vitamin E group, piracetam group and acteoside groups [30, 60, 120 mg/(kg.d)]. Mice in D-Gal combined with AlCl3, vitamin E, piracetam and acteoside groups were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with D-Gal [60 mg/(kg.d)] and AlCl3 [5 mg/(kg.d)] for 90 days to induce the subacute aging models. The real-time quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were respectively used to detect the expression of NT-3 mRNA and protein in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mouse brain. RESULTS: D-Gal and AlCl3 caused a significant reduction of NT-3 in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Acteoside, vitamin E and piracetam increased the decreased expression of NT-3 induced by D-Gal and AlCl3, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05 or P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Acteoside can up-regulate the expression of brain NT-3 in D-Gal plus AlCl3 treated mice.
