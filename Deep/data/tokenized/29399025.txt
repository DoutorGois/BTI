In the present study, we examined the effects of Dendropanax morbifera Leveille leaf extract (DML) on D-galactose-induced morphological changes in microglia and cytokines, including pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) in the hippocampus. Administration of DML to D-galactose-treated mice significantly improved D-galactose-induced reduction in escape latency, swimming speed, and spatial preference for the target quadrant. In addition, administration of DML to D-galactose-treated mice significantly ameliorated the microglial activation and increases of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus. Administration of D-galactose significantly reduced IL-4 levels in the hippocampus, while administration of DML to D-galactose-treated mice significantly increased IL-4 level. However, we did not observe any significant changes in IL-10 levels in hippocampal homogenates. These results suggest that DML reduces D-galactose-induced mouse senescence by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, as well as increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4.
