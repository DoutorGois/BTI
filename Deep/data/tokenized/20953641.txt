The intracerebroventricular infusion of streptozotocin (icv-STZ) has been largely used in research to mimic the main characteristics of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including cognitive decline, impairment of cholinergic transmission, oxidative stress and astrogliosis. Moderate physical exercise has a number of beneficial effects on the central nervous system, as demonstrated both in animals and in human studies. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 5-week treadmill training, in the icv-SZT model of sporadic AD, on cognitive function, oxidative stress (particularly mediated by NO) and on the astrocyte marker proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100B. Results confirm the spatial cognitive deficit and oxidative stress in this model, as well as astroglial alterations, particularly a decrease in CSF S100B. Physical exercise prevented these alterations, as well as increasing the hippocampal content of glutathione and GFAP per se in the CA1 region. These findings reinforce the potential neuroprotective role of moderate physical exercise. Astroglial changes observed in this dementia model contribute to understanding AD and other diseases that are accompanied by cognitive deficit.
