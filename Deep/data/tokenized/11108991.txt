Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family in the rat hippocampus, but the signaling pathways for this activation are not well understood. We investigated whether N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor mediated signaling is involved in the phosphorylation-activation of the MAPK family. The NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, dose-dependently reduced ECS-induced phosphorylation of p38 and its upstream kinase MKK6 up to 1 mg/kg. MK-801 also reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MEK1, but only at high dosage, 2 mg/kg. Moreover, the reduction in the phosphorylation of p38 and MKK6 was greater than that of ERK1/2 and MEK1. Our results suggest that ECS activates p38 and ERK1/2 partly through an NMDA receptor-mediated signaling system in the rat hippocampus and that NMDA receptor mediated signaling is more responsible for the activation of the MKK6-p38 pathway than the MEK1-ERK pathway.
