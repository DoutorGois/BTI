Messenger RNAs coding for glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor proteins were localized to discrete subfields of the hippocampal formation by in situ hybridization histochemistry, using cRNA probes of approximately equivalent specific activity. Both GR and MR mRNAs were present in all subfields examined; GR mRNA was of greatest abundance in CA1, while MR mRNA was most densely labeled in CA3. In all subfields examined, MR mRNA was considerably more abundant than GR mRNA. Removal of circulating glucocorticoids by adrenalectomy precipitated an up-regulation of GR mRNA in subfields CA1-2 and the dentate gyrus, which was reversed by dexamethasone replacement. High doses of dexamethasone significantly down-regulated GR mRNA in CA3. In contrast, adrenalectomy produced significant up-regulation of MR mRNA only in subfield CA1-2. The data indicate that steroid receptor mRNAs are differentially distributed in hippocampus, and that sensitivity to steroids occurs within defined structural domains of the hippocampal formation.
