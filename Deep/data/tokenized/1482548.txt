Rats were submitted to object and spatial recognition tests (both based on the same paradigm) and to the radial-arm maze. The results are as follows: (1) rats could discriminate between a new and a familiar object when the retention delay was 1 min, 15 min or 60 min but not 24 h. The relationship between the level of discrimination and intertrial delays is quadratic with a maximum for 15 min. (2) Exposure to distractive stimuli during the retention delay may impair object recognition. (3) Rats discriminated between a new and a familiar space. (4) There is no correlation between the three tests which argues for a multiple form of working memory, especially a spatial and a non-spatial one. (5) Medial septal lesion did not impair object and spatial recognition memory, but the level of discrimination in the spatial recognition test was significantly reduced compared to that of control.
