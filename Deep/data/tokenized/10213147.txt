2'-5' Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) expression is induced by interferon or viral infection of cells. To better understand ischemia-induced changes in gene expression and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms, changes in OAS mRNA levels were evaluated after 30 min four-vessel occlusion and 2, 4, 8 or 24 h recovery and compared to the temporal profile of changes in mRNA levels induced by a transient depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores in primary neuronal cell cultures. OAS mRNA levels dropped during early recovery both in vivo and in vitro. After 6 h recovery from ER calcium pool depletion, OAS mRNA levels increased to about 350% of controls and returned to control levels after 24 h of recovery. After 24 h recovery from ischemia, OAS mRNA levels rose to about 390% of controls in the hippocampus and striatum and to 210% of the control value in the cortex. It is concluded that transient ischemia place cells into an antiviral state, most pronounced in the hippocampus and striatum, and that disturbances of ER calcium homeostasis may contribute to this process.
