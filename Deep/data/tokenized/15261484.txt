From rodents to primates, transient global brain ischemia is a well known cause of delayed neuronal death of the vulnerable neurons including cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1) pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Previous reports using the rodent experimental paradigm indicated that apoptosis is a main contributor to such ischemic neuronal death. In primates, however, the detailed molecular mechanism of ischemic neuronal death still remains obscure. Recent data suggest that necrosis rather than apoptosis appear to be the crucial component of the damage to the nervous system during human ischemic injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, necrotic neuronal death mediated by Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases, is becoming accepted to underlie the pathology of neurodegenerative conditions from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to primates. This paper reviews the role of cysteine proteases such as caspase, calpain and cathepsin in order to clarify the mechanism of ischemic neuronal death being triggered by the unspecific digestion of lysosomal proteases.
