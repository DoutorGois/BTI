OBJECTIVE: A 3D digitized visible model of human cerebrum was built to provide anatomical structure for making plans of cerebral surgical operation and realizing accurate simulation of cerebrum on computer. METHODS: Transverse sectional anatomy data of the cerebrum were chosen from the first Chinese visible human (one male and one female). Semi-automated segmentation and Photoshop software were selected to segment cerebral cortex, white matter, basal nuclei, lateral ventricle, hippocampus, etc. On personal computer, the segmented structures were reconstructed in 3D with volume rendering reconstruction and surface rendering reconstruction. RESULTS: Two accurately segmented images of the main structures of cerebrum were completed. The reconstructed structures can be displayed singly, in small groups or as a whole and can be continuously rotated in 3D space at different velocities. CONCLUSION: Combining volume-rendering reconstruction with surface rendering reconstruction overcomes the defects of surface rendering reconstruction that lack of internal anatomical information, which provides a new method for 3D reconstruction. The reconstructed cerebrum and the main internal structures are realistic, which demonstrates the natural shape and exact position of the structures. It provides an accurate model for the automated segmentation algorithmic study and provides a digitized anatomical mode of cerebrum.
