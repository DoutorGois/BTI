The relationship between the synaptic potentiations evoked by the protein kinase C activator phorbol-12,13-diacetate and by afferent tetanization has been examined in the CA1 region of the hippocampal slice preparation using extracellular recording. It has been found that the potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential produced by 1 microM phorbol ester does not affect the amount of long-term potentiation (LTP) that can be evoked by afferent tetanization, and vice versa. A dissociation between phorbol ester-induced and tetanus-induced potentiation is also indicated by the fact that only the former was associated with changes in paired-pulse facilitation. On the other hand, as previously described, higher concentrations (10 microM) of phorbol ester blocked the tetanus-induced potentiation. Since the total potentiation given by 10 microM phorbol ester and tetanization depended on the order of presentation of the potentiation-inducing stimuli, it appears that the blockade of LTP is, at least partly, independent of the phorbol ester-induced potentiation.
