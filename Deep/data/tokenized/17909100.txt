Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of extracellularly acting proteolytic enzymes with well-recognized roles in plasticity and remodeling of synaptic circuits during brain development and following brain injury. However, it is now becoming increasingly apparent that MMPs also function in normal, nonpathological synaptic plasticity of the kind that may underlie learning and memory. Here, we extend this idea by investigating the role and regulation of MMP-9 in an inhibitory avoidance (IA) learning and memory task. We demonstrate that following IA training, protein levels and proteolytic activity of MMP-9 become elevated in hippocampus by 6 h, peak at 12-24 h, then decline to baseline values by approximately 72 h. When MMP function is abrogated by intrahippocampal infusion of a potent gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) inhibitor 3.5 h following IA training, a time prior to the onset of training-induced elevation in levels, IA memory retention is significantly diminished when tested 1-3 d later. Animals impaired at 3 d exhibit robust IA memory when retrained, suggesting that such impairment is not likely attributed to toxic or other deleterious effects that permanently disrupt hippocampal function. In anesthetized adult rats, the effective distance over which synaptic plasticity is impaired by a single intrahippocampal infusion of the MMP inhibitor of the kind that blocks IA memory is approximately 1200 microm. Taken together, these data suggest that IA training induces a slowly emerging, but subsequently protracted period of MMP-mediated proteolysis critical for enabling long-lasting synaptic modification that underlies long-term memory consolidation.
