The study was designed to investigate the effect of various concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD) in rats with chronic epilepsy. The chronic epilepsy rat model was prepared by intraperitoneally injecting pentylenetetrazole to the rats pre-treated with CBD (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg) for 28 consecutive days. Behavioral measurements of convulsion following pentylenetetrazole treatment and morphological changes of the hippocampal neurons with hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the epileptic behaviour. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the hippocampus. The mRNA expression of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor subunits (NR1 and NR2B) was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed a significant decrease in the daily average grade of epileptic seizures on treatment with CBD (50 mg/kg). The neuronal loss and astrocyte hyperplasia in the hippocampal area were also decreased. CBD treatment did not affect the expression of iNOS in the hippocampus; however, the expression of NR1 was decreased significantly. Thus, CBD administration inhibited the effect of pentylenetetrazole in rats, decreased the astrocytic hyperplasia, decreased neuronal damage in the hippocampus caused by seizures and selectively reduced the expression of the NR1 subunit of NMDA. Therefore, CBD exhibits an anticonvulsive effect in the rats with chronic epilepsy.
