To evaluate the effects of aswal on ionic fluxes and neuronal excitation, we performed extracellular and whole cell patch clamp recordings on CA1 pyramidal neurons of guinea pigs and Long-Evans rats. Aswal (100- 250 mg/l) was administered systemically, and its effects on the rate of synchronized extracellular field potentials (EFP), membrane parameters, action potentials and postsynaptic potentials were recorded. The extracellular results obtained are consistent with calcium antagonistic properties. Intracellular recordings suggest that a direct sodium antagonistic effect as seen in many antiepileptic drugs plays no significant role. Further effects on ligand gated ion channels are discussed controversially. In summary, the cellular action of aswal appears heterogeneous with calcium antagonism playing a prominent role in counteracting excitation which may be a common feature in epilepsy and different psychiatric conditions as mood and anxiety disorder.
