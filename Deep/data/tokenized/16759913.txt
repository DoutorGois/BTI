Decades of research have provided substantial evidence of memory impairments in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), including deficits in the encoding, storage, and retrieval of new information. These findings are not surprising, given the associated underlying neuroanatomy, including the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe structures. Because of its associated anatomic and cognitive characteristics, TLE has provided an excellent model by which to examine specific aspects of human memory functioning, including classic distinctions such as that between explicit and implicit memory. Various clinical and experimental research studies have supported the idea that both conscious and unconscious processes support memory functioning, but the role of relevant brain structures has been the subject of debate. This review is concerned with a discussion of the current status of this research and, importantly, how TLE can inform future studies of memory distinctions.
