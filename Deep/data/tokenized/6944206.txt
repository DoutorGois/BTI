It has been shown in rats, as previously on frogs, with electrochemotrodes chronically implanted into dorsal hippocampuses that some kynurenine metabolites of tryptophan (quinolinic acid, d, 1-kynurenine) can provoke an increase in the pathological activity of the penicillin-induced epileptogenic focus in the hippocampus. Unlike kynurenines, serotonin, another tryptophan metabolite, and the serotoninomimetic 5-methoxytryptamine suppress the pathological activity of the epileptogenic focus. The results obtained support the hypothesis about a certain role of kynurenines and serotonin in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
