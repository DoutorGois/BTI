Evolvulus alsinoides, also known as Shankpushapi, is a commonly used traditional medicine for enhancing memory. We evaluated the in vitro free radical scavenging and enzymes [acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinestrase, glycogen synthase kinase-3-beta (GSK-3-beta), rho kinase (ROCK II), prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) and lipoxygenase (LOX)] inhibitory activities of aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extracts of E. alsinoides. Hydro-alcoholic extract of E. alsinoides demonstrated more free radical scavenging activity as compared to aqueous extract. Hydro-alcoholic extract also showed higher cholinesterase, GSK-3-beta, ROCK II, PEP, COMT and LOX enzyme inhibitory activities as compared to aqueous extract. Phytochemical analysis revealed more flavanoids in hydro-alcoholic extract as compared to aqueous extract but no significant difference in phenolic content of the two extracts was observed. Based on in vitro data, hydro-alcoholic extract (100, 300 and 500mg/kg, p.o.) was selected for in vivo study in intracerebroventricularly injected streptozotocin (STZ) induced cognitive impairment in male Wistar rats. Elevated plus maze, passive avoidance and Morris water maze were used for assessment of cognitive function on 14th, 21st and 28th day after STZ injection. Oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, nitric oxide levels and superoxide dismutase activity), cholinergic dysfunction and rho kinase (ROCK II) expression were studied in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rat brain at the end of the study. Hydro-alcoholic extract of E. alsinoides dose dependently prevented STZ induced cognitive impairment by reducing the oxidative stress, improving cholinergic function and preventing the increase in rho kinase expression. The results suggest an anti-Alzheimer potential of hydro-alcoholic extract of E. alsinoides.
