Whole cell recording (EPSCs) and extracellular recording (field EPSPs) were compared in hippocampal field CA1 with regard to the effects of experimental treatments that increase AMPA receptor gated currents. Cyclothiazide, which maintains AMPA receptors in the sensitized state, caused a rapid and pronounced increase in EPSCs but only minor changes in field EPSPs. This difference was evident in recordings carried out at 22 and 32 degrees C and with different solutions in the clamp pipette. The larger effect of cyclothiazide on EPSCs was unaffected by blockade of GABA and NMDA receptors. Two-dimensional current source density analyses derived from 64 recording sites were used to provide extracellular estimates of AMPA receptor mediated synaptic currents. With this method, cyclothiazide again had much smaller effects than were obtained with whole cell clamp. Differences between whole cell and extracellular recordings were present, although not as pronounced, for the ampakines, a class of drugs that slow both deactivation and desensitization of AMPA receptors. Additionally, increases in synaptic responses produced by frequency facilitation, a manipulation that enhances the number of bound receptors, were not qualitatively different between recording techniques. These results support the conclusion that the whole cell clamp technique may alter AMPA receptors in such a way as to increase the relative importance of desensitization.
