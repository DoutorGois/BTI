Several studies have demonstrated that chronic treatment with organophosphates, such as DFP, elicits a decreased number of brain muscarinic receptors (measured by the binding of QNB) which has been presented as an explanation for tolerance to the organophosphates. The purpose of the studies presented here was to assess whether graded changes in QNB binding could be attained following different methods of chronic DFP treatment, and whether tolerance to DFP paralleled these changes. Male DBA mice were injected with DFP every 4 days or 2 days for 30 days or daily for 14 days. The animals were subsequently challenged with DFP or the muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine, and respiratory rate, heart rate, body temperature, Y-maze activity and rearing were recorded. Chronic DFP-treated animals were supersensitive to the effects of DFP on respiratory rate, heart rate, and body temperature whereas a modest tolerance to the effects of oxotremorine on respiratory rate, heart rate, and body temperature was seen. Neither tolerance nor supersensitivity were observed for the effects of DFP and oxotremorine on the Y-maze measures. Chronic DFP treatment elicited reduced binding of QNB in striatum, cortex, and hippocampus with the group that had been treated every other day exhibiting the greatest changes. The changes in drug response did not parallel changes in QNB binding which raises questions as to the cause of the reduction in binding.
