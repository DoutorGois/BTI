The effect of chronic emotional stress and ethanol on NCAM and GFAP levels in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum and medulla-ponts was investigated. We report about increase of NCAM and GFAP concentrations in the cerebral cortex and decline of the total protein contents in the investigated brain areas of middle-sleep rats under the stress conditions. Ethanol in the dose of 0.5 g/kg during 7 days evoked opposite changes of NCAM and GFAP concentration and elevation of the total protein level in medulla-pons. In the other brain areas level changes of only one (any) of the two investigated neurospecific proteins were observed. Ethanol injections to the stressed rats normalized the relative weights of adrenals and the level of total protein in the brain areas but didn't normalize the behavioral activity in an "open field" test. Besides, we observed a dramatic increase of GFAP level (over 10 times) in the medulla-pons which may be connected with glioses. These results suggest the specific changes of NCAM and GFAP contents under the chronic emotional stress which don't correlate with changes in the hypophysis-adrenals system.
