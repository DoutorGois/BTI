The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of cerebral hypoperfusion on cognitive ability, TNFalpha, IL1beta and PGE2 levels in both hippocampi in a modified two-vessel occlusion model. Both common carotid arteries of adult male Wistar rats were permanently occluded with an interval of 1 week between occlusions. Learning and memory were significantly decreased after 1 month. This reduction was not significant after 2 months, which may be attributed to blood flow compensation. The TNFalpha level was significantly increased after 3 h and 1 day. IL1beta was significantly increased after 1 day. After a week there was no significant difference in pro-inflammatory levels. Furthermore, there was no difference between right and left hippocampi. It is possible that TNFalpha and IL1beta elevation initiates pathologic processes that contribute to memory impairment.
