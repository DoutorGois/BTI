Nerve growth factor (NGF) produced by telencephalic neurons provides critical trophic support for cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. In situ hybridization and nuclease protection analyses demonstrate that limbic seizures dramatically increase the amount of messenger RNA for NGF in the neurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus within 1 hour of seizure onset and in broadly distributed neocortical and olfactory forebrain neurons some hours later. The increased messenger RNA species is indistinguishable from messenger RNA for transcript B of the beta subunit of NGF from mouse submandibular gland. Thus, the expression of a known growth factor is affected by unusual physiological activity, suggesting one route through which trophic interactions between neurons in adult brain can be modified.
