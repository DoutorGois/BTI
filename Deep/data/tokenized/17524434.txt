Sleep architecture, EEG power pattern and locomotor activity were investigated in a putative animal model of schizophrenia. The model was prepared by excitotoxic damage of the ventral hippocampus on postnatal day 7 (PD 7), after which locomotor activity and electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep profile were compared between lesioned and sham operated animals respectively, at prepuberty (postnatal day PD 35) and postpuberty (PD 56). An enhancement of locomotor activity was observed in lesioned adult PD 56, but not in juvenile PD 35 rats. Spontaneous EEG/EMG recordings during 24 h showed no major differences between both groups at PD 35 and at PD 56. However, quantitative analysis of the EEG revealed an enhancement of power in delta (delta), theta (theta) and alpha (alpha) activities in lesioned animals at PD 35 during wakefulness in both light and dark phases. At PD 56, the power in the delta and theta bands was increased during the light and dark periods in both wakefulness and non-REM sleep. These findings suggest that ventral hippocampus lesion is not associated with disturbance of sleep architecture in rats, while consistent changes were observed in the dynamic of EEG slow wave frequency domain. Thus, the data indicate that neonatal lesion of ventral hippocampus did not mimic sleep abnormalities observed in schizophrenia, however this rodent model may model some EEG features seen in schizophrenia such as a frontally pronounced slowing of the slow EEG activity in delta and theta frequency bands.
