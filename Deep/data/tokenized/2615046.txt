The effects of FKS-508 [AF102B; cis-2-methylspiro(1,3-oxathiolane-5,3')quinuclidine], a selective M1 muscarinic receptor agonist, were examined to predict the possible activity on memory disorders using a T-maze and radial-arm maze task in experimental amnesia models. The amnesia models were produced by bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of ethylcholine aziridinium ion (AF64A), a selective cholinotoxin, in rats. Repeated administrations of FKS-508 (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 5 weeks significantly ameliorated impaired performance of AF64A-treated rats (AF64A-rats) in a delayed alternation task in the T-maze. Repeated administrations of FKS-508 (1 and 5 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 5 weeks significantly ameliorated acquisition failures of AF64A-rats in a radial-arm maze task. Single administration of FKS-508 (1 and 5 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the incorrect choices of AF64A-rats in a radial-arm maze task with 6 hr-delay time. No abnormalities in general behaviors, such as loss of appetite and ataxia, were observed in rats treated with FKS-508 repeatedly during 5 weeks. Our present results showed that FKS-508 can ameliorate memory impairments in AF64A-rats with central cholinergic hypofunction without causing any behavioral abnormalities. FKS-508 may be considered as a candidate for the clinical examination of the cholinergic hypothesis of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type.
