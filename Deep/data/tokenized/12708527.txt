The role of the hippocampus and perirhinal-entorhinal cortex was examined in an olfactory discrimination paradigm. Small neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampus (21% tissue damage) yielded relatively unimpaired olfactory retention across brief (30 s), intermediate (approximately 5 min), and 24-hr delays, whereas impairments were noted at 5-day retention intervals. Larger hippocampal lesions (63% tissue damage) spared memory at intermediate delays, with no impact at 8-day retention intervals. Aspiration lesions directed at the perirhinal-entorhinal cortex produced a variable performance pattern, with impairments noted at intermediate, 24-hr, and 5-day delays. Results suggest the hippocampus is not specifically involved in retaining olfactory information, with additional consideration given to the relationship between lesion size and memory impairment.
