Isoflurane is a widely used inhaled anesthetic in the clinical setting. However, the mechanism underlying its effect on consciousness is under discussion. Therefore, we investigated the effect of isoflurane on the hippocampus and cortex using an in vivo field recording approach. Our results showed that 1.3%, 0.8%, and 0.4% isoflurane exerted an inhibitory influence on the mouse hippocampus and cortex. Further, high frequency bands in the cortex and hippocampus showed greater suppression with increasing isoflurane concentration. Our findings suggest that in vivo field recordings can monitor the effect of isoflurane anesthesia on the mouse cortex and hippocampus.
