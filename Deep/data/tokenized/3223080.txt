In rats experimental myocardial infarction, whether it was reproduced after a preliminary stress or in its absence, a reduction was found of ATP content initially appearing in the neocortex at the second day of the experiment. The deficit of providing of the energy in brain structures in a traditional variant of infarction reproduction increased still greater, and in the case of preliminary stressing the ATP content was reduced. Parallelly a characteristic change took place in the concentration of products of the fermentative ATP hydrolysis in the brain structures.
