Ischemic preconditioning and ischemic postconditioning (IPostC) represent promising strategies to reduce ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and attenuate the lethal ischemic damage following stroke. However, the mechanism underlying this attenuation remains to be elucidated. It was hypothesized that alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice following I/R is associated with the functional improvement induced by IPostC. Behavioral changes were assessed in a mouse model of I/R in the absence or presence of IPostC, followed by microarray analyses to investigate the expressional alterations of miRNAs in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice. The results of the present study revealed that IPostC abrogated the neurological impairment and hippocampusassociated cognitive deficits induced by I/R, and upregulated or downregulated the expression levels of numerous miRNAs. Furthermore, the upregulation of miR19a, and the downregulation of miR1, let7f and miR124 expression levels following IPostC was confirmed utilizing reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results of the present study demonstrated that alterations in miRNA expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice following I/R was associated with the neuroprotection induced by IPostC.
