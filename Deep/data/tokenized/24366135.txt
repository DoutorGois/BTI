Data show a relationship of cellular resonance and network oscillations in the entorhinal cortex to the spatial periodicity of grid cells. This paper presents a model that simulates the resonance and rebound spiking properties of entorhinal neurons to generate spatial periodicity dependent upon phasic input from medial septum. The model shows that a difference in spatial periodicity can result from a difference in neuronal resonance frequency that replicates data from several experiments. The model also demonstrates a functional role for the phenomenon of theta cycle skipping in the medial entorhinal cortex.
