The goal of this review in an overview of the structural elements of the entorhinal-hippocampal connection. The development of the dendrites of hippocampal neurons will be outlined in relation to afferent pathway specificity and the mature dendritic structure compared. Interneurons will be contrasted to pyramidal cells in terms of processing of physiological signals and convergence and divergence in control of hippocampal circuits. Mechanisms of axonal guidance and target recognition, target structures, the involvement of receptor distribution on hippocampal dendrites and the involvement of non-neuronal cellular elements in the establishment of specific connections will be presented. Mechanisms relevant for the maintenance of shape and morphological specializations of hippocampal dendrites will be reviewed. One of the significant contexts in which to view these structural elements is the degree of plasticity in which they participate, during development and origination of dendrites, mature synaptic plasticity and after lesions, when the cells must continue to maintain and reconstitute function, to remain part of the circuitry in the hippocampus. This review will be presented in four main sections: (1) interneurons-development, role in synchronizing influence and hippocampal network functioning; (2) principal cells in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus regions-their development, function in terms of synaptic integration, differentiating structure and alterations with lesions; (3) glia and glia/neuronal interactions-response to lesions and developmental guidance mechanisms; and (4) network and circuit aspects of hippocampal morphology and functioning. Finally, the interwoven role of these various elements participating in hippocampal network function will be discussed.
