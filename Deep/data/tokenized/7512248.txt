The electrical reactions of many central neurons depend on two voltage-activated K+ currents: the fast transient A-current IA and the delayed rectifier current IK. In rat dentate gyrus granule cells, the A-current density decreases during ontogenesis, possibly due to a redistribution of K+ channels from somata into dendrites. We tested this possibility in mechanically isolated granule cells with preserved dendrites of different length. Potassium currents were recorded with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique using prepulse protocols with and without a delay interval to isolate IA. A correlation between the length of the dendrites and the amount of A-current expressed in a given cell could not be demonstrated. Our findings therefore confirm an ontogenetic down regulation of A-currents.
