The effects of i.c.v. administration of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on the turnover rate of acetylcholine (TRACh) in various areas of the rat brain were examined in an effort to better understand the role of adenosine as a neuromodulator or cotransmittr. TRACh was determined by gas chromatographic-mass fragmentographic analysis of the rate of deuterium incorporation into ACh and choline during a constant rate infusion of deuterated phosphorylcholine. The i.c.v. administration of the adenosine receptor agonist, 2-chloroadenosine (2-CIAdo), in a dose of 82 nmol failed to change the ACh or choline content of any of the brain areas examined. This dose of 2-CIAdo elicited significant reductions in the TRACh in both the hippocampus and frontal cortex, but not in the striatum. The extent of the TRACh reduction was 67 and 36% in hippocampus and cortex, respectively. This inhibition of TRACh elicited by 2-CIAdo was antagonized by pretreatment (i.c.v.) with theophylline (278 nmol), suggesting that an activation of adenosine receptors is operative in the action of 2-CIAdo. Further support for a participation of adenosine receptors in the action of 2-CIAdo was obtained by comparing the effects of the L- and D-isomers of phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) on TRACh. The i.c.v. administration of L-PIA (65 nmol) elicited a 79% reduction in the TRACh in the hippocampus, whereas D-PIA (65 nmol i.c.v.) had no significant effect on hippocampal TRACh. This finding supports the view that these effects on TRACh may be mediated by adenosine A1 receptors, but not by A2 receptors, because the former, but not the latter, display marked stereoselectivity toward PIA. It also was demonstrated that intraseptal injections of L-PIA or theophylline failed to reduce the TRACh in the hippocampus, suggesting that adenosine receptors located in the septum are not operative in mediating the i.c.v. action of PIA.
