We have examined the influence of reducing conditions on the activity of group-I or -II metabotropic glutamate receptors. In cultured cerebellar granule cells or in hippocampal slices, the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) inhibited the stimulation of polyphosphoinositide (PPI) hydrolysis elicited by group-I mGlu receptor agonists without affecting responses to norepinephrine or carbamylcholine. Similarly, DTT reduced the increase in intracellular free Ca(2+) induced by glutamate in HEK-293 cells expressing mGlu5 receptors. In adult hippocampal slices, the selective group-II mGlu receptor agonist, (2S,1'R,2'R,3'R)-2-(2, 3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) had no effect per se on PPI hydrolysis, but potentiated the response to quisqualate. Although DTT substantially attenuated the action of quisqualate, it did not affect the potentiation by DCG-IV, suggesting that group-II mGlu receptors are resistant to extracellular reduction. Accordingly, DTT did not affect the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation induced by maximally effective concentrations of group-II mGlu receptor agonists in hippocampal slices or in CHO cells expressing mGlu2 receptors. At structural level, DTT differentially affected the aggregation state of mGlu1a, -2/3 or -5 receptors. In immunoblots performed under non-reducing conditions, mGlu1a, -2/3 or -5 antibodies labeled exclusively a high-molecular weight band, corresponding to receptor dimers. Under reducing conditions, mGlu1a or -5 receptors were detected as monomers, whereas a large proportion of mGlu2/3 receptors was still present in a dimeric form. We conclude that reducing conditions differentially influence the aggregation state of group-I and -II mGlu receptors and suggest that dimerization affects the functional activity of native mGlu receptors.
