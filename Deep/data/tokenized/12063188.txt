Within the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of peptides, pancreatic polypeptide is the most divergent across species. It differs in 20 of 36 positions between human and chicken. In mammals, it binds primarily to the Y4 receptor, to which NPY and peptide YY (PYY) bind with lower affinities. Because of these large sequence differences in pancreatic polypeptide, we decided to characterise the chicken Y4 receptor. We report here that Y4 displays the least sequence conservation among the Y-family receptors, with only 57-60% overall amino acid identity between chicken and mammals, compared with 64-83% for the Y1, Y2 and Y5 receptors. After expression of the chicken Y4 receptor in COS-7 cells, (125)I-labelled porcine (p) PYY bound with a K(d) of 20 pM. In competition with (125)I-pPYY, chicken pancreatic polypeptide bound with high affinity at 140 pM. Interestingly, chicken PYY bound with even greater affinity at 68 pM. The affinity of NPY, 160 pM, was similar to that of pancreatic polypeptide. Chicken Y4 is less sensitive than is mammalian Y4 to truncation of the amino terminus of the NPY molecule. RT-PCR revealed expression in several peripheral organs, including adipose tissue and oviduct. In brain, Y4 mRNA was detected in the brainstem, cerebellum and hippocampus. In situ hybridisation to brain sections showed expression in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the brainstem. Thus the chicken Y4 receptor is less selective and anatomically more widespread than that in mammals, probably reflecting the original properties of the Y4 receptor.
