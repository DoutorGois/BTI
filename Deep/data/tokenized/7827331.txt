The consequences of intracerebroventricular injection of the toxin 192-IgG-saporin on the electrophysiological properties of CA1 pyramidal cells were investigated using intracellular recordings in the in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. We present the first electrophysiological evidence of a dysfunction of hippocampal cholinergic afferents following injection of 192-IgG-saporin. The synaptic events mediated by acetylcholine were altered in such animals: the slow cholinergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials as well as the cholinergic activation of GABAergic interneurones were dramatically depressed or even absent; the amplitude and duration of the afterhyperpolarization following a burst of spikes were increased, while other neuronal properties were not modified. These specific alterations suggest that the toxin 192-IgG-saporin is a specific tool for the experimental study of cholinergic denervation in the hippocampus.
