Antiserum to [Arg8]vasopressin (anti-AVP) was bilaterally administered into dorsal hippocampus at 1:50 or 1:10 dilution 20 min before the 24-day retention session of a visual discrimination task. This treatment by itself did not affect the retention performance by comparison with the respective control group, whatever the dilution of anti-AVP, suggesting that hippocampal endogenous AVP is not involved in our behavioral paradigm. On the other hand, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of AVP 10 min before the retention session improved retention performance of the visual discrimination task. When anti-AVP was injected at the 1:10 dilution into the dorsal hippocampus 10 min before the i.c.v. administration of AVP, the retention performance was not improved. These data suggest the involvement of the hippocampus in the behavioral expression of AVP following an i.c.v. treatment.
