BACKGROUND: The role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the pathogenesis of affective disorders such as depression has been controversial. Mounting evidence comes from structural imaging, that the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism influences the hippocampal volume with carriers of the 66Met allele (Val/Met and Met/Met group) having smaller hippocampi. Given that stress-induced atrophy of the hippocampus is associated with the pathogenesis of affective disorders, the functional BDNF Val66Met polymorphism could be an incremental risk factor. METHOD: Eighty-seven healthy Caucasian participants underwent structural imaging and were genotyped for the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism. Data were analysed by means of voxel-based morphometry (VBM). RESULTS: Region of interest (ROI) analyses revealed an association between the 66Met allele and smaller parahippocampal volumes and a smaller right amygdala. In addition, the whole-brain analysis showed that the thalamus, fusiformus gyrus and several parts of the frontal gyrus were smaller in 66Met allele carriers. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the impact of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is not confined to the hippocampus but also extends to the parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala.
