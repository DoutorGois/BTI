M. R. Gilmartin and M. D. McEchron (2005) reported that single cells recorded in the prelimbic cortex of rats during the acquisition of trace fear conditioning display multiple patterns of neuronal firing during the trace. These finding are discussed in the context of the role of the prelimbic cortex in processing temporal information during trace conditioning and delayed matching- or nonmatching-to-sample paradigms based on both electrophysiology and lesion evidence. In addition, evidence is provided for a role of the hippocampus in supporting temporal processing of information and its potential interaction with the prelimbic cortex.
