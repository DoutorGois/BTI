Dendritic spine density of pyramidal cells in region CA1 of the hippocampus has been evaluated in young (3 months), old (27 months) and old phosphatidylserine (BC-PS)-treated rats. BC-PS (50 mg/kg, suspended in tap water) was administered daily, starting at the age of 3 months until 27 months. Spine density was analyzed on Golgi-stained pyramidal neurons by a computerized analysis system. In 27-month-old rats, spine density showed with respect to 3-month-old animals, a significant decrease in both basal and apical dendrites (p less than 0.01; one-way ANOVA), with a mean loss of 12.11% in the basal dendrites and of 10.64% in the apical ones. In 27-month-old rats treated with BC-PS, values of spine density were not statistically different when compared to those of 3-month-old animals. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of BC-PS treatment on neuronal connectivity might be explained on the basis of its pharmacological actions on neuronal membranes [9], neurotransmission [43] and/or interaction with NGF [7].
