Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is not a unitary electroclinical imaging syndrome. We asked if seizures arising from the parahippocampal-inferior temporal (PIT) region differ from those associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). The electroclinical features of 22 patients with HS and 14 patients with lesions in the PIT region who underwent epilepsy surgery and were seizure free for at least 2 years postoperatively were analyzed retrospectively. Patients with PIT lesions had a higher frequency of hypermotor and bilateral features and a lower frequency of behavioral arrest at the onset of seizure compared to cases with HS, suggesting that TLE originating in the PIT area can mimic frontal lobe epilepsy or contralateral mesial TLE.
