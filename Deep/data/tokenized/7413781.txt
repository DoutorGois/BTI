The effects of hippocampal stimulation on the development and expression of latent inhibition were investigated employing classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response of rabbits. Hippocampal stimulation overlapping conditioned stimulus preexposure produced attenuation of latent inhibition, as did stimulation presented during conditioning after preexposure. However, hippocampal stimulation during conditioning in the absence of preexposure had little effect. The results support the hypotheses that in classical conditioning a major function of the hippocampus is the modulation of sensory input, especially input involved in the learned irrelevance of stimuli.
