AIM: To observe the protective role of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) on hippocampal neuronal apoptosis induced by beta amyloid peptide in the culture. METHODS: Hippocampal neurons were isolated from 1d old SD rat and neuronal survival and apoptosis were measured by MTT assay and DNA ladder. RESULTS: 25 micromol/L Abeta could induce neuron apoptosis while co-treatment with PACAP could increase the survival of hippocampal neurons. The antagonist of PACAP receptor, P6-27, could reverse the effect of PACAP. CONCLUSION: PACAP could protects cultured neurons from the neurotoxicity of Abeta through the activation of PACAP receptor and may have a bright use in treatment of neurodegenerative disease.
