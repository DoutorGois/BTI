Intracellular recordings were made from rat hippocampal CA1 neurons in rat brain slice preparations to investigate whether cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and calcium/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) contribute to the membrane dysfunction induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). Superfusion of oxygen- and glucose-deprived medium produced a rapid depolarization approximately 5 min after the onset of the superfusion. When oxygen and glucose were reintroduced immediately after the rapid depolarization, the membrane depolarized further (persistent depolarization) and reached 0 mV after 5 min from the reintroduction. The pretreatment of the slice preparation with PKA inhibitors, H-89 and Rp-cAMPS, and an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ 22, 536, significantly restored the membrane toward the preexposure potential level after the reintroduction of oxygen and glucose in a concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, a phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122, a PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, and a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, also significantly restored the membrane after the reintroduction. Moreover, an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor antagonist, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate, and calmodulin inhibitors, trifluoperazine and W-7, significantly restored the membrane after the reintroduction, while neither an alpha-subunit-selective antagonist for stimulatory G protein, NF449, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II inhibitor, KN-62, nor a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, ML-7, significantly restored the membrane after the reintroduction. These results suggest that the activation of PKA and/or PKC prevents the recovery from the persistent depolarization produced by OGD. The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-stimulated adenylate cyclase may contribute to the activation of PKA.
