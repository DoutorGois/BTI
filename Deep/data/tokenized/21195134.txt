An outbred rat model of the novelty-seeking phenotype is used to study nicotine vulnerability, where experimentally naive rats were phenotype screened as high or low responders (HRs or LRs, ranking in the upper or lower one-third of the population respectively) based on locomotor activity displayed in a novel environment. Following nicotine training and abstinence, HR animals pre-trained with nicotine showed expression of locomotor sensitization to nicotine challenge along with enhanced social anxiety-like behavior in the social interaction test compared to saline pre-trained controls. HR rats also showed a downregulation in neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA levels in the medial nucleus of amygdala and the CA1 field of the hippocampus, an upregulation in Y2 mRNA levels in the CA3 field of the hippocampus, and an upregulation in the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) mRNA levels in the central nucleus of the amygdala. These findings implicate dysregulations in the NPY-CRF systems in the HR hippocampus and amygdala associated with the emergence of social anxiety-like behavior, and a novel Y2R-mediated pathway in nicotine relapse.
