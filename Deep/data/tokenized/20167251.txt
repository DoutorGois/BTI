Phosphorylation is critically involved in synaptic plasticity and memory. Recent studies have shown that another posttranslational modification, acetylation, particularly of histone H3, also plays important roles in long-term potentiation and memory. However, activity-dependent modification of different histones of the nucleosome is not clearly understood. Here we show that depolarization enhances acetylation of histone H2B in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Depolarization-induced H2B acetylation is dependent on calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity. In addition, inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity also abolishes depolarization-induced increase in H2B acetylation. These results show that acetylation of histone H2B is regulated in an activity-dependent manner by the molecular events important for synaptic plasticity and memory.
