Local micro-injection of dophamine, norepinephrine and serotonin into the dorsal hippocampus of rats in doses of 5gamma does not affect the muscle tone and spontaneous motor activity of the animals, but lengthens the latent period of the conditioned avoidance reflex (CAR). When administered into the hippocampus in the same dose 15 minutes after injection of lithium chloride (1gamma equiv) dophamine inhibits stronger the CAR and noticeably stimulates the motor activity. At the same time, a preliminary injection of lithium cloride into the hippocampus does not change the action of norepinephrine and serotonin on the length of the latent CAR period, but, when used against the background of lithium chloride, norepinephrine depresses the motor activity.
