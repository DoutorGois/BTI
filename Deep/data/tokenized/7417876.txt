S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) decreases the epileptiform discharges induced by hippocampic stimulation. SAH reduces the pentetrazol convulsions, does not modify picrotoxine convulsions, and increases strychnine toxicity. These effects are not linked to gamma-aminobutyric acid metabolism perturbation or to the concentration of some amino acids known for their action in synaptic transmission.
