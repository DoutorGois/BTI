OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of Sini Powder () decoction (SND) in the treatment of insomnia. METHODS: The rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, model, SND-treated, and Estazolamtreated groups (n=15 in each group). Sleep deprivation (SD) rat model was established using the modifified multiple platform method for 14 h per day for 14 days, and the behavior of the rats were observed. Na-K-Cl-cotransporter (NKCC1) and K(+)/Cl(-) cotransporter (KCC2) in the hippocampus were tested by immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blot. RESULTS: SD rats displayed anxiety-like behavior, which was alleviated by SND. The protein expressions of NKCC1 and KCC2 in the hippocampus were signifificantly decreased in SD rats compared with those in control rats (P<0.05); these proteins were signifificantly increased by SND (P<0.05). The mRNA expression of KCC2 was signifificantly decreased in SD rats (0.62+/-0.35 vs. 2.29+/-0.56; P=0.044), while SND showed a tendency to increase the mRNA of KCC2 in SD rats (P>0.05). By contrast, the mRNA expression of NKCC1 was signifificantly increased in the hippocampus of SD rats (6.58+/-1.54 vs. 2.82+/-0.32; P=0.011), while SND decreased the mRNA expression of NKCC1 (6.58+/-1.54 vs. 2.79+/-0.81; P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Chinese medicine SND could alleviate mood disorder of SD rats by regulating cation-chloride cotransporters, such as NKCC1 and KCC2. These fifindings would have major implications in the mechanism of SND to relieve insomnia.
