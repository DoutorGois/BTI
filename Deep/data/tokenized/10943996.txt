In previous studies, we isolated and identified a mu-calpain/PKCalpha complex from rabbit skeletal muscle. Here, we have used specific purification procedures in order to study the interactions between mu-calpain and PKC in mouse hippocampus, a brain structure implicated in memory processes. We observed that mu-calpain and conventional PKCs (alpha, betaII and gamma) are co-eluted after anion exchange chromatography. In contrast to our previous results obtained on skeletal muscle, mu-calpain and PKC isoenzymes were dissociated after gel filtration chromatography. Furthermore, mu-calpain induced the proteolytic conversion of PKCalpha, betaII, and gamma into PKMalpha, betaII, and gamma with a preferential hydrolysis of PKCgamma, a specific isoenzyme of the nervous system. Although the mu-calpain/PKC interactions in the hippocampus are quite different from skeletal muscle, our results however, point out the functional importance of these inter-relations. Moreover, as PKCgamma has been involved in the biochemical events underlying learning and memory, the preferential relationship between mu-calpain and PKCgamma promotes the importance of the role that mu-calpain could play in the cellular mechanisms of memory formation.
