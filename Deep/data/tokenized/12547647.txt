The human neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene was originally discovered because of its deletion in infantile spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a childhood genetic disorder characterized by motor neuron loss and progressive paralysis with muscular atrophy. Although SMA is now known to be caused by deletions of survival motor neuron (SMN), the fact that NAIP is an anti-apoptotic protein is consistent with the NAIP gene modifying SMA severity. Here we report the cloning of a 1.5 kb rat NAIP cDNA fragment which contains BIR-3 (third baculovirus inhibitory repeat) domain. This fragment shows 78% homology to the human NAIP and 86% homology to the murine counterpart. We have investigated the distribution of NAIP mRNA expressing neurons by in situ RT-PCR technique in the rat central nervous system (CNS). Although all of the neurons appeared to express NAIP mRNA ubiquitously, pronounced elevation of NAIP mRNA expression was observed in the areas innervated by glutamatergic neurons after kainic acid (KA) injection. We have raised an anti-rat NAIP antiserum in rabbits using NAIP cDNA and recombinant rat NAIP, and carried out an immunohistological investigation. We observed highly immunoreactive neuronal subpopulations in the retinal ganglion, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain, thalamus, areas of midbrain, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and motor neurons in the spinal cord. Increased immunoreactivity of glutamatergic neurons was also observed broadly in the CNS after KA treatment. This study provides additional evidence that expression of mRNA and gene products of NAIP seem to be regulated in response to excessive stimuli or injuries in rat CNS, and these results are compatible with an anti-apoptotic role of NAIP in acute SMA as well as in brain injuries.
