Females and males are different in brain and behaviors. These differences are mediated by steroids and their nuclear receptors which require coactivators to regulate the transcription of target genes. Studies have shown that these coactivators are critical for modulating steroid hormone action in the brain. Steroid receptor coactivator-1 has been implied in the regulation of reproduction, stress, motor learning, and limited studies have reported the sex-specific difference of SRC-1 mRNA or protein expression in specific brain regions, but the expression and differences of SRC-1 immunoreactivities in adult female and male brain remain unclear. In this study we reported that in both sexes, high levels of SRC-1 immunoreactivities were detected in olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, Purkinje cells, some limited diencephalon and brainstem nuclei. The immunopositive materials were predominantly detected in cell nucleus, but in some regions they were also detected in the processes or fiber-like structures. In most of the brain regions studied, males possessed significantly higher levels of SRC-1 immunoreactivities than that of females. Higher levels of SRC-1 were detected in some nuclei related to learning and memory, motor regulation and reproduction indicated its potential roles in neurodegeneration and sex-dependent behavior and structure; the region- and sex-specific localization of SRC-1 immunoreactivities in agreement with that of some steroid receptors, indicating this coactivator play important roles in these hormone-reactive regions and cell groups related to reproduction, learning and memory, integration of motor and sense.
