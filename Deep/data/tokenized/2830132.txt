The effect of systemic administration of agonists and antagonists of GABA system on excitability and intracentral relationships of the brain structures was found during chronic experiments on rabbits with bipolar electrodes implanted in the region of the frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, midbrain reticular formation and central gray matter. The changes of the functional state of the cerebral formations were suggested to be related to a different degree of the involvement of GABA receptors of types A and B.
