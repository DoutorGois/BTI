We demonstrate the possibility of using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as potential devices able to improve neural signal transfer while supporting dendrite elongation and cell adhesion. The results strongly suggest that the growth of neuronal circuits on a CNT grid is accompanied by a significant increase in network activity. The increase in the efficacy of neural signal transmission may be related to the specific properties of CNT materials, such as the high electrical conductivity.
