Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown some morphological and volumetric peculiarities in brains of schizophrenic patients. The authors explored the influence of genetic polymorphisms at interleukin-1beta (IL-1B) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) genes on these abnormalities. Hippocampus, lateral ventricles, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex gray matter volumes were measured in a sample of 23 DSM-IV diagnosed schizophrenic patients of Spanish origin using MRI scans; MRI data were adjusted for age and brain volume using regression parameters from a healthy control group (n = 45). IL-1B and IL-1RN genes, involved in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative processes, were analyzed in the patient sample. Patients carrying VNTR-allele*2 of IL-1RN gene showed a significant enlargement of both left (P = 0.002) and right (P = 0.01) ventricles. Sex and illness duration were controlled for in the analyses. Our results, though preliminary, suggest that IL-1RN gene might contribute to the ventricular volumetric changes observed in schizophrenic patients.
