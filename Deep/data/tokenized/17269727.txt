Protein profiling in five individual mouse strains showed strain-specific expression of three hypothetical proteins (HPs). As functional and structural assignment of HPs were based on predictions and low identity to known structures, HPs were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and their proposed tentative function was determined by enzyme assays. Three identified HPs were extracted from gels and renatured, and pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase, inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase, and antioxidant activities were revealed, findings in agreement with functional predictions.
