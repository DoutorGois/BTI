Following exposure to short daylengths, in golden hamsters, changes in basal adrenal glucocorticoid secretion are associated with a significant increase in Type I receptor binding, and are preceded by alterations in the stress-induced release of glucocorticoids, which is one of the major modes of operation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA). These results lend support to the hypothesis that corticosteroid receptors, and in particular the Type I receptor subtype, play a central role in the regulation of circadian and circannual rhythms of the HPA.
