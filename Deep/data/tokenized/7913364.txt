Changes in cytosolic Na+ ([Na+]i) caused by a toxic glutamate (GLU) or NMDA treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons were monitored by using SBFI fluorescent probe and imaging microscopy. Both GLU and NMDA (50 or 100 microM in Mg(2+)-free solution, 15 min) induced a marked increase in [Na+]i (from 6-8 to 30-45 mM) which persisted after the termination of a treatment. The competitive NMDA antagonist, APV (100 microM) when applied in the post-NMDA period failed to decrease the elevated [Na+]i. The results obtained strongly suggest that the main reason for an impairment of Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the post-glutamate period (see Febs Letters 1993, 324, 271-273) is a reduction of the transmembrane Na+ gradient caused apparently by inhibition of Na(+)-K+ pump.
