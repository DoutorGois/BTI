To develop a timesaving and easy operating Reverse Phase (RP) chromatography method, we adopted Thermo Pierce RP C18 Tip to separate small amount hippocampus peptide mixtures and to compare with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). According to the separation performance of 4 ACN gradient optimization methods, we determined the best ACN concentration gradient. The results showed that, the experiment took only 10 min by separating with eight ACN concentration gradient, which accounted 1/4 for HPLC. But as for the identified proteins, RP C18 Tip accounted 85.5% for HPLC. ACN gradient of 5%, 15%, 20% and 90% had best repeatability (P = 0.429) and result for separating 30 mug peptides. This method is easy to operate, timesaving and has low cost. It could be used into pretreatment of small amount complex proteomic samples.
