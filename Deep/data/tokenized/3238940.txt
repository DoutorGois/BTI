Activities of GABA-transaminase (GABA-TA) and glutamate decarboxylase (GDC) were estimated in mitochondria of limbic cortex (L1 and L2 areas), hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala and midbrain reticular formation (RF) of 3 months and 1 year old dogs during 5, 12 and 20 days of starvation. Total activity of GABA-TA and GDC was distinctly decreased in mitochondria of limbic cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and amygdala. At the same time, after 5 days starvation activity of GDC, in presence of 0.1 mM PALP or without it was increased in RF mitochondria of 3 months old dogs, while GABA-TA was activated in the mitochondria of 1 year old dogs. The rate of GDC activation by PALP was dissimilar in certain structures of brain limbic areas during various periods of starvation in 3 months old dogs, which occurred due to difference of the GDC mitochondrial forms in synaptic structures of the dog brain limbic system. Activity of GABA-TA in 3 months and 1 year old dogs as well as activity of GDC, in presence of PALP or without it, in 3 months old dogs were distinctly decreased in mitochondria of all the dog brain limbic structures studied after long-term deprivation within 12 and 20 days. The decrease in activity of GABA-TA and GDC was related to duration of starvation as well as to morpho-functional alterations and adaptation of the brain structures studied during postnatal ontogenesis.
