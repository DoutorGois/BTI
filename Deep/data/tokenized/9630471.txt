This study describes the regional and cellular expression of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, in rodent brain. A combination of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and immunoblot techniques was employed to localize GLUT4 mRNA and protein to the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cerebellum, with the greatest level of expression being in the cerebellum. Estimates of the concentration of GLUT4 in cerebellar membranes indicate that this transporter isoform is present in significant amounts, relative to the other isoforms, GLUT1 and GLUT3. Cerebellar GLUT4 expression was increased in the genetically diabetic, hyperinsulinemic, db/db mouse relative to the non-diabetic control, and even higher levels were observed in db/db female than db/db male mice. Levels of expression of GLUT4 protein in cerebellum appear to respond to the level of circulating insulin, and are reduced in the hypoinsulinemic streptozotocin-diabetic rat. Exercise training also results in reduced insulin levels and comparably reduced levels of GLUT4 in the cerebellum. These studies demonstrate a chronic insulin-sensitive regulation of GLUT4 in rodent brain and raise the possibility of acute modulations of glucose uptake in these GLUT4 expressing cells.
