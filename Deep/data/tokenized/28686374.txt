Various cells of the thalamus, hippocampus, and the medial entorhinal cortex plays a crucial role in spatial navigation ability. The highlighting of these cells and the understanding of their functioning by John O'Keefe, May-Britt and Edvard Moser have earned them the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 2014. The vision, olfaction, and the vestibular system contribute to this complex system. These observations may well explain why patients with vestibular disorder complain of spatial disorientation, often a source of deep anxiety.
