Intrauterine growth retardation induced by ligation of the uterine vessels in pregnant rats on the 5th day before delivery was associated with brain and body weights of hypotrophic offspring significantly lower than those of pair-aged control rats, even after 6 weeks of postnatal rearing under normal conditions. In vitro measurements in homogenates indicated that Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in the forebrain, cerebellum and hippocampus was less active in hypotrophic rats than in pair-aged controls for at least the first month after birth. However, 5-HT and related agonists (RU-24969, bufotenine, and to a lower extent, tryptamine) stimulated Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity more efficiently in tissues from hypotrophic rats than in those from control animals. Opposite changes were noted in the brain stem: basal Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was higher in hypotrophic rats during the second half of the first postnatal month but the stimulatory effect of 5-HT was lower than in pair-aged control animals. Since potent 5-HT antagonists such as cinanserin, methiothepin and methysergide, prevented the 5-HT induced-activation of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in brain homogenates, these results are discussed in relation with the possible existence of a specific 5-HT receptor controlling Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in the rat brain.
