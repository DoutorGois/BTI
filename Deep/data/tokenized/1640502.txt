Synaptic connectivity change is a consistent anatomical feature of memory formation and the possibility that this is mediated by a replay of neurodevelopmental events has been investigated by measuring change in neural cell adhesion molecule sialylation state during the acquisition and consolidation of a passive avoidance response in the adult rat. The avoidance response was always generated after two to three trials and the animals remained on the platform for the criterion time of 5 min. In all cases training was complete within 5-8 min. Change in sialylation state was monitored following intraventricular infusion of the 3H-ManNAc precursor at 4 hr prior to the reference point. No task-specific change in general glycoconjugate sialylation was apparent in hippocampal P2 pellets at increasing times following training. Increased sialylation state was observed only in neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) immunoprecipitates of hippocampal membrane fractions at 12 and 24 hr after training. Change in hippocampal sialylation state could not be attributed to an increased accumulation of NCAM as detected by an immunoabsorbent assay. Immunoblotting of antibody precipitated NCAM demonstrated the 3H-ManNAc to be incorporated into the synapse-specific, 180 kDa isoform of NCAM and a novel 210 kDa isoform. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting procedures with an antibody specific for a2-8-polysialic acid showed the 180 and 210 kDa isoforms to be polysialylated. The role of NCAM180 sialylation as a mechanism for synapse selection in information storage is discussed.
