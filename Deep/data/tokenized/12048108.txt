alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system, and contain combinations of four subunits (GluR1-4). We developed a GluR3-specific monoclonal antibody and quantified the cellular distribution of GluR3 in rat hippocampus. GluR3 immunoreactivity was detected in all pyramidal neurons and most interneurons. In addition, we found a subset of parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons in the hippocampus and neocortex that was notable for its intense GluR3 immunoreactivity and lack of GluR2 immunoreactivity. Such an expression pattern of AMPA receptor subunits is likely to make these interneurons selectively vulnerable to excitotoxicity.
