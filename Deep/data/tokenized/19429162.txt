The adrenal glucocorticoid, corticosterone, induces changes in gene expression in both neural and non-neural tissues. The rhythmic release of corticosterone has been shown in rats to be necessary for the rhythmic expression of the clock protein PERIOD2 (PER2) in select regions of the limbic forebrain. The mechanisms mediating the effects of glucocorticoids on changes in gene expression have been linked to the transcriptional activity of the low affinity glucocorticoid receptor, GR. We examined the patterns of PER2 expression in the brains of mice containing an inactivation of GR gene restricted to neural tissues (GR(NesCre) mice). We found that central deletion of the GR gene blunts the daily pattern of PER2 expression in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) both of which make up the central extended amygdala, but not in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), basolateral amygdala (BLA) or dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG). These results implicate brain GR receptors in the regulation of PER2 expression in the BNSTov and CEA and are consistent with our previous findings that the rhythmic expression of PER2 in these areas is selectively sensitive to fluctuations in circulating corticosterone.
