PKCiota/lambda has been proposed to be crucial in the early expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we further investigate the potential role of PKCiota/lambda in learning and memory by generating PKCiota/lambda conditional knockout mice specifically lacking PKCiota/lambda in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Surprisingly, PKCiota/lambda cKO mice show normal hippocampal LTP and memory. Further close-up observation reveals compensation for PKCiota/lambda expression by PKMzeta in PKCiota/lambda cKO mice. This compensation was not observed under basal conditions, but was detected either after LTP induction or learning-associated behavioral training. Accordingly, in the early stage of LTP expression, a switch from PKCiota/lambda- to PKMzeta-dependent molecular mechanisms was detected in PKCiota/lambda cKO mice. Notably, when cKO mice were challenged with more difficult hippocampus-dependent learning tasks, moderate learning deficits were detected, suggesting a suboptimal compensation for PKCiota/lambda's function in PKCiota/lambda cKO mice. Thus, under physiological conditions, PKCiota/lambda is essential for hippocampal early-LTP and long-term memory (LTM).
