The current study evaluated the effects of Xiao Yao San (XYS) on anxiety-like behaviors and sought to determine whether the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is involved. A total of 40 rats were divided into 5 groups (n=8): the control group (deionized water, per os (p.o.)), the model group (deionized water, p.o.), the SP600125 group (surgery), the per se group (surgery), and the XYS group (3.9 g/kg/d, p.o.). A 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) citrate buffer solution (2 microL/ventricle/d) and SP600125 (10 microg/ventricle, 2 microL/ventricle/d) were separately and bilaterally injected into the rats of the two surgery groups via the ventricular system of the brain. All but the control group underwent 14 d of chronic immobilization stress (CIS; 3 h/d). On day 15, the body weights of all of the rats were measured; additionally, the rats were subjected to the elevated plus maze (EPM) and novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) tests. Finally, JNK signaling pathway indices, including phosphorylated JNK (P-JNK), JNK, phosphorylated c-Jun (P-c-Jun) and cytochrome C (Cyt-C), were examined. After modeling, the body weight and behavioral analyses of the model rats indicated that this modeling method induced anxiety-like behaviors. P-JNK, JNK, and P-c-Jun were altered in the hippocampus of the model rats. After 14 d of treatment with XYS and SP600125, rat body weight and behaviors as well as P-JNK, JNK, and P-c-Jun had changed. However, no significant difference in Cyt-C was found. XYS improves the anxiety-like behaviors induced by CIS, which might be related to the JNK signaling pathway in the hippocampus.
