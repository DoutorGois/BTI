The purpose of the present study was to observe the depression-like behavior induced by social isolation; detect the antidepressant effect of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing NAP on social isolation mice by intranasal delivery. After construction of NT4-NAP/AAV, expression of NAP was confirmed in vitro. 3-week-old C57/BL mice were bred individually in cages as social isolation-rearing. Six weeks later, the first subset of mice underwent behavioral tests and western blot; the second was for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NT4-NAP/AAV was delivered quaque die by nasal administration for consecutive 10 days before behavioral test. Several depression-like behaviors were observed in social isolation mice, including decreased relative sucrose preference, longer immobility time in forced swimming test, lower plasma corticosterone and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampus. Thus, social isolation procedure appears to be an animal model of depression with good face and construct validity. What's more, the antidepressant effect in social isolation-rearing mice was observed after intranasal administration of NT4-NAP/AAV, suggesting that this might be a promising therapeutic strategy for depressive disorder.
