The formation of oxidative DNA damage as a consequence of seizures remains little explored. We therefore investigated the regional and temporal profile of 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation, a hallmark of oxidative DNA damage and DNA fragmentation in rat brain following seizures induced by systemic kainic acid (KA). Formation of 8-OHdG was determined via HPLC with electrochemical detection, and single- and double-stranded DNA breaks were detected using in situ DNA polymerase I-mediated biotin-dATP nick-translation (PANT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL), respectively. Systemic KA (11 mg/kg) significantly increased levels of 8-OHdG within the thalamus after 2 h, within the amygdala/piriform cortex after 4 h, and within the hippocampus after 8 h. Levels remained elevated up to sevenfold within these areas for 72 h. Smaller increases in 8-OHdG levels were also detected within the parietal cortex and striatum. PANT-positive cells were detected within the thalamus, amygdala/piriform cortex, and hippocampus 24-72 h following KA injection. TUNEL-positive cells appeared within the same brain regions and over a similar time course (24-72 h) but were generally lower in number. The present data suggest oxidative damage to DNA may be an early consequence of epileptic seizures and a possible initiation event in the progression of seizure-induced injury to DNA fragmentation and cell death.
