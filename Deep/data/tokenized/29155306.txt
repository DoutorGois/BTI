In the present study we provide evidence that 3,3',5'-triiodothyronine (reverse T3, rT3) restores neurochemical parameters induced by congenital hypothyroidism in rat hippocampus. Congenital hypothyroidism was induced by adding 0.05% propylthiouracil in the drinking water from gestation day 8 and continually up to lactation day 15. In the in vivo rT3 exposure, hypothyroid 12-day old pups were daily injected with rT3 (50 ng/kg body weight) or saline until day 14. In the ex vivo rT3 treatment, hippocampal slices from 15-day-old hypothyroid pups were incubated for 30 min with or without rT3 (1 nM). We found that ex vivo and/or in vivo exposure to rT3 failed in restoring the decreased (14)C-glutamate uptake; however, restored the phosphorylation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), (45)Ca(2+) influx, aspartate transaminase (AST), glutamine synthetase (GS) and gamma-glutamate transferase (GGT) activities, as well as glutathione (GSH) levels in hypothyroid hippocampus. In addition, rT3 improved (14)C-2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. Receptor agonists/antagonists (RGD peptide and AP-5), kinase inhibitors of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, CaMKII, PKA (SB239063, PD98059, KN93 and H89, respectively), L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) and intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM) were used to determine the mechanisms of the nongenomic rT3 action on GGT activity. Using molecular docking analysis, we found rT3 interaction with alphavbeta3 integrin receptors, nongenomically activating signaling pathways (PKA, CaMKII, p38MAPK) that restored GGT activity. We provide evidence that rT3 is an active TH metabolite and our results represent an important contribution to elucidate the nonclassical mechanism of action of this metabolite in hypothyroidism.
