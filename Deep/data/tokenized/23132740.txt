Social isolation is one of the most potent stressors in the prepubertal period and may influence disease susceptibility or resilience in adulthood. The glucocorticoid response and, consequently, the adaptive response to stress involve important changes in mitochondrial functions and apoptotic signaling. Previous studies have shown that consumption of a palatable diet reduces some stress effects. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether isolation stress in early life can lead to cellular alterations in the hippocampus. For this, we evaluated oxidative stress parameters, DNA breakage index, mitochondrial mass and potential, respiratory chain enzyme activities, apoptosis, and necrosis in the hippocampus of juvenile male rats submitted or not to isolation stress during the pre-puberty period. We also verified whether consumption of a palatable diet during this period can modify stress effects. Results show that stress led to an oxidative imbalance, DNA breaks, increased the mitochondrial potential and early apoptosis, and decreased the number of live and necrotic cells. In addition, the palatable diet increased glutathione peroxidase activity, high mitochondrial potential and complex I-III activity in the hippocampus of juvenile rats. The administration of a palatable diet during the isolation period prevented the stress effects that caused the reduction in live cells and increased apoptosis. In conclusion, the stress experienced during the pre-pubertal period induced a hippocampal oxidative imbalance, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased apoptosis, while consumption of a palatable diet attenuated some of these effects of exposure, such as the reduction in live cells and increased apoptosis, besides favoring an increase in antioxidant enzymes activities.
