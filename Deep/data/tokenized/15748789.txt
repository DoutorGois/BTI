To address controversies regarding the effect of age on the hippocampus, volumes of hippocampus and a comparison structure, temporal cortex, were measured on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 84 healthy men and 44 healthy women (20-85 years). Neither men nor women showed significant correlations between hippocampal volumes and age, despite significant age-related decline in temporal volumes. Absence of hippocampus age relationships endured when restricting analyses to older individuals (> or =50 years) and considering menopause and hormone replacement therapy.
