In situ hybridization for regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA showed a distinct and limited pattern of expression in the hypothalamus, midline thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus of the rat. High levels of regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA were found in the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular, supraoptic and accessory nuclei, in the neurons of the periventricular, medial tuberal, arcuate, lateral and perifornical nuclei, infundibular stalk, and in the ventrolateral division of the ventromedial nucleus and compact division of the dorsomedial nucleus. Lower levels of regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA were found in the parvocellular divisions of the paraventricular nucleus as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, median preoptic nucleus, medial preoptic nucleus, medial and lateral preoptic areas, subfornical organ, suprachiasmatic nucleus, anterior hypothalamic area, zona incerta, ventromedial nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and tuber cinereum. Regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 messenger RNA was also found in thalamic structures including the paraventricular, central medial, intermediodorsal, anterodorsal, rhomboid and reticular nuclei. Signal was also identified in the medial and lateral habenula, in the central, medial, basomedial and anterior cortical nuclei of the amygdala, and in the CA1-CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Dopamine may regulate regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 expression in the CNS because (i) regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 was originally identified in melanotropes based on its regulation by dopaminergic agents and (ii) many of the nuclei that contain regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 also receive dopaminergic input. The localization of regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 in the diencephalon suggests that regulated endocrine-specific protein-18 is involved in regulation of limbic and autonomic function, neuroendocrine control of salt and water balance, reproductive function and feeding behavior.
