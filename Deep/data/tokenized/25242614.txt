Cell apoptosis can cause hippocampal neuronal loss after epileptic seizures. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha is an important factor mediating apoptosis after brain injuries, such as cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injures, but little research has been done on its role in the lithium chloride-pilocarpine induced epileptic model. Here, we used a rat model of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) to investigate HIF-1alpha expression and apoptosis in the hippocampus, and to explore their relationship during epileptogenesis. 120 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were treated with lithium chloride-pilocarpine injections and divided into an experimental group (administered by MK-801) and a positive control group (administered by saline). Then the HIF-1alpha expression and hippocampal apoptosis were investigated by histological confirmation and western blotting at 24h, 3d, 7d and 14d, respectively. The results showed that the administration of MK-801 significantly reduced (P<0.05) HIF-1alpha expression and hippocampal apoptosis during epileptogenesis in comparison with the positive control. Moreover, the expression of HIF-1alpha and hippocampal apoptosis presented significant time-dependent changes (P<0.01) within 2 weeks, and their positive correlation (P<0.05) analyzed by Pearsons correlation analysis. Meanwhile, the HIF-1alpha immunostained cells were distributed in accord with TUNEL immunostained cells and Caspase-3 immunopositive cells in the hippocampus. These results indicate that the HIF-1alpha expression is associated with hippocampal apoptosis, and suggest that HIF-1alpha is an important factor during epileptogenesis.
