New hippocampal neurons are continuously generated in the adult brain of several animal species. Several studies have demonstrated that a variety of environmental factors, including stress, influence the proliferation of hippocampal cells. Thus, stress induced decrease of hippocampal neurogenesis seem to be an important factor in the etiology of depression. In this review the relationship between neurogenesis and depression has been emphasized.
