To evaluate the potential for lipofectin-mediated central nervous system gene transfer, the plasmid coding for cholecystokinin was administered intracerebroventricularly to rats, which have congenital audiogenic seizures and high responses to peripheral electric stimulation-induced analgesia. Previous studies had shown that low brain cholecystokinin levels may be the neurochemical variable of rat's audiogenic seizure and high responses to the analgesia because cholecystokinin is an anticonvulsant and anti-opioid neuropeptide. Gene transfer of cholecystokinin corrected the increased susceptibility to audiogenic seizures and the high responses to analgesia for about one week. Similar administration of plasmid expressing beta-galactosidase indicated that the vector mainly transfected ependymal cells lining the ventricle and pia mater cells. The increased cholecystokinin messenger RNA and immunoreactivity in the hippocampus following stereotactic intrahippocampal administration of cholecystokinin plasmid was also demonstrated with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry techniques. These results suggest that lipofectin-mediated gene transfer will be useful for studies of brain function, the modification of behavior and gene therapy for central nervous system disorders.
