The molecular basis for developing epilepsy remains under debate. It is hypothesized that increased excitatory synaptic activity might activate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor/Ca(2+) transduction pathway, which induces long-lasting plasticity changes leading to recurrent epileptiform discharges. To determine if these effects are caused by disruption of F-actin in the dendritic spines, we have perfused the hippocampus of conscious rats with the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin Aand the actin filament stabilizer jasplakinolide. Single perfusions of latrunculin Aand jasplakinolide decrease and increase picrotoxin seizure threshold, respectively. Repeated perfusions of both latrunculin Aand jasplakinolide induce epileptic seizures and a long-term increase in neuronal excitability. These results suggest that actin disruption might not be just a consequence but also a possible cause of epileptic seizures. We propose a new experimental model in rats to study the biochemical changes that might lead to chronic seizures and a method for testing new antiepileptic drugs.
