Coherence functions of biopotentials of the hippocampus, amygdala and frontal cortex were studied in dogs during performance of an alimentary instrumental conditioned reflex. Significant differences were determined between the coherence functions values in the background activity and under conditioned stimulation. The level of organization of coherence functions was calculated by entropy analysis method. An increase of organization level of coherence functions within the theta waves range and decrease within the beta 1 range under the action of the conditioned stimulus, was found during transition of the animal brain from the background state to activity.
