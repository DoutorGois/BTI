The effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as well as its sulfate and fatty acid ester derivatives on rat brain membrane fluidity was investigated by fluorescence depolarization of a lipid probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and compared to its effect on phospholipid conformation investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In rat brain, membrane fluidity varied rostro-caudally, the frontal cortex showing the highest fluidity compared to the hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, and hindbrain. As previously reported, it was observed that cholesteryl hemisuccinate and stearic acid rigidify striatal membrane whereas linoleic acid and L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine increase the membrane fluidity. Striatal fluidity was increased in vitro with increasing concentrations of DHEA, this effect was greater with the DHEA fatty acid ester derivatives (DHEA-L), DHEA-undecanoate, and DHEA-stearate, whereas no effect was observed with DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S). In the frontal cortex only the two DHEA-L derivatives increased membrane fluidity, whereas DHEA and DHEA-S were without effect. The effect of DHEA-L on synthetic dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-d54 phospholipid membranes indicates a disordering effect of DHEA-undecanoate and DHEA-stearate as reflected by increased trans-gauche isomerization of the acyl chains of the lipid. Hence, DHEA-L increase the disorder and/or fluidity of brain membranes; interestingly, these compounds are abundant in the brain where they are generally considered as storage compounds that slowly release the active unconjugated steroid hormone.
