Chronic consumption of processed food causes structural changes in membrane phospholipids, affecting brain neurotransmission. Here we evaluated noxious influences of dietary fats over two generations of rats on amphetamine (AMPH)-conditioned place preference (CPP). Female rats received soybean oil (SO, rich in n-6 fatty acids (FA)), fish oil (FO, rich in n-3 FA) and hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF, rich in trans fatty acids (TFA)) for two successive generations. Male pups from the 2nd generation were maintained on the same supplementation until 41 days of age, when they were conditioned with AMPH in CPP. While the FO group showed higher incorporation of n-3 polyunsaturated-FA (PUFA) in cortex/hippocampus, the HVF group showed TFA incorporation in these same brain areas. The SO and HVF groups showed AMPH-preference and anxiety-like symptoms during abstinence. Higher levels of protein carbonyl (PC) and lower levels of non-protein thiols (NPSH) were observed in cortex/hippocampus of the HVF group, indicating antioxidant defense system impairment. In contrast, the FO group showed no drug-preference and lower PC levels in cortex. Cortical PC was positively correlated with n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, locomotion and anxiety-like behavior, and hippocampal PC was positively correlated with AMPH-preference, reinforcing connections between oxidative damage and AMPH-induced preference/abstinence behaviors. As brain incorporation of trans and n-6 PUFA modifies its physiological functions, it may facilitate drug addiction.
