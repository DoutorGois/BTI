Diazoxide has been identified as a mitochondrial, ATP-dependent K(+) channel opener, and a potentially neuroprotective compound under ischemic conditions. We set out to characterize the consequences of various treatment strategies with diazoxide in a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Cerebral hypoperfusion was induced by permanent, bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (2VO, n = 36), sham-operated rats serving as controls (SHAM, n = 29). Diazoxide or its vehicle was administered i.p. daily (5 x 0.5 mg/kg/0.25 ml) or as a bolus injection (5 mg/kg/0.25 ml) before surgery or daily after surgery (5 x 0.5 mg/kg/0.25 ml). Spatial learning performance was assessed 1 week after 2VO in the Morris maze. Hippocampal pyramidal cell loss was assessed on cresyl violet-stained sections, while glial reactivity was labeled immunocytochemically. Daily or bolus pretreatment with diazoxide significantly improved 2VO-related learning impairment, whereas posttreatment was ineffective. The number of CA1 pyramidal neurons was reduced by 2VO, which was prevented by repeated or bolus pretreatment with diazoxide. Astrocyte proliferation and microglial activation were enhanced by posttreatment with diazoxide in the hippocampus CA1 area of 2VO animals as compared with SHAM. These data demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect exerted by diazoxide depends on the time of administration with respect to the onset of ischemia; pretreatment but not posttreatment with the compound has proved to be neuroprotective in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Thus, pretreatment with diazoxide offers therapeutical prospects for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
