Transient cerebral ischemia leads to protein aggregation mainly in neurons destined to undergo delayed neuronal death after ischemia. This study utilized a rat transient cerebral ischemia model to investigate whether ischemic preconditioning is able to alleviate neuronal protein aggregation, thereby protecting neurons from ischemic neuronal damage. Ischemic preconditioning was introduced by a sublethal 3 min period of ischemia followed by 48 h of recovery. Brains from rats with either ischemic preconditioning or sham-surgery were then subjected to a subsequent 7 min period of ischemia followed by 30 min, 4, 24, 48 and 72 h of reperfusion. Protein aggregation and neuronal death were studied by electron and confocal microscopy, as well as by biochemical analyses. Seven minutes of cerebral ischemia alone induced severe protein aggregation after 4 h of reperfusion mainly in CA1 neurons destined to undergo delayed neuronal death (which took place after 72 h of reperfusion). Ischemic preconditioning reduced significantly protein aggregation and virtually eliminated neuronal death in CA1 neurons. Biochemical analyses revealed that ischemic preconditioning decreased accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (ubi-proteins) and reduced free ubiquitin depletion after brain ischemia. Furthermore, ischemic preconditioning also reduced redistribution of heat shock cognate protein 70 and Hdj1 from cytosolic fraction to protein aggregate-containing fraction after brain ischemia. These results suggest that ischemic preconditioning decreases protein aggregation after brain ischemia.
