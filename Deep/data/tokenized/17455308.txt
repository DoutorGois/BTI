Neurogenesis continues throughout life in the hippocampus. To study postnatal neurogenesis in vitro, hippocampal slices from rats on postnatal day 5 (P5) were cultured on a porous membrane for 14 or 21 days. In the initial experiments, precursor cells were labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after 7 days in culture because hippocampal slices are generally used in experiments after 1-2 weeks in culture. Fourteen days after labeling, however, only about 10% of BrdU-labeled cells expressed neuronal markers, although in living rats, about 80% of cells labeled with BrdU on P5 had become neurons by P19. Next, rats were injected with BrdU 30 min before culture, after which hippocampal slices were cultured for 14 days to examine the capacity of in vivo-labeled neural precursors to differentiate into neurons in vitro. In this case, more than two-thirds of BrdU-labeled cells expressed neuronal markers, such as Hu, NeuN, and PSA-NCAM. Furthermore, precursor cells underwent early in vitro labeling by incubation with BrdU or a modified retrovirus vector carrying EGFP for 30 min from the beginning of the culture. This procedure resulted in a similar high rate of neuronal differentiation and normal development into granule cells. In addition, time-lapse imaging with retrovirus-EGFP revealed migration of neural precursors from the hilus to the granule cell layer. These results indicate that in vivo- and early in vitro-labeled cultures are readily available ex vivo models for studying postnatal neurogenesis and suggest that the capacity of neural precursors to differentiate into neurons is reduced during the culture period.
