Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) is a member of the Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) protein family, required for exocytosis of synaptic vesicles and regulation of diverse ion channels. Here, we show that acute reduction of SNAP-25 expression leads to an immature phenotype of dendritic spines that are, consistently, less functional. Conversely, over-expression of SNAP-25 results in an increase in the density of mature, Postsynaptic Density protein 95 (PSD-95)-positive spines. The regulation of spine morphogenesis by SNAP-25 depends on the protein's ability to bind both the plasma membrane and the adaptor protein p140Cap, a key protein regulating actin cytoskeleton and spine formation. We propose that SNAP-25 allows the organization of the molecular apparatus needed for spine formation by recruiting and stabilizing p140Cap.
