We applied an automated hippocampal segmentation technique based on adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) to the 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) baseline and 1-year follow-up data of 243 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 96 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 145 normal controls (NC) scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). MCI subjects with positive maternal history of dementia had smaller hippocampal volumes at baseline and at follow-up, and greater 12-month atrophy rates than subjects with negative maternal history. Three-dimensional maps and volumetric multiple regression analyses demonstrated a significant effect of positive maternal history of dementia on hippocampal atrophy in MCI and AD after controlling for age, ApoE4 genotype, and paternal history of dementia, respectively. ApoE4 showed an independent effect on hippocampal atrophy in MCI and AD and in the pooled sample.
