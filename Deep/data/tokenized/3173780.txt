Samples collected from rabbit neocortical surface during a tetanic stimulation of the neocortex induced neurite growth in PC-12 cells in culture and synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) in guinea pig hippocampal slices. If these samples were preheated and cooled, or if they were collected in the absence of a tetanic stimulation of the rabbit neocrotex, they did not induce neurite growth in PC-12 cells or LTP in the guinea pig hippocampus. These results suggest that neurite-inducing factors are released during tetanic stimulations and that these substances are involved in LTP.
