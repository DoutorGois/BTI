The purpose of this study is to observe the effect of intracerebroventricular (icv) and intra-PAG injection of substance P (SP) on serotonin (5-HT) contents of hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and its relation with the change of pain threshold, electroacupuncture (EA) analgesia. The results were as follows: (1) After icv injection of SP, the pain threshold and the 5-HT contents of hypothalamus, hippocampus were significantly increased. After depletion of the 5-HT contents in brain by pCPA, the inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis, the effect of SP on elevating pain threshold and the 5-HT contents of hypothalamus, hippocampus were markedly attenuated, bud did not prevent the analgesic effect of SP (2) The pain threshold and the 5-HT contents of hypothalamus, hippocampus were dose-dependently increased by intra-PAG injection of SP. (3) The intra-PAG injection of SP introduced simultaneously with high or low frequency EA did not affect the change of 5-HT contents of three brain regions, but caused a more marked elevation of pain threshold. These results suggest that the serotoninergic system may be activated by PAG for the mediation of SP induced analgesia. There is a synergic action of analgesia between the effects produced by intra-PAG injection of SP and those by high or low frequency EA.
