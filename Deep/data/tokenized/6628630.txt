The influence that the amygdala may exert on the development of hippocampal kindling was investigated using three different approaches: (i) after uni- or bilateral amygdalectomy by thermocoagulation, (ii) after prestimulation of the amygdala until the appearance of masticatory movements, and (iii) after increasing the GABA concentration in the amygdala with gamma-vinyl GABA. Hippocampal kindling was not significantly modified in amygdalectomized animals. On the contrary, prestimulation of the ipsilateral amygdala facilitated the subsequent hippocampal kindling. Finally, microinjection of gamma-vinyl GABA in both amygdalae either reduced the seizures to a prekindled level or strongly delayed the appearance of the motor signs of kindling. It is suggested that hippocampal kindling may develop preferentially through the amygdala.
