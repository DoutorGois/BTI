Reactions of the neurons of the hypothalamus, septum, amygdala of the hyppocampus, and of the brain cortex of rabbits to microionophoretic application of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) of the hypophysis, noradrenaline and acetylcholine were investigated. About half of the cells in all the brain areas under study changed the frequency of their discharges during the hormone application. The septal and the hyppocampus neurons mostly responded to ACTH by the excitation reactions, whereas neurons of the medial hypothalamus--by the inhibtion reactions. Comparison of the number of cells responding unidirectionally to the hormone and to each of the mediator agents studied, with the number of neurons responding multidirectionally showed no definite significant differences.
