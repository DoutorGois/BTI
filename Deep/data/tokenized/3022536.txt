Pick body-like inclusions are described in the granular neurons of the dentate fascia in Alzheimer's disease. The inclusions are round, argyrophilic and stained by thioflavine-S. Immunocytochemically they contain antigenic determinants of neurofilaments and of Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles. Ultrastructurally they are composed primarily of 15-18 nm straight filaments similar to the neurofibrillary pathology of progressive supranuclear palsy and Pick's disease. The dentate fascia inclusions, as well as cerebellar plaques but not amyloid angiopathy, are found most frequently in association with severe neurofibrillary degeneration.
