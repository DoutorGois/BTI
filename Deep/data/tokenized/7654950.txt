In these studies, recordings from cerebral cortical and limbic systems of cats are made of the dynamics of the electroencephalogram and evoked potentials. The hippocampus receives inputs from classification couples in global mappings and sends outputs back to the cortical regions that are originally responsible for input to the hippocampus. Because of the hippocampal loop structure operating parallel it appears to maintain an ordering of perceptual information in time of input from cortical networks. Repetitive stimuli are used to test the interaction patterns of evoked potentials in cortical and limbic regions.
