INTRODUCTION: Zinc finger-like protein that regulates apoptosis (Zfra) is a naturally occurring 31-amino-acid protein. Synthetic peptides Zfra1-31 and Zfra4-10 are known to effectively block the growth of many types of cancer cells. METHODS: Ten-month-old triple-transgenic (3xTg) mice for Alzheimer's disease (AD) received synthetic Zfra peptides via tail vein injections, followed by examining restoration of memory deficits. RESULTS: Zfra significantly downregulated TRAPPC6ADelta, SH3GLB2, tau, and amyloid beta (Alphabeta) aggregates in the brains of 3xTg mice and effectively restored their memory capabilities. Zfra inhibited melanoma-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus and plaque formation in the cortex. Mechanistically, Zfra blocked the aggregation of amyloid beta 42 and many serine-containing peptides in vitro, suppressed tumor necrosis factor-mediated NF-kappaB activation, and bound cytosolic proteins for accelerating their degradation in ubiquitin/proteasome-independent manner. DISCUSSION: Zfra peptides exhibit a strong efficacy in blocking tau aggregation and amyloid Alphabeta formation and restore memory deficits in 3xTg mice, suggesting its potential for treatment of AD.
