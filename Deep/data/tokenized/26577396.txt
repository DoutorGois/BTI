Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition resulting from exposure to a traumatic event. It is characterized by several debilitating symptoms including re-experiencing the past trauma, avoidance behavior, increased fear, and hyperarousal. Key roles in the neuropathology of PTSD and its symptomatology have been attributed to the hippocampus and amygdala. These regions are involved in explicit memory processes and context encoding during fear conditioning. The aim of our study was to investigate whether PTSD is capable of altering the morphology, density and expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in astrocytes from the CA1 region of the hippocampus and the medial amygdala and correlate the data obtained with the orientation index of the polarity of astrocytes. Thirty male rats were divided in two groups: control (n = 15) and PTSD (n = 15). The inescapable shock protocol, in which the animals are exposed to a single episode of footshock, was used to induce PTSD. Our results show that, in the hippocampus, PTSD is capable of decreasing the density of GFAP+ astrocytes as well as altering astrocytic morphology, as shown by the reductions observed in the total number of primary processes, in the number of primary processes in the lateral quadrants, and the degree of branching in the lateral quadrants. The analysis of the orientation index indicates that PTSD alters the polarity of hippocampal astrocytes. No alterations were observed in the amygdala astrocytes. Therefore, this study demonstrates notable changes in hippocampal astrocytes, supporting the concept that these cells play an important role in PTSD symptomatology.
