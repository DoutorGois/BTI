Available evidence suggests that regular, moderate-intensity exercise has beneficial effects on neural health, perhaps including neuroprotection. To evaluate this idea further, we compared the severity of kainate-induced neuronal loss in exercised versus sedentary female rats. Stereological estimations of neuron number revealed that rats in the exercise condition exhibited significantly greater neuron loss in hippocampal region CA2/3, suggesting that high levels of physical activity may increase neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxicity.
