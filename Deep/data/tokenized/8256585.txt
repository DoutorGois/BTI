Proteins immunologically related to the human erythrocyte anion transporter band 3 are present in neurons of the human neocortex and hippocampus. Immunocytochemical studies show increased band 3 immunoreactivity in neurons in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Immunoblot studies show the presence of band 3-like molecules in brain membrane fractions, and suggest changes in expression and/or processing of band 3-like molecules in Alzheimer's disease-affected regions. We postulate that alterations in membrane-bound, band 3-like molecules may reflect termination of neuronal lifespan in Alzheimer's disease.
