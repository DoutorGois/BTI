The administration of 3-nitropropionic acid increases reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidant defense mechanisms buffer these ROS converting them into non-damaging compounds. Taurine and vitamins C and E are antioxidants that play a role in the defense against cellular damage. This study examines the antioxidant effect of taurine, vitamin C, and vitamin E on acute hippocampal damage caused by 3-NP. Animals treated with 3-NP increased lipid peroxidation levels and astrocytic damage in the hippocampus. Administration of taurine, vitamin C, and vitamin E partially protected from oxidative damage, indicate that while all substances had antioxidant effects, only taurine showed morphological protection in surviving cells.
