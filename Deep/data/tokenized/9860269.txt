Effects of the mono- and tetra-sialogangliosides, GM1 and GQ1b, on long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated in the CA1 neurons of guinea-pig hippocampal slices. The magnitude of LTP induced by a strong tetanus (100 Hz, 100 pulses) was not significantly affected by application of either ganglioside. In contrast, when LTP was induced by a weak tetanus (100 Hz, 4 pulses), a significantly greater LTP was induced in the presence of either ganglioside. Similarly, when slices were incubated in low-Ca2+ (1.0-1.1 mM) medium for more than 2 h, the LTP was usually small or absent, but showed a significant increase in amplitude of population spike (A-PS) when the slices were incubated with either GM1 or GQ1b (4-5 microg/ml). In addition, the application of GQ1b (4 microg/ml) reversed the blocking effect of an NMDA-receptor antagonist, APP-5 (10 microM), on the induction of LTP and resulted in forming LTP. Based on these findings, we conclude that GM1 and GQ1b exert positive modulatory effects on the induction of LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons and suggest that GM1 and GQ1b may participate in the induction of LTP as donors of Ca2+ ions.
