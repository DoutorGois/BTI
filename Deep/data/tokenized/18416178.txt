Expression of mRNA of 1 and 2 type (TRPVI and TRPV2) vanilloid receptors in the cultured hippocampal neurons was determined. With the use of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of single neurons (single-cell RT-PCR), was shown the TRPV1 and TRPV2 receptors expression in both neurons and glia cell. With use of real-time (real-time PCR) we determined that the level of these genes expression in different neurons is identical. It was also shown that the level of mTRPVI in GABAergic neurons was considerably higher, than the level of mTRPV2, while expression of genes in the glutamatergic neurons did not differ. Findings about expression of TRPV 1 and TRPV2 allow to suppose that vanilloid receptors can play an important functional role in the hippocampal neurons.
