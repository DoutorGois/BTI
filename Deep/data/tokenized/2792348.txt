The computed analysis of the EEG-effects of a neuroleptic ethaperazine and an antidepressant melipramine administered in different doses was made in the experiments on cats. It was established that ethaperazine (3 mg/kg) and melipramine (6 mg/kg) increase the spectral power in the range of 1-2 Hz; the maximal effect was noted 2 hours after their oral administration Ethaperazine primarily decreases the powers of the spectra of the hypothalamus and reticulotegmental nucleus in the range of 13-14 Hz and over. Melipramine in a dose of 6 mg/kg decreases the spectral power of the hippocampus in the range of 4-12 Hz, of the mediodosal and caudal nuclei in the range of 8-12 Hz. The peak of the effects of melipramine administered in a dose of 12 mg/kg manifests itself in the decrease of the power in the range of 14-20 Hz and over both of the cortical and subcortical structures of EEG spectra.
