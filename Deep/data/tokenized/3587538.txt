Using unit recording and electrophoretic techniques, the action of piperidine on unit activity of the brain of the rat was studied. Piperidine excited 31%, and inhibited 4% of cortical cells tested. In the hippocampus and caudate nucleus, piperidine excited larger proportions of the cells tested. The actions of piperidine were blocked by tetraethylammonium but not by scopolamine.
