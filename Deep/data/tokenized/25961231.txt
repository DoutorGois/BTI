Estrogen neuroprotection has been shown in pathological conditions damaging the hippocampus, such as trauma, aging, neurodegeneration, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, hypoglycemia, amyloid-beta peptide exposure and ischemia. Hypertensive encephalopathy also targets the hippocampus; therefore, hypertension seems an appropriate circumstance to evaluate steroid neuroprotection. Two experimental models of hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and deoxycorticosterone (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats, develop hippocampal abnormalities, which include decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, astrogliosis, low expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and decreased number of neurons in the hilar region, with respect of their normotensive strains Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley rats. After estradiol was given for 2 weeks to SHR and DOCA-treated rats, both hypertensive models normalized their faulty hippocampal parameters. Thus, estradiol treatment positively modulated neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, according to bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and doublecortin immunocytochemistry, decreased reactive astrogliosis, increased BDNF mRNA and protein expression in the dentate gyrus and increased neuronal number in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus. A role of local estrogen biosynthesis is suggested in SHR, because basal aromatase mRNA in the hippocampus and immunoreactive aromatase protein in cell processes of the dentate gyrus were highly expressed in these rats. Estradiol further stimulated aromatase-related parameters in SHR but not in WKY. These observations strongly support that a combination of exogenous estrogens to those locally synthesized might better alleviate hypertensive encephalopathy. These studies broaden estrogen neuroprotective functions to the hippocampus of hypertensive rat models.
