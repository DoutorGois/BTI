Oxidative stress is considered as a major risk factor that contributes to age-related increase in lipid peroxidation and declined antioxidants in the central nervous system during aging. Grape seed extract, one of the bioflavonoid, is widely used for its medicinal properties. In the present study, we evaluated the role of grape seed extract on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in discrete regions of the central nervous system of young and aged rats. Male albino rats of Wistar strain were divided into four groups: Group I-control young rats, Group II-young rats treated with grape seed extract (100 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days, Group III-aged control rats and Group IV-aged rats supplemented with grape seed extract (100 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days. Age-associated increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in the spinal cord, cerebral cortex, striatum and the hippocampus regions of aged rats (Group III). Activities of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and levels of non-enzymic antioxidants like reduced glutathione, Vitamin C and Vitamin E were found to be significantly decreased in all the brain regions studied in aged rats when compared to young rats. However, normalized lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defenses were reported in the grape seed extract-supplemented aged rats. These findings demonstrated that grape seed extract enhanced the antioxidant status and decreased the incidence of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation in the central nervous system of aged rats.
