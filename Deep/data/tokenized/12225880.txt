Cerebral ischemia is caused by a reduced blood supply to neurons, and vulnerability to neurodegeneration varies considerably among neuronal types. In hippocampus, neurons in the CA1 region are more susceptible to ischemia-induced neuronal death than neurons in the CA3 region, and in response to transient forebrain ischemia a family of calcium-dependent receptors for alpha-latrotoxin is differentially expressed in the two regions. Here, we report that an ischemic insult up-regulated a family of calcium-independent receptors for alpha-latrotoxin (CIRL) mRNAs in CA1 neurons and down-regulated their mRNAs in CA3 neurons. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides complementary to CIRL-1 mRNA or CIRL-3 mRNA suppressed neuronal death associated with hypoxia in hippocampal and cortical cell cultures. The observed region-specific CIRL mRNA expression in hippocampus and an in vitro rescue experiment by antisense oligonucleotides against CIRL mRNAs suggest a functional importance of CIRL in neurodegeneration.
