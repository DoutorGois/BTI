Dysfunctions of the hippocampus have been suggested to be related to schizophrenia, and reduced connectivity with other brain regions may be a key for the pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of white matter anomalies in the hippocampus, as a sign of altered connectivity, on the brain electrical activity. We investigated seven first episode schizophrenic patients and seven age, gender and education-matched controls with diffusion tensor imaging and resting EEG. Fractional anisotropy was computed based on diffusion tensor imaging data for the right and left hippocampus for both groups. No group differences were found in hippocampal fractional anisotropy, EEG spectral power and topography. However a significant correlation was found between more anterior alpha activity and lower fractional anisotropy of both hippocampi in schizophrenics, but not in controls. More anterior alpha activity has been described in schizophrenia. We conclude that this feature might depict a group of schizophrenic patients with reduced hippocampal connectivity.
