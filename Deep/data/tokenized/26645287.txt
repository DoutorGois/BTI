We performed immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of caspases 3, 9 and bcl-2 protein in rat brain at various terms after administration of LD50 of sodium thiopental. Expression of the specified apoptosis markers was found in the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus (dentate gyrus and CA2 region).
