We have studied the expression of smg p25A and synaptophysin in cultured hippocampal neurons isolated from 5-day-old rat brain by an immunocytochemical technique. In a dispersed cell culture seeded on astrocyte monolayers, well-branching neurite proliferation was observed along with age in culture. The synaptophysin immunoreactivity was present in the neuronal cell bodies and neurites at 1 and 5 days in vitro (DIV) and was eventually localized to discrete areas along neurites at 15 DIV while the immunoreactivity in cell bodies became less prominent. On the other hand, the smg p25A immunoreactivity was observed in the neuronal cell bodies and neurites at 1 through 15 DIV. The immunoreactivity for smg p25A or synaptophysin was not observed in astrocytes and this finding was confirmed by an immunoblot analysis. These results indicate that smg p25A as well as synaptophysin is present exclusively in neurons and suggest that these two synapse-associated proteins have different sites of function and different kinetics of synthesis, transport, and/or turnover in cultured hippocampal neurons.
