To assess the neurotoxic properties of the glutamate agonist quisqualic acid (QA) in immature brain, we injected this compound (100 nmol QA/1 microliter) directly into the striatum of 7-day-old rats. QA produced neuronal necrosis and glial infiltration in 14 pups and reduced the size of the striatum and hippocampus on the side of injection. Intracerebral injection of QA provides a new method for producing neuronal lesions in the developing brain.
