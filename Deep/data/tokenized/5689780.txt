1. Experiments were carried out to determine whether the prostaglandins, which have been identified as natural constituents of the brain, are widely distributed or concentrated in special regions of the central nervous system.2. Prostaglandins E(1), E(2), F(1alpha) and F(2alpha) have been identified in dog brain using solvent partition, column and thin layer chromatographic and bio-assay techniques.3. Each of these prostaglandins is distributed throughout all regions of the central nervous system investigated (cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, medulla and pons, cortical white matter and spinal cord).4. This distribution suggests that the role of prostaglandins in the central nervous system is not confined to any specific region.
