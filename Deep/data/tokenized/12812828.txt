Using optical recording techniques, we examined whether nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the impairment of the activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons induced by mild heat stress. A temperature increase from 32 to 38 degrees C reversibly depressed the neuronal activity in hippocampal slices. L-Arginine (1 mM), an NO donor, enhanced the heat-induced depression of the activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons. N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, attenuated the inhibition of the neuronal activity induced by a temperature increase. Methylcobalamin (10 microM), a vitamin B(12) analogue that reduces NO production, reduced the heat-induced depression of the neuronal activity. These results suggest that NO contributes, at least in part, to the heat-induced depression of the neuronal activity in the hippocampal CA1 region.
