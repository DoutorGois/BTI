Bile duct ligation (BDL)-treated rats exhibit cholestasis and increased systemic and brain oxidative stress. Activation of NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are implicated as the pathogenetic mechanisms of brain dysfunction in BDL-treated adult rats. Young rats underwent sham ligation or BDL at day 17 for 2 or 4weeks. Treatment group rats were administered melatonin between day 17 and 45. We found a progressive increase in prefrontal cortex NADPH-dependent superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production and increased expression of NADPH oxidase subunits in either the prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus in BDL-treated young rats. In addition, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) genes were increased in either the prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus. Prefrontal cortex capillary junctional complex proteins expressions including occludin, claudin-5, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 and vascular endothelial cadherin were not altered. Melatonin lowered the prefrontal cortex NADPH-dependent O(2)(-) production and t-PA gene expression. We conclude that alterations in NADPH oxidase expression and BBB are involved in brain dysfunction in BDL-treated young rats. In addition, melatonin regulates NADPH oxidase activity and t-PA gene expression.
