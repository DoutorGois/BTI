The hippocampus plays a key role in learning and memory. The normal development and mature function of hippocampal networks supporting these cognitive functions depends on afferent cholinergic neurotransmission mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Whereas it is well-established that nicotinic receptors are present on GABAergic interneurons and on glutamatergic presynaptic terminals within the hippocampus, the ability of these receptors to mediate postsynaptic signaling in pyramidal neurons is not well understood. We use whole cell electrophysiology to show that heteromeric nicotinic receptors mediate direct inward currents, depolarization from rest and enhanced excitability in hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons of male mice. Measurements made throughout postnatal development provide a thorough developmental profile for these heteromeric nicotinic responses, which are greatest during the first 2 wk of postnatal life and decrease to low adult levels shortly thereafter. Pharmacological experiments show that responses are blocked by a competitive antagonist of alpha4beta2* nicotinic receptors and augmented by a positive allosteric modulator of alpha5 subunit-containing receptors, which is consistent with expression studies suggesting the presence of alpha4beta2 and alpha4beta2alpha5 nicotinic receptors within the developing CA1 pyramidal cell layer. These findings demonstrate that functional heteromeric nicotinic receptors are present on CA1 pyramidal neurons during a period of major hippocampal development, placing these receptors in a prime position to play an important role in the establishment of hippocampal cognitive networks.
