OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the protective characteristic of chlorogenic acid, a natural glucosyl xanthone found in Lonicera Japonica on the cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury and the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion model was built by blocking the left middle cerebral artery in rats by using the suture-occluded method. Before operation, the corresponding drugs were given for each group once a day for 7 days. After 1 h of final administration, the model was built, after operation, reperfusion was conducted for 22 h, Before the reperfusion 10 min tail vein injection of large, medium and small dose of chlorogenic acid and then mortality was calculated, and Neurological deficit score (NDS) was conducted, and serum was collected to measure the NSE level; a 2 mm thick brain slice located at the intersection of optic nerves was collected for TTC staining, and the percentage of cerebral infarction area was calculated; brain homogenate was collected to measure the ICAM-1, VCAM-1, EPO and HIF-1alpha levels in brain tissue of cerebral ischemia reperfusion rat models; NGF was detected using immunohistochemical method; the morphological changes in brain tissue was observed with HE staining. RESULTS: All focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion rat models were duplicated successfully. Every chlorogenic acid group with different dosage can significantly reduce the mortality, NDS and cerebral infarction area of rats, and significantly increase the EPO, HIF-1alpha and NGF levels in brain tissue; significantly improve the pathological lesions of hippocampus and cortex in brain tissue. CONCLUSION: The results showed that chlorogenic acid could protect the focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury rat models by adjusting the inflammatory factor, hypoxia factor and nerve growth factor.
