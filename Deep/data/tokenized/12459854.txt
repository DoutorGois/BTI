Microiontophoresis of delta sleep-inducing peptide primarily activated neurons in the dorsal hippocampus, anteroventral thalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, and sensorimotor cortex. Microiontophoretic administration of glutamate markedly enhanced neuronal activity, while preliminary microionophoresis of delta sleep-inducing peptide blocked the excitatory effect of glutamate on neurons in these brain structures.
