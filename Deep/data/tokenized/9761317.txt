This study compared temporal lobe epilepsy patients, along with kindled animals and self sustained limbic status epilepticus (SSLSE) rats for parallels in hippocampal AMPA and NMDA receptor subunit expression. Hippocampal sclerosis patients (HS), non-HS cases, and autopsies were studied for: hippocampal AMPA GluR1-3 and NMDAR1&2b mRNA levels using in situ hybridization: GluR1, GluR2/3, NMDAR1, and NMDAR2(a&b) immunoreactivity (IR); and neuron densities. Similarly, spontaneously seizing rats after SSLSE, kindled rats, and control animals were studied for: fascia dentata neuron densities: GluR1 and NMDAR2(a&b) IR; and neo-Timm's staining. In HS and non-HS cases, the mRNA hybridization densities per granule cell, as well as molecular layer IR, showed increased GluR1 (relative to GluR2/3) and increased NMDAR2b (relative to NMDAR1) compared to autopsies. Likewise, the molecular layer of SSLSE rats with spontaneous seizures demonstrated more neo-Timm's staining, and higher levels of GluR1 and NMDAR2(a&b) IR compared to kindled animals and controls. These results indicate that hippocampal AMPA and NMDA receptor subunit mRNAs and their proteins are differentially increased in association with spontaneous, but not kindled, seizures. Furthermore, there appears to be parallels in fascia dentata AMPA and NMDA receptor subunit expression between HS (and non-HS) epileptic patients and SSLSE rats. This finding supports the hypothesis that spontaneous seizures in humans and SSLSE rats involve differential alterations in hippocampal ionotrophic glutamate receptor subunits. Moreover, non-HS hippocampi were more like HS cases than hippocampi from kindled animals with respect to glutamate receptors; therefore, hippocampi from kindled rats do not accurately model human non-HS cases, despite some similarities in neuron densities and mossy fiber axon sprouting.
