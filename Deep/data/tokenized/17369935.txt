We studied the effect of delta sleep-inducing peptide on GABA receptors of hippocampal and cerebellar neurons in rats. It was shown that delta sleep-inducing peptide considerably and dose-dependently potentiates GABA-activated currents in these neurons and blocks NMDA-activated potentiation in cortical and hippocampal neurons. The peptide modulates activity of presynaptic NMDA receptors, which is seen from changes in (45)Ca(2+) uptake into synaptosomes of the brain cortex after uptake stimulation with glutamate and NMDA.
