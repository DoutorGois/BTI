Normal anatomic variation in the amount of fat within the petrous temporal bone of dogs can result in a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging pseudolesion. Focal hyperintense areas in the region of the hippocampus on T1-weighted, T1-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging sequences were noted in a dog being imaged for seizure activity. Further investigation of this region, aided by the use of cadaveric specimens, led to the identification of normal anatomic variability in the amount of fat in the substantia spongiosa of the petrous temporal bone. The presence of normal adipose tissue was confirmed histopathologically. Fat suppression MR imaging sequences can be used to differentiate whether hyperintensity ventral to the hippocampus is a result of a pathologic process, or fat in the substantia spongiosa of the petrous temporal bone.
