The lizard medial cortex, a region homologous to the mammalian dentate gyrus, shows postnatal neurogenesis and the surprising ability to replace its neurons after being lesioned specifically with the neurotoxin 3-acetylpyridine. As the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is expressed during neuronal migration and differentiation, we have studied its distribution in adult lizards and also during the lesion-regeneration process. In the medial cortex of control animals, many labeled fusiform somata, presumably corresponding to migratory neuroblasts, appeared in the inner plexiform layer. There were also scattered immunoreactive granule neurons in the cell layer. Double immunocytochemistry with 5'-bromodeoxyuridine revealed that some of the PSA-NCAM-expressing cells in the inner plexiform and cell layers were generated recently. PSA-NCAM immunoreactivity was also present in the dorsomedial, dorsal, and lateral cortices, as well as in the dorsal ventricular ridge, the nucleus accumbens, and the nucleus sphericus. Twelve hours after the injection of 3-acetylpyridine, some medial cortex granule neurons appeared degenerated, although some of them still expressed PSA-NCAM. One to 2 days after the injection, most granule neurons appeared degenerated and no PSA-NCAM immunoreactivity was detected in the medial cortex cell layer. Four to 7 days after treatment, abundant labeled fusiform cells populated the inner plexiform layer and some immunoreactive somata were seen in the cell layer. Fifteen to 30 days after the neurotoxin injection, the number of PSA-NCAM expressing granule neurons augmented considerably and the level was still above control levels in lizards that survived 42 days. Our results show for the first time the expression of PSA-NCAM in a reptile brain, where it appears to participate in the migration and differentiation of granule neurons during adult neurogenesis and regeneration.
