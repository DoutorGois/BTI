The influence of bradykinin and kallikrein on the levels of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) as well as the influence of bradykinin on the levels of normetanephrine, homovanillic (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic (5-HIAA) acids were investigated in different parts of the brain (cerebellum, corpus striatum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, medulla oblongata and midbrain). Kinins decrease the levels of NA and DA and their metabolites, and increase the level of 5-HT and 5-HIAA, expecially in corpus striatum and hypothalamus. The results of these investigations correlate with previously reported behavioural effects of kinins.
