We investigated the effect of dietary vitamin E on lipofuscin accumulation with age in the hippocampus, the inferior olive and the cerebellum of young (3-5 months old) middle-aged (12-14 months old) and old (24-26 months old) male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were fed either a vitamin E-deficient diet, vitamin E-supplemented diet or a control diet after reaching four weeks old. We employed both quantitative light microscopy using semithin sections and qualitative fluorescence microscopy for the analysis of lipofuscin accumulation with age. The concentrations of alpha-tocopherol were measured simultaneously in both the plasma and the three brain regions investigated. The effect of vitamin E deficiency was statistically significant only in the inferior olive of young rats and in all the three brain regions of middle-aged rats. The effect of vitamin E supplementation was statistically significant in all three brain regions of middle-aged rats. There was no statistically significant effect of vitamin E deficiency or supplementation on lipofuscin accumulation with age as compared with the control rats in all three brain regions of old rats. It was thus revealed that dietary vitamin E clearly had a significant effect on lipofuscin accumulation with age in the rat brain up until middle age, and that the same effect became indistinct in the latter half of their life.
