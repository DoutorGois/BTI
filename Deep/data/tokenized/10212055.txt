Spatial and non-spatial learning of mice with an incorporated antisense RNA complementary to a fragment of cDNA coding for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were evaluated in allocentric and egocentric radial maze and water maze tasks, and in spontaneous object recognition and sensorimotor learning paradigms. Mice with impaired GR function did not acquire two maze paradigms based on allocentric spatial navigation, radial maze non-matching to position and water maze spatial discrimination learning. Comparison of performance in spaced and massed trials indicated that this may be due to a general inability to store information into allocentric reference memory or in retrieval processes. However, both groups of animals learned the rules of an egocentric radial maze task at similar rates and there was no difference in their ability to recognise objects once animals had equal opportunity to explore the sample objects. Sensorimotor performance was impaired in transgenic animals, but it is suggested that this is due to non-specific factors rather than to disrupted sensorimotor learning per se. These results are consistent with a disruption of hippocampal function. Histological examination of the hippocampus revealed no obvious structural abnormalities in transgenic animals. Therefore, the data suggest that functional underactivity of GRs at the level of the hippocampus induces a deficit in allocentric navigation while sparing egocentric navigation and object recognition.
