T-type voltage-dependent calcium channel has central roles in neuronal burst firing. The alpha1G subunit of T-type channel has been recently cloned and we here reported a cellular distribution of the alpha1G by in situ hybridization in adult rat brain and spinal cord. The cells expressing alpha1G were widely distributed in the central nervous system. The distribution seemed to be restricted to neurons, and exhibited a specific pattern in the cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
