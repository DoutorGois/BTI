Semliki Forest virus (SFV), an enveloped alphavirus of the family Togaviridae, infects a wide range of mammalian host cells. Most strains are neurotropic but differ in virulence. The authors took advantage of the nonpathogenic properties of SFV strain A7(74), cloned recently in their laboratory, and constructed a replication-proficient expression vector to target the central nervous system (CNS) for heterologous gene expression. The vector, termed VA7, was engineered to drive expression of foreign inserts through a second subgenomic promoter inserted in the viral 3' nontranslated region (NTR). Infectious virus was obtained by in vitro transcription and transfection into BHK cells, and was shown to direct synthesis of heterologous proteins in several mammalian cell lines. Although novel expression vehicle is not applicable for targeting specific cell populations within the CNS in its present form, in cultured rat hippocampal slices, VA7 encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) efficiently transduced pyramidal cells, interneurons, and glial cells. With prolonged time post infection, the number of EGFP-expressing neurons in hippocampal slices increased. Mice infected intraperitoneally with the recombinant virus remained completely asymptomatic but showed CNS expression of EGFP as evidenced by immunohistochemistry. SFV A7(74) is a nonintegrating virus, which gives rise to a randomly distributed, patchy infection of the adult CNS that is cleared within 10 days. With the advantage of noninvasive administration, the expression vector described in this work is thus applicable for short-term gene expression in the CNS.
