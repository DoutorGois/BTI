BACKGROUND: Febrile seizures are the most common seizure disorder in childhood, associated with a significant rise in body temperature. However, post-infectious refractory afebrile form of seizures in previously healthy children is being increasingly recognized in around the world, which evolves into a chronic refractory form of epilepsy. The term 'Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome' (FIRES) has been proposed for these conditions and represents a refractory severe post-infectious epileptic condition in previously normal children. CASE REPORT: We report the initial and follow-up MR imaging findings in a 5year-old with refractory epilepsy post-febrile seizures. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, acute post-infectious seizures are increasingly being recognized across the globe with the newly coined term 'Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome'(FIRES) for this group of immune-mediated epileptic encephalopathy in previously healthy children. This has three phases: episode of simple febrile infection, followed by acute refractory seizures and lastly the chronic phase of neuropsychological impairments and seizures.
