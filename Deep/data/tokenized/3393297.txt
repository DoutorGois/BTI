Rabbits were injected intracerebrally with aluminum salt leading to experimental neurofibrillary change formation as a model of Alzheimer neurofibrillary change. Eleven days after the injection, the brain tissues were excised from the cortex, hippocampus, and cervical region of spinal cord. Five lysosomal enzymes (cathepsin D, beta-glucuronidase, acid phosphatase, acid DNase, alkaline DNase) were assayed and compared with the control. Cathepsin D, acid DNase and beta-glucuronidase activities increased significantly in all 3 areas of aluminum-injected brain. On the other hand, acid phosphatase and alkaline DNase activities remained at the same level. The results showed the lysosomal enzymes did not change in parallel after aluminum administration, suggesting a role of the increased enzymes in the brain with neurofibrillary changes.
