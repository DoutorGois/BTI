Accelerating hippocampal sprouting by making unilateral progressive lesions of the entorhinal cortex spared the spatial memory of rats tested for retention of a learned alternation task. Subsequent transection of the sprouted crossed temporodentate pathway (CTD), as well as a simultaneous CTD transection and progressive entorhinal lesion, produced a persistent deficit on the memory task. These results suggest that CTD sprouting, which is homologous to the original perforant path input to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, is behaviorally significant and can ameliorate at least some of the memory deficits associated with hippocampal deafferentation.
