By virtue of its capacity to prevent apoptosis the protooncogene bcl-2 is believed to play a crucial role in CNS development. Studies in rodents have shown that the anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 protein is widely expressed during CNS development, but undergoes a marked down-regulation during maturation and is present only at low concentrations in adult CNS. In contrast, current data suggest that Bcl-2 protein in adult monkey brain results from microglial expression. In the present immunohistochemical study, however, numerous subsets of Bcl-2-immunoreactive neurons were encountered in the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, limbic cortices and striatum of squirrel monkeys. Of particular interest was the presence in the basal portion of the amygdala and adjoining piriform cortex of numerous intensely immunoreactive cells with long and thick immunopositive processes that ran into the ventral amygdalofugal pathway. At striatal level Bcl-2-positive neurons were strictly confined to calbindin-poor striosomes, which are specifically innervated by limbic cortices. This study has provided the first evidence for the occurrence of Bcl-2 in mature monkey brain. It has further shown that this protein is preferentially expressed in limbic structures in primate forebrain. The sustained expression of this anti-apoptosis protein may protect limbic system neurons from various injuries or neurodegeneration. It may also be involved in the functional and structural changes that occur throughout adulthood in some regions of the primate limbic system.
