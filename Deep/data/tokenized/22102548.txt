Recent investigations have shown that the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a region thought to be exclusive to episodic memory, can also influence performance on tests of semantic memory. The present study examined further the nature of MTL contributions to semantic memory tasks by tracking MTL activation as participants performed category fluency, a traditional test of semantic retrieval. For categories that were inherently autobiographical (e.g. names of friends), the MTLs were activated throughout the time period in which items were generated, consistent with the MTLs role in retrieving autobiographical memories. For categories that could not benefit from autobiographical or spatial/context information (e.g. governmental offices), the MTL was not implicated at any time point. For categories for which both prototypical and episodically-related information exists (e.g. kitchen utensils), there was more robust MTL activity for the open-ended, late generation periods compared with the more well-defined, early item generation time periods. We interpret these results as suggesting that early in the generation phase, responses are based on well-rehearsed prototypical knowledge whereas later performance relies more on open-ended strategies, such as deriving exemplars from personally relevant contextual information (e.g. imagining one's own kitchen). These findings and interpretation were consistent with the results of an initial, separate behavioral study (Expt 1), that used the distinctiveness of responses as a measure of open-endedness across the generation phase: Response distinctiveness corresponded to the predicted open-endedness of the various tasks at early and late phases. Overall, this is consistent with the view that as generation of semantic information becomes open-ended, it recruits processes from other domains, such as episodic memory, to support performance.
