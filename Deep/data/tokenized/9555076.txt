Understanding mechanisms of estrogen effects on cognition is critical for designing therapies for post-menopausal women and others with dementia. Hippocampus, an area important to cognitive function, responds robustly on estrogen. ERbeta and ERalpha transcripts were detected in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of an ovariectomized female monkey at a relatively high ERbeta/ERalpha ratio. These results suggest that ERbeta may play a role in mediating estrogen effects in the primate hippocampus and hypothalamus.
