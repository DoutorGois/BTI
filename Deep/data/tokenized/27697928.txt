The axon initial segment (AIS) is enriched in specific adaptor, cytoskeletal, and transmembrane molecules. During AIS establishment, a membrane diffusion barrier is formed between the axonal and somatodendritic domains. Recently, an axonal periodic pattern of actin, spectrin, and ankyrin forming 190-nm-spaced, ring-like structures has been discovered. However, whether this structure is related to the diffusion barrier function is unclear. Here, we performed single-particle tracking time-course experiments on hippocampal neurons during AIS development. We analyzed the mobility of lipid-anchored molecules by high-speed single-particle tracking and correlated positions of membrane molecules with the nanoscopic organization of the AIS cytoskeleton. We observe a strong reduction in mobility early in AIS development. Membrane protein motion in the AIS plasma membrane is confined to a repetitive pattern of approximately 190-nm-spaced segments along the AIS axis as early as day in vitro 4, and this pattern alternates with actin rings. Mathematical modeling shows that diffusion barriers between the segments significantly reduce lateral diffusion along the axon.
