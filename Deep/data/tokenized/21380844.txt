Due to controversy about the involvement of Dync1h1 mutation in pathogenesis of motor neuron disease, we investigated expression of tau protein in transgenic hybrid mice with Dync1h1 (so-called Cra1/+), SOD1G93A (SOD1/+), double (Cra1/SOD1) mutations and wild-type controls. Total tau-mRNA and isoforms 0, 1 and 2 N expression was studied in frontal cortex, hippocampus, spinal cord and cerebellum of presymptomatic and symptomatic animals (age 70, 140 and 365 days). The most significant differences were found in brain cortex and cerebellum, but not in hippocampus and spinal cord. There were less changes in Cra1/SOD1 double heterozygotes compared to mice harboring single mutations. The differences in total tau expression and in profile of its isoforms between Cra1/+ and SOD1/+ transgenics indicate a distinct pathogenic entity of these two conditions.
