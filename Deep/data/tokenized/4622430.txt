Although the entorhinal cortex is a major contributor of afferents to the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, knowledge of its own afferents has been vague. Regions of both the frontal and temporal lobes were found to contribute afferents to this region of the brain. These afferents form probable multisynaptic links in pathways connecting the classical sensory areas of the cortex and the limbic system.
