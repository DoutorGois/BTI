The relation between blood pressure and cognitive performance was assessed in the spatial navigation task. Spatial learning by rats with spontaneous hypertension (SHR) and Goldblatt renal hypertension (RHR) was compared with that of normotensive Wistar rats (NR). The task required the rats to escape from water by finding a submerged and hidden platform. It was found that SHR rats showed improved learning capacity in the maze task in acquisition compared to the RHR and NR groups already on Day 1 and Day 2. The performances of all tested groups reached almost similar asymptotic level on Day 4 and in the probe trial on Day 5. After a reversal training the SHR rats did not show preference to swim in the new platform position quadrant. The present results confirm earlier reports on different behavioural characteristics associated with hypertension.
