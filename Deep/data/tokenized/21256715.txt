We describe seizure laterality and temporal seizure patterns in six subjects with bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (bTLE) implanted with bilateral hippocampal depth electrodes and the NeuroPace RNS system over 84 consecutive days. Seizures were disproportionate in laterality in three subjects and disproportionate in time for two subjects. Clustering of seizures did not clearly affect laterality. Some but not all subjects with bTLE displayed nonrandom temporal or lateral clustering of seizures.
