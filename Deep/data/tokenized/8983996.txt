Calcium currents in CA1 neurons from rat hippocampus were studied with the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. Under control conditions high-voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents activated from membrane potentials of -80 mV and -40 mV underwent "run-down". The rate of run-down of the current activated from -40 mV was significantly attenuated by inclusion of the G-protein activator NaF (1 mM) in the pipette and also irreversibly attenuated by brief batch application of NaF (10 mM). This effect was significantly reduced by inclusion of high (10 mM) ethyleneglycoltetraacetate (EGTA) concentrations in the pipette, suggesting an involvement of calcium-dependent processes. It is suggested that activation of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins by NaF leads to a long-lasting attenuation of HVA calcium current run-down in hippocampal CA1 cells.
