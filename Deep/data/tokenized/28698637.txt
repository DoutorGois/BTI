The hippocampus is important for spatial navigation, episodic memory and affective behaviour. Increasing evidence suggests that these multiple functions are accomplished by different segments along the dorsal-ventral (septal-temporal) axis. Long-term potentiation (LTP), the best-investigated cellular correlate of learning and memory, has distinct properties along this axis in the CA1 region, but so far, little is known about longitudinal differences in dentate gyrus (DG). Therefore, here we examined potential dorsoventral differences in DG-LTP using in vitro multi-electrode array recordings. In young mice, we found higher basal synaptic transmission in the dorsal DG, while the LTP magnitude markedly increased towards the ventral pole. Strikingly, these differences were greatly reduced in slices from middle-aged mice. Short-term plasticity, evaluated by paired-pulse ratios, was similar across groups. Recordings in the presence and absence of GABAA-receptor blocker picrotoxin suggested a higher inhibitory tone in the ventral DG of young mice, confirmed by an increased frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Our findings support the view that the hippocampus contains discrete functional domains along its dorsoventral axis and demonstrate that these are subject to age-dependent changes. Since these characteristics are presumably conserved in the human hippocampus, our findings have important clinical implications for hippocampus- and age-related disorders.
