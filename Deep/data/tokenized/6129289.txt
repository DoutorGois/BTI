Effects of diazepam and gamma-aminobutyric acid-related compounds on the release of [(1)(4)C]cysteine sulfinate and [(3)H]glutamate from preloaded hippocampal slices of rat brain were examined by a superfusion method. Diazepam markedly inhibited the release of cysteine sulfinate and glutamate evoked either by high K(+) or veratridine without affecting that of other neurotransmitter candidates, e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and dopamine; IC(5)(0) values for the release of cysteine sulfinate and glutamate were about 20 and 7 muM, respectively. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (1 to 10 muM) and muscimol (100 muM) significantly reduced high K(+)-stimulated release of glutamate. Bicuculline, which had no effect on the release at a concentration of 50 muM by itself, antagonized the inhibitory effects of diazepam and gamma-aminobutyric acid on glutamate release. Similar results were obtained with the release of cysteine sulfinate except that a high concentration (100 muM) of gamma-aminobutyric acid was required for the inhibition. These results indicate the modulation by gamma-aminobutyric acid innervation of the release of excitatory amino acids in rat hippocampal formation, and also suggest that some of the pharmacological effects of diazepam may be a consequence of inhibition of excitatory amino acid transmission.
