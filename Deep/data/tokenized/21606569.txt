The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is the major genetic risk factor for the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas the presence of the APOE epsilon2 allele seems to confer protection. Here, we report that healthy young APOE epsilon4 carriers have statistically significantly smaller hippocampal volumes than APOE epsilon2 carriers, while no differences were detected between the two groups in memory performance. The difference in hippocampal morphology is cognitively/clinically silent in young adulthood, but could render APOE epsilon4 carriers more prone to the later development of AD possibly due to lower reserve cognitive capacity.
