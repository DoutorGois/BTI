The behavioral effects of lesions in the basal forebrain (BF) of rats were evaluated using two tasks. The BF lesions included both the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) and the medial septal area (MSA). The first task was a Stone maze, which has 14 consecutive choice points and is a task of complex, trial-independent memory. BF lesions did not impair choice accuracy in this task. The second task was a win-shift spatial discrimination in a radial arm maze, which requires trial-dependent memory. BF lesions produced a significant decrease in choice accuracy in this task. These results demonstrate that BF lesions impair trial-dependent (working) memory but not trial-independent reference memory, and that task difficulty is not the sole factor determining whether BF lesions produce behavioral impairments.
