Early maternal separation (MS) may produce lasting effects in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) that can change its response to chronic stress in adulthood. Chronic stress affects DH morphology and function, but tianeptine (an anti-depressant) can reverse the stress-induced morphological impairments. Morphologic alterations of hippocampus can affect contextual memory. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of tianeptine in MS and chronically stressed rats on: 1) volume of the DH and its areas using stereology and 2) hippocampal-dependent memory using a fear conditioning test. Male Wistar rats were subjected to daily MS for 4.5 h between postnatal days (PND) 1-21, or to animal facility rearing (AFR). Between (PND) days 50 and 74, rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable stress and were treated daily with tianeptine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle, providing eight groups: AFR-unstressed/vehicle (n = 5 for stereology, n = 18 for fear conditioning test); AFR unstressed/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10); AFR-chronic stress/vehicle (n = 6 and n = 14); AFR-chronic stress/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10), MS-unstressed/vehicle (n = 5 and n = 19), MS-unstressed/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10), MS-chronic stress/vehicle (n = 6 and n = 18), and MS-chronic stress/tianeptine (n = 6 and n = 10). MS-chronic stress/tianeptine rats showed a diminished CA1 area than the corresponding MS-unstressed/tianeptine rats. The combination of stressors produced a freezing response similar to those of the control group during postconditioning. During retrieval, MS led to a diminished freezing response compared to the AFR-unstressed groups. Tianeptine had no effect on freezing behavior. Our results show that tianeptine can affect the CA1 area volume differently depending on the nature and quantity of stressors but cannot alter freezing to context.
