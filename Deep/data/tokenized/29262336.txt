Although much progress has been made in understanding type II theta rhythm generation under urethane anesthesia, less is known about the mechanisms underlying type I theta generation during active exploration. To better understand the contributions of cholinergic and NMDA receptor activation to type I theta generation, we recorded hippocampal theta oscillations from freely moving mice with local infusion of cholinergic or NMDA receptor antagonists to either the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex (EC). We found that cholinergic receptors in the hippocampus, but not the EC, and NMDA receptors in the EC, but not the hippocampus, are critical for open-field theta generation and Y-maze performance. We further found that muscarinic M1 receptors located on pyramidal neurons, but not interneurons, are critical for cholinergic modulation of hippocampal synapses, theta generation, and Y-maze performance. These results suggest that hippocampus and EC neurons recruit cholinergic-dependent and NMDA-receptor-dependent mechanisms, respectively, to generate theta oscillations to support behavioral performance.
