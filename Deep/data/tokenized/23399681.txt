Peroxizome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is highly expressed in the central nervous system where it modulates numerous gene transcriptions. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression could be modified by simulation of PPARgamma which in turn activates nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylyl-cyclase (sGC)/cyclic guanosine mono phosphate (cGMP) pathway. It is well known that NO/cGMP pathway possesses pivotal role in the development of opioid dependence and this study is aimed to investigate the effect of PPARgamma stimulation on opioid dependence in mice as well as human glioblastoma cell line. Pioglitazone potentiated naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome in morphine dependent mice in vivo. While selective inhibition of PPARgamma, neuronal NOS or GC could reverse the pioglitazone-induced potentiation of morphine withdrawal signs; sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor amplified its effect. We also showed that nitrite levels in the hippocampus were significantly elevated in pioglitazone-treated morphine dependent mice. In the human glioblastoma (U87) cell line, rendered dependent to morphine, cAMP levels did not show any alteration after chronic pioglitazone administration while cGMP measurement revealed a significant rise. We were unable to show a significant alteration in neuronal NOS mRNA expressions by pioglitazone in mice hippocampus or U87 cells. Our results suggest that pioglitazone has the ability to enhance morphine-dependence and to augment morphine withdrawal signs. The possible pathway underlying this effect is through activation of NO/GC/cGMP pathway.
