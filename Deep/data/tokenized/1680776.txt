Repeated injections of piracetam (400 mg/kg, i.p. once a day for 15 days) to 16-month old rats led to an improved performance on an 8-arm radial maze, used as a test for spatial learning. This effect was accompanied by a greater ability of excitatory amino acids (ibotenate and glutamate) to stimulate [3H]inositol-monophosphate formation in hippocampal slices incubated in the presence of 10 mM Li+. Repeated administration of piracetam did not induce changes in excitatory amino acid-stimulated polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis in hippocampal slices prepared from 2-month old animals.
