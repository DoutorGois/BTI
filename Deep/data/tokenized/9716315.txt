Trimipramine has been classified as an atypical tricyclic antidepressant, because only weak inhibitory effects on serotonin and/or noradrenaline reuptake have been found. Since some antidepressive drugs (e.g. imipramine) and other agents used in the treatment of affective disorders (e.g. carbamazepine) modulate neuronal calcium channels, trimipramine was tested on field potential changes (fp) in the low Mg2+-model of epilepsy which has been shown to be affected by calcium antagonists. Trimipramine reduced the frequency of occurrence of fp in a dose dependent manner (5-100 microM). The threshold concentration of trimipramine which did not decrease the firing rate was approximately 1 microM. Simultaneous application of subthreshold concentrations (2 microM) of the organic calcium antagonist verapamil with trimipramine decreased the firing rate to 37.0+/-22.7% (means+/-SEM, n=7) with respect to baseline values. In contrast, no additive effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists and trimipramine were observed. In conclusion, the data suggests that the antidepressive effects observed with trimipramine treatment may be due to its inhibitory action on neuronal calcium channels.
