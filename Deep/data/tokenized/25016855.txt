OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression of p-p38 MAPK protein and the number of astrocytes expressing p-p38 MAPK in CA1 hippocampus in rats during the induction of brain ischemic tolerance induced by intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (IH) preconditioning. METHODS: Thirty healthy adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 5 in each group): sham 0 min group, IH + sham 0 min group, sham 7 d group, IH + sham 7 d group, Ischemia (Is) 7 d group, and IH + Is 7 d group. Neuropathological evaluation was performed by thionine staining in CA1 hippocampus in rats. The expression of p-p38 MAPK in CA1 hippocampus was observed by immunohistochemical staining. And the number of astrocytes expressing p-p38 MAPK was observed by immunofluorescent double labeling. RESULTS: The results showed that IH preconditioning induced brain ischemic tolerance successfully. At the same time, IH preconditioning obviously up-regulated the expression of p-p38 MAPK protein in CA1 hippocampus, and also increased the number of astrocytes expressing p-p38 MAPK. CONCLUSION: It might be concluded that IH preconditioning induced brain ischemic tolerance by up-regulating the expression of p-p38 MAPK protein in pyramidal neurones and astrocytes.
