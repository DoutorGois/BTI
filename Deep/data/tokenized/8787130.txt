The peptide YY derivatives [Leu31,Pro34]PYY and PYY3-36 are highly selective Y1 and Y2 agonists, devoid of activity on the Y3 receptor subtype [Dumont et al. (1994) Molec. Brain Res., 26:3220-3324]. These selective ligands were iodinated and used to evaluate the respective quantitative autoradiographic distribution of the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes in the rat brain, excluding a potential contamination from Y3 receptor. Specific [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY (Y1), and [125I]PYY3-36 (Y2) binding sites are detected in various brain regions, but each showed a differential distribution profile. Y1/[125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY sites are especially concentrated in superficial layers of the cortex, the olfactory tubercle, islands of Calleja, tenia tecta, molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, several thalamic nuclei, and the posterior part of the medial mammaliary nucleus. These areas generally contained only low densities of Y2/[125I]PYY3-36 binding sites. In contrast, [125I]PYY3-36 binding is most abundant in multiple other regions including the lateral septum, piriform cortex, triangular septal nucleus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, oriens layer and stratum radiatum of the dorsal hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, dorsal raphe nucleus, and the granular cell layer of the cerebellum. Few areas of the rat brain contained significant amounts of both [125I][Leu31,Pro34]PYY and [125I]PYY3-36 binding sites such as the anterior olfactory nuclei, oriens layer and stratum radiatum of the ventral hippocampus, nucleus tractus solitarius, area postrema, and inferior olive. Taken together, these results and the use of two selective radioligands demonstrate further the discrete, differential distribution of the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes in the rat brain.
