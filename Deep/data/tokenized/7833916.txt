Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is accompanied by varying degrees of mental retardation. The molecular basis for this is unknown, although at least four dystrophin transcripts regulated by specific promoters and undergoing elaborate splicing control are present in brain areas associated with cognitive function. In muscle the absence of dystrophin causes instability of a dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) linking the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix; this disruption is accompanied by muscle necrosis. The laminin-binding component of DAPC, dystroglycan, in contrast to other components of DAPC, has been found in brain homogenates. This suggests that the link between the membrane cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix mediated by dystrophin-dystroglycan may play a functional role in brain. We have cloned a mouse dystroglycan partial cDNA and have mapped this gene in the mouse to chromosome 9. Further, in situ hybridisation to mouse brain sections shows that the dystroglycan gene is expressed in relatively few structures and co-localises with dystrophin mRNA in hippocampus, dentate gyrus, olfactory bulb and Purkinje neurons but, surprisingly, not in the cortex. Dystroglycan is also expressed in those brain areas where the dystrophin-related protein (utrophin) is present. Our results provide a basis for a future characterisation of the role of dystrophin-dystroglycan association in the brain.
