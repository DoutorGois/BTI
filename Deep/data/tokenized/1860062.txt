Hippocampal mossy fiber zinc was examined in mice selectively bred for differences in susceptibility to handling-induced convulsions during ethanol withdrawal. The density of mossy fiber zinc in the CA3 stratum lucidum was significantly decreased in the duplicate lines of untreated withdrawal seizure prone (WSP) mice compared to untreated withdrawal seizure resistant (WSR) mice. Mossy fiber zinc densities in randomly bred control lines of mice (WSC) were intermediate to WSP and WSR mice. Serum, whole brain and whole hippocampal zinc were not significantly different between WSP and WSR mice, indicating that the reduction in the chelatable pool of hippocampal mossy fiber zinc was not a consequence of deficits in brain or whole body zinc nutrition. A highly significant correlation between hippocampal mossy fiber zinc density and handling-induced convulsion indices suggests that a reduction in mossy fiber zinc may be one contributing factor in the expression of seizure susceptibility in WSP mice.
