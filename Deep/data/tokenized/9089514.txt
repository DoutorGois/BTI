This paper summarizes experiments showing that the direct excitatory glutamergic pathway projecting from area CA1 and subiculum to the prefrontal cortex in the rat express a long-lasting NMDA receptor-dependent form of LTP that can be induced for several days in the freely-moving rat. Other experiments examined its functional significance in learning and the role of dopamine in the regulation of hippocampal-prefrontal cortex plasticity.
