The purpose of this study was to develop three new radiotracers, 1-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4-([(11)C/(18)F]substituted-phenyl)piperidin-1-yl-2-oxo-1,2 -dihydropyridine-3-carbonitrile ([(11)C]1, [(11)C]2, and [(18)F]4), and to examine their specific bindings with metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 (mGluR2) in rat brain sections by using in vitro autoradiography. These compounds were found to possess potent in vitro binding affinities (Ki: 8.0-34.1nM) for mGluR2 in rat brain homogenate. [(11)C]1, [(11)C]2, and [(18)F]4 were synthesized by [(11)C/(18)F]alkylation of the corresponding phenol precursors with [(11)C]methyl iodide or [(18)F]fluoroethyl bromide with >98% radiochemical purity and 80-130GBq/mumol specific activity at the end of synthesis. In vitro autoradiography indicated that these radiotracers showed heterogeneous specific bindings in mGluR2-rich brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and granular layer of the cerebellum.
