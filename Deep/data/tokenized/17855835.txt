OBJECTIVE: Assess the effect of antioxidant treatment on late memory impairment and early hippocampus oxidative stress after cecal ligation and perforation. SUBJECTS: Male Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS: Rats underwent sham operation or cecal ligation and perforation. Animals that underwent cecal ligation and perforation were divided into groups: 1) treated with basic support (50 mL/kg saline, 30 mg/kg ceftriaxone, and 25 mg/kg clindamycin every 6 hrs), 2) treated with basic support plus N-acetylcysteine (20 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hrs after cecal ligation and perforation), 3) treated with basic support plus deferoxamine (20 mg/kg deferoxamine at 3 and 24 hrs after cecal ligation and perforation), 4) treated with basic support plus N-acetylcysteine and deferoxamine, or 5) treated with N-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On days 10 and 30 after surgery, the animals underwent behavioral tasks: inhibitory avoidance task, habituation to an open field, and continuous multiple-trials step-down inhibitory avoidance task. The sepsis group showed significantly decreased performance in latency retention compared with the sham group in the inhibitory avoidance task. In the open-field task, the sepsis group presented memory impairment after sepsis. In the continuous multiple-trials step-down inhibitory avoidance task, the sepsis group showed a significant increase in the number of training trials required to reach the acquisition criterion. All these memory impairments were prevented by N-acetylcysteine plus deferoxamine treatment, but not its isolate use. In addition, the combined use of antioxidants attenuated oxidative damage in hippocampus 6 hrs after sepsis induction. CONCLUSIONS: Antioxidant treatment prevented the development of late cognitive deficits in an animal model of sepsis.
