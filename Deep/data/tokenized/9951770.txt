The study provides a review of the basic examination procedures and results of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) in patients suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). The source of seizures in MTLE is most often an epileptogenic focus secondary to hippocampal sclerosis. 1H MRS currently plays an important role in the non-invasive diagnosis of this type of epileptogenic lesion. The decisive 1H MRS parameter characterizing an epileptogenic lesion is a statistically significantly decreased value of N-acetylaspartate levels compared with control values, most often associated with a decrease in the ratios of the intensities of NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho and NAA/(Cr + Cho) signals. Moreover, MRS makes it possible to distinguish bilateral involvement of mesial temporal structures typically associated with a bilateral decrease in the levels of metabolites and/or their ratios. As regards other metabolic compounds which play an important role in the pathobiochemistry of epilepsy, MRS is employed to study the action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), inositol, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate, the clinical function of which has not been fully clarified as yet. It is in this context that one should consider the application of 1H MRS in evaluating the action of some new anti-epileptic agents affecting excitatory and inhibitory amino acids. There is no doubt that in vivo 1H MRS, along with other imaging methods, has made a significant contribution to the clinical and biochemical description of epileptic seizures and has assumed a prominent position among the techniques of pre-operative examination in epileptic surgery.
