In the present investigation, anti-nociceptive effects of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (NAChR) ligands, (+)- and (-)-nicotine, cytisine, methylcarbamylcholine (MCC), dimethylphenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP), and (+/-)-epibatidine were evaluated in the rat tail-flick assay both after subcutaneous (s.c.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration. The pharmacology of the tail-flick response to NAChR ligands after s.c. and i.c.v. routes was similar. Epibatidine was the most potent ligand examined with a longer duration of action than any other agonist. (-)-Nicotine was more active than (+)-nicotine indicating stereospecificity. ICV administration studies indicated an apparent partial agonist activity for (+)-nicotine in the tail-flick response. Tail-flick responses to NAChR agonists are independent of opioid and muscarinic pathways and appear to be mediated both by central and peripheral NAChR recognition sites. Central administration of MCC activates both NAChR and muscarinic anti-nociceptive mechanisms. Studies employing the alpha-adrenergic receptor alkylating agent, phenoxybenzamine or the noradrenergic neurotoxin, N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4), suggested that the NAChR-noradrenergic and NAChR-serotoninergic interactions play an important role in the tail-flick response. Studies employing a selective alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive NAChR receptor antagonist, methyllycaconitine (MLA), suggested a minimal role for these receptors in the tail-flick response. The biochemical studies also indicated that a sub-population of NAChR receptors are located pre-synaptically on noradrenergic and/or serotoninergic pathways in the hippocampus.
