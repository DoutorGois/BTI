Subtracted cDNA libraries from the mouse developing inferior colliculus were previously constructed between postnatal day (P) 6 and 10. In the P10-P6 subtracted library, neuroleukin, calmodulin I, cortactin, and Rho7 were identified. The goal of the present study was to analyze their distribution, at the mRNA and protein levels, in both the adult and the developing mouse brain. The four molecules showed a wide expression throughout the brain, with a neuronal-enriched localization in structures such as the cortex, the hippocampus, the cerebellum, and the inferior colliculus. The level of expression of their corresponding mRNAs increased during brain postnatal development. The expression of these molecules was also investigated 2 weeks after a mechanical lesion in the adult cerebral cortex. Neuroleukin and cortactin were found to be expressed by reactive astrocytes, while there were no changes in the expression of calmodulin and Rho7. The expression of neuroleukin, calmodulin, cortactin, and Rho7 is discussed in the context of their putative role in the maturation of the brain and in the axonal regeneration process.
