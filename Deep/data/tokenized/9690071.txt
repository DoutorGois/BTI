It was shown that the content of serotonin (5-OT) and 5-oxyindoleacetic acid (5-OIAA) in the temporal cortex, hippocampus and medulla oblongata and the content of dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenilacetic acid in the striatum are increased initially, while the level of norepinephrine in the striatum is reduced in Krushinskii-Molodkina rats genetically predisposed to audiogenic epilepsy in comparison with Wistar rats. Carbamazepine levelled out the changes in the 5-OT and 5-OIAA levels at the peak of the audiogenic attack in the temporal cortex and hippocampus, causing at the same time a sum increase in the content of all monoamines and their metabolites in the medulla oblongata and striatum.
