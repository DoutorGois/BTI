Stimulation of glucocorticoid or beta-adrenergic receptors (BAR) has been shown to increase nerve growth factor (NGF) biosynthesis in adult rat brain. Little is known about the role of these receptors in the regulation of NGF expression in neonatal and aged brain. We have examined the effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) and the BAR agonist clenbuterol (CLE) on the levels of NGF mRNA in neonatal (8 day old), adult (3 month old) and aged (24 month old) rats. By 3 h, DEX (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) evoked a comparable increase in NGF mRNA in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in both 8-day and 3-month-old rats. In contrast, CLE (10 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to change NGF mRNA levels in neonatal rats, while increasing (2-3-fold) NGF mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex of adult rats. In 24-month-old rats, both DEX and CLE elicited only a modest increase in NGF mRNA. This increase was, however, anatomically and temporally similar to that observed in adult animals. The weak effect of DEX or CLE was not related to a down-regulation of receptor function because both DEX and CLE were able to elicit a comparable increase in the mRNA levels for basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) in neonatal, adult and aged rat brain. Our data demonstrate that induction of NGF expression by neurotransmitter/hormone receptor activation varies throughout life and suggest that pharmacological agents might be useful tools to enhance trophic support in aging.
