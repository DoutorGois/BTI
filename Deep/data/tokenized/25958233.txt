Transient receptor potential canonical channel (TRPC) is a nonselective cation channel dominantly permeable to Ca(2+). It consists of seven homologues, TRPC1-TRPC7, based on their sequence similarity. According to some researches, the expression of TRPC3/5 in hippocampus is related to the morphological changes of hippocampus, including axon length and dendritic spine density [1]. This study observed whether the expression of TRPC3/5 was changed in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression of rat model and can the altered TRPC3/5 expression affect the morphology of neurons in hippocampus of depressive rats as well as the cognitive ability. A total of 16 rats were equally and randomly divided into two groups: the control group and the depression model group, which underwent a process of CUS for three weeks. Western blot assay was conducted to test the content of TRPC3/5 in hippocampus, and Golgi-Cox staining was used to observe the morphological changes of neurons in hippocampus. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to observe the changes of spatial cognitive ability of rats while the long-term potentiation was applied to evaluate synaptic plasticity. Results showed that there was a difference in the expression of TRPC3/5 in hippocampal neurons, as well as the neuron morphology between control group and depression model group. At the same time the cognitive ability and synaptic plasticity were significantly changed. Results suggest that there is an association between expressions of TRPC3/5 and cognitive changes in CUS rat model, and the mechanism maybe that the different expressions of TRPC3/5 can cause morphological changes of the neurons in hippocampus, which has a profound impact on the spatial cognitive ability and synaptic plasticity.
