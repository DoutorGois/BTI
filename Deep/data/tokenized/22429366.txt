OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of low-frequency cortical electrical stimulation (CES) on seizures and behaviour in a rat model of epilepsy induced by ferric chloride (FeCl3). METHODS: Rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n=8 per group): normal healthy rats; saline-treated control rats; FeCl3-induced epileptic rats; CES-treated FeCl3-induced epileptic rats. Behavioural tests, analysis of the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in brain tissue, and ultrastructural studies using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were undertaken. RESULTS: CES significantly decreased the number and grade of seizures, and improved rat behaviour, compared with untreated epileptic rats. CES reduced levels of BDNF protein in the forebrain and increased levels of BDNF protein in the hippocampus compared with untreated epileptic rats. TEM showed less damage and ultrastructural changes in the neurons of CES-treated epileptic rats. CONCLUSIONS: CES inhibited seizures in FeCl3-induced epileptic rats and improved their behaviour. These effects might be mediated by altering BDNF protein levels in the brain.
