An antibody directed against a synthetic peptide sequence specific for the beta-subtype of protein kinase C (PKC) was used to determine the distribution of beta-PKC in rat hippocampus by immunocytochemistry. PKC was distributed primarily in the stratum oriens and radiatum of the CA1 region. Positive staining cell bodies were only observed after colchicine treatment in pyramidal cells (CA2-CA4) and granule cells of the dentate gyrus. The discrete localization of various subtypes of PKC should provide clues to their functions.
