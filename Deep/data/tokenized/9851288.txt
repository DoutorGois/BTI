Deficiency of neuronal growth inhibitory factor (GIF) and abnormalities in zinc homeostasis have been suggested to play a role in the neuropathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We report here that embryonic chick cerebral cell cultures zinc and copper containing GIF in the presence of marmoset hippocampal extract reduces significantly and concentration dependently mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity (MTT) and cell mass. In contrast, no indications could be found that GIF affected neural retina cell cultures. Our results suggest that the observed effects of GIF are not elicited by zinc.
