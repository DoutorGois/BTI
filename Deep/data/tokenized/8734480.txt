The GABAA receptor/chloride ionophore (GABAR) is allosterically modulated by several classes of anticonvulsant agents, including benzodiazepines and barbiturates, and some alkyl-substituted butyrolactones. To test the hypothesis that the anticonvulsant butyrolactones act at a distinct positive-modulatory site on the GABAR, we examined the physiological effects of a butyrolactone, a benzodiazepine and a barbiturate on GABA-mediated currents in voltage-clamped neurons and cells transfected with various subunit combinations. The butyrolactone, alpha-ethyl-alpha-methyl-gamma-thiobutyrolactone (alpha EMTBL), altered the EC50 for GABA and changed the apparent cooperativity of GABA responses. In contrast, the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide altered the EC50 for GABA with no effect on apparent cooperativity. The barbiturate phenobarbital altered both the EC50 and the amplitude of the maximal GABA response without altering apparent cooperativity. The GABA-mediated effect of the barbiturate, but not the benzodiazepine, added to the maximal effect of the butyrolactone, supporting the hypothesis that butyrolactones do not exert their effect at the barbiturate effector site. Both alpha EMTBL and phenobarbital potentiated GABA currents in transfected cells containing the alpha 1 beta 2 and alpha 1 gamma 2 subunit combinations, as well as alpha 1 subunits alone. Chlordiazepoxide had the minimum requirement of an alpha subunit and a gamma subunit. Specific GABARs lacking benzodiazepine or barbiturate modulation were tested for modulation by alpha EMTBL. The alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 combination was modulated by the butyrolactone but not chlordiazepoxide. However, GABARs comprising rho1 subunits were sensitive to both phenobarbital and alpha EMTBL. Although the molecular determinants for alpha EMTBL action appear similar to the barbiturates, our data support the conclusion that alpha EMTBL interacts with GABARs in a distinct manner from barbiturates and benzodiazepines.
