Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is a type of phenolic acid found in green tea and has been shown to have potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of PCA on pilocarpine seizure-induced neuronal death in the hippocampus has not been evaluated. In the present study, we investigated the potential therapeutic effects of PCA on seizure-induced brain injury. Epileptic seizure was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of pilocarpine (25 mg/kg) in adult male rats, and PCA (30 mg/kg) was injected into the intraperitoneal space for three consecutive days after the seizure. Neuronal injury and oxidative stress were evaluated three days after a seizure. To confirm whether PCA increases neuronal survival and reduced oxidative injury in the hippocampus, we performed Fluoro-Jade-B (FJB) staining to detect neuronal death and 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) staining to detect oxidative stress after the seizure. In the present study, we found that, compared to the seizure vehicle-treated group, PCA administration reduced neuronal death and oxidative stress in the hippocampus. To verify whether a decrease of neuronal death by PCA treatment was due to reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration, we measured glutathione with N-ethylmaleimide (GS-NEM) levels in hippocampal neurons. A seizure-induced reduction in the hippocampal neuronal GSH concentration was preserved by PCA treatment. We also examined whether microglia activation was affected by the PCA treatment after a seizure, using CD11b staining. Here, we found that seizure-induced microglia activation was significantly reduced by the PCA treatment. Therefore, the present study demonstrates that PCA deserves further investigation as a therapeutic agent for reducing hippocampal neuronal death after epileptic seizures.
