The frequency spectra of the electrograms of the dorsal hippocampus with intraventricular administration of GABA, muscimol, baclofen, bicuculline, and picrotoxin, were studied in chronic experiments on 24 awake freely-moving rats. The data obtained are in accord with the existing notion regarding the interactions of agonists and antagonists with GABA receptors. The possibility of their participation in the formation and/or modulation of the total electrical activity of the hippocampus is discussed.
