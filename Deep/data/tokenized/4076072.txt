The effects of lithium chloride on seizure activity generated by stimulation of hippocampal kindled rats were studied. Acute administration of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 mEq/kg i.p. resulted in serum levels ranging from clinically subtherapeutic to toxic during the subsequent 4 h. Afterdischarge threshold and seizure severity were unchanged by these levels of lithium. Afterdischarge duration was somewhat prolonged, reaching a significant level only for the 3.0-mEq/kg dose. It is concluded that lithium shows a minor proconvulsant effect after acute administration in the kindled hippocampal seizure model.
