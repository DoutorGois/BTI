Aminergic neurotransmitters and their main metabolites concentrations are measured in four areas (posterior cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus) of the rat brain, 24 hours after an acute ischemic injury (created by the occlusion of the four cephalic vessels). Simultaneously, spontaneous motility and neurological status are evaluated. The main results are the increase of 5 HIAA in striatum, hippocampus and cortex, associated with an increase of HVA in striatum. Motility as well as neurological scores are significantly decreased in ischemic animals when compared with controls. The conclusion is that this model of cerebral ischemia is may be useful for pharmacological assessment of drugs liable to antagonize cerebrovascular disorders.
