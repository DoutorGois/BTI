The rat collapsin response-mediated protein 4 (rCRMP-4) is a member of a family of proteins that are involved in axonal growth. It is found transiently in postmitotic neurons, such as those that are generated in the adult hippocampus. The authors used immunocytochemistry to investigate whether areas of the rat central nervous system (CNS) that retain postnatal neurogenesis express this protein. They found pronounced rCRMP-4 immunoreactivity in recently generated cells in the dentate granular layer, the subventricular zone, the olfactory bulbs, and the rostral migratory stream, four areas in which the production or migration of neurons occurs in adulthood. However, rCRMP-4 immunoreactivity also is expressed in many other regions of the rat brain in which there is no record of adult neurogenesis or neuronal migration, e.g., in the olfactory glomeruli and in neurons of the cerebral cortex. In the hypothalamus, intensely rCRMP-4-labeled neurons populated the supraoptic, paraventricular, and periventricular nuclei as well as the median eminence and the arcuate nucleus. Immunoreactivity for rCRMP-4 also was present in certain neurons of the interpeduncular nucleus, median raphe, superior colliculus, and scattered granule cerebellar neurons. Many of these regions are known to display axonal outgrowth and/or synaptic rearrangement in adulthood and to coexpress the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule. Thus, the results of this study suggest that rCRMP-4 expression in the CNS is associated with cells that are migrating or are undergoing axonal growth. Nevertheless, small, rCRMP-4-immunoreactive cells were seen throughout the brain. These cells did not express neuronal, astroglial, or microglial markers, although some of them also were immunoreactive for rip antibody, suggesting an oligodendroglial lineage.
