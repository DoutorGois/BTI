[3H]norepinephrine efflux from preloaded rat hippocampal slices was increased in a dose-dependent manner by excitatory amino acids (EAA) in the following potency order: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) greater than kainic acid greater than L-glutamic acid greater than or equal to D,L-homocysteic acid greater than L-aspartic acid greater than quinolinic acid greater than quisqualic acid. The effect of EAA was blocked by physiological concentration of Mg2+, with the exception of kainic acid. D,L-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (APH) dose-dependently inhibited NMDA effect (IC50 = 69 mumol/L), whereas at 1 mmol/L it was ineffective versus kainic acid. The release of [3H]norepinephrine induced by quinolinic acid was blocked by APH 0.1 mmol/L. gamma-D-glutamylglycine dose-dependently inhibited kainic acid effect with an IC50 = 1.15 mmol/L. Tetrodotoxin 2 mumol/L reduced NMDA and kainic acid effects by 40 and 20%, respectively. The data indicate a possible involvement of central noradrenergic system in the modulation of excitotoxic action of EAA and offer a reliable system for testing new compounds acting at EAA-receptors by measuring norepinephrine release in vitro.
