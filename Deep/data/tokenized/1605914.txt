Quantitative and qualitative autoradiographic methods together with lesion approaches were used to determine the distribution of [3H]ryanodine binding sites in rat brain and the neuronal localization of these sites in the hippocampus. In normal animals, levels of [3H]ryanodine binding sites ranged from a low of about 1 fmol/mg tissue in subcortical structures to a high of 12-18 fmol/mg tissue in subregions of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb. Relatively high densities of sites (5-9 fmol/mg tissue) were also seen in the olfactory tubercle, most areas of the cerebral cortex, accumbens nucleus, striatum, lateral septal nuclei, pontine nucleus, superior colliculus and granule cell layer of the cerebellum. Specific binding was undetectable in white matter. In experimental animals, intracerebral injections of kainic acid caused neuronal degeneration and a near total depletion of [3H]ryanodine binding sites in the dentate gyrus and in fields CA1, CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus. Injections of kainic acid that left dentate granule cells largely intact while destroying all neurons in field CA3 had no effect on binding sites in the dentate gyrus. However, these lesions substantially reduced the density of binding in field CA3, leaving a narrow band of sites outlining the position of the degenerated CA3 pyramidal cells. Mechanical knife-cut lesions that severed the granule cell mossy fiber input to field CA3 reduced the density of binding sites in the CA3 region. The results indicate that [3H]ryanodine binding sites in brain are heterogeneously distributed and suggest that a proportion of these sites in the hippocampus may be contained in mossy fiber terminals where a presumptive calcium channel/ryanodine receptor complex may be involved in the regulation of calcium mobilization and/or neurotransmitter release.
