In experiment on white rats it was shown that fractionated exposure to 1 sGy/day during 25 days is followed by the directed change in the total heparin-binding activity of proteins in the rat brain (both in males and in females) with maximum deviation from control by the 7th day after accumulation of a total dose of 25 sGy. The diverse in hemisphere cortex and hippocampus were different from those in brain trunk regions and cerebellum. It is supposed that a thin overturning of the intercellular and "cell-matrix" interactions in CNS modulates compensation and adaptation processes under chronic X-ray irradiation with a small dose of low intensity due to regulation of the free/bound heparansulphate correlation.
