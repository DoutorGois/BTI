PURPOSE: This work studied the profile of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). METHODS: The GAGs were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, enzymatic degradation, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The hippocampus of TLE patients showed increased levels of chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid against normal levels of these GAGs in the neocortex and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that these matrix components could be involved in the pathophysiology of TLE.
