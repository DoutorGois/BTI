The expression of NF-H neurofilament subunit mRNAs was investigated in the rat brain at different ontogenic stages. The levels of NF-H mRNAs vary 15-fold among brain regions with the highest level in the brainstem. In situ localization studies revealed that the NF-H mRNAs are mainly concentrated in the brainstem motoneuron nuclei. By increasing the sensitivity of the hybridization method, NF-H mRNAs could also be localized in neurons present in the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus areas. Minor amounts of NF-H mRNAs were already detected at 17-day embryonic stages.
