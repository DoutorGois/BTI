AIM: To study the mechanism of protective effect of GABA against hypoxic injury in rat hippocampal slices. METHODS: The hippocampal slices from adult rats and extracellular recording technique were used to observe the effect of GABA on the evoked population spikes in rat hippocampal slices after hypoxia in vitro. RESULTS: GABA can significantly delay the disappearance of PV, but have no effect on PS. When the receptor antagonist of GABA (bicuculline) and the inhibitor of Cl- channel (NPPB) were given, the protect effect could be suppressed. CONCLUSION: GABA increases hypoxic tolerance of hippocampal slices. The mechanism of the effect of GABA may be involved in the elevation of chloride influx through GABA receptor.
