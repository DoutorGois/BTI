PURPOSE: Oxidative stress and renin- angiotensin system are both involved in the pathophysiology of most of the systemic and central disorders as well as in aging. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, well known for their cardiovascular beneficial effects, have also shown antioxidant properties in pathologic conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the central effect of ACE inhibitors on oxidative status under no pathologic condition. METHODS: Adult male rats were divided into four groups of 9 rats each. Groups were treated orally by perindopril at the doses of 1, 2, 4 mg/kg/day or normal saline as the control for four consecutive weeks. At the end of the treatment period the reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG respectively) and malondialdehyde (MDA), the product of lipid peroxidation, were measured in the rats' hippocampus. RESULTS: The GSH increased dose dependently and was significantly higher in the 2 mg/kg perindopril treated group than the control group (p<0.05) while the GSSG level remained unchanged. As a consequent, the ratio of GSH to GSSG increased significantly in a dose dependent manner. There was not any significant change in MDA. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that ACE inhibition may cause an increase in GSH as an anti- oxidant defense in the hippocampus.
