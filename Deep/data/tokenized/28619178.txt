OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine morphological changes in subcortical structures via surface-based analysis and to correlate local shape changes with cognitive function. METHODS: We analyzed subcortical brain morphology and compared the shape changes with clinical and neuropsychological features in patients with chronic insomnia. RESULTS: Hippocampal atrophy was associated with higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (r = -0.4, p = 0.0408) and higher arousal indices (r = -0.4, p = 0.0332). Local volume loss of the putamen was associated with higher arousal indices (r = -0.5, p = 0.0416). Atrophic change of subcortical structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and thalamus, correlated negatively with verbal fluency, frontal function, verbal memory, and visual memory, respectively, in these patients (|r| >/= 0.3, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that sleep quality and fragmentation are closely related to atrophic changes in hippocampus and putamen. In addition, atrophic changes in global subcortical structures are associated with impaired cognitive function in patients with chronic insomnia.
