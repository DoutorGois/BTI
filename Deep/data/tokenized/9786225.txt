The purpose of the present study was to examine whether cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was implicated in the process of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal afferent fibre system to the prefrontal cortex in vivo. Using a biochemical approach, we measured PKA activity at different times after induction of LTP. We show that there is an NMDA receptor-dependent increase in PKA activity in the prefrontal cortex, only at five minutes after LTP induction. These data demonstrate a role of PKA in the induction and not the expression of cortical LTP and suggest that if PKA is involved in the late phase of LTP, it does not appear to be a persistent activation.
