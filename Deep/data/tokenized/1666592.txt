In spontaneously hypertensive rats, the hippocampus has two types of glycocorticoid receptors. In stress, an increase of the receptor binding was found, mainly due to the 2 type receptors. Only one type of receptors was found in the striatum. In stress, the maximal binding of H3-corticosterone with the receptors was enhanced and the dissociation constant increased. The change of the receptors in the striatum can underlie the change in regulation of the hypophyseal-adrenal system function by the feedback mechanism occurring in hypertension in the SHR rats.
