On the basis of systematic examinations of electrical activity of brain deep structures in 87 epileptic patients, an experiment was carried out to replace the concept of the epileptic focus by the graph of functional grouping of structures with epileptic activity. In order to make the graph as realistic as possible, the multi-lead electrodes have to be introduced into the brain systematically and under standard conditions. In this case, the results obtained are comparable. At the same time, the graph proves to be the basis of indications for stereotactic treatment.
