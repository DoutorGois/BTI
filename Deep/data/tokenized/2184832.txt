Neurochemical and neuropharmacological studies were undertaken to assess the involvement of CNS serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and GABA systems in regulating the alcohol-drinking behavior of two lines of rats selectively bred for their high alcohol-seeking behavior, namely the alcohol-preferring P line and the high alcohol-drinking HAD line of rats. Neurochemical data indicate that high alcohol-seeking behavior (when compared with data from rats with low alcohol-seeking characteristics) is associated with: a) lower (10-20%; p less than 0.05) contents of 5-HT in certain limbic regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus); b) a lower (10-15%; p less than 0.05) content of DA in the nucleus accumbens; c) higher (20-35%; p less than 0.05) densities of 5-HT1A binding sites in some limbic regions (e.g., medial nucleus accumbens, medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus); and d) a greater (20-50%) density of GABA axon terminals in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, the acute administration of high doses of ethanol appears to increase the activity of the 5-HT and DA projections to the nucleus accumbens of the P line of rats (as indicated by the 20-30% elevated tissue levels of 5-HT and DA metabolites following IP ethanol administration); neuronal tolerance to alcohol appears to develop in both these monoamine pathways, as suggested by an attenuated effect on metabolite levels by a challenge dose of ethanol given to P rats that had been chronically drinking alcohol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
