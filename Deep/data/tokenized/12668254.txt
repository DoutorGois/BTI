The brain serotonin (5-HT) system and circulating corticosteroids are in close interaction and both implicated in the pathogenesis of affective disorders. We evaluated the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) on 5-HT(1B) receptors mRNA expression in cerebellum, frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus in rats, using the RNase protection assay technique. Eight weeks after bilateral adrenalectomy, 5-HT(1B) receptor mRNA levels were decreased in the cerebellum and in the frontal cortex. The expression of 5-HT(1B) receptors mRNA was unchanged in the hippocampus and in the striatum. This data indicates regional differences in the effects of long term adrenalectomy on the expression of 5-HT(1B) receptors.
