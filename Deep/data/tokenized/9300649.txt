We have found that beta-eudesmol, a sesquiterpenol constituent of Chinese herb antagonized organophosphate-induced lethal toxicity by reversing the neuromuscular failure and reducing the occurrence of convulsions. Its possible antiepileptic action was further explored in electroshock seizure mice in vivo and in high potassium treated rat hippocampal slices in vitro. At a dose with little effect on the motor activity, beta-eudesmol prevented the convulsions and lethality induced by maximal electroshock but not those by pentylenetetrazol or picrotoxin. At subeffective doses, beta-eudesmol and phenytoin showed additive effect in preventing electroshock seizures. Extracellular recording of field potentials in CA1 pyramidal layer of hippocampal slices showed that beta-eudesmol reduced the high potassium (8.5 microM)-induced electrographic seizure activity. The potential of beta-eudesmol to serve as an antiepileptic or a conjuvant in phenytoin therapy is suggested.
