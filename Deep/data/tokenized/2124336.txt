Hippocampal and striatal extracellular acetylcholine levels were monitored in conscious rats using the technique of intracerebral dialysis. Scopolamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) resulted in a marked increase of acetylcholine release in both regions whereas the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue MK-771 (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) only increased acetylcholine release in the hippocampus. The relevance of the present findings in relation to the known cognitive enhancing effects of TRH analogues is discussed.
