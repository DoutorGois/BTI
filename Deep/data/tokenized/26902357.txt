Induction of long-term potentiation in rat hippocampus was followed by short-term activation of transcription factor p53 and its subsequent degradation. We studied the effects of EX-527 (inhibitor of deacetylase Sirt1, a negative regulator of p53) and pifi thrin-beta (inhibitor of p53-dependent transcription) on the levels of p53 protein and mRNA of its target gene S100B during long-term potentiation. Pifi thrin-beta limited the increase in S100B mRNA content after tetanization, which confi rmed signifi cant contribution of p53 in the regulation of S100B during long-term potentiation. EX-527 completely prevented p53 degradation and increased S100B expression induced by tetanization. Thus, Str1 regulates stability of p53 and expression of its target gene S100B in rat hippocampus during long-term potentiation.
