Pre-test local microinjection of arginine-vasopressin (AVP) into dorsal or ventral hippocampus resulted in an improvement of retention performance in an appetitively motivated task. Nevertheless, a better improvement appeared when AVP treatment was performed into ventral hippocampus suggesting a higher sensitivity of this part of hippocampus to the action of AVP. To examine a non-specific behavioral action of the peptide, the effect of AVP treatment on locomotor activity was assessed. When the treatment was given into ventral hippocampus, a reduction of locomotor activity was recorded, whereas after AVP injection into dorsal hippocampus, the peptide failed to alter locomotor activity.
