The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of prenatal protein deprivation on area CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells on postnatal (P) days 15, 30, 90 and 220 using Golgi techniques. Age related changes in both groups and diet related changes between groups were assessed. There were significant diet effects at all four ages, with one of 12 different measurements showing a significant diet effect on P15, five on P30, one on P90, and seven on P220. The most marked effect of the diet was on pyramidal cell dendrite spine density in the stratum moleculare and stratum radiatum, with a different pattern of diet effects in the two strata. In pyramidal cell dendrites in the stratum moleculare, there was a deficit in spine density that was significant at three of the four ages and there were similar age-related changes in the two diet groups. Spines on pyramidal cell dendrites in the stratum radiatum showed a lack of synchrony of age-related changes in the two diet groups, with an increased spine density in the malnourished rats on P30 and a widening deficit in this parameter on P90 and P220. The bimodal distribution to these changes, with most marked deficits occurring on P30 and P220, with an intervening period of apparent "catch-up" on P90, is of interest and may be a significant brain adaptation to malnutrition. The present study is the final of three morphometric studies on the effect of prenatal protein restriction on three key neurons in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit. When compared to our previous studies on the dentate granule cell and the CA3 pyramidal cell, it is noted that there is an effect of the low protein diet on all these neurons, with the most marked effect on the predominantly postnatally generated dentate granule cells.
