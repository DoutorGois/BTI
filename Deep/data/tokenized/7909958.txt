Long-term depression (LTD) is an activity-dependent decrease in synaptic efficacy that together with its counterpart, long-term potentiation, is thought to be an important cellular mechanism for learning and memory in the mammalian brain. The induction of LTD in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in neonatal rats is shown to depend on postsynaptic calcium ion entry through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels paired with the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Although induced postsynaptically, LTD is due to a long-term decrease in transmitter release from presynaptic terminals. This suggests that LTD is likely to require the production of a retrograde messenger.
