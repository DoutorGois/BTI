This study was carried out to ascertain the effects of maternal separation (3 h per day) of mothers from their pups in the neonatal period in rats, which has been suggested to induce a depressive-like state, would have long lasting effects on different parameters including hippocampal Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity, NO production, free radical production and antioxidant enzymes activities in dams. Fourty-eight Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups: control, brief separation (10 min) and long separation (3 h). The neonatal interventions were done on postpartum days 1-10. At 35 days post-partum the dams were killed and the hippocampal Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity were measured, as well as the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, free radicals production, and the production of nitric oxide. Hippocampal Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity was decreased in the brief separated group and in dams subjected to 3 h separation from their pups. A reduction in nitric oxide levels in the hippocampus in dams of the long separated group was also observed. It is concluded that the withdrawal of pups from their mothers make the mothers more susceptible to the development of neurochemical alterations that could be related to depressive features.
