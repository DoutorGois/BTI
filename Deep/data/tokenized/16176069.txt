Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) plays a pivotal role in neuronal ischemia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the routes of Ca2+ entry during non-excitotoxic oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in acutely dissociated rat CA1 neurons. During OGD the fluo-3/fura red ratio reflecting [Ca2+]i increased rapidly and irreversibly. [Ca2+]i increased to the same degree in Ca2 + depleted medium, and also when both the ryanodine receptors (RyR) and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors were blocked. When the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores were emptied with thapsigargin no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed independent of extracellular Ca2+. The OGD induced Ca2+ deregulation in isolated CA1 neurons is not prevented by removing Ca2+, or by blocking the IP3- or RyR receptors. However, when SERCA was blocked, no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed suggesting that SERCA dysfunction represents an important mechanism for ischemic Ca2+ overload.
