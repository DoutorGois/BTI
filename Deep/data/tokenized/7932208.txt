In this study, we attempted to identify of the subtype(s) of alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (AR) involved in the control of motor behavior, nociception and the hippocampal synthesis of noradrenaline (NA) in the rat. The high efficacy alpha-2 AR agonists, xylazine and UK 14,304 [5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino]quinoxaline], inhibited striatal accumulation of L-dopa in rats pretreated with NSD 1015 (an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid-decarboxylase), elicited a loss of the righting reflex in rats, provoked ataxia in the rotarod test in mice and elicited antinociception in the writhing and hot-plate tests in mice. Guanfacine and guanabenz, agonists acting preferentially at rat alpha-2A (R alpha-2A)/human alpha-2A (H alpha-2A) AR, mimicked the antinociceptive and motor actions of xylazine and UK 14,304 and likewise inhibited NA synthesis. The preferential R alpha-2A/H alpha-2A AR antagonist, [2-(2H-(1-methyl-1, 3-dihydroisoindole)methyl)-4, 5-dihydro-imidazole (BRL 44408), enhanced hippocampal synthesis of NA and blocked the antinociceptive and motor effects of UK 14,304, xylazine, guanfacine and guanabenz. Similarly, fluparoxan and des-fluorofluparoxan, preferential antagonists at R alpha-2A AR as compared to H alpha-2A AR, were highly active. In contrast, the preferential alpha-2B/alpha-2C AR antagonists, ARC 239 [2-(2-(4-o-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)-ethyl)-4,4-dimethyl-1,3- (2H,4H)-isoquinolinedione] prazosin, corynanthine, spiroxatrine and [1,2-dimethyl-2,3,9,13-betetrahydro-1H-dibenzo(c,f)- imidazo(1,5-a)azepine (BRL 41992)], as well as the preferential H alpha-2A AR antagonist, [2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl)- aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane] (WB 4101), were only weakly active. Based on the actions of a total of 16, structurally diverse alpha-2 AR antagonists, a correlation matrix was constructed. This revealed a strong correlation among the tests (median r = 0.82) and allowed for a comparison between drug potency in inhibiting these alpha-2 AR-mediated actions and affinity at various populations of alpha-2 AR subtypes (see companion paper). Correlations for potency in the two motor tests were pronounced with R alpha-2A sites (0.85), modest with H alpha-2A sites (0.60) and alpha-2B sites (0.58) and poor with alpha-2C sites (0.35). For the two antinociceptive tests, correlations were likewise pronounced with R alpha-2A sites (0.80) but less marked with H alpha-2A sites (0.73), alpha-2B sites (0.62) and alpha-2C sites (0.62).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
