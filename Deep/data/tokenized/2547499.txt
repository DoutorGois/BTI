High affinity [3H]ouabain binding was examined in the hippocampal CA1 region and frontal cortex of rats subjected to 5 min complete cerebral ischemia in a clinical death model, and to subsequent resuscitation. A decrease of Bmax directly after ischemia and its further gradual decrease during 120 min of reperfusion were noted in the ischemia-vulnerable CA1 region, whereas no change of Bmax was observed in frontal cortex. The apparent Kd constant showed insignificant fluctuations in either of the two brain regions. Since ouabain binds with high affinity to the neuronal (alpha +)-form of Na+/K+-ATPase, the results indicate a rapid enzyme loss in CA1 neurons. The high affinity ouabain binding test proved to be a sensitive detector of premorphological changes in nerve cell membranes in ischemia.
