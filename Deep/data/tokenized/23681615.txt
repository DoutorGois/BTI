Hippocampal neurons consist mainly of pyramidal neuron and granule cell, and dissociated hippocampal neurons are a good tool to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanism of neuronal development and neuronal degenerative disease in the central neuronal system (CNS). Here, we describe a general procedure of dissociated hippocampal neuron culture.
