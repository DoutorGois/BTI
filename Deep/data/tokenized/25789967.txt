Brain oscillatory activity is considered an essential aspect of brain function, and its frequency can vary from <1 Hz to >200 Hz, depending on the brain states and projection. Episodes of rhythmic activity accompany hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in vivo. Therefore, long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression, which are considered viable substrates of learning and memory, are often experimentally studied in paradigms of patterned high-frequency (>50 Hz) and low-frequency (<5 Hz) stimulation. However, the impact of intermediate frequencies on neuronal plasticity remains less well understood. In particular, hippocampal neurons are specifically tuned for activity at theta frequency (4-8 Hz); this band contributes significantly to electroencephalographic signals, and it is likely to be involved in shaping synaptic strength in hippocampal circuits. Here, we review in vitro and in vivo studies showing that variation of theta-activity duration may affect long-term modification of synaptic strength and neuronal excitability in the hippocampus. Such theta-pulse-induced neuronal plasticity 1) is long-lasting, 2) may be built on previously stabilized potentiation in the synapse, 3) may produce opposite changes in synaptic strength, and 4) requires complex molecular machinery. Apparently innocuous episodes of low-frequency synaptic activity may have a profound impact on network signaling, thereby contributing to information processing in the hippocampus and beyond. In addition, theta-pulse-induced LTP might be an advantageous protocol in studies of specific molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.
