PURPOSE: The present study evaluated the expression of alpha1-adrenoceptor subtypes in human corpus cavernosum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mRNA encoding alpha1a, alpha1b and alpha1d subtypes were assessed by RNA-directed complementary cDNA synthesis followed by Taq DNA amplification. The level of alpha1 mRNA was calculated in arbitrary optical density units and normalized with respect to the length of the respective cDNA fragments. RESULTS: We found that alpha1a, alpha1b and alpha1d adrenoceptor subtypes are expressed in human corpus cavernosum, with a predominant expression of the alpha1a subtype. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that alpha1a-adrenoceptor subtype is important and that understanding the biochemical and functional characteristics of this subtype may lead to the development of specific antagonists in the treatment of impotence.
