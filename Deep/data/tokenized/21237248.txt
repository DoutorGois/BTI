The aim of this work was to study the effect of molsidomine (MOLS), a nitric oxide (NO) donor, on the nitrergic system changes in an experimental model of cholinergic damage induced by 192 IgG saporin (SAP). Male rats were injured by intraseptal administration of SAP (0.22 mug), after seven days, rats were administered with MOLS (4 mg/kg, i.p.) 60 min before sacrifice. Prefrontal cortex (PC), striatum (S) and hippocampus (HC) were dissected out. Results showed significant recovery of the constitutive NOS activity (cNOS) in PC and S regions by MOLS but not in HC compared against controls. SAP reduced the cellular population in the lesion site and MOLS was able to avoid the progression of damage in this area. NO donor is able to modulate the nitrergic status in an experimental model induced by SAP.
