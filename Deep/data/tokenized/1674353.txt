Evidence is given for altered gene expression in the hippocampus in response to entorhinal cortex lesioning. Three RNA markers encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein, apolipoprotein E and alpha-tubulin were isolated from a rat hippocampal cDNA library by differential screening with cDNA probes from entorhinal cortex lesioned and control rat hippocampus RNA. By Northern blot analysis, mRNA for apolipoprotein E and alpha-tubulin increased to peak around 6 days after the lesion and returned to near control level at 30 days. The increased synthesis of both mRNAs coincides with the acute phase of synaptogenesis, protein synthesis, and polyribosomes accumulation in the deafferented hippocampal area.
