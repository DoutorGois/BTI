Using correlated light and electron microscopic preembedding enkephalin immunocytochemistry combined with post-embedding GABA immunogold staining, we found morphological evidence of a direct connection between the enkephalinergic and GABAergic systems in the rat hippocampus. Enkephalin-immunoreactive boutons were found to be presynaptic to GABA-immunoreactive postsynaptic profiles, establishing type 2 symmetrical synapses on GABA-positive cell bodies and dendritic shafts in strata radiatum and lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 region. Thirty-six percent of all studied postsynaptic targets (n = 40) were non-pyramidal, including all somatic (n = 7) and 47% of the dendritic (n = 13) postsynaptic targets. The remaining 64% consisted of pyramidal dendritic shafts and spines. These results support previous physiological experiments suggesting that the opioidergic system takes part in disinhibitory processes in the hippocampal formation.
