Alimentary instrumental conditioned reflex (CR) was elaborated in dogs to light flashes (I series), electrostimulation (ES) of the hippocampus (II series) and the hypothalamus (III series). Nonreinforced ES of the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and septum reproduced pressings on the pedal to the least extent in the I series (17-40% of trials), increasing in the II-nd one up to 40-87% during stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus, medial amygdala and contralateral hippocampus. In the III-rd series the number of pressings increased statistically significantly in comparison with the I-st series for most structures. Probably, besides the artificial increase of motivation during ES of the limbic structures which took place in all series, in the II-nd and III-rd series significance for movement reproduction was acquired by CR generalization appearing due to close interconnection of the structures. In this phenomenon connections (evaluated by the EPs) from the tested structures to the initially signal one are important.
