The brain of a 6-year-old Holstein cow, which showed progressive neurologic symptoms during several months, was examined by histopathologic methods. Many round or oval-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions were observed, mainly in neurons of the temporal lobe and the hippocampus. Those inclusions were faintly eosinophilic with hematoxylin and eosin and positive with Bielschowsky's silver stain. Immunohistochemically, the inclusions were recognized by antiubiquitin and antiphosphorylated tau antibodies. Ultrastructurally, the inclusions were globular and well demarcated from the rest of the cytoplasm, lacked limiting membranes, and were mainly composed of straight fibrils about 15 nm in width. The structure of the inclusions was similar to that of Pick bodies in Pick's disease of humans. The pathogenesis of this bovine condition is not known.
