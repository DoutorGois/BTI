Hippocampal ripple oscillations (140-200 Hz) are believed to be critically involved in the consolidation of memory traces during slow-wave sleep (SWS). We investigated the temporal pattern of ripple occurrence in relation to sleep phases following different types of waking. Amphetamine, the atypical wakening drug modafinil or non-pharmacological sleep deprivation lead to an increased ripple occurrence ("rebound") during the subsequent SWS episode. Waking of the same duration evoked by amphetamine or sleep deprivation led to a ripple rebound of similar extent (approximately 200%). The mean intraripple frequency was also elevated by up to 20 Hz during SWS following all treatments. Ripple amplitude was significantly increased only in experiments with amphetamine. Ripple occurrence but not intraripple frequency clearly correlated with the antecedent waking duration independent of treatment. Recovery of ripple occurrence and frequency to the pretreatment level during SWS depended on SWS duration. At the end of the recovery period paradoxical sleep (PS) acted like waking, elevating ripple occurrence during subsequent SWS episodes. On the other hand, PS decreased ripple occurrence if recovery from the rebound was not yet complete. Thus occurrence and structure of ripple oscillations are regulated by the timing and duration of previous SWS, PS and waking episodes.
