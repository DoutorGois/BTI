Pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region of the hippocampal formation integrate synaptic information arriving in the dendrites within discrete laminar regions. At potentials near or below the resting potential integration of synaptic signals is most affected by the passive properties of the cell and hyperpolarization-activated currents (I(h)). Here we focused specifically on a subset of neurons within the CA3b subregion of the rat hippocampus in order to better understand their membrane response within subthreshold voltage ranges. Using a combined experimental and computational approach we found that the passive properties of these neurons varied up to fivefold between cells. Likewise, there was a large variance in the expression of I(h) channels. However, the contribution of I(h) was minimal at resting potentials endowing the membrane with an apparent linear response to somatic current injection within +/-10 mV. Unlike in CA1 pyramidal neurons, however, I(h) activation was not potentiated in an activity-dependent manner. Computer modeling, based on a combination of voltage- and current-clamp data, suggested that an increasing density of these channels with distance from the soma, compared with a uniform distribution, would have no significant effect on the general properties of the cell because of their relatively lower expression. Nonetheless, temporal summation of excitatory inputs was affected by the presence of I(h) in the dendrites in a frequency- and distance-dependent fashion.
