The effects of the increase of intracellular calcium, induced by membrane depolarization with 50 mM KCl, and arachidonic acid (AA) on the expression of 25-kD synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) were studied in cultured rat hippocampal and cerebellar explants, and PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, using immunoblot analysis. Incubation periods of 24 h and 48 h in 50 mM KCl increased SNAP-25 levels in hippocampal explants and PC12 cells, but not on cerebellar explants. Otherwise, a 24 h incubation with 10 microM AA increased SNAP-25 expression only in hippocampal explants, although 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) did not have effect. These results indicate that intracellular calcium and AA can modulate the expression of SNAP-25, depending on the origin of the tissue.
