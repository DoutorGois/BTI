The effect of 1,1,2-trichloroethylene (TCE), an industrial solvent, on myelin in the dorsal hippocampus of the developing rat was investigated. Rat pups were exposed to TCE via their dams' drinking water while in utero and until they were sacrificed at 21 days of age. Frozen coronal sections through the dorsal hippocampus were stained for the presence of myelin using a modification of the Heidenhain procedure developed for frozen sections. A significant decrease in myelinated fibers was found in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, an area comprised of distal dendritic profiles of CA1 pyramidal neurons which receive input from the entorhinal cortex. These findings suggest that the reduction in myelin in the hippocampus may be responsible, in part, for behavioral effects observed following TCE exposure.
