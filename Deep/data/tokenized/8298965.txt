Self-stimulation rewarding experience promoted structural changes in pyramidal neurons of the CA3 region of the hippocampus and the Vth layer of the motor cortex in adult male Wistar rats. Self-stimulation experience was allowed for 1 h daily for a duration of 10 days through bipolar electrodes placed bilaterally in lateral hypothalamus and substantia nigra--ventral tegmental area. At the end of 10 days, rats were sacrificed, and rapid Golgi examination of the CA3 hippocampal and layer V pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex was made for a grand total of 1600 neurons from 80 rats divided into 4 groups. The neurons of the self-stimulation experienced (SS) group revealed a significant (ANOVA, F-test) increase in dendritic branching in the perisomatic domains. Such changes were not observed in neurons of sham control (SH), experimenter administered stimulation (EA) and normal control (NC) groups. SS animals also showed a significant increase in the thickness of lacunosum and radiatum laminae of CA3 neurons of the hippocampus. Our results reveal that both limbic and neocortical neurons undergo changes in dendritic branching patterns due to self-stimulation rewarding experience. It is tempting to hypothesize that neuronal plasticity is the result of motivation and learning experienced by rats which underwent self-stimulation.
