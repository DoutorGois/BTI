The possible involvement of beta-adrenoceptor system in the effectiveness of 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (THA) to attenuate retention deficits exhibited by middle-aged rats in a one-trial passive avoidance task has been investigated. THA (2.5 mg.kg-1), injected i.p. after training, induced a significant increase in test step-through latency (STL) in middle-aged rats. Post-training injection of THA reduced basal and isoprenaline stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in cortex and hippocampus of every group of rats. It is suggested that the effect of THA on memory processes may involve an action on beta-adrenoceptor-linked cyclic AMP accumulation.
