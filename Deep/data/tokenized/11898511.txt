The use of electrical fields to treat epilepsy is undergoing increased scrutiny as an alternative to medications and resective surgery. Much recent attention has been focused on ionic channels and seizure control; however, nonsynaptic mechanisms may be crucial for seizure onset, raising the possibility of using electrical field application to abort seizures. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects may outlast the immediate treatment and possibly be a prophylactic intervention. This paper reviews the use of brain stimulation for treatment of epilepsy, but also cites instances where the antithetical results occur. The greatest detail focuses on disrupting the onset or shortening the seizure. The paper does not extensively review deep brain or vagal nerve stimulation.
