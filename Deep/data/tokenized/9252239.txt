Differential activation of neural substrates was investigated in female sheep exposed to a male when they were in oestrus, and sexually receptive and attracted to males, as opposed to anoestrus when they were not. Changes in neuronal activation were visualized in ovariectomized, hormone-treated ewes by quantifying changes in cellular expression of c-fos messenger RNA by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Results showed that, while oestrus induction had no significant effects on c-fos expression per se, a 5-min exposure to a male significantly increased it in a number of primary and association cortical regions (the mitral and granule cell layers of the olfactory bulb, visual, somatosensory, orbitofrontal, piriform, cingulate and temporal cortices), the limbic system (CA1 region of the hippocampus, subiculum, lateral septum, lateral and basolateral amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) and hypothalamus (mediobasal hypothalamus, medial preoptic area and paraventricular nucleus) as well as the nucleus accumbens and mediodorsal thalamus. Intromissions did not contribute significantly to these c-fos changes however. In anoestrus females, exposure to a male only produced a small significant increase in c-fos messenger RNA expression in the temporal cortex inspite of receiving similar amounts of visual and olfactory cues from him and a number of mating attempts. These results clearly demonstrate that changes in sexual motivation markedly alter the neural processing of sensory cues from males. They also show that the hormonal induction of sexual attraction to males cues and the resultant stimulation of sexual behaviour is due not only to altered responsiveness of oestrogen-sensitive brain regions involved in mediating behavioural responses towards the male, but also to changes in primary and secondary/tertiary somatosensory, olfactory and visual processing regions which relay sensory information to them.
