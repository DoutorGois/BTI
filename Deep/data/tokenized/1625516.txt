The effects of recombinant human superoxide dismutase (r-hSOD) on ischemic neuronal injury were examined. Cerebral ischemia was produced in Mongolian gerbils by occluding bilateral common carotid arteries for 5 min. Preischemic treatment with r-hSOD clearly reduced hippocampal neuronal damages while postischemic treatment did not. This result suggests that oxygen free radicals play an important role in selective vulnerability to ischemia and r-hSOD has a potential clinical usefulness against cerebral ischemia.
