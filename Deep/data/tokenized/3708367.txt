Acute (45-min) restraint stress decreased sodium-dependent, high-affinity choline uptake in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats. The effect of restraint on the hippocampus was blocked, whereas that on the frontal cortex was not significantly affected, by pretreatment of the rats with the narcotic antagonist naltrexone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) immediately prior to restraint.
