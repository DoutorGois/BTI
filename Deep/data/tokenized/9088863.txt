The present experiment was designed to elucidate whether chronic dietary treatment with nimodipine (3 months, 1000 ppm) enhances water maze spatial navigation, passive avoidance behavior and locomotor activity, and whether such a treatment with nimodipine would interact with the therapeutic effect of acute metrifonate treatment. In young medial septum-lesioned rats, nimodipine had no effect by its own on cognitive or motor behavior, and did not enhance the water maze and passive avoidance behavior improving action of metrifonate (3 and 10 mg/kg. p.o.). Nimodipine treatment of aged rats did not markedly affect the deficit in motor performance. Single and combined nimodipine and metrifonate (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) treatment of aged rats resulted in shorter escape distance values to the hidden water maze escape platform compared to those of control aged rats. The passive avoidance performance of aged rats was more effectively facilitated by a combined nimodipine and metrifonate treatment than by either of the drugs on their own. Following a washout period of 2.5 months the rats that were treated previously with nimodipine no longer performed better than aged controls in the water maze test. Furthermore, after the washout period metrifonate 10 mg/kg was no longer effective in improving the water maze behavior of the now 26-month-old rats irrespective of their chronic pretreatment. Taken together, these findings indicate that chronic nimodipine and acute metrifonate treatment may more effectively stimulate cognitive functioning than either of the treatments on their own.
