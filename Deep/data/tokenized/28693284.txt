A 38-year-old male patient presented with general weakness, polydipsia and a body weight loss of 10 kg in two years. Hypopituitarism with central hypothyroidism and central adrenal insufficiency were noted at Taipei City Hospital (Taipei, Taiwan). However, hypogonadotropic hypergonadism was also observed. The patient was diagnosed with an intracranial beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) secreting germ-cell tumor, and brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the tumor involved the pineal gland, stalk, posterior pituitary gland, right basal ganglion, hypothalamus, corpus callosum and posterior hippocampus. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-hCG level was 1936 IU/l, while the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was <0.24 ng/ml. The serum AFP level of the patient was 3.28 ng/ml, and the beta-hCG level was 178 IU/l with a CSF:serum beta-hCG ratio >2:1. The patient was successfully treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as demonstrated by a marked decrease in size of the tumor and in the serum beta-hCG levels. Intracranial beta-hCG secreting germ-cell tumors are rare in adults and manifest differently compared with patients of early pubertal age. In contrast with the precocious puberty frequently observed in young patients, the diagnosis of adult patients is often delayed and the symptoms are associated with tumor size and location. The present case report described an adult male with an intracranial beta-hCG secreting GCT, demonstrating hypopituitarism and asymptomatic hyperandrogenemia, and reviews and discusses the literature relevant to the case.
