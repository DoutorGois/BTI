The increases in firing rates of hippocampal cells were examined following microiontophoretic application of several muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonists. The agonists studied had been pharmacologically characterized previously and divided into two classes: class A agonists (e.g. acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, and oxotremorine-M) which maximally stimulate PI turnover and reveal mAChR heterogeneity, and class B agonists (e.g. bethanecol and oxotremorine-1) which poorly stimulate PI turnover and do not alter mAChR conformation/orientation in the hippocampus. While comparable stimulatory effects on hippocampal pyramidal cell firing rates were seen with both classes of agonists during short (20 s) ejection periods, longer applications (greater than 25 s) produced class-dependent differential firing patterns. Prolonged ejection of class A agonists selectively desensitized cells to further, continued application in the same ejection period, and the firing rates declined. Class B agonists produced stimulatory responses in hippocampal cells during the entire ejection period, and DE was not observed. This desensitization effect (DE) was observed only for bursts and not for simple spikes.
