The ubiquitin-proteasome system plays a central role in regulated degradation of cellular proteins under different physiological conditions. Accumulation of misfolded proteins is involved in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). Hrd1 is a newly identified ubiquitin ligase involved in degradation of misfolded proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thereby protecting cells against ER stress. Increasing evidence has linked ER stress to PD pathogenesis. However, the expression of Hrd1 in PD brain remains elusive. In the present study, the expression of Hrd1 in different encephalic regions was studied in 6-OHDA model of Parkinson's disease by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that Hrd1 was up-regulated in 6-OHDA-treated mice in various encephalic regional neurons, especially those in hippocampus, substantia nigra (SN), subthalamic nucleus (STN), striatum and frontal lobe. It suggested that Hrd1 up-regulation may represent a protective response against neurodegeneration in PD.
