RNA editing by site selective adenosine deamination changes codons in several nuclear transcripts in the mammalian brain and affects critical properties of the encoded proteins, as exemplified by the calcium permeability of AMPA receptor channels. The recently cloned RNA dependent adenosine deaminases ADAR1, ADAR2 and ADAR3 form a small family of sequence-related candidate editases which are expressed in brain and other tissues at distinct levels and patterns. We have employed single-cell polymerase chain reaction of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje and Bergmann glial cells in an attempt to evaluate the expression of these enzymes at a cellular level. We found ADAR2 expressed in all cells analyzed; approximately 50% of the cells co-expressed ADAR1 or ADAR3. The differential ADAR expression revealed by our study might underlie the distinct editing efficiencies and selectivities in different GluR subunit transcripts.
