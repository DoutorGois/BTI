In the hippocampus formation of Bouin fixed and paraffin embedded specimens of Wistar rats somatostatin-immunoreactive cells could be demonstrated regularly in the hilus region. Some cells indicating immunoreactivity have been observed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1- and CA2-regions. On the basis of light microscopic investigations it was not possible to decide whether somatostatin-immunoreactivity is located in the cytoplasm of the cells or in surrounding axon-terminals.
