This review focuses on the epileptic human temporal lobe, primarily on recent findings related to changes in hippocampal GABAergic interneuron circuits that have a central role in epileptogenesis. Relying on correlations to animal studies, we provide a functional interpretation of the different changes in perisomatic inhibition (controlling output synchrony) and dendritic inhibition (controlling input plasticity), and the potential consequences of the loss of interneuron-selective interneurons. The highly heterogeneous, but specific, alterations of GABAergic interneuron circuits have important implications for the pharmacotherapy of epilepsy.
