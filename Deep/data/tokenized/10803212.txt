There are several lines of evidence indicating that membrane AA correlates with the ability of aged rats to sustain LTP. The age-related decrease in membrane AA seems to be triggered by increased lipid peroxidation, which is involved with the decline of LTP. The chronic treatment of DHA could decrease membrane AA without an increase in lipid peroxidation. We have thus investigated the effect of chronic treatment of DHA on hippocampal LTP to assess whether the decrease in membrane AA could directly affect the induction of LTP. The effects of daily supplementation of DHA for 3 months on membrane AA, LTP, and Ca2+ response were evaluated using hippocampal slices from 26-month-old Wistar rats. Chronic treatment of DHA reduced the hippocampal AA significantly, but did not change the amplitude of LTP. Neither 30 mM K+ nor 500 microM NMDA-induced Ca2+ response was affected by chronic treatment of DHA, while the 500 microM carbachol-induced Ca2+ response was reduced. From these results, the reduction of membrane AA might suppress the carbachol-induced Ca2+ response by inhibiting the muscarinic receptor function, IP3 formation and/or Ca2+ release from Ca2+ stores by IP3. However, the reduction of membrane AA is not likely to be a main causal factor of the decline of LTP.
