We have studied the modulation of hippocampal neuron morphological development in vitro using surfaces derivatized with aminosilane self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The efficacies of model SAMs, alone, or in combination with adsorbed heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (HS), are related to the physical and chemical properties of the surfaces. These properties are determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), optical ellipsometry, and wettability measurements. The ability of surfaces to promote somal adhesion and the maintenance of discrete neurites appears to be sensitive to the density and accessibility of positively charged amine or amide groups, and has less of an apparent relationship to the surface density of uncharged amines. Aromatic ring-containing aminosilanes are ineffective in promoting neuron growth, while adsorbed HS augments the neurite-promoting capacity of one marginally adhesive SAM. These results are relevant to an improved understanding of the 'non-specific' contributions of the substrate in affecting neuronal development and the rational design of model surface coatings for neuronal culture.
