Previously a distinct D1-like dopamine receptor (DAR) that selectively couples to phospholipase C/phosphatidylinositol (PLC/PI) was proposed. However, lack of a selective agonist has limited efforts aimed at characterizing this receptor. We characterized the in vitro and in vivo effects of SKF83959 in regulating PI metabolism. SKF83959 stimulates (EC50, 8 micro m) phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis in membranes of frontal cortex (FC) but not in membranes from PC12 cells expressing classical D1A DARs. Stimulation of FC PI metabolism was attenuated by the D1 antagonist, SCH23390, indicating that SKF83959 activates a D1-like DAR. The PI-linked DAR is located in hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum and FC. Most significantly, administration of SKF83959 induced accumulations of IP3 in striatum and hippocampus. In contrast to other D1 DAR agonists, SKF83959 did not increase cAMP production in brain or in D1A DAR-expressing PC12 cell membranes. However, SKF83959 inhibited cAMP elevation elicited by the D1A DAR agonist, SKF81297, indicating that the compound is an antagonist of the classical D1A DAR. Lastly, we demonstrated that SKF83959 enhances [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding to membrane Galphaq and Galphai proteins, suggesting that PI stimulation is mediated by activation of these guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Results indicate that SKF83959 is a selective agonist for the PI-linked D1-like DAR, providing a unique tool for investigating the functions of this brain D1 DAR subtype.
