Hippocampal responses to electrical stimulation of the prepyriform cortex in the cat were studied both in acute experiments under halothane anesthesia and in awake cats with chronically indwelling electrodes. Analysis of field potentials and unit activity indicated the extent to which different hippocampal subareas were activated, the laminar level at which the synaptic action took place and the dynamics of the evoked responses. It was found that: (1) the main generator of evoked responses in the hippocampus upon prepyriform cortex stimulation is localized in the fascia dentata and CA3 (CA1 pyramidal cells, and probably also subiculum cells, are activated but in a lesser degree); (2) the initial synaptic activity takes place at the most distal part of the dendrites of fascia dentata granuhat leads to a transient increase in the firing rate of the hippocampal units, which is often followed by a long-lasting decrease in firing rate. We conclude that the pathway from the prepyriform cortex via lateral entorhinal cortex to hippocampal neurons may enable olfactory inputs to effectively excite hippocampal neurons.
