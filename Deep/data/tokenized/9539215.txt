Several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, are characterized by sensorimotor gating deficits. Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response is an operational measure assessing sensorimotor gating and has been found to be reduced in schizophrenic patients. Much attention has therefore been paid to the neuronal mechanisms underlying the disruption of prepulse inhibition. The activity of limbic forebrain structures such as the septohippocampal system, the prefrontal cortex, and the nucleus accumbens has been the main focus of recent research into the regulation of prepulse inhibition in rats. We here provide a functional anatomical picture of forebrain structures probably involved in the regulation of prepulse inhibition. Stimulation of the ventral hippocampus with a subconvulsive dose of N-methyl-D-aspartate caused a significant and long-lasting disruption of prepulse inhibition. Immunostaining of the c-Fos protein revealed a characteristic pattern of neuronal activity in various forebrain areas, including the nucleus accumbens and different frontal cortical areas after hippocampal stimulation. Based on the present findings, we conclude that the overactivity within a network of cortico-limbic forebrain structures compromises the normal processing of sensory stimuli by disrupting a neuronal filter mechanism. Interestingly, there is a considerable overlap between the pattern of neuronal activity observed in our study and the brain pathology in schizophrenics reported in the literature.
