Quantitative receptor autoradiography demonstrated that muscarinic receptors were down-regulated in Wistar rats after repeated exposure to diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate. The density of receptors was decreased to 60-85% of the controls. Reductions in muscarinic receptor binding were observed in cortex, caudate-putamen, lateral septum, hippocampal formation, superior colliculus, and pons. The density of muscarinic receptors was unchanged in thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei, periaqueductal grey, cerebellum, inferior colliculus and reticular formation of the brain stem. The down-regulation of muscarinic receptors in forebrain structures, such as cortex, caudate-putamen and hippocampus, may be important in the adaptation to the behavioral effects of organophosphate poisons.
