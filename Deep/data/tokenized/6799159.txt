Power spectra of the spontaneous electrical activity of CA1 field of dorsal hippocampus and the amplitude of responses evoked to commissural stimulation were compared in waking Mice. The magnitude of excitatory post-synaptic potentials was found to be positively correlated with the power in 5 and 6 Hz while this correlation became negative for 8-9 Hz. Similar, although weaker correlations were found for the population spike responses and for a late potential, suggesting that different types of modulation are involved.
