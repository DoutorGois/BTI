In the central nervous system glutamate dehydrogenase appears to be strongly involved in the metabolism of transmitter glutamate and plays a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In order to identify unequivocally the neural cell types expressing this enzyme, non-radioactive in situ hybridization, using a complementary RNA probe and oligonucleotide probes, was applied to sections of the rat central nervous system and, for comparison with peripheral neural cells, to cervical spinal ganglia. The results were complemented by immunocytochemical studies using a polyclonal antibody against purified glutamate dehydrodenase. Glutamate dehydrogenase messenger RNA was detectable at varying amounts in neurons and glial cells (i.e. astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, Bergmann glia, ependymal cells, epithelial cells of the plexus choroideus) throughout the central nervous system and in neurons and satellite cells of spinal ganglia. In some neuronal populations (e.g., pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, motoneurons of the spinal cord and spinal ganglia neurons) messenger RNA-labelling was higher than in other central nervous system neurons. This is remarkable because the immunostaining of neurons in the central nervous system regions studied was at best weak, whereas a predominantly high level of immunoreactivity was detected in astrocytes (and Bergmann glia). Thus, in neurons of the central nervous system, the detected levels of glutamate dehydrogenase messenger RNA and protein seem to be at variance whereas in peripheral neurons of spinal ganglia both in situ hybridization labelling and immunostaining are intense.
