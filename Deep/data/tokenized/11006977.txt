Seven days after in vivo intrahippocampal administration of NMDA, 3'-OH DNA fragmentations and Bax protein expression were detected in hippocampal neurons of p53+/+ but not p53-/- transgenic mice. Interestingly, neurons showing pycnosis, an early apoptotic phenomena, were present in all genotypes. These results confirm that apoptotic 3'OH DNA fragmentations and Bax protein induction during NMDA-induced apoptosis in adult hippocampal neurons are p53 dependent.
