The relationship between adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition appears more complex than suggested by early reports. We aimed to determine if the duration and task demands of spatial memory training differentially affect hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult male rats were trained in the Morris water maze in a reference memory task for 4 days, or alternatively working memory for either 4 or 14 days. Four days of maze training did not impact neurogenesis regardless of whether reference or working memory paradigms were used. Interestingly, 2 weeks of working memory training using a hidden platform resulted in fewer newborn hippocampal neurons compared with controls that received either cue training or no maze exposure. Stress is a well-established negative regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis. We found that maze training in general, and a working memory task in particular, increased levels of circulating corticosterone after 4 days of training. Our study indicates that working memory training over a prolonged period of time reduces neurogenesis, and this reduction may partially be mediated by increased stress.
