The preventive effect of Hwangryun-Hae-Dok-tang (HHDT, Huanglian-Jie-Du-Tang), a Chinese herbal medicine, and its ingredients on ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury was evaluated in the rat brain. HHDT consists of four herbs, namely, Coptidis rhizoma, Scutellariae radix, Phellodendri cortex, and Gardeniae fructus. Ischemia was induced by intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 120 min and reperfusion was continued for 22 h. HHDT (200 mg/kg), Coptidis rhizoma (100 mg/kg), Scutellariae radix (100 mg/kg), Phellodendri cortex (100 mg/kg), and Gardeniae fructus (100 mg/kg) were orally administered, promptly prior to reperfusion and 2 h after reperfusion. Baicalein, a component of Scutellariae radix, was also examined at a dosage of 50 mg/kg given 2 h apart, promptly prior to and 2 h after reperfusion. Total infarction volume in the ipsilateral hemisphere of ischemia/reperfusion rats was significantly lowered by treatment with HHDT, Scutellariae radix, and balicalein. However, the other ingredient of HHDT did not show any ameliorating effects on total infarction volume. The inhibiting effect of Scutellariae radix on total infarction volume was much higher than that of the others. In addition, HHDT, Scutellariae radix, and baicalein significantly inhibited myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an index of neutrophil infiltration in ischemic brain tissue at about the same rate (30%). There was marked mismatch between total infarction volume and MPO activity in the Scutellariae radix-treated rats but not in the HHDT- and baicalein-treated groups. Our findings suggest that Scutellariae radix as an ingredient of HHDT plays a crucial protective role in ischemia-induced brain injury. In addition, it is apparent that the effect of Scutellariae radix is the result, in part, of baicalein, a compound contained in Scutellariae radix.
