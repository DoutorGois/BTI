OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of modified Wuzi Yanzong Granule (WYG) on memory ability and volume of hippocampus measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: According to the international accepted diagnostic criteria, 36 MCI patients were selected and randomly assigned to two groups equally, the treated group treated with WYG and the control group with placebo, with a course of 3 months for both groups. Besides, 20 healthy subjects were selected as the normal group. The changes of memory ability were observed and the volume of hippocampus was detected by MRI before and after treatment. RESULTS: Memory quotient (MQ) was significantly lower in MCI patients than in healthy subjects (P < 0.01), after treatment it increased in the treated group as compared with that before treatment (P < 0.01), and the increment was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05); the volume of hippocampus, total or that of either side, as well as the increment of the total volume of hippocampus in the treated group were all higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: WYG could improve memory ability in MCI patients and could prevent and treat the hippocampal atrophy to certain degree.
