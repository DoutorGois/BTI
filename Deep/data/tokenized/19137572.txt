The interactions between the mother/parents and their offspring provides socioemotional input, which is essential for the establishment and maintenance of synaptic networks in prefrontal and limbic brain regions. Since glial cells are known to play an important role in developmental and experience-driven synaptic plasticity, the effect of an early adverse emotional experience induced by maternal separation for 1 or 6 h on the expression of the glia specific proteins S100beta and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was quantitatively analyzed in anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and precentral medial cortex. Three animal groups were analyzed at postnatal day 14: (i) separated for 1 h; (ii) separated for 6 h; (iii) undisturbed (control). Twenty-four hours after stress exposure, the stressed brains showed significantly reduced numbers of S100beta-immunoreactive (ir) cells in the anterior cingulate cortex (6-h stress) and in the precentral medial cortex (1- and 6-h stress). Significantly reduced numbers of GFAP-ir cells were observed only in the medial precentral cortex (1- and 6-h stress); no significant changes were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex. No significant changes of the two glial markers were observed in the hippocampus. Double-labeling experiments with GFAP and pCREB revealed pCREB labeling only in the hippocampus, where the stressed brains (1 and 6 h) displayed significantly reduced numbers of GFAP/pCREB-ir glial cells. The observed downregulation of glia-specific marker proteins is in line with our hypothesis that emotional experience can alter glia cell activation in the juvenile limbic system.
