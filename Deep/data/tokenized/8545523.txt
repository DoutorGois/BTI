The effects of long-term treatment (three times a day for 3 weeks) with pharmacologically active doses of the novel anxiolytics and anticovulsants abecarnil (0.5 mg/kg, IP) and imidazenil (0.5 mg/kg, IP) on basal hippocampal acetylcholine release in freely moving rats were compared with those of diazepam (3 mg/kg, IP). Challenge doses of diazepam, abecarnil, and imidazenil decreased the extracellular acetyl-choline concentration in the hippocampus by the same extent in animals chronically treated with the respective drug or vehicle. Moreover, the abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment with diazepam, abecarnil, or imidazenil failed to affect hippocampal acetylcholine release during the first 5 days of withdrawal. In contrast, the acute administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1 mg/kg, IP) 2 days after diazepam withdrawal elicited a marked increase (65%) in acetylcholine release in the hippocampus. Flumazenil failed to induce the same effect 5 days after diazepam withdrawal or 2 or 5 days after discontinuation of long-term treatment with abecarnil or imidazenil. These results indicate that (i) the inhibitory effects of full (diazepam), partial (imidazenil), and selective (abecarnil) benzodiazepine receptor agonists on acetylcholine output in rat hippocampus are not affected by repeated drug administration; (ii) discontinuation of long-term treatment with each type of agonist does not affect hippocampal cholinergic mechanisms; and (iii) flumazenil increases acetylcholine release only in the hippocampus of rats chronically treated with diazepam. Together, these data further differentiate the pharmacology of benzodiazepine receptor full agonists from that of partial and selective agonists.
