The present study investigated whether a 30-minute-a-day transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (short-term TENS) might improve disturbances in memory and affective behaviour in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease. The hypothesis was derived from former studies in which beneficial effects on memory and affective behaviour of Alzheimer patients were found after a daily application of 6-h TENS and a 30-min tactile stimulation. The present data reveal that short-term TENS improved some aspects of verbal and visual short-term and long-term memory. Moreover, patients who had undergone this treatment felt, e.g., less dejected, less gloomy, less irritable, more cheerful, more active, and more alert. They were also more interested in social contacts and participated more in daily activities. After a period of 6 weeks following treatment, the effects on memory as well as the improvements in affective behaviour partially remained.
