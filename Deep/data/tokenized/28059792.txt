There exist several dozen lines of transgenic mice that express human amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked mutations. AbetaPP transgenic mouse lines differ in the types and amounts of Abeta that they generate and in their spatiotemporal patterns of expression of Abeta assemblies, providing a toolkit to study Abeta amyloidosis and the influence of Abeta aggregation on brain function. More complete quantitative descriptions of the types of Abeta assemblies present in transgenic mice and in humans during disease progression should add to our understanding of how Abeta toxicity in mice relates to the pathogenesis of AD. Here, we provide a direct quantitative comparison of amyloid plaque burdens and plaque sizes in four lines of AbetaPP transgenic mice. We measured the fraction of cortex and hippocampus occupied by dense-core plaques, visualized by staining with Thioflavin S, in mice from young adulthood through advanced age. We found that the plaque burdens among the transgenic lines varied by an order of magnitude: at 15 months of age, the oldest age studied, the median cortical plaque burden in 5XFAD mice was already approximately 4.5 times that of 21-month-old Tg2576 mice and approximately 15 times that of 21-24-month-old rTg9191 mice. Plaque-size distributions changed across the lifespan in a line- and region-dependent manner. We also compared the dense-core plaque burdens in the mice to those measured in a set of pathologically-confirmed AD cases from the Nun Study. Cortical plaque burdens in Tg2576, APPSwePS1DeltaE9, and 5XFAD mice eventually far exceeded those measured in the human cohort.
