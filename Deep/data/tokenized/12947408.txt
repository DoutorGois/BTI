Ca(2+)-regulated gene transcription is essential to diverse physiological processes, including the adaptive plasticity associated with learning. We found that basal synaptic input activates the NF-kappa B transcription factor by a pathway requiring the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase CaMKII and local submembranous Ca(2+) elevation. The p65:p50 NF-kappa B form is selectively localized at synapses; p65-deficient mice have no detectable synaptic NF-kappa B. Activated NF-kappa B moves to the nucleus and could directly transmute synaptic signals into altered gene expression. Mice lacking p65 show a selective learning deficit in the spatial version of the radial arm maze. These observations suggest that long-term changes to adult neuronal function caused by synaptic stimulation can be regulated by NF-kappa B nuclear translocation and gene activation.
