Quinacrine, which has been shown to bind to neurones in the peripheral nervous system, was localized in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the guinea-pig brain. In the basal ganglia, different populations of fluorescent nerve cell bodies as well as a dense quinacrine-positive nerve plexus were demonstrated. The possibility that quinacrine-positive neurones contain high levels of ATP is discussed.
