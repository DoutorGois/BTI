Effects of Manganese exposure to pregnant rats on the growth and development of their offsprings were as follows: (1) the gain of body weight and brain weight in the high dose Mn-exposed offspring was significantly lower but the ratio of brain to body weight was significantly higher; (2) in Morris Water Maze Test, the average latency to find the hidden platform in the high dose Mn-exposed offsprings was obviously reduced during the first 5 days. But on the non-platform test day, a much longer length of swimming in the quadrant in which the hidden platform was located previously, although no difference was found for the total distance between them; (3) the immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acid protein and the average density of its products in hippocampus of both the low and high dose Mn-exposed groups, especially of the high dose one, was significantly higher than that of the control group.
