It has been demonstrated that stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) results in enhanced synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and other brain areas. To investigate mechanisms of the PKA-mediated potentiation of synaptic transmission, we used rat hippocampal embryonic cultures. In low-density cultures, paired recordings under the perforated patch demonstrated that 15-min forskolin treatment produced long-lasting potentiation of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) mediated by the cAMP/PKA pathway. eEPSC amplitudes increased to 240 +/- 10% of baseline after 15 min of forskolin treatment (early). After forskolin washout, eEPSCs declined to a potentiated level. Potentiation was sustained for > or = 85 min after forskolin washout and, 60 min after forskolin washout, constituted 152 +/- 7% of baseline (late potentiation). Disruption of presynaptic processes with the whole cell configuration and internal solution containing PKA inhibitor peptide did not affect forskolin-induced potentiation. Disruption of postsynaptic processes, in contrast, impaired early potentiation and abolished late potentiation. Study of mEPSCs confirmed the contribution of postsynaptic mechanisms. Forskolin-induced enhancement of mEPSC frequency observed under the perforated patch was attenuated by the whole cell configuration. Forskolin also induced an increase of mEPSC amplitudes in the perforated patch, but not in the whole cell, experiments. Potentiation of eEPSCs was not activity dependent, persisting in the absence of stimulation. NMDA receptor blockade did not abolish forskolin-induced potentiation. In summary, we demonstrate that forskolin-induced potentiation of eEPSCs was mediated by postsynaptic mechanisms, presumably by upregulation of AMPA receptors by phosphorylation.
