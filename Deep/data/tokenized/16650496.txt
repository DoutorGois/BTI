The modulation of K(+)-evoked [(3)H]-norepinephrine ([(3)H]-NE) release by gabapentin (GBP) and pinacidil (PIN), a known K(ATP) agonist, was examined in human brain slices. We compared the pharmacological effects on NE-release in human epileptic neocortex and epileptic hippocampus to non-epileptic neocortex. GBP (100 microM) decreased [(3)H]-NE release by 22% in non-epileptic neocortical slices, whereas this inhibition was absent in slices from epileptic hippocampus and epileptic neocortex. PIN (10 microM) also reduced [(3)H]-NE release by 30% in non-epileptic neocortical slices and only by 5% in epileptic hippocampal slices. The blockade of voltage-gated calcium channels by omega-conotoxins MVIIA and MVIIC (0.1 microM) reduced [(3)H]-NE release in epileptic and non-epileptic neocortical slices to the same extend. The data show a marked reduction in K(+)-evoked [(3)H]-NE release by GBP and PIN in epileptic hippocampus and neocortex, suggesting an alteration of K(ATP) channel function, whereas the effects of the calcium channel modulators omega-conotoxins MVIIA and MVIIC are similar in both epileptic and non-epileptic neocortex.
