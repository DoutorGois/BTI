In experiments on hippocampal slices from young rats subjected to immobilization-cold stress we observed a pronounced increase in the amplitude of long-term potentiation of focal responses in CA1 area. Daily injections of comenic acid during stress exposure normalized parameters of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.
