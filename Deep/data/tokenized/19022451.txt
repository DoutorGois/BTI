Hydroxytyrosol [4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-benzenediol] is a well known natural polyphenolic component with antioxidative effects from olive oil and an aglycone of acteoside. In order to examine the in vivo metabolism of acteoside to hydroxytyrosol and the distribution of hydroxytyrosol in the blood and brain, microdialysis coupled to a liquid chromatographic system was developed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of free-form hydroxytyrosol in rat blood and brain. Probes were implanted in the jugular vein and the brain hippocampus for blood and brain sampling purposes. Hydroxytyrosol in the microdialysis samples was separated by a reversed-phase C18 column and eluted with a mobile phase containing acetonitrile - 2% acetic acid (pH 2.6) (12:88, v/v), using a flow rate for the mobile phase of 1 mL/min. Fluorescence detection for hydroxytyrosol was set at 281 nm and 316 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Hydroxytyrosol and endogenous interference could be resolved within 10 min by the developed chromatographic method. The results indicated that acteoside was metabolized immediately to hydroxytyrosol in vivo and eliminated rapidly from the blood, and hydroxytyrosol could enter the brain. The blood-to-brain distribution ratio was defined by dividing the area under concentration versus time (AUC) ratio of AUC(brain)/AUC(blood), which represents the AUC for brain and blood. The results suggested that the P-glycoprotein was not involved in the brain efflux transport of hydroxytyrosol.
