Single intraperitoneal injection of melatonin in a dose of 1 mg/kg prevented accumulation of cGMP and intensification of lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus and habenula of rats exposed to acute hypobaric hypoxia (12,000 m). Changes in habenular content of cGMP suggest that melatonin prevents hypoxia-induced activation of heme-oxygenase.
