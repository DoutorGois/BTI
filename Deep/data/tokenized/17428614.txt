Prostaglandins (PGs) are bioactive lipid mediators released following brain hypoxic-ischemic injury. Clearance and re-uptake of these prostaglandins occur via a transmembrane prostaglandin transporter (PGT), which exchanges PG for lactate. We used Western blot analyses to examine the PGT developmental profile and its regional distribution as well as changes in transporter expression during chronic hypoxia in the neonatal mouse brain. Microsomal preparations from four brain regions (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and brainstem/diencephalon) showed gradual increases in prostaglandin transporter expression in all brain regions examined from postnatal day 1 till day 30. There was a significant regional heterogeneity in the prostaglandin transporter expression with highest expression in the cortex, followed by cerebellum and hippocampus, and least expressed in the brainstem/diencephalon. To further delineate the pattern of prostaglandin transporter expression, separate astrocytic and neuronal microsomal preparations were also examined. In contrast to neurons, which had a robust expression of prostaglandin transporters, astrocytes had very little PGT expression under basal conditions. In response to chronic hypoxia, there was a significant decline in PGT expression in vivo and in neurons in vitro, whereas cultured astrocytes increased their PGT expression. This is the first report on PGT expression in the CNS and our studies suggest that PGTs have 1) a widespread distribution in the CNS; 2) a gradual increase and a differential expression in various regions during brain development; and 3) striking contrast in expression between glia and neurons, especially in response to hypoxia. Since PGTs play a role as prostaglandin-lactate exchangers, we hypothesize that PGTs are important in the CNS during stress such as hypoxia.
