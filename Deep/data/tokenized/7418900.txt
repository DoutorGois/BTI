Three kinetic compartments (one extra--and two intracellular) of Na were distinguished in the rat neocortical and hippocampal cuts. Glutamate (Glu) caused the increase of intracellular Na compartments via two mechanisms: by the elevation of Na influx rate constant and by the decrease of Na efflux rate constant. The relationship between the phenomena observed and possible transmitter action of the Glu is discussed.
