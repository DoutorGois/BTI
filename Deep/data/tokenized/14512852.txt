The effect of systemic erythropoietin pretreatment on hypoxic ischemic injury was examined in neonatal mice. Injury was significantly less in cortex, hippocampus, striatum and thalamus of erythropoietin-treated animals (5 U/g vs vehicle) 24 h after hypoxic ischemia and in all of these regions except hippocampus at 7 days. Activated caspase-3- and activated NFkappaB-immunoreactive neurons were observed in the injured areas; these areas were smaller in the erythropoietin group. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating persistent neuroprotective effects of erythropoietin in neonatal mice.
