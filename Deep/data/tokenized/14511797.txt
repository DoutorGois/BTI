It has been hypothesized that schizophrenia could be due to a defect of neural circuitry, that is a misconnection between different cerebral areas, particularly those involved in language processing and production. A group of 28 patients with chronic schizophrenia were investigated in order to detect differences in locations of white matter voxel signal intensity in comparison with a control group of 28 normal subjects matched for age, gender and educational level. Voxel-based morphometry was used to assess the white matter of the brain. Significant voxel signal hypointensity was identified in schizophrenic patients bilaterally (mainly in the left hemisphere) in the post-central gyrus and superior temporal gyrus and unilaterally (in the left hemisphere) in the inferior frontal gyrus-pars triangularis and pars pretriangularis, the medial orbital gyrus, the lateral orbital gyrus and the rectus gyrus. Thus, the white matters of these cerebral areas were structurally modified particularly in the left hemisphere and in those structures that control language and hearing processes.
