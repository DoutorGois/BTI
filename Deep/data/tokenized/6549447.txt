Glucagon-like peptides in the central nervous system (CNS) of man with the immunofluorescence and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method were studied. It has been found that there are immunoreactive glucagon cells present in the hypothalamus hippocampus, amygdaloid nuclei cerebral cortex, and medulla oblongata region. The findings confirm earlier investigations from this laboratory performed along this line.
