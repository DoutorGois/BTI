The effect of a transient increase in extracellular calcium concentration on the Schaffer collateral-commissural evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike responses of CAI pyramidal neurons was investigated using the rat in vitro hippocampal slice preparation. Brief exposure of slices (5-10 min) to twice the normal concentration of calcium (4 mM) induced a marked potentiation of both the excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike that could persist for at least 3 h. No long-term changes were observed in either the presynaptic fiber volley of antidromically evoked CAI population spike, indicating that the potentiation could not be attributed to an increase in the number of fibers activated or a generalized increase in cellular excitability. The response of CAI pyramidal neurons to the iontophoretic application of L-glutamate in the apical dendritic zone was also unaffected after exposure to high calcium perfusate, suggesting a lack of alteration in membrane excitability or receptor sensitivity restricted to the region of synaptic input. In addition, total intracellular calcium content of individual slices, measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, was significantly increased for at least 1 h following return to the control medium. These data indicate that brief exposure of in vitro hippocampal slices to a high extracellular calcium concentration results in a long-term increase in synaptic efficacy which is similar in many respects to long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation of hippocampal excitatory afferents. The results further suggest that the mechanisms underlying calcium-induced long-term potentiation may reside in presynaptic components and involve an enhanced transmitter release.
