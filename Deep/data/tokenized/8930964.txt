Calbindin-D28K (Calbindin) is a member of the superfamily of calcium-binding proteins that is implicated in the regulation of intracellular calcium. In the adult mammalian brain, calbindin was thought to be present only in neurones, where it is believed to serve a neuroprotective role. We now report the expression of calbindin after ischaemia in reactive astrocytes in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. Since other calcium-binding proteins, such as S-100 and calmodulin, which induce transformation or proliferation of glia, occur in astrocytes, it is conceivable that the expression of calbindin after ischaemia might be an important part of the process of gliosis.
