Ethanol-sensitive LSIBG and ethanol-insensitive SSIBG mice were exposed to ethanol (23.5% ethanol-derived calories) for 4 months. Half of the animals was sacrificed at this time and the other half was withdrawn from the ethanol diet for 1 month. GABA immunoelectron microscopy was used to study the impact of the treatments on synaptic contacts in the dentate molecular layer. In the LS mice a significant loss of non-GABAergic axospinous synapses (26.7%; p < 0.05) was observed during ethanol exposure which was followed by a loss of GABAergic synapses on dendritic shafts (54.7%; p < 0.01) during withdrawal. In the SS mice there was a significant decrease in the non-GABAergic axospinous synapses (23.5%; p < 0.05) and a significant increase in axodendritic synapses (63.3%; p < 0.05) during ethanol exposure. The observed changes in the GABAergic and non-GABAergic innervation of the dentate fascia induced by ethanol were observed in the projection zone of the perforant path. They could adversely affect the hippocampal physiology with a consequent impairment of mnemonic functions.
