In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1 and -2 (PGHS-1 and PGHS-2) are expressed throughout the latter half of gestation in ovine fetal brain and pituitary. Hypothalamus, pituitary, hippocampus, brainstem, cortex and cerebellum were collected from fetal sheep at 80, 100, 120, 130, 145days of gestational age (DGA), 1 and 7days postpartum lambs, and from adult ewes (n=4-5 per group). mRNA and protein were isolated from each region, and expression of prostaglandin synthase-1 (PGHS-1) and -2 (PGHS-2) were evaluated using real-time RT-PCR and western blot. PGHS-1 and -2 were detected in every brain region at every age tested. Both enzymes were measured in highest abundance in hippocampus and cerebral cortex, and lowest in brainstem and pituitary. PGHS-1 and -2 mRNA's were upregulated in hypothalamus and pituitary after 100 DGA. The hippocampus exhibited decreases in PGHS-1 and increases in PGHS-2 mRNA after 80 DGA. Brainstem PGHS-1 and -2 and cortex PGHS-2 exhibited robust increases in mRNA postpartum, while cerebellar PGHS-1 and -2 mRNA's were upregulated at 120 DGA. Tissue concentrations of PGE(2) correlated with PGHS-2 mRNA, but not to other variables. We conclude that the regulation of expression of these enzymes is region-specific, suggesting that the activity of these enzymes is likely to be critical for brain development in the late-gestation ovine fetus.
