The activity of 41 visual cortex and 20 hippocampal neurons from field CA1 was registered in experiments using oddball-stimulation with different color stimuli varied in intensity. 34% cortical and 37% hippocampal neurons demonstrated plasticity reactions. The significant increase of latest phases of neuronal activity (200-500 and 200-1000 ms after stimulation for cortical neurons and 300-550 ms for hippocampal neurons) was shown in responses to rare deviant stimuli, which had a less intensity than frequently standards. The quantity of the earliest neuronal phase of activity (40-120 ms after stimulation) was stabilized in responses to deviants and standards during the experiment. We propose that such increase of the latest phases of neuronal activity (the limited plasticity) may reflect the mechanisms of orienting reaction.
