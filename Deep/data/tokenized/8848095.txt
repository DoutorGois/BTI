The possible modulation by D1 drugs of learning abilities of a population of aged memory-impaired animals was investigated in the present study. The level of D1/[3H]SCH 23390 receptors was first examined by quantitative autoradiography to ascertain if cognitive deficits seen in these animals could be related to alterations in the levels of these receptors. No significant differences in [3H]SCH 23390 binding were observed in any of the brain areas examined between young, and aged memory-unimpaired and aged memory-impaired animals. However, the cognitive deficits of the aged-impaired rats were modulated by D1 drugs. The D1 agonists SKF 38393 and SKF 81297 (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the latency period to find a hidden platform in the Morris Water Maze, reflecting improved cognitive functions, while the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) had no overall significant effect. Moreover, the D1 agonist SKF 38393 increased, whereas the antagonist inhibited, in vivo hippocampal acetylcholine release. Taken together, these results suggest that functional hippocampal acetylcholine-dopamine interactions exist in aged memory-impaired rats. More importantly, the cognitive deficits seen in the aged-impaired rats can be attenuated by stimulations of D1 receptors, hence suggesting an alternative approach to alleviate the cognitive deficits seen in the aged brain.
