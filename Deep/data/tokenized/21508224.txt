Adapting successfully to new situations relies on integrating memory of similar circumstances with the outcomes of past actions. Here, we tested how reward history and recent memory influenced coding by orbital prefrontal cortex (OFC) neurons. Rats were trained to find food in plus maze tasks that required both the OFC and the hippocampus, and unit activity was recorded during stable performance, reversal learning, and strategy switching. OFC firing distinguished different rewarded paths, journeys from a start arm to a goal arm. Activity of individual cells and the population correlated with performance as rats learned newly rewarded outcomes. Activity was similar during reversal, an OFC-dependent task, and strategy switching, an OFC-independent task, suggesting that OFC associates information about paths and outcomes both when it is required for performance and when it is not. Path-selective OFC cells fired differently during overlapping journeys that led to different goals or from different starts, resembling journey-dependent coding by hippocampal neurons. Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded simultaneously in the OFC and the hippocampus oscillated coherently in the theta band (5-12 Hz) during stable performance. LFP coherence diminished when rats adapted to altered reward contingencies and followed different paths. Thus, OFC neurons appear to participate in a distributed network including the hippocampus that associates spatial paths, recent memory, and integrated reward history.
