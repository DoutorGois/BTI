Copper is an essential trace element which forms an integral component of many enzymes. While trace amounts of copper are needed to sustain life, excess copper is extremely toxic in the brain. Also, ethanol intake causes morphological changes in the brain. The present study aims to investigate effects of copper overload with ethanol intake in hippocampal neuron numbers of rat brain. Control and experimental group of rats (n = 6 for each group) were fed ad libitum. Experimental group were given ethanol with copper in drinking water each day for ten days. Control group animals were given only drinking water during this period. Afterwards, animals were decapitated and their brains were removed by craniotomy. Frozen brains were cut by a cryostat. Sections collected via systematic random sampling were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. On microscopic images obtained from pyramidal cell layers in hippocampus, total neuron numbers were estimated using the optical fractionator method. We observed that pyramidal neuron numbers in the subdivisions of hippocampus were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group. These results suggest that copper overdose with ethanol intake can cause neuronal loss in hippocampus of rat brain.
