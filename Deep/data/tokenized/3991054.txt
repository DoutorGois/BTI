Lesioning of serotonergic (5-HT) fibers using 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) in one of the two median raphe-hippocampal pathways induced homotypic sprouting from the other. We have utilized this model with the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tracing technique to test the effects of an adrenal corticosteroid-corticosterone on homotypic sprouting in female adult rats. Removal of the adrenal glands does not interfere with the 5,7-DHT destruction of 5-HT fibers observed at 3 days. However, the animals without circulating adrenal steroids do not show the increase of the HRP-labeled cells normally seen 21 days after the 5,7-DHT lesions. Furthermore, s.c. implantation of corticosterone pellets was able to completely restore homotypic sprouting of 5-HT fibers in the hippocampus.
