During normal development of the nervous system, the target fields influence the survival and differentiation of projection neurons, but the factors regulating this interaction remain obscure. In the present study, we have raised the question whether the target region is essential for the postnatal development and maintenance of two different types of central projection neurons, cholinergic and GABAergic septohippocampal cells. In early postnatal rats (P5, P10), the hippocampus was eliminated by unilateral intrahippocampal injections of the excitotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate. After a long survival time (at P70), we have immunostained serial sections of the septal region with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the acetylcholine-synthesizing enzyme, or the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PARV) which is known to be contained in GABAergic septohippocampal neurons. In the medial septum ipsilateral to the lesioned side, about 60% of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons and 62% of PARV-immunoreactive neurons were found in adulthood even after complete elimination of the hippocampus. Some immunoreactive cells appeared heavily shrunken, but electron microscopic analysis revealed ultrastructural characteristics typical for medial septal neurons obtained from controls. Our results indicate that target elimination during development affected both types of projection cells, although only the cholinergic cells are known to be responsive to target-derived factors.
