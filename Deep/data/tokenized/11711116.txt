Two distinct periods of sensitivity to elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels during postnatal development of the pituitary-adrenal axis were studied. Wistar rats were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with cortisol (1 mg/kg) on postnatal days 1-5 or 14-18. The steroid treatment during the first postnatal week resulted in a decrease of the morning basal and stress-induced plasma corticosterone levels in 30 day-old male rats, as well as in rats that were injected with cortisol on the third postnatal week. Stress-induced corticosterone levels in 90-day old cortisol-treated rats were determined in blood samples drawn from the tail vein before the restraint stress, immediately after the 20-min long stress, then 60 and 180 min afterwards. Only the rats treated with cortisol during the third week showed a prolonged stress-induced corticosterone secretion, with the highest corticosterone level in 180 min after the restraint stress. The early neonatal cortisol treatment had no effect on (3)H-corticosterone binding in all studied brain areas of the 90-day old rats. The rats treated with cortisol at the 14-17th postnatal days showed a significantly lower (3)H-corticosterone binding in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. These findings suggest that the third week of life in rats is more sensitive to elevated levels of corticosterone than the first one. The high level of glucocorticoids at this period has long-term effects on the efficiency of the negative feedback mechanisms provided by hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.
