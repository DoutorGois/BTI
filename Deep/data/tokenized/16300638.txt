Oxidative damage of biological macromolecules is a hallmark of most neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and diffuse Lewy body diseases. Another important phenomenon involved in these disorders is the alteration of iron homeostasis, with an increase in iron levels. The present study investigated whether 6-hydroxymelatonin (6-OHM) can reduce Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation and necrotic cell damage in the rat hippocampus in vivo. It was found that 6-OHM administration proved successful in reducing Fe2+-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampus. This study provides some evidence of the neuroprotective effects of 6-OHM.
