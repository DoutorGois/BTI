Significant increases in local cerebral blood flow during lithium-pilocarpine (Li-P) induced seizure have been reported. We recently found that both acetone and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) showed anticonvulsive effects in status epilepticus induced by Li-P in rats. In this study, we examined whether MEK also suppressed the enhancement of local cerebral blood flow induced by Li-P with a simplified autoradiographic method using [(14)C]-para-iodo-N-isopropyl amphetamine ([(14)C]-IMP). Significant increases in local cerebral blood flow in the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum were observed in Li-P induced status epilepticus rats. Pretreatment with MEK (8 mmol/kg) completely suppressed the enhancement of local cerebral blood flow to or below the control level in all regions.
