During a postnatal critical period balance of excitation/inhibition in the developing brain is highly regulated by environmental signals. Compared to the visual cortex, rare document includes effects of sensory experience on the hippocampus, which is also bombarded by sensory signals. In this study, basic and tetanized field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in CA1 area of hippocampus of light-(LR) and dark-reared (DR) rats (at 2, 4 and 6weeks of age). Also, we assessed age- and activity-dependent changes in the N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors subunit compositions and, GABA producing enzymes. While the sensory deprivation increased amplitude of baseline fEPSPs, it decreased degree of potentiation of post-tetanus responses. Expression of GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of AMPA receptors was increased across age in DR rats. In contrast to LR rats, mRNA and protein expression of GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors was decreased in DR ones. Also, dark rearing diminished expression of GABA synthesis enzymes GAD65 and GAD67. These results indicate that, sensory experience adjusts synaptic plasticity and might also affect the balance of excitation/inhibition in the hippocampus.
