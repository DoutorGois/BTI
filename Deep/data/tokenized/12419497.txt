Previous studies show that neuropeptide Y (NPY) inhibits in vitro seizures in rodent hippocampus. Here, we explored the effect of NPY application on epileptiform discharges induced by perfusion with magnesium-free solution in slices of entorhinal cortex from two different mouse strains. NPY significantly reduced the duration of epileptiform discharges with a peak effect of 36-50%. This is the first study showing anti-epileptiform effect of NPY in the entorhinal cortex and also the first evidence that NPY inhibits seizures in a cortical region in mice. The entorhinal cortex has a central role in transferring information between the hippocampus and the rest of the brain. Therefore our data further strengthen the concept of NPY and its receptors as widespread regulators of epileptiform activity and as a potential future target for antiepileptic therapy.
