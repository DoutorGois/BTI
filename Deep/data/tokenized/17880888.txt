Fast ripples are EEG transients emanating from epileptic foci, but fast-ripple frequencies far exceed maximal neuronal firing rates. In this issue of Neuron, Menendez de la Prida and coworkers propose that out-of-phase firing of a subpopulation of neurons during physiological ripple activity effectively doubles the ripple frequency to produce fast ripples.
