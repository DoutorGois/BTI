It has been shown on frogs with epileptogenic focus induced by the injection of penicillin (1000 U in 0.4 ml) into the hippocamp that preinjection (or injection on the background of the functioning epileptogenic focus) of strophanthin (1.8 and 0.18 microgram/g) or digoxin (1.2 micrograms/g) into spinal lymphaticus sac led to a sharp increase in interparoxysmal epileptiform discharges and electrographic correlates of fits on the ECG. The influence of cardiac glycosides upon the epileptized cerebral neurons is thought to be associated with the capacity of these drugs to inhibit Na+, K+-ATPase of neurons and their axons resulting in the disturbance of cerebral mediator activity.
