The pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include extracellular neuritic plaques containing beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide, a cleaved fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP) via beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is increasingly thought to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD, both as a regulator of the production of Abeta and through its well-established role as a tau kinase. Fuzhisan (FZS), a Chinese herbal complex prescription, has been used for the treatment AD for over 20 years, and is known to enhance the cognitive ability in AD patients as well as in AD model rats. To investigate mechanisms of AD and the potential therapy of FZS in AD, we treated senescence-accelerated mouse SAMP8 mice, a useful model of AD-related memory impairment, with FZS by intragastrical administration for 8 weeks and Donepizel was used as a positive control. The results showed that FZS (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 g/kg/day) improved impaired cognitive ability of aged SAMP8 mice in a dose-dependent manner. FZS robustly decreased Abeta level and phosphorylation of tau. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the BACE1 level and phosphorylated APP (Thr668). Futhermore, The p25/Cdk5 pathway was markedly down-regulated by FZS treatment. These results indicated that the memory ameliorating effect of FZS may be, in part, by regulation the p25/Cdk5 pathway which may contribute to down-regulation of Abeta and tau hyperphosphorylation.
