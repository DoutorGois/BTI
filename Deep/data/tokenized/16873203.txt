The HIV envelope protein, gp120, has been proposed to be a key agent in the development of AIDS dementia complex (ADC). To elucidate CNS effects that gp120 alone may be inducing in ADC, the present study investigated changes in weight, motor activity, cognitive function and corresponding neuropathology in rats given daily bilateral infusions of gp120 intracerebroventricularly for 7 days. gp120 inhibited weight gain, but had no measurable effects on motor activity or water maze cognitive performance. Nonetheless, gp120 infusions did induce both hippocampal and neostriatal atrophy. Thus, gp120 alone can cause ADC-related neuropathologic and weight changes, but gp120 alone was not sufficient to induce impairments in spatial learning and memory.
