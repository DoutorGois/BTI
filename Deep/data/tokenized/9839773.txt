Synaptophysin (SY) is a protein expressed at presynaptic vesicles. SY immunohistochemistry (IHC) was undertaken in surgically resected hippocampal specimens from 25 patients with intractable epilepsy. All were investigated with chronic ictal EEG videotelemetry, which showed a temporal onset in each case, and all had normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The density of reaction product of SY IHC was used to generate optical density (OD) measurements as an estimate of synaptic density in CA1 and CA4 fields (ODCA1 and ODCA4), and inner third and outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (ODIML and ODOML). There was significant correlation between ODCA1 (r=0.619, P=0.001) and ODCA4 (r=0.639, P=0.001) and onset age of epilepsy. There was no correlation between ODCA1 and duration of epilepsy. There was correlation between ODCA4 and duration (r=-0.412, P=0.041), but partial correlations showed no significant correlation between ODCA4 and duration when controlling for onset, although correlation between ODCA4 and onset when controlling for duration remained significant (r=0.536, P < 0.01). Univariate ANOVA revealed onset age to be the only predictor of ODCA1 and ODCA4. Chronological age and duration were not predictors. There was no correlation between ODIML or ODOML and either onset age or duration. ODIML and ODOML were not predicted by onset age, duration or chronological age. These findings support the hypothesis that the major cause of hippocampal sclerosis is an age specific insult rather than the result of repeated seizures.
