Studies were carried out on cats by bipolar electrodes implanted into symmetrical points of somatosensory cortical areas, caudate nuclei, hippocampus, lateral geniculate bodies, reticular formation of the midbrain after section of the half of midbrain tegmentum and commissural systems of the brain. Animals with sections usually have asymmetry of sleep EEG. The phenomenon is revealed of the coexistence of slow-wave and paradoxal sleep in different brain halves.
