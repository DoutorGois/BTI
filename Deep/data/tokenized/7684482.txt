Recent studies suggest a role for the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in the repair of damaged tissue following hypoxic-ischemic injury in the infant rat brain. We have used a unilateral model of hypoxic-ischemic injury to assess the possible involvement of two IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5, in the post-asphyxial response. Ligation of the right carotid artery of 21-day-old rats was followed by either 15 min or 60 min exposure to 8% oxygen to produce moderate and severe damage respectively. Using in situ hybridization, the distribution of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 mRNA was determined in brains collected over 10 days following the insult. In the control brains (no damage), both IGFBPs were expressed in distinct regions. IGFBP-4 mRNA was detected in limited areas of the hippocampus and in several cortical layers, while IGFBP-5 mRNA was found primarily in the thalamus. In response to hypoxic-ischemic injury, IGFBP-4 mRNA expression was reduced in regions of neuronal loss, suggesting a neuronal origin for IGFBP-4. The expression of IGFBP-5 mRNA was not altered by the 15 min insult, but was heavily induced from 3 days following the 60 min insult, particularly in the subependymal layer and adjacent white matter on the ligated hemisphere. This suggests that IGFBP-5 may be involved in recovery from severe hypoxic-ischemic injury and may be important in the regeneration of oligodendrocytes.
