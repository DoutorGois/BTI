Male Fischer-344 rats aged 6, 12, or 24 months were subjected to four-vessel occlusion cerebral ischemia to assess age-dependent ischemic vulnerability of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons based on choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15) activities. Activities of both enzymes were similar (p greater than 0.05) in 6- (n = 5) and 12- (n = 5) month-old rats. Mean +/- SEM choline acetyltransferase activities in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum of 6-month-old controls were 75 +/- 5, 123 +/- 9, 415 +/- 9, and 50 +/- 4 nmol acetylcholine/hr/mg protein, respectively, and were 20-30% lower (p less than 0.05) in all brain regions except the cerebellum in 24-month-old controls. Choline acetyltransferase activity was unaffected by ischemia in 6- and 12-month-old rats but was reduced by 30-60% in 24-month-old rats. Mean +/- SEM glutamic acid decarboxylase activities in the cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum of 6-month-old controls were 98 +/- 8, 86 +/- 7, 144 +/- 13, and 125 +/- 9 nmol gamma-aminobutyric acid/hr/mg protein, respectively, and 25-35% lower in all regions of 24-month-old controls. After 30 minutes of ischemia and 5 days of recovery, glutamic acid decarboxylase activities were reduced (p less than 0.05) in all brain regions and age groups. However, its activity was decreased (p less than 0.05 compared with age-matched controls) by 55% in the cortex and 79% in the hippocampus of 24-month-old rats compared with 30% and 45% in younger rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
