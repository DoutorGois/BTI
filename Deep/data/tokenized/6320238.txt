Parameters of dentate gyrus field potentials evoked by stimulation of the perforant path were studied in freely moving rats before and after repeated footshock application. An increase of population-EPSP steepness and a shortening of population spike latency was demonstrated immediately after the footshocks. These results indicate control for variables in behavior should be included in studies of monosynaptic potentials.
