The effects of NC-1100 on the central nervous system were analyzed behaviorally and electroencephalographically in mice, rabbits and mongolian gerbils, using ifenprodil as a control material. NC-1100 showed potentiating effects on spontaneous locomotor activities and excitatory motor activities induced by methamphetamine, but did not affect the rotarod test, traction test, sleeping time induced by pentobarbital, analgesic test, anticonvulsant test (MES and pentetrazol test), body temperature and group toxicity induced by methamphetamine. Following i.v. injection of NC-1100 to rabbits with chronically implanted electrodes, electroencephalographic properties in spontaneous EEGs such as fast waves with low voltages in the neocortex became distinguished slightly. Seizure discharges produced by stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus were slightly inhibited, but arousal responses produced by stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation or the posterior hypothalamic area were not inhibited. Furthermore, the effects of NC-1100 on functional recovery after transient cerebral ischemia in gerbils were not distinct. Based on these results, NC-1100 was considered to be an agent that improves cerebral metabolism and selectively increases cerebrovascular blood flow with few central nervous actions.
