BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Estrogen-related neuroprotection in association with animal models of transient forebrain and focal ischemia has been documented in several recent reports. Some of those studies indicated that part of that benefit was a function of improved intraischemic vasodilating capacity. In the present study we examined whether chronic estrogen depletion and repletion affected ischemic neuropathology through perfusion-independent mechanisms. METHODS: Normal, ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX female rats treated with 17beta-estradiol (E2) were subjected to 30 minutes of transient forebrain ischemia (right common carotid occlusion plus hemorrhagic hypotension) and reperfusion. Neurological function and brain histopathology were assessed over the 72-hour recovery period. In all rats, preischemic and intraischemic cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF) levels were monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry. In additional rats, CBF changes in the striatum and hippocampus were also monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry probes and radiolabeled microspheres. In each experiment, the level of ischemia was targeted to a 75% to 80% reduction in cortical CBF. RESULTS: The similarity in ischemic severity among groups was supported by measurements of comparable patterns of electroencephalographic power changes during the ischemic period. Compared with normal females, OVX rats showed diminished neurological outcomes and more severe histopathology in the hippocampus and striatum. Two-week treatment of OVX rats with E2 was accompanied by postischemic neuropathological changes similar to those seen in normal females. Intraischemic CBF reductions in the hippocampus and striatum were similar in all groups (to 35% to 50% of the preischemic value) but significantly less than the cortical CBF reductions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that estrogen provides ischemic neuroprotection through mechanisms unrelated to improvement of intraischemic cerebral perfusion.
