Hypoxic encephalopathy is a common cause of neonatal seizures and long-term neurological abnormalities. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may have multiple functions in brain. The aim of this study is to investigate whether sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a H2S donor, provides protection against neonatal hypoxia-induced neurobehavioral deficits. Neonatal mice were subjected to hypoxia (5% oxygen for 120min) at postnatal day 1 and received NaHS (5.6mg/kg) once daily for 3d. Neurobehavioral toxicity was examined at 3-30d after hypoxia. Treatment with NaHS significantly attenuated the delayed development of sensory and motor reflexes induced by hypoxia up to two weeks after the insult. Moreover, NaHS improved the learning and memory performance of hypoxic animals as indicated in Morris water maze test at 30d after hypoxia. In mice exposed to hypoxia, treatment with NaHS enhanced expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the protective effects of NaHS were associated with its ability to repress the hypoxia-induced nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and nitric oxide production in the hippocampus of mice brain. Taken together, these results suggest that the long-lasting beneficial effects of NaHS on hypoxia-induced neurobehavioral deficits are mediated, at least in part, by inducing BDNF expression and suppressing NOS activity in the brain of mice.
