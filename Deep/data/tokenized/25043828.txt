Poststroke seizures are considered to be the major cause of epilepsy in the elderly. The mechanisms of poststroke seizures remain unclear. A history of diabetes mellitus has been identified as an independent predictor of acute poststroke seizures in stroke patients. The present study sought to reveal the mechanisms for the development of postischemic seizures under hyperglycemic conditions. Transient forebrain ischemia was produced in adult Wistar rats by using the four-vessel occlusion method. At the normal blood glucose level, seizures occurred in approximately 50% of rats after 25 min of ischemia. However, in rats with hyperglycemia, the incidence rate of postischemic seizures was significantly increased to 100%. The occurrence of postischemic seizures was not correlated with the severity of brain damage in hyperglycemic rats. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic agent, could neither prevent postischemic seizures nor alleviate the exacerbated brain damage in the presence of hyperglycemia. K(+) channels play a critical role in controlling neuronal excitability. The expression of A-type K(+) channel subunit Kv4.2 in the hippocampus and the cortex was significantly reduced in hyperglycemic rats with seizures compared with those without seizures. These results suggest that the reduction of Kv4.2 expression could contribute to the development of postischemic seizures in hyperglycemia.
