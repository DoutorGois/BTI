To investigate the effect of ketamine administration on memory consolidation, p-CREB and c-fos expression in hippocampus of infant rats and the possible mechanism. Ninety-six SD rats of 21 days old were divided into seven groups, Y-maze was used to test the ability of learning and memory for minor rats. p-CREB and c-fos protein expression was tested by immunhistochemistry. The results showed that the memory consolidation rate in normal saline group mice was higher than that in k1a and k7a group (P<0.05). However, normal saline group between k1b and k7b group was not significant difference. The p-CREB and c-fos protein expressing cells of normal saline group were higher than those in passive control group, pseudotraining group, k1a and k7a group (P<0.05). However, there was not significant difference between normal saline group and k1b or k7b group. The c-fos protein expressing cells of pseudotraining group was higher than those in passive control group, however, the p-CREB protein expressing cells was not significant difference. Therefore, administration of ketamine may temporally affect the ability of memory consolidation rate of minor rats through suppressing the expression of p-CREB and c-fos protein in hippocampus.
