Aneurysms of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) are infrequent and located in the central depth of the brain. Hence their optimal microsurgical management has not been discussed systematically, as institutions and/or neurosurgeons have only limited experience. The purpose of this communication is to report our considerations on this topic with emphasis on the selection of approaches by reviewing our 20 consecutive cases of PCA aneurysms out of more than 1,000 aneurysm patients seen over the past 15 years. Although the subtemporal approach appears to be prevalent in the literature, in our series we applied the pterional approach with or without selective extradural anterior clinoidectomy (SEAC) for P1, P1-P2 aneurysms, and either a selective amygdalohippocampectomy approach (SAHEA) or supracerebellar transtentorial approach (SCTTA) for P2 and P2-P3 aneurysms. Construction of an extracranial-intracranial EC-IC bypass, when necessary, in conjunction with parent artery occlusion or with trapping of aneurysms was adapted to selected approaches.
