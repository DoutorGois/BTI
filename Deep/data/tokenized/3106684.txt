L-threo-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPS), a norepinephrine (NE) precursor, 3 mg/kg, i.v., increased the cerebral blood flow (CBF) in both the striatum and hippocampus as well as the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in urethane-anesthetized rats, as NE infusion did. The L-DOPS induced increase in CBF was inhibited by benserazide (3 mg/kg/hour), a peripheral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, and propranolol (3 mg/kg, i.p.), a beta-adrenoceptor blocker as well. These results suggest that the effects of L-DOPS may be attributed to the action of NE formed from L-DOPS, and the action may be mediated by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptor.
