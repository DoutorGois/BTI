Vacuolar proton ATPase accumulates protons inside various intracellular organelles such as synaptic vesicles; its membrane domain V0 could also be involved in membrane fusion. These different functions could require vacuolar proton ATPases possessing different V0 subunit a isoforms. In vertebrates, four genes encode isoforms a1-a4, and a1 variants are also generated by alternative splicing. We identified a novel a1 splice variant a1-IV and showed that the two a1 variants containing exon C are specifically expressed in neurons. Single neurons coexpress a2, a1-I, and a1-IV, and these subunit a isoforms are targeted to different membrane compartments. Recombinant a2 was accumulated in the trans-Golgi network, and a1-I was concentrated in axonal varicosities, whereas a1-IV was sorted to both distal dendrites and axons. Our results indicate that alternative splicing of exon N controls differential sorting of a1 variants to nerve terminals or distal dendrites, whereas exon C regulates their neuronal expression.
