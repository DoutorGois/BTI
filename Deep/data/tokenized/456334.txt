The effect of gamma-hydroxy, gamma-ethyl, gamma-phenyl-butyramide (HEPB) on afterdischarges produced by hippocampal stimulation in cats was studied. HEPB notably diminished the duration of afterdischarges and in some cats blocked their propagation into the substantia nigra and the amygdala. HEPB treatment also antagonized the enhancement of afterdischarge duration produced by subconvulsive doses of bicuculline, whereas treatment with diphenylhydantoin strongly potentiated this effect of bicuculline. The intracisternal injection of HEPB or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mice resulted in a potentiation of strychnine-induced convulsions. On the other hand, neurochemical experiments in mouse brain cortex slices and in synaptosomes demonstrated that HEPB did not affect the high affinity uptake of [3H] GABA, its spontaneous or Ca2+ dependent release stimulated by depolarizing K+ concentrations, and its Na+ independent binding to synaptic plasma membranes.
