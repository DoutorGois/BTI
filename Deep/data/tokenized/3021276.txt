S-100 is a calcium-binding, glial protein which has been shown to be involved in behavioral learning and memory tasks. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic efficacy evoked by repetitive afferent stimulation. When anti-S-100 serum is applied by pressure ejection onto the stratum radiatum of area CA1 of the hippocampal slice, the amplitude of the extracellularly recorded population spike is not affected. However, repetitive stimulation of the afferents during S-100 application failed to produce LTP. At a distant site in the same slice, LTP occurs normally. Preimmune normal rabbit serum had no effect on the development of LTP. It appears that S-100 protein is involved in the establishment of LTP.
