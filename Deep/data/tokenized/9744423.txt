There is growing evidence that prenatal protein malnutrition alters the development of the hippocampal formation in rats (Morgane et al., 1993; Galler et al., 1996; Almeida et al., 1996, for reviews). Little is known, however, of the possible functional consequences of prenatal malnutrition on the physiology of principal cells in the hippocampus. We have addressed this issue by comparing the electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons (dentate granule cells and CA1 pyramidal cells) in slices prepared from control and from prenatally protein malnourished adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. We found no significant effect of the prenatal protein malnutrition insult upon a number of intrinsic membrane properties measured with whole-cell current clamp recordings, including: resting membrane potential, input resistance, and membrane time constant, or on action potential characteristics such as threshold, amplitude, and/or firing frequency. Additionally, we saw no effect of prenatal malnutrition upon extracellular measures of glutamatergic synaptic transmission such as the presynaptic fiber volley, excitatory postsynaptic potential or population spike amplitude at the perforant path to dentate granule cell synapse or at the Schaffer collateral to CA1 pyramidal cell synapse. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that prenatal protein malnutrition does not result in significant alterations of the cellular physiological properties of these two types of principal neurons in the adult rat hippocampus.
