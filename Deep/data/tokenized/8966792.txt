In a prospective investigation concerning 50 consecutive patients suffering from complex partial epilepsy who all had a normal CT investigation pathological findings were recognized in 80% using MRI. The MRI examination included volume estimation of the hippocampus. The volume estimations were compared to a reference material. In 24% a focal pathology was recognized, that was suspected of being responsible for the epileptic condition. Only 20% of the examinations were evaluated as normal. Hippocampal atrophy was recognized in 50%. In the latter group a diagnosis of hippocampal sclerosis was established in 16%. It is concluded that MRI is the investigation of choice in complex partial epilepsy and that volume estimation of the hippocampus is important.
