Neonatal seizures can result in long-term adverse consequences including alteration of seizure susceptibility and impairment in spatial memory. However, little is known about the effects of neonatal seizures on developmental changes occurring in synaptic transmission during the first postnatal weeks. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of neonatal seizures on several aspects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the developing rat hippocampus. Flurothyl was used to induce multiple recurrent seizures in rat pups during the first postnatal days. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cell and extracellular recordings from the CA3 pyramidal cell layer were made in slice preparations. In rats that experienced neonatal seizures the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents at P15-17 was decreased by 27% compared with controls, whereas neither frequency nor the kinetic properties were altered. Neonatal seizures did not affect the timing of the developmental switch in the GABAA signaling from excitatory to inhibitory. None of the studied parameters of glutamatergic postsynaptic currents was different between the flurothyl and control groups, including the amplitude and frequency of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, the ratio of the amplitudes and frequencies of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated spontaneous postsynaptic currents, and the kinetics of AMPA and NMDA mediated postsynaptic currents in the age groups P8-10 and P15-17. We suggest that the selective depression of the amplitude of GABAergic synaptic responses may contribute to the adverse neurological and behavioral consequences that occur following neonatal seizures.
