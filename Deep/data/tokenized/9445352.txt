BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Free radicals including superoxide are responsible for postlesional cytotoxicity. In contrast to the constitutive CuZn-superoxide dismutases (SODs), manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) is inducible and has the potential to protect neurons by its superoxide dismutating activity. Therefore, we studied the presence and the regional changes in Mn-SOD within the brain after focal cortical ischemia. METHODS: Focal cortical photothrombotic lesions were produced in the hindlimb region of rat brains. Animals were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with Zamboni's fixative. Mn-SOD was immunohistochemically localized using an antiserum against rat-Mn-SOD. Changes in Mn-SOD immunoreactivity were quantified by image analysis. RESULTS: Focal photothrombosis caused a perilesional increase in Mn-SOD after 24 hours, followed by a further significant increase at 48 hours in perilesional cortex, ipsilateral corpus callosum, hippocampus, and thalamus, as well as in a homotopic cortical area within the nonlesioned hemisphere. At day 2, Mn-SOD was present in neurons and astrocytes. Up to day 7, Mn-SOD increased in the entire ipsilateral and contralateral cortex but remained higher elevated in the ipsilateral hippocampus and thalamus. Thereafter, Mn-SOD decreased globally but remained elevated in some cortical neurons up to day 60. CONCLUSIONS: The early transient increase of Mn-SOD in distinct brain regions, which are functionally connected via afferents and efferents, suggests that these regions are affected by the injury. It suggests that Mn-SOD protects the cells in these regions from superoxide-induced damage and therefore may limit the retrograde and anterograde spread of neurotoxicity.
