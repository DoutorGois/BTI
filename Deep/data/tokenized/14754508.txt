One of the most vulnerable areas to ischemia or hypoglycemia is CA1 hippocampal region due to pyramidal neurons death. Glutamate receptors are involved together with protein-kinase C and nitric oxide synthase. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is generated in anoxic or hypoglycemic conditions via activation of NMDA while inhibition of these receptors attenuates this response. Protein-kinase C and nitric oxide synthase are involved in anoxic LTP mechanism. Postischemic neurons are hyperexcitable in CA3 area while CA1 pyramidal neurons degenerate and disappear. Changes of glutamate receptors triggered by ischemia and hypoglycemia are discussed in this review.
