The hippocampus, a limbic brain region involved in the encoding and retrieval of memory, has a well-defined structural network assembled from excitatory principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Because the GABAergic interneurons form synapses onto both pyramidal neurons and interneurons, the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) present on certain interneurons could induce either inhibition or disinhibition in the hippocampal circuitry. To understand the role of nAChRs in controlling synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, we evaluated the magnitude of nAChR-modulated GABAergic postsynaptic currents (PSCs) in pyramidal neurons and various interneurons of the CA1 region. Using whole cell patch-clamp recording and post hoc identification of neuronal types in rat hippocampal slices, we show that brief (12-s) nAChR activation by ACh (1 mM) or choline (10 mM) enhances the frequency of GABAergic PSCs in both pyramidal neurons and CA1 interneurons. The magnitude of alpha7 nAChR-mediated GABAergic inhibition, as assessed by the net charge of choline-induced PSCs, was highest in stratum lacunosum moleculare interneurons followed by pyramidal neurons and s. radiatum interneurons. In contrast, the magnitude of alpha4beta2 nAChR-mediated GABAergic inhibition, as assessed by the difference between the net charge of PSCs induced by ACh and choline, was highest in pyramidal neurons followed by s. lacunosum moleculare and s. radiatum interneurons. The present results suggest that cholinergic cues transmitted via specific subtypes of nAChRs modify the synaptic function in the hippocampus by inducing a differential degree of GABAergic inhibition in the target neurons.
