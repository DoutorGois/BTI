Temporal-lobe epilepsy commonly has its origins in childhood, particularly when the lesion involved is mesial temporal (Ammon's horn) Sclerosis. Evidence suggests that this lesion is probably a common cause of chronic epilepsy in adults and that often it is probably the result of a severe febrile convulsion in infancy. 40 children, fifteen years of age and younger, who had an anterior temporal lobectomy were followed up for one to twenty-four years. The findings confirm those already established in adults, that the best results of surgery, not only in seizure relief but also in behaviour, are obtained when mesial temporal sclerosis is the lesion found at operation, and also indicate that a severe febrile convulsion in infancy is often the chief provocative factor in the development of epilepsy.
