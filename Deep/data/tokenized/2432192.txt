Topographic analyses were performed on the distribution of neuronal RNA loss in relation to local neuronal loss and neurofibrillary degeneration in the hippocampal region of brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Compared to age-matched controls, pyramidal neuronal RNA was depressed (p less than 0.0001) in all areas of the hippocampus examined in AD, viz., the endplate (33%), Rose's H2 field (30%), Rose's H1 field (37%) and the subiculum (46%). Significant neuronal loss was observed in Rose's H1 field and the subiculum but not in the endplate or Rose's H2 field. The frequency of neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons was enhanced in all four regions of AD brains, the number of involved neurons being markedly greater in Rose's H1 field and the subiculum than in the endplate and Rose's H2 field. Overall, the data indicate the existence of a generalized disturbance in RNA metabolism within pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus in AD, occurring in regions of minimal (endplate, Rose's H2 field) as well as those of extensive (Rose's H1 field, subiculum) pathological alterations. Although there is focal accentuation of RNA depletion in the latter, the marked RNA depletion in regions of minimal pathologic change suggests that this effect is largely unrelated to local neuronal loss or neurofibrillary degeneration.
