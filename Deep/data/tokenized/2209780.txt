Following a unilateral fimbria-fornix lesion, the delivery of nerve growth factor (NGF) to the ipsilateral lateral ventricle of the rat can prevent the lesion-induced loss of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) expression in the ipsilateral medial septum and vertical diagonal band region. In the present study, the ability of polymer rods to deliver NGF and to prevent a decrease in basal forebrain ChAT expression following a fimbria-fornix lesion was assessed. NGF was loaded into an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVAc) rod, fabricated by a melt-extrusion process. NGF release was established by the ability of the rods to induce neurite extension from PC12 cells and chick E12 dorsal root ganglia. Unilateral aspirative lesions of the fimbria-fornix were performed in adult rats, followed by implantation of a polymer rod into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle. Five animals received EVAc rods containing only the carrier molecule bovine serum albumin (BSA), and six received EVAc rods containing both BSA and NGF. After 2 weeks, ChAT-positive cells were counted in the medial septum and vertical diagonal band regions. Rats with NGF-releasing rods displayed ChAT(+) cell counts ipsilateral to the lesion equal to 88% of those on the contralateral side. In contrast, ChAT(+) cell numbers were 42% in animals with rods releasing BSA only (P less than 0.001). No undue reaction to implanted rods was noted. Following a fimbria-fornix lesion, NGF released from polymer matrices effectively prevents a lesion-induced reduction in ChAT expression in basal forebrain neurons.
