In rats treated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MpT) or saline, the effects of clonidine on the levels and turnover of norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI) and dopamine (DA) were analyzed in microdissected regions of the hypothalamus and extra-hypothalamic structures. In 7 of the 9 brain sites examined (namely dorsomedial nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, medial preoptic area, midlateral perifornical hypothalamus, frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus and cerebellum), clonidine (50 micrograms/kg) caused a significant decrease in NE turnover, with no change in steady-state levels. In the two remaining areas, namely the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and the locus coeruleus, clonidine produced different patterns of effects. In the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), clonidine significantly reduced NE content in saline-treated rats, and in rats injected with alpha-MpT + clonidine, no further change in NE concentration was observed. In the locus coeruleus, both NE levels and turnover were unaltered. Epinephrine and DA turnover, in contrast to NE turnover, was unaffected by clonidine in all brain areas, with the exception of the midlateral hypothalamus, where the alpha-MpT-induced depletion of EPI and DA was totally reversed by clonidine, and in the frontal cortex, where DA turnover was also significantly reduced. These data are discussed relative to the proposed physiological actions of clonidine in the hypothalamus.
