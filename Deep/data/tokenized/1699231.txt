We have used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to study the expression of galanin mRNA and galanin-like immunoreactivity after decortication and lesions of the ventral hippocampus. After decortication the levels of both galanin mRNA and galanin-like immunoreactivity were increased in the dorsal raphe nucleus. In addition, in decorticated rats, but not in controls, galanin mRNA could be seen in dorsal and ventral nuclei of the thalamus and in the remaining parts of the cortex. Increases in galanin mRNA and galanin-like immunoreactivity were also observed in the septum-vertical diagonal band after electrocoagulation lesions of the ventral hippocampus. In contrast, no changes were found after ibotenic acid lesions of the same hippocampal area. These results suggest that increases in the expression of galanin occur in certain neuron populations after direct lesion of their axons and/or terminal fields.
