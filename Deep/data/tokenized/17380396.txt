A comprehensive, quantitative description of the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of the short-term plasticity (STP) in the CA1 hippocampal region is presented. It is based on the Volterra-Poisson modeling approach using random impulse train (RIT) stimuli. In vitro hippocampal slice preparations were used from adult rats. RIT stimuli were applied at the Schaffer collaterals and population spike responses were recorded at the CA1 cell body layer. The computed STP descriptors that capture the nonlinear dynamics of the underlying STP mechanisms were the Volterra-Poisson kernels. The kernels quantified the presence of facilitatory and inhibitory STP behavior in magnitude and duration. A third order Volterra-Poisson STP model was introduced that accurately predicted in-sample and out-of-sample system responses. The proposed model could also accurately predict impulse pair and short impulse train system responses.
