The functional importance of theta modulation in the activity of hippocampal neurons was further analyzed using a method consisting of controlled sequential short-term (25-30 min) inclusion or exclusion of the theta rhythm by local administration of lidocaine into the median cervical nucleus and medial septal region respectively. Studies were carried out using conscious rabbits with extracellular recording of hippocampal neuron activity in field CA1. Administration of lidocaine into the medial septal nucleus and diagonal tract nucleus (MS-DT) led to complete inhibition of theta modulation in neuronal and total hippocampus activity. The mean frequency of background discharges underwent no change in most neurons, but decreased significantly in a limited group of cells with high-frequency activity (presumptive inhibitory neurons). Administration of lidocaine into the median cervical nucleus (MCN), the source of serotoninergic pathways to the MS-DT and hippocampus, was accompanied by increases in the stability and frequency of theta modulation of neuronal activity, induction of theta modulation in an additional group of neurons, and expression of a continuous theta rhythm in the electrical activity (EA) of the hippocampus. The mean frequency and regularity of discharges increased in most cells. These data support the existence of tonic inhibitory effects on the part of the MCN on the septa-hippocampal system generating the theta rhythm; in this regard, the MCN can be regarded as an antagonist of the activating reticular formation.
