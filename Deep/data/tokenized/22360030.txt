OBJECTIVE: To study the attenuating effect of Dexpanthenol (Dxp) provitamin B5 on neuronal damage after cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion. METHODS: This was a randomized, controlled experimental study conducted at the Islamic Azad University, Tabriz, Iran, from April to September 2008. Male wistar rats were divided into 4 groups randomly (n=13): 1- sham group, Group 2 :two hours occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and 24 hours reperfusion. Group 3: two hours occlusion of MCA and 24 hours reperfusion + Dxp (250mg/kg) since 3 days before ischaemia. Group 4: two hours occlusion of MCA and 24 hours reperfusion which had received Dxp (500mg/kg) since 3 days before ischaemia. Glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were studied in brain tissue and numbers of cornu ammonis (CA1 and CA3) pyramidal neurons were studied with light microscopy. RESULTS: The GSH levels were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 as compared with group 2. In group 3 and group 4 animals, the MDA levels were significantly lower than in group 2 (P < 0.05). Numbers of CA1 and CA3 neurons were completely normal in appearance in the group 1. The surviving neurons in the CA1 and CA3 subfield were markedly decreased in number, in group 2 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our pathologic and biochemical study has proven positive effect of Dxp on protection of cerebral tissue after I/R. The present findings correlate with previous studies on the protective effects of Dxp against cell and tissue injury by I/R.
