In a previous paper we have demonstrated that the orexigenic peptide Ghrelin (Ghr), increases memory retention in rats and mice. In the present work we evaluated the Ghr effect when it was administered previous the training session or previous the test session (24h after training) on the memory performance, using step-down test. The results showed that the intra-hippocampal Ghr administration previous the training session improved the long-term memory in this task, but did not modify the short-term memory. Nevertheless, when the Ghr was administrated previous the test session, no changes were observed in the memory performance. Taking into account these results and other previously published by our group, we could hypothesizes that Ghr may modulate specific molecular intermediates involved in memory acquisition/consolidation but not in the retrieval.
