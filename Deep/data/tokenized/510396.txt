The effects of muscimol on rabbit hippocampal pyramidal cell firing were studied and compared after iontophoretic, topical, and intravenous administration of the drug. All modes of application resulted in a bicuculline-sensitive, strychnine-insensitive, depression of the monosynaptically activated population spike evoked by micro-stimulation of the contralateral hippocampal field. These findings indicate that systemically administered muscimol selectively activates hippocampal GABA receptors suggesting that this compound may be useful for studying limbic system physiology.
