The suspension of embryonic locus coeruleus (LC) was transplanted into outbred albino rat hippocampus after its preliminary 6-hydroxy-dopamine-induced denervation. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analysis revealed that 3 months after the transplantation, embryonic noradrenergic LC cells which have completed their histogenesis in recipient hippocampus, appear as differentiated multipolar and fusiform cells, typical to LC. Intrahippocampal allotransplants of rat embryonic LC were also demonstrated to normalize the level of orientation activity in an open area, that was significantly reduced after administration of 6-hydroxy-dopamine to the animals.
