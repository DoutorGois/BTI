Normal aging may limit the signaling efficacy of certain GPCRs by disturbing the function of specific Galpha-subunits and leading to deficient modulation of intracellular functions that subserve synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Evidence suggests that Galphaq/(1)(1) is more sensitive to the effects of aging relative to other Galpha-subunits, including Galphao. To test this hypothesis, the functionality of Galphaq/(1)(1) and Galphao were compared in the hippocampus of young (6 months) and aged (24 months) F344 x BNF(1) hybrid rats assessed for spatial learning ability. Basal GTPgammaS-binding to Galphaq/(1)(1) was significantly elevated in aged rats relative to young and but not reliably associated with spatial learning. mAChR stimulation of Galphaq/(1)(1) with oxotremorine-M produced equivocal GTPgammaS-binding between age groups although values tended to be lower in the aged hippocampus and were inversely related to basal activity. Downstream Galphaq/(1)(1) function was measured in hippocampal subregion CA(1) by determining changes in [Ca(2+)]i after mAChR and mGluR (DHPG) stimulation. mAChR-stimulated peak change in [Ca(2+)]i was lower in aged CA(1) relative to young while mGluR-mediated integrated [Ca(2+)]i responses tended to be larger in aged. GPCR modulation of [Ca(2+)]i was observed to depend on intracellular stores to a greater degree in aged than young. In contrast, measures of Galphao-mediated GTPgammaS-binding were stable across age, including basal, mAChR-, GABABR (baclofen)-stimulated levels. Overall, the data indicate that aging selectively modulates the activity of Galphaq/(1)(1) within the hippocampus leading to deficient modulation of [Ca(2+)]i following stimulation of mAChRs but these changes are not related to spatial learning.
