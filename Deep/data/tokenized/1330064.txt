The sulfhydryl reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) and the oxidizing agent 5,5-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) reversibly modulate the component of synaptic potentials mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in slices of hippocampal area CA1. DTT (1 mM) reversibly potentiates NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic potentials while DTNB (1 mM) has the opposite effect. However, treatment of the slices with the irreversible sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide (300 microM) prevents DTNB from reversing the potentiation induced by DTT. These results further implicate the redox modulatory site as a regulator of the NMDA receptor-channel complex in vivo.
