Non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists impair rodent cognition. Specifically, MK-801, the most potent NMDA-R antagonist, induces an amnesic effect on the modified elevated plus maze (mEPM) learning test in rodents, which reflects spatial long-term memory. However, alterations in anxiety-related behaviors could overlap this amnesic effect. Accumulated evidence supports the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in learning and memory processes and deficits in hippocampal BDNF function, which underlie cognitive impairments, have been extensively reported. Therefore, we investigated if changes in anxiety-related behaviors and hippocampal BDNF levels are related with the amnesic effect induced by MK-801 in the mEPM.Transfer latency (TL) as an index of spatial memory in the mEPM was used. TL1 was evaluated 30 min after saline/MK-801 injection (day 1, acquisition session) while learning/memory performance was measured 24 h later at TL2 (day 2, retention session). Also at TL2, two other experimental groups were added to measure the anxiety-related behaviors using the classic EPM and BDNF protein levels by ELISA. To evaluate if amnesia endures, an additional session was recorded on day 3 (TL3) and BDNF levels were measured.While TL1 was not significantly modified by MK-801, TL2 was increased compared to the control group indicating an amnesic effect. This effect was not mimicked by anxiety-related behaviors and it was associated to a significant attenuation of BDNF levels. During the third post-training day, the cognitive performance of MK-801-treated animals was improved and an increased BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus accompanied this change
