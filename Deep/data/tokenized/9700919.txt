Free radical-mediated processes and NO-synthase activity were studied in cerebral structures and blood serum of male Wistar rats with different types of behavior in emotional resonance test one hour after global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest. Oxidative stress accompanied by loss in NO-synthase activity was revealed in cerebral cortex after the ischemia. The oxidative stress was also evident in cerebellum and to a lesser extent in hippocampus. The majority of behavior-related biochemical differences were induced by cardiac arrest. These differences could be global or related to specific brain structures. Sometimes they became apparent in cerebral lateralization of biochemical indices.
