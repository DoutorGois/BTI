The contribution of the rat striatonigral GABAergic system to spatial navigation was investigated in this study. We first tested the effects of ibotenic acid lesions of the striatum on place navigation performance in Morris water maze. Medial but not lateral striatal lesions produced a significant increase of escape latency, and this deficit was clarified as mainly caused by a marked increase of initiation latency rather than of thigmotaxis time (experiment 1). Next we tested the effects of systemic (0.5 mg/kg) and intranigral (2.0 ng/side) administrations of muscimol, a GABA receptor agonist, on the place navigation deficits produced by medial striatal lesions. Systemic muscimol administration significantly ameliorated the increase of initiation latency, while intranigral administration was not sufficiently effective (experiment 2). The results suggest that neural circuits containing medial striatal neurons play an essential role in place navigation performance probably through some movement preparation processes that precede movement execution, and the GABAergic system may be involved in this initiation process, although whether it is the striatonigral GABAergic system that is involved remains unclear.
