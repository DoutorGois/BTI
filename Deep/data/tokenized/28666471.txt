Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) encompasses certain related neurodegenerative disorders which alter personality and cognition. Heterogeneous ribonuclear proteins (hnRNPs) maintain RNA metabolism and changes in their function may underpin the pathogenesis of FTLD. Immunostaining for hnRNP E2 was performed on sections of frontal and temporal cortex with hippocampus from 80 patients with FTLD, stratified by pathology into FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP type A, B and C subtypes, and by genetics into patients with C9orf72 expansions, MAPT or GRN mutations, or those with no known mutation, and on 10 healthy controls. Semi-quantitative analysis assessed hnRNP staining in frontal and temporal cortex, and in dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus, in the different pathology and genetic groups. We find that hnRNP E2 immunostaining detects the TDP-43 positive dystrophic neurites (DN) within frontal and temporal cortex, and the neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI) seen in DG granule cells, characteristic of patients with Semantic Dementia (SD) and type C TDP-43 pathology, but did not detect TDP-43 or tau inclusions in any of the other pathological or genetic variants of FTLD. Double immunofluorescence for hnRNP E2 and TDP-43 showed most TDP-43 immunopositive DN to contain hnRNP E2. Present findings indicate an association between TDP-43 and hnRNP E2 which might underlie the pathogenetic mechanism of this form of FTLD.
