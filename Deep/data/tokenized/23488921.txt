We determined the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of the thorny seahorse Hippocampus histrix. The total length of H. histrix mitogenome is 16,523 bp, which consists of 13 protein coding, 22 tRNA and 2 rRNA genes and 1 control region. It has the typical vertebrate mitochondrial gene arrangement. This mitogenome sequence provides the basis for taxonomic and conservation studies of this and several closely related species.
