Various hypotheses try to explain the anticonvulsive and mood stabilizing effects of valproate. Among them, amplification of GABAergic inhibition and reduction of membrane excitability is favored. Here we show that superfusion with 0.1-1 mM valproate induced a moderate intracellular acidification of BCECF-AM-loaded CA3-neurons (hippocampal slices, guinea pig) which was measured as the difference between intracellular pH before (baseline pH(i)) and during valproate treatment (deltapH(i)). In two groups of neurons treated with 1 mM and 0.1-0.5 mM, deltapH(i) values amounted to 0.20 +/- 0.10 and 0.10 +/- 0.04 (deltapH(i) +/- S.D.), respectively, suggesting a dependence on the used valproate-concentration. DeltapH(i) did not correlate with the baseline pH(i). Furthermore, the acidification seems to be independent from an activation of postsynaptic GABA-A receptors, as it was not influenced by 0.1 mM picrotoxin. Since our previous studies clearly demonstrated a reduction of membrane excitability during moderate intracellular acidification, we suggest that the valproate-mediated intracellular acidification may substantially contribute to its anticonvulsive and mood stabilizing properties.
