We cloned two novel alternatively-spliced mRNA isoforms of glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) which we named GRIP1d and GRIP1e 4-7. GRIP1d is a 135 kDa, 7-PDZ-domain variant of GRIP1, containing the 12 amino acid C-terminus originally described for the 4-PDZ-domain GRIP1c 4-7. GRIP1e 4-7 is a 75 kDa 4-PDZ-domain variant of GRIP1, containing the 12 amino acid C-terminus originally described for the 7-PDZ-domain GRIP1a/b. Northern blots indicated that GRIP1d mRNA is 5.1 kb long and abundant in brain. An antibody to the C-terminus of the 75 kDa GRIP1c 4-7 also recognized an abundant 135 kDa protein, consistent with the predicted size of GRIP1d. Similarly, an antibody to the C-terminus of the 135 kDa GRIP1a/b also recognized a low abundance 75 kDa protein, consistent with the predicted size of GRIP1e 4-7. Immunocytochemistry of hippocampal cultures and intact brain using these antibodies showed that (i) these isoforms are present in both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses, and (ii) the isoforms co-localize in individual synapses. While GRIP1a/b isoforms are abundant in interneurons and highly concentrated in GABAergic presynaptic terminals, the isoforms recognized by the antibody to the C-terminus common to GRIP1c 4-7 and GRIP1d are much less abundant in interneurons and preferentially concentrate at the postsynaptic complex.
