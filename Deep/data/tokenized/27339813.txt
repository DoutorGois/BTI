CRMP family proteins (CRMPs) are critical for neurite outgrowth and maturation in the developing nervous system. However, the distinct roles of CRMP isoforms remain to be elucidated, especially in dendritic development. Here, we show that CRMP4 is sufficient and necessary for dendritic growth and maturation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of CRMP4 promotes and genetic knockdown of CRMP4 inhibits the amount of dendritic tips, total dendritic length, spine density, and the frequency but not amplitude of miniature excitatory synaptic current. By GST-pulldown assay, we reveal that CRMP4 interacts with actin cytoskeleton by its C-terminal region, but not by N-terminal. Overexpression of actin-interacting region of CRMP4 promoted dendritic growth and maturation as CRMP4 wildtype. Taken together, these results suggest that CRMP4 is involved in dendritic development via the interaction with actin cytoskeleton in hippocampal neurons.
