The effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5, the nitric oxide synthase (NO) inhibitor NO-arg or the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT5720 on memory were evaluated. Rats bilaterally implanted in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus were trained and tested in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task, and rats unilaterally implanted in the left posteroventral region of the caudate nucleus were trained and tested in a cued water maze task. Previous findings from this and other laboratories had found that lesions or pharmacological treatments of these sites significantly altered memory of these two tasks. Immediately after training, animals received intrahippocampal or intracaudate 0.5 microliter microinfusions of saline, AP5, NO-arg or KT5720. All three drugs impaired retention of inhibitory avoidance, but did not affect retention of the cued water maze. The findings suggest that NMDA receptor-, NO- and PKA-mediated processes in the dorsal hippocampus, but not in the caudate nucleus, are involved in memory.
