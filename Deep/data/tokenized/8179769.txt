Acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) was assayed in rat CNS membrane fractions after administration of the convulsant 3-mercaptopropionic acid (150 mg/kg, ip). In comparison with saline-injected controls, total AChE activity decreased 12-20% in striatum and cerebellum during seizure and postseizure but failed to change in cerebral cortex. Specific AChE activity, assayed in the presence of 10(-4) M ethopropazine (a butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor), decreased 15-25% in striatum and cerebellum, increased 20-45% in hippocampus, but remained unchanged in cerebral cortex. Saline injection alone increased AChE activity in striatum (68%) and cerebellum (36%) but failed to modify enzyme activity in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. To conclude, AChE sensitivity to convulsant and saline administration is tissue-specific and not restricted to cholinergic areas.
