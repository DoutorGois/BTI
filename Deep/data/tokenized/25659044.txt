While the current literature on children suffering from temporal lobe epilepsy (CTLE) mostly focuses on material-related episodic memory deficits according to seizure-onset lateralization, the present study examined associative episodic memory according to the type of information to memorize (e.g., factual, spatial, and sequential) and further investigated subjective and objective recollection. Eleven children with left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE), 10 children with right temporal lobe epilepsy (RTLE), among whom 9 displayed hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and 42 healthy controls completed the WHAT-WHEN-WHERE protocol (Guillery-Girard et al., 2013). Group comparisons were first conducted according to the affected side and second according to the underlying pathology. Results showed associative memory impairments in patients irrespective of the affected side. Moreover, this study revealed that HS is particularly deleterious to associative and subjective recollection in CTLE. In addition, this study emphasizes the need for assessing episodic memory in childhood TLE beyond material specificity.
