BACKGROUND: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Earlier studies have shown differences in brain structure according to the APOE epsilon4 status. OBJECTIVE: To assess possible differences in brain structure according to the APOE epsilon4 status in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects in relation to conversion to dementia. METHODS: In a follow-up study of 56 MCI subjects, 13 MCI subjects progressed to dementia (PMCI) during a mean follow-up time of 31 months. Brain structure differences in both stable MCI (SMCI) and PMCI epsilon4 carriers and noncarriers in the baseline MRI scan were assessed with voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: The SMCI epsilon4 carriers had atrophy in the amygdala and hippocampus compared to the SMCI noncarriers. The PMCI epsilon4 carriers revealed atrophy of the left inferior frontal gyrus and parietal cortex compared to the PMCI noncarriers. CONCLUSION: The rate of brain atrophy in certain brain areas may be increased in epsilon4-positive MCI subjects progressing to dementia.
