The effects of long-term exposure to ammonia on [Cl-]i in cultured hippocampal neurons were examined. Ammonia increased the [Cl-]i time- (>/=24 h) and concentration- (>/=2 mM) dependently, resulting in a depolarizing shift of the equilibrium potential of the GABAA receptor-Cl- channel opening (EGABA). Such an effect of ammonia was diminished by the inhibitors of Cl-/HCO3- exchangers, 0.1 mM 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS) and 0.1 mM 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS), and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, 2 mM acetazolamide, but not by a Na+/K+/2Cl-cotransport inhibitor, 50 microM bumetanide, suggesting an enhanced Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity by ammonia. The ammonia-induced increase in [Cl-]i was also abolished by the inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), 0.1 microM calphostin C and 10 microM 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), and of transcription and de novo protein synthesis, 1 microM actinomycin D and 0.5 microg/ml cycloheximide, while a PKC activator, 0.1 h microM phorbor 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), increased the [Cl-]i. The mRNA level of the AE3 Cl-/HCO3- exchanger was increased by ammonia in a calphostin C- and H-7-sensitive manner. The AE3-like immunoreactivity was also increased by ammonia. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to ammonia increases the expression of AE3 through the activation of PKC, resulting in an increase in [Cl-]i in neurons and a reduction of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.
