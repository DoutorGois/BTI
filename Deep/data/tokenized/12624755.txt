Taurine is an inhibitory amino acid acting as an osmoregulator and neuroromodulator in the brain, with neuroprotective properties. The ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) greatly potentiates taurine release from brain preparations in both normal and ischemic conditions, the effect being particularly marked in the developing hippocampus. We now characterized the regulation of NMDA-stimulated taurine release from hippocampal slices from adult (3-month-old) and developing (7-day-old) mouse using a superfusion system. The NMDA-stimulated taurine release was receptor-mediated in both adult and developing mouse hippocampus. In adults, only NO-generating compounds, sodium nitroprusside, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and hydroxylamine reduced the release, as did also NO synthase inhibitors, 7-nitroindazole and nitroarginine, indicating that the release is mediated by the NO/cGMP pathway. On the other hand, the regulation of the NMDA-evoked taurine release proved to be somewhat complex in the immature hippocampus. It was not affected by the NOergic compounds, but enhanced by the protein kinase C activator 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and adenosine receptor A(1) agonists, N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine and R(-)N(6)-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine in a receptor-mediated manner. The activation of both ionotropic 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors and metabotropic glutamate group I receptors also enhanced the evoked release. The NMDA-receptor-stimulated taurine release could be a part of the neuroprotective properties of taurine, being important particularly under cell-damaging conditions in the developing hippocampus and hence preventing excitotoxicity.
