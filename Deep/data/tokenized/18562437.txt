Increasing clinical evidence for the effectiveness of herbal antidepressants has led to investigations at the molecular level. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, this study investigated similarities in protein expression between clomipramine, St John's wort and a Chinese herbal formula, xiao-yao-san, often used in mood disorder treatment. HT22 cells, derived from a mouse hippocampal cell line, were treated for 24 h, and protein expression was compared with that of the untreated cells (n = 4/group). Forty-three protein spots were found to be significantly differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in more than one of the treatment groups. Twenty-nine of these were identified using mass spectrometry. The most affected proteins were those involved in the cytoskeleton and energy metabolism, and an up-regulation of vimentin by all three treatments was confirmed by Western blotting. This study provides preliminary evidence for multiple common molecular targets between conventional and alternative antidepressants, which appear to collectively affect neuronal plasticity.
