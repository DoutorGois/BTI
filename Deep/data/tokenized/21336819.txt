Free radicals mediated damage of phospholipids, proteins and nucleic acids results in subsequent neuronal degeneration and cell loss. Aim of this study was to evaluate the existence of lipid and protein oxidative damage and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in various rat brain structures 24 h after lateral fluid percussion brain injury (LFPI). Parietal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum from the ipsilateral hemisphere were processed for analyses of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and oxidized protein levels as well as for the SOD and GSH-Px activities. Immunohistochemical detection of oxidized proteins was also performed. Results of our study showed that LFPI caused significant oxidative stress in the parietal cortex and hippocampus while other brain regions tested in this study were not oxidatively altered by LFPI. GSH-Px activities were significantly increased in the parietal cortex and hippocampus, while the SOD activities remained unchanged following LFPI in all regions investigated.
