In adult, 6-10 days, and 16-20 days old rabbits with electrochemotrodes implanted into the left and right dorsal hippocampus, 5-methoxytriptamine (mexamine, 8 mg/kg, i.p.) stimulation of the central serotoninergic systems decreased the amount of seizures in the hippocampal penicilline epileptogenic focus in 6-10 and 16-20 days old rabbits and had no effect on interictal epileptiform discharges in the EEG. After i.v. mexamine administration (2 mg/kg) in 16-20 days old rabbits, both the inhibition of seizures and the interictal epileptiform activity in the EEG occurred. In adult rabbits, mexamine (2 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on the hippocampus epileptogenic foci. The level of the serotoninergic systems activity is supposed to be more significant for supporting the hippocampus excitability in young rabbits than in adult ones.
