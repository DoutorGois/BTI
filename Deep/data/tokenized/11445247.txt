To investigate the possibility that TRH (pGlu-His-Pro-NH(2)) and EEP (pGlu-Glu-Pro-NH(2)) contribute to the behavioral and mood changes attending hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and hypogonadism, we have treated young, adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats (5/group, 250 g bw at time of sacrifice) for one week with either daily ip injections of saline, 5 microg T(4), 3 mg PTU or castration. Immunoreactivity for TRH (TRH-IR), TRH-Gly (pGlu-His-Pro-Gly, a TRH precursor), EEP and Ps4 (prepro-TRH-derived TRH-enhancing peptide) was measured in 8 brain regions by RIA. Castration reduced the Ps4-IR levels in hippocampus by 80%. High pressure liquid chromatography revealed that in many brain regions EEP-IR and TRH-IR consisted of a mixture of TRH and other TRH-like peptides including EEP, Val(2)-TRH, Tyr(2)-TRH, Leu(2)-TRH and Phe(2)-TRH. Transition from the hyperthyroid to the hypothyroid state increased the Val(2)-TRH and Tyr(2)-TRH levels in the accumbens by 10-fold and 15-fold, respectively, and the corresponding ratios for the pyriform cortex increased 9-fold and 12-fold, respectively. Hypothyroidism and castration reduced the levels of TRH and the majority of other TRH-like peptides in the entorhinal cortex. This is the first report that thyroid and steroid hormones alter the levels of TRH, prepro-TRH-derived peptides, and a newly discovered array of TRH-like neuropeptides in limbic brain regions.
