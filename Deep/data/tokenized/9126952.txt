A novel method is presented to simultaneously measure the permeability surface area product of water (PS), also known as capillary diffusion capacity, and the regional blood volume (RBV). It is based on magnetic resonance imaging of the longitudinal relaxation times of tissue and blood at different concentrations of an intravascular MR contrast agent. PS and RBV were measured in vivo in different regions of the brain and the skeletal muscle of the rat. The average PS values (n = 5) obtained in cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, hippocampus, thalamus, jaw muscle, and tongue muscle were 3.31 +/- 0.20, 1.81 +/- 0.25, 3.37 +/- 0.36, 3.68 +/- 0.44, 10.6 +/- 1.1, and 14.1 +/- 2.51 ml x min(-1) x g(-1), respectively. The corresponding average RBV values were 1.63 +/- 0.18, 1.22 +/- 0.25, 3.30 +/- 0.37, 3.03 +/- 0.36, 1.66 +/- 0.30, and 1.38 +/- 0.33 ml x 100 g(-1). These results are in good agreement with previously reported literature values obtained by means of autoradiography.
