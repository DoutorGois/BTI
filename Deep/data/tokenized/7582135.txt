Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype glutamate receptors increases the excitability of most neurons within the CNS. A common feature of ionotropic glutamate receptors is their ability to undergo desensitization. In the present experiments we have examined the role of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) in the regulation of NMDA receptor desensitization. Repeated NMDA receptor activation with 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ increased the degree of glycine-resistant NMDA receptor desensitization of subsequent responses to NMDA recorded in the presence of 0.2 mM Ca2+. The recovery of glycine-resistant NMDA receptor desensitization after repeated NMDA receptor activation in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+ was significantly reduced in neurons intracellularly dialysed with guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), guanosine-5'-triphosphate or AlCl3 and CsF, compounds known to activate G-proteins. Intracellular dialysis with guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), adenosine triphosphate, adenosine triphosphate, or adenosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) was ineffective. The calcium permeability of NMDA receptor-channels was not altered by intracellular dialysis with GTP gamma S. This suggests that modulation of NMDA receptor desensitization by G-proteins represents a novel mechanism for regulation of glutamate-gated ion channel activity.
