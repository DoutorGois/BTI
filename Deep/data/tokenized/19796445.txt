There is accumulating evidence that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of depression. Decreased serum levels have been reported in major depression, and a correlation between BDNF reduction and the severity of the disease was found. Moreover, in post-mortem hippocampal tissue, increased levels of BDNF immunoreactivity have been reported in subjects treated with antidepressants compared to untreated subjects. These findings indicate parallel changes in brain and serum BDNF levels during depression. BDNF has been measured in selected brain areas in several animal models. In investigations between Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) and Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats, a genetic rat model of depression, no differences were found in BDNF levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, areas believed to be core brain regions in depression. However, to our knowledge brain and serum BDNF levels have never been reported in parallel for any psychiatric disease model. Therefore, we examined the levels of BDNF in whole blood, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), hippocampus, and frontal cortex in male FSL and FRL rats. BDNF levels in serum and whole blood of FSL rats were significantly increased compared to FRL rats. In contrast, in the hippocampus the BDNF level was significantly decreased in FSL compared to FRL rats while no differences were found in the frontal cortex and CSF. The differential regulation of the BDNF levels in hippocampus, serum, and whole blood in FSL/FRL rats adds to the hypothesis that neurotrophic factors are related to the pathophysiology of depression.
