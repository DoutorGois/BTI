Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity under both basal and poststress conditions is often increased in the aged rat. This change has been associated with the loss of corticosteroid receptors in specific regions that mediate glucocorticoid negative feedback. In order to study the cellular basis for the loss of receptors, we measured glucocorticoid (type II corticosteroid) receptor binding and mRNA levels in pituitary and selected brain regions in rats at 6, 12, and 24 months of age. Receptor binding, measured using [3H]RU 28362, was stable in all regions (pituitary, hypothalamus, amygdala, and frontal cortex) except the hippocampus, where there was about a 40% decrease in binding capacity, with no change in the affinity of the receptor for RU 28362. The loss of receptors in the hippocampus was apparent in animals at 12 months of age, and binding was further decreased at 24 months. Glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels were significantly higher in all regions at 12 months of age than at 6 months. By 24 months, however, receptor mRNA levels in most regions had returned to levels that were similar to those at 6 months of age. In contrast, glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels in the hippocampus were significantly decreased at 24 months of age compared to levels at both 6 and 12 months of age. Thus, in general, variations in receptor mRNA levels parallel those in receptor binding in animals 6 and 24 months of age, with the hippocampus as the only region showing a significant loss of receptors and a decrease in mRNA levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
