Responses of the CA3 neurons to mossy fibre stimulation were investigated in incubated hippocampal slices in vitro under the influence of norepinephrine (NE) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT). Both agents modulated the level of background activity (increased or decreased it), changed its pattern and influenced the responses to stimulation of nonaminergic input, facilitating or suppressing it. The changes in response level and pattern usually correlate with the corresponding changes of background activity. In some cases NE, lowering the frequency of background activity but increasing the proportion of "complex discharges" in it as well as the number of reduced spikes with in a complex discharge, increased the responses to stimulation. 5HT which evoked in some cells a periodic grouped activity, facilitated the occurrence of identical groups in response to stimulation. Unlike NF which evoked relatively short-term changes, 5HT produced prolonged (up to 40 min) augmentation of background activity and facilitation of responses.
