In the present study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were collected from kimchi and were screened to isolate strains that inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production by Escherichia coli and p16 expression and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Oral administration of Lactobacillus brevis OW38 (1x10(9) cfu/mouse) to aged mice (male, 18 months old) for 8 weeks reduced the LPS level in colon fluid and blood. In addition, OW38 treatment also reduced the ratio of Firmicutes or Proteobacteria to Bacteroidetes, which was significantly higher in aged mice than in young mice. Treatment with OW38 in aged mice inhibited the expression of inflammatory markers, such as myeloperoxidase, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin (IL)-1beta, and inhibited NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, it induced the expression of colonic tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, occludin, and claudin-1. OW38 treatment also suppressed the expression of senescence markers p16, p53, and SAMHD1 in the colon and the hippocampus of aged mice. In addition, it significantly restored spontaneous alternation as well as the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and doublecortin in aged mice compared to that in young mice (P<0.05). Based on these findings, we conclude that OW38 treatment may ameliorate aging-associated colitis and memory impairment by inhibiting gut microbiota LPS production, NF-kappaB activation, and p16 expression.
