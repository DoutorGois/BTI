It is well established that the auxiliary Cavbeta subunit regulates calcium channel density in the plasma membrane, but the cellular mechanism by which this occurs has remained unclear. We found that the Cavbeta subunit increased membrane expression of Cav1.2 channels by preventing the entry of the channels into the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) complex. Without Cavbeta, Cav1.2 channels underwent robust ubiquitination by the RFP2 ubiquitin ligase and interacted with the ERAD complex proteins derlin-1 and p97, culminating in targeting of the channels to the proteasome for degradation. On treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, Cavbeta-free channels were rescued from degradation and trafficked to the plasma membrane. The coexpression of Cavbeta interfered with ubiquitination and targeting of the channel to the ERAD complex, thereby facilitating export from the endoplasmic reticulum and promoting expression on the cell surface. Thus, Cavbetabeta regulates the ubiquitination and stability of the calcium channel complex.
