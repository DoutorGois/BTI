JP05 (originally referred to as glucocorticoid-induced receptor gene or cDNA clone 4.2) designates a gene originally isolated from murine thymoma WEHI-7TG cells after being treated with glucocorticoids and forskolin. This gene is also induced by dexamethasone (a potent glucocorticoid receptor agonist) in isolated normal murine thymocytes. The predicted amino acid sequence was found to share significant similarity to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, in particular to the tachykinin receptors NK-1, NK-2 and NK-3, with which it has an overall identity of 32%, 31% and 33%, respectively. The results of the present in situ hybridization analysis reveal that JP05 mRNA containing cells are extensively distributed throughout the rostrocaudal extension of the brain and spinal cord. However, the vast majority of the areas with high to moderate levels of JP05 mRNA were localized in the forebrain, primarily within limbic system structures, the dorsal and ventral striatum and in some hypothalamic nuclei. These results are discussed in relation to the central nervous system distribution of glucocorticoid receptor-containing cells and to the tachykinin system.
