Cholinergic antagonism impacts selected learning tasks. To understand where scopolamine exerts its action, learning tasks differentially sensitive to hippocampus and amygdala lesions were used. Hippocampal lesions prevent context fear conditioning without effect on tone conditioning. These lesions also produce a time-dependent retrograde deficit in context conditioning. The amygdala is necessary for both tone and context conditioning. To examine the possibility that cholinergic antagonism mimics hippocampal damage or amygdala damage, rats were given scopolamine (1 mg/kg) either before or after fear conditioning. In the fear conditioning procedure, rats received tone-footshock or context-footshock pairings. Evidence of conditioning to the tone and the context was provided by observation of freezing. When given prior to training, scopolamine blocked fear conditioning to the tone in a dose-dependent fashion but had no effect on context conditioning. The impairment of tone conditioning did not occur with methylscopolamine, indicating the central action of the drug. Rats given scopolamine immediately following fear conditioning, tested later in a drug-free state, froze more to the tone than rats given a control injection. The effect of scopolamine on freezing to the context was not reliable. The present results suggest that scopolamine's impact on fear conditioning is mediated by some mechanism other than impaired hippocampal or amygdala functioning.
