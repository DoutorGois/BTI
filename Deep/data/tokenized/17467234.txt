Immunoreactivity for corticosteroid binding globulin was observed in the hypothalamus of intact male rats in the magnocellular nuclei and in single neurons in the periventricular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus. The suprachiasmatic and the arcuate nuclei contained parvocellular neurons with specific immunoreactivity. Extensive networks of immunopositive fibers were observed in the lateral hypothalamus, the preoptic region, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and along the third ventricle. Immunostained axons often exhibited varicosities. The internal and the external layer of the median eminence showed numerous bundles of immunostained axons. Herring bodies in the posterior pituitary lobe contained specific immunoreactivity while pituicytes remained unstained. A portion of the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and mossy fibers in the cerebellar granular layer stained for corticosteroid binding globulin. Some of the pyramidal cells in the hippocampus were corticosteroid binding globulin positive. Immunostained fibers occurred in the mesencephalon in the periaqueductal grey and in the medulla oblongata. A small fraction of the ependymal cells was also stained. In the spinal cord we observed specific immunoreactivity in a portion of the neurons in the dorsal horn. With polymerase chain reaction we confirmed the presence of the respective transcripts in the different brain regions. The multiple locations of corticosteroid binding globulin throughout the central nervous system suggest multiple functional properties, including neuroendocrine and neurohumoral functions.
