Activation of group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) stimulates dendritic protein synthesis and long-term synaptic depression (LTD), but it remains unclear how these effects are related. Here we provide evidence that a consequence of mGluR activation in the hippocampus is the rapid loss of both AMPA and NMDA receptors from synapses. Like mGluR-LTD, the stable expression of this change requires protein synthesis. These data suggest that expression of mGluR-LTD is at least partly postsynaptic, and that a functional consequence of dendritic protein synthesis is the regulation of glutamate receptor trafficking.
