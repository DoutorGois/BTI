Fourteen cases with psychomotor seizure were examined by pneumoencephalotomographic technique. In all cases uni- or bilateral changes of the inferior horn were found: diverticular dilatation of subiculum, lowering and irregularity of the floor, reduction of width, and deformation of digitation. These findings correlated well with the autopsy reports. In most cases, EEG findings also correlated.
