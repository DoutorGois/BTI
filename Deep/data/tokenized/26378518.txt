DNA dioxygenases Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) proteins can catalyze the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) of DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and thereby alter the epigenetic state of DNA. The TET family includes TET1, TET2 and TET3 members in mammals. Recently, accumulative research uncovered that TET1-3 occur abundantly in the central nervous system (CNS), and their biological functions have just begun to be investigated. In the present study, we demonstrated that mRNA and protein of TET2 were highly expressed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus along the whole brain-development process. Further studies showed that TET2 was expressed in various types of cells, especially in most neurons. Subcellular distribution pattern implicated that TET2 is localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm of neurons. Down-regulation of TET2 in cultured cortical neurons with RNA interference implied that TET2 was required for cell survival. In all, our results indicate that neuronal TET2 is positively involved in the regulation of cell survival.
