Polyamine (tissue) concentrations have been studied in hippocampus and temporal neocortex from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Depth electrode recordings demonstrated hippocampal origin of the seizures, the temporal neocortex being involved during the discharge propagation. Neuropathological examination of excised tissues showed glial proliferation or glioma in Ammon's horn (CA), whereas the temporal neocortex did not exhibit any histological abnormality. Polyamine (putrescine or PUT, spermidine or SPD, spermine or SPM) concentrations were determined on surgical samples from the hippocampus and various areas of temporal neocortex. Human post-mortem tissue from temporal lobe regions was used for controls. In post-mortem controls and temporal neocortex specimens from epileptic patients, polyamine levels were similar (in nmol/g wet weight: PUT = 40-100; SPD = 200-350; SPM = 100-200). In CA, polyamine levels exhibited striking changes: SPD content was significantly increased (350-700 nmol/g) while SPM was lowered (50-100). PUT was only increased in CA invaded by the tumoral process (100-180). Accordingly, a very high SPD/SPM molar ratio in the abnormal CA region was observed, indicating an acceleration of polyamine neosynthesis which is usually related to ornithine decarboxylase induction. Metabolic changes in polyamines appear to be selective of human epileptic hippocampus. A relationship between glial proliferation (gliosis or neoplasia), epileptic firing and polyamines is discussed.
