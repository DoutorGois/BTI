Neuroprotective effects of a Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, LY379268, were examined in a neonatal rat model of hypoxia-ischemia (unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxic exposure for 1.5h in 7-day-old rat pups). LY379268 administered 5 min after hypoxic exposure (2, 5, or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced brain injury as measured by reductions in the ipsilateral brain weight and in CA1 hippocampal neuron density. The significant neuroprotective effects were also observed when this compound (5 mg/kg) was administered 30 min, but not 60 min, after hypoxic exposure. The neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) procedure significantly increased caspase-3 activity and induced DNA fragmentation in the ipsilateral cortex compared with that in the contralateral cortex 24 and 72h after the insult, respectively. LY379268 did not prevent this increase in caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation in the ipsilateral cortex. These results suggest that activation of Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors may provide neuroprotection against HI brain injury. However, blockade of caspase-3 activation and the apoptotic pathway appears not to be involved in the neuroprotective effects of LY379268 observed in the neonatal rat model of HI.
