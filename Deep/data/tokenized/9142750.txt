Research on spatial problem-solving over the past two years has linked the hippocampus to path integration, that is, the use of movement-related cues to guide spatial behavior. Path integration may underlie the forms of place learning that are impaired by hippocampal damage. It remains a challenge to determine whether path integration is the central function of the hippocampus or but one of many.
