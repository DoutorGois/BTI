In the hippocampus of human alcoholics, prolonged ethanol treatment reduces the number of muscarinic ligand binding sites present at autopsy suggesting a decrease in functional muscarinic receptors. Whether these changes are due to alcohol-induced brain damage or ethanol dependence and represent a reduced level of cholinergic function is unknown. The present studies tested the impact of ethanol dependence or long-term ethanol treatment and subsequent withdrawal on the function of pre- and postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by 0.1-100 microM carbachol. This presynaptic inhibitory action of carbachol involving muscarinic receptors was not significantly reduced either by ethanol treatment (12 days), causing physical dependence, or by long-term ethanol treatment (97-120 days) and abstinence (3-6 months). Postspike after hyperpolarizations (AHPs) were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by carbachol (6-2000 nM). This postsynaptic excitatory action of muscarinic receptors also was not significantly reduced either by 12-day ethanol treatment or by long-term ethanol treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that neither pre- nor postsynaptic muscarinic receptor function measured electrophysiologically is reduced by either ethanol dependence or long-term ethanol consumption and abstinence in the rat as suggested by reduced muscarinic ligand binding in the hippocampus of human alcoholics.
