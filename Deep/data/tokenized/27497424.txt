Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia in the aging population worldwide. SIRT1 deacetylation of histones and transcription factors impinge on multiple neuronal and non-neuronal targets, and modulates stress response, energy metabolism and cellular senescence/death pathways. Collectively, SIRT1 activity could potentially affect multiple aspects of hippocampal and cortical neuron function and survival, thus modifying disease onset and progression. In this review, the known and potential mechanisms of action of SIRT1 with regard to AD, and its potential as a therapeutic target, are discussed.
