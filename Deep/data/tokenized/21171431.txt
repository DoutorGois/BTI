AIM: To investigate the effects of intermittent hypoxia on the hippocampal synaptic plasticity in rat. METHODS: The evoked potentials were recorded extracellularly, then the LTP were induced by tetanic stimulation in rat hippocampal dentate gyrus. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the amplitude of LTP was significantly reduced in hippocampus of rat treated with intermittent hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that the hippocampal synaptic plasticity could be decreased by the treated of intermittent hypoxia.
