The neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) agonist rosiglitazone are of particular interest for disease-modifying and antiepileptogenic approaches. We studied the expression of PPARgamma and the impact of rosiglitazone on the consequences of status epilepticus (SE) in a rat post-SE model. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a selective overexpression of PPARgamma in the piriform cortex of rats with spontaneous seizures. Rosiglitazone administration initiated following SE failed to exert relevant effects on the development of spontaneous seizures and neuronal cell loss. Whereas spatial learning in the Morris water maze was delayed in SE animals with vehicle administration, the learning curve of rosiglitazone-treated SE rats showed no significant difference to that of controls. The study provides first evidence arguing against a robust antiepileptogenic effect. However, the findings in the spatial learning paradigm indicate disease-modifying effects.
