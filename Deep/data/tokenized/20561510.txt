While much has been elucidated about the hypothalamic controls of energy balance, the epidemic of obesity continues to escalate. Recent work has suggested that extra-hypothalamic central nervous system structures may play a previously un-appreciated role in the control of ingestive behavior and body weight regulation. Because animals can and do learn about food and food-related stimuli, as well as the consequences of eating, we and others have sought to understand the cognitive process that underlies that learning. Additionally, we have begun to investigate the neuro-anatomical bases for complex learning about food and food cues. Here we review some evidence for learning about food as well as evidence that the hippocampus may play a critical role in the brain's ability to regulate body weight through such learning processes.
