INTRODUCTION: Chronic stress induces dendritic atrophy and decreases spine density in excitatory hippocampal neurons, although there is also ample evidence indicating that the GABAergic system is altered in the hippocampus after this aversive experience. Chronic stress causes dendritic remodeling both in excitatory neurons and interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. METHODS: In order to know whether it also has an impact on the structure and neurotransmission of hippocampal interneurons, we have analyzed the dendritic arborization, spine density, and the expression of markers of inhibitory synapses and plasticity in the hippocampus of mice submitted to 21 days of mild restrain stress. The analyses were performed in GIN mice, a strain that displays EGFP-labeled interneurons. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in the dendritic arborization of interneurons in the CA1 region, which did not occur in those in CA3. We found neither changes in dendritic spine density in these regions nor alterations in the number of EGFP-positive interneurons. Nevertheless, the expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 was reduced in different layers of CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. No significant changes were found in the expression of the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) or synaptophysin. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic stress reduces the interneuronal dendritic arborization in CA1 region of the hippocampus but not in CA3.
