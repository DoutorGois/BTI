Zinc cations at concentrations of 0.2 mM and greater catalyzed specific phosphorylation, by ATP, of two membrane-associated proteins from rat hippocampus. These proteins, corresponding to molecular weights of 60 and 49 kDa, were phosphorylated primarily at tyrosine residues. The 60-kDa protein was identified as p60c-src by immunoprecipitation using two different p60src-specific monoclonal antibodies. The 49-kDa protein co-immunoprecipitated with p60c-src. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of p60c-src and the 49-kDa protein phosphorylated in the presence of Zn2+ gave different patterns of phosphopeptides. It is suggested that tyrosine phosphorylation of p60c-src and the p60c-src-associated 49-kDa protein may be a way of zinc participation in hippocampal neurotransmission.
