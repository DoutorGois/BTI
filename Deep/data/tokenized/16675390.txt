Recent evidence has challenged the view that memories are made permanent by a consolidation process that happens just once and instead have suggested that memories are "re-consolidated" after reminders. The current findings of Morris et al. in this issue of Neuron suggest that reconsolidation may involve a complex interaction between synaptic and system processing of recent as well as remote experiences.
