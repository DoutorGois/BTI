The localization of binding sites for [3H]indalpine to sections of rat brain was studied by a quantitative autoradiographic technique. Binding sites for this specific neuronal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) uptake inhibitor are concentrated in areas rich in 5-HT neuronal cell bodies, fibers, and synaptic terminals. One of the most interesting features of this regional distribution is the very high density of these sites found in the dorsal raphe, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and locus ceruleus. Components of the visual system also show pronounced labelling with [3H]indalpine. The finding that limbic structures are strongly labelled by this drug may be related to the antidepressant activity of indalpine. The anatomical distribution of binding sites demonstrated is consistent with the specific labelling of 5-HT neurons by [3H]indalpine and confirms previous studies carried out with another 5-HT uptake inhibitor, [3H]imipramine.
