The goal of this article is to initiate dialogue among those conducting research on the biological aspects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and clinicians and researchers concerned with developing effective psychological treatments for PTSD. Important biological findings in PTSD are reviewed, paying special attention to the clinical implications of these findings. A discussion of the psychological treatments effective for PTSD follows, focusing on how these empirically supported treatments may address some of the issues raised by the biological findings. Finally, suggestions are made for future directions for psychological treatment development for this disabling condition, examining how these innovative treatment approaches may be relevant to the reviewed biological findings.
