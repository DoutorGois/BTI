This study examined the subnuclear distribution and transmitter content of neurons in the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) that projected to the septum, dorsal hippocampal formation, and/or raphe. Following the injection of fast blue into the medial septum/diagonal band nucleus and rhodamine-conjugated microspheres into the dorsal hippocampal formation (or vice versa), retrogradely-labelled cells were found throughout the apical subnucleus of the IPN. Incubation of these sections with 5-hydroxytryptamine antiserum indicated that a small number of fast blue- or rhodamine-positive cells also contained serotonin. Occasional apical cells contained both fast blue and rhodamine, indicating a dual projection via collaterals to both the septum and hippocampus. Injection of either dye into the raphe also retrogradely labelled cells in the apical subnucleus, none of which contained serotonin. These results suggest that the IPN may function to integrate the activity within subcortical limbic nuclei via widespread serotonergic and non-serotonergic projections.
