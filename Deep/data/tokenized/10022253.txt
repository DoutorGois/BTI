Tetanus and botulinum neurotoxins are the most potent toxins known and cause tetanus and botulism, respectively. They are zinc-endopeptidases acting in the cytosol, where they cleave SNARE proteins. Here, we report on the assay of their metalloproteolytic activity in vitro on recombinant SNARE proteins. We also describe the assay of their activity in nerve cells in culture using antibodies specific for the SNARE proteins. Together with recent reports from other laboratories, these results show that the toxicity of these powerful neurotoxins can be appropriately assayed in vitro, thus reducing considerably the number of animals currently used in the evaluation of the toxicity of tetanus toxoid vaccine and of the botulinum neurotoxins to be used for human therapy.
