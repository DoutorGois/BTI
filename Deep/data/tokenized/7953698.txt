The effects of glucocorticoid hormones on oxytocin receptors in rat hippocampus were investigated. Oxytocin receptor autoradiography (using 0.1 and 1.2 nM concentrations of [125I]OVTA) revealed a significant (P < 0.02) decrease in oxytocin receptor binding in adrenalectomized animals 7 days after the surgery. Corticosterone replacement at the time of adrenalectomy prevented the decrease in oxytocin binding. The findings were significant in hippocampus and subiculum. These findings suggest regulation of oxytocin receptors, and possibly oxytocin-regulated behaviors by glucocorticoids.
