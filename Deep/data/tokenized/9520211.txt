The involvement of the cholinergic septohippocampal system in strategies used to reach a spatial goal was examined by functionally inactivating this system with infusions of 192 IgG saporin, a potent cholinergic immunotoxin. Rats were initially trained on a win-shift radial arm maze (RAM) task and then given injections of either 192 IgG saporin (LES) or saline vehicle (CON) into the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band. Rats were then retested postoperatively on the RAM to assess whether allocentric spatial strategies used to solve the task were impaired. The results indicated that injections of 192 IgG saporin into the septum of rats produced deficits in allocentric strategies used to locate the spatial goal when retested. In addition, place and response learning was also examined in a modified version of the Morris water maze task. In this task, rats with cholinergic lesions were mildly impaired in their ability to learn a place response. In order to clarify further whether rats may have been relying on allocentric or egocentric learning strategies to locate the platform, a probe trial was given on the final test day in which the visible platform was moved to a new location. Control rats swam either to the new platform location or the old platform location indicating the use of both an allocentric and egocentric response. However, rats with the cholinergic septal lesions swam to the new platform location indicating an egocentric response. Taken together, these results suggest that selective cholinergic lesions of the septum produce deficits in spatial strategies used to locate a spatial goal.
