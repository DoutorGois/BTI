Depression is one of the most common mental disorders and a primary cause of disability. To better treat patients suffering this illness, elucidation of the underlying psychopathological and neurobiological mechanisms is urgently needed. Based on the above-mentioned evidence, we sought to investigate the effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) treatment in tricyclic antidepressant treatment-resistant depression induced by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration. Mice were treated with NPY (5.84, 11.7 or 23.4mmol/mul) intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) for one or five days. The levels of serum corticosterone, tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity in the hippocampus were analyzed. The behavioral parameters (depressive-like and locomotor activity) were also verified. This study demonstrated that ACTH administration increased serum corticosterone levels, KYN, 5-HIAA levels, IDO activity (hippocampus), immobility in the forced swimming test (FST) and the latency to feed in the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT). In addition, ACTH administration decreased the BDNF and NGF levels in the hippocampus of mice. NPY treatment was effective in preventing these hormonal, neurochemical and behavioral alterations. It is suggested that the main target of NPY is the modulation of corticosterone and neuronal plasticity protein levels, which may be closely linked with pharmacological action in a model of tricyclic antidepressant treatment-resistant depression. Thus, this study demonstrated a protective effect of NPY on the alterations induced by ACTH administration in mice, indicating that it could be useful as a therapy for the treatment of tricyclic antidepressant treatment-resistant depression.
