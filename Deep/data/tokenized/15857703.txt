Individual differences in behavioral traits are associated with sensitivity to various neurochemical and psychopharmacological manipulations. In this study exploratory and amphetamine-induced behavior in rats with persistently high or low exploratory activity (HE and LE, respectively) was examined before and after a partial denervation of the locus coeruleus (LC) projections with the selective neurotoxin DSP-4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine; 10 mg/kg). Partial LC denervation prevented the increase in exploratory activity over repeated test sessions in the LE animals, but had no effect in HE-rats. Amphetamine- (0.5 mg/kg) induced locomotor activity was attenuated by DSP-4 pretreatment only in HE-rats. These results suggest differential involvement of LC noradrenergic transmission in novelty- and amphetamine-induced behavior in animals with persistent differences in novelty-related behavior. In addition to partial noradrenaline depletion in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which occurred in both HE- and LE-rats, DSP-4 treatment also decreased the content of dopamine and its metabolites in the nucleus accumbens, and the metabolite levels in striatum, but only in the LE-animals. 5-HIAA levels were also reduced in the nucleus accumbens and striatum in LE-rats by the neurotoxin. D(2) receptor function, as determined by dopamine-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, was increased by DSP-4 treatment in the striatum of LE-rats, but reduced in HE-rats. No effect of partial LC denervation was found on dopamine-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in the nucleus accumbens. Together these findings suggest that LC noradrenergic neurotransmission is differently involved in dopaminergic mechanisms which mediate novelty-related vs amphetamine-induced behavior.
