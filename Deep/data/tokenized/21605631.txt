Induction of brain cytokines during times of stress has potent effects on altering behavior, mood, and cognitive functioning. Currently, it is unknown why exposure to some stressors such as tailshock and footshock elevate brain cytokines, while exposure to swim, predator odor, and restraint stress do not. Recent data indicate that brain noradrenergic signaling mediates brain cytokine production suggests magnitude of norepinephrine release during stress may be critical in initiating brain cytokine production. The aim of the current study was to investigate stress-induced brain cytokines between rat strains that differ in their magnitude of stress responsiveness as measured by brain norepinephrine and HPA responses. Sprague-Dawley and Fischer rats were placed in a restraint bag for 1 h or 2 h and sacrificed immediately following stressor termination. Exposure to restraint significantly elevated hypothalamic interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-1 receptor type (R) 2 mRNA after 1 h and IL-1beta protein after 2 h in the high stress responsive Fischer rats, but not in Sprague-Dawley rats. IL-6, IL-1R1, Il-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 mRNA were not altered and neither there was expression of any cytokines in the hippocampus or circulating cytokines in either strain. Administration of desipramine (a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) to Sprague-Dawley rats was sufficient either alone or in combination with stress to increase IL-1beta mRNA in the hypothalamus and desipramine combined with stress was sufficient to increase IL-1R2 mRNA in the hypothalamus. These data support our hypothesis that there is a critical threshold of brain norepinephrine necessary to stimulate brain cytokines, which may help to explain why severe stressors are more commonly reported to induce brain cytokines. These data also suggest an organisms' susceptibility to stress-induced brain cytokine production, depends on responsiveness and regulation of noradrenergic neurons.
