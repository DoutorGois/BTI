This study examined the effects of tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA, an anticholinesterase) on water-maze (WM) spatial reference (stable platform location during training) and spatial working memory (reversal of platform location) learning in young intact/medial septal (MS)-lesioned and aged rats. THA (1 or 3 mg/kg, IP) had no effect on reference or working memory performance of young intact rats. MS lesions decreased cholineacetyltransferase activity in the hippocampus and also impaired spatial reference and working memory. THA at 3 mg/kg stabilized MS lesion-induced reference memory performance deficit (path length increase), but was ineffective at 1 mg/kg. THA had no effect on the working memory performance of MS-lesioned rats. Aged rats were impaired in spatial reference and working memory tasks. THA at 3 mg/kg partially stabilized the age-induced spatial reference memory deficits, but was ineffective at 1 mg/kg. THA at either 1 or 3 mg/kg did not alleviate the age-related deficit in the working memory version of WM. The present results suggest that some of the age-related WM deficits may be related to the degeneration of the MS-hippocampus cholinergic system and that THA may be effective in stabilizing the reference memory deficits induced by hippocampal cholinergic dysfunction.
