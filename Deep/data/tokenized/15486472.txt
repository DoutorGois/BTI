We investigated the role of nitric oxide (NO) on mitochondrial complexes activity, following short-term non-desensitizing activation of AMPA receptors with kainate (KA) plus cyclothiazide (CTZ), in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In these conditions, we observed a decrease in the activity of mitochondrial complexes I, II/III, and IV. A selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-Nitroindazole, prevented the decrease in the activity of mitochondrial complex I, but not for the other complexes. Exposure to KA plus CTZ also increased cyclic GMP levels significantly, and led to increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine, a biomarker for peroxynitrite production. Taken together, our results suggest that non-desensitizing activation of AMPA receptors causes inhibition of mitochondrial complex I via peroxynitrite.
