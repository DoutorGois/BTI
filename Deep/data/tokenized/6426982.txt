The effects of lesions in the basal medial hypothalamus and limbic structure on the acetate metabolic responses to daily repeated exposure to immobilization stress in the liver of rabbits have been investigated. The experimental results were as follows: (1) The acetate metabolic response to the 1st exposure to immobilization stress (exposure on the 1st day) were considerably altered by lesions in the periventricular arcuate nucleus (ARC) ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), stria terminalis (ST) and dorsal fornix (FX). (2) The acetate metabolic responses to immobilization stress were completely abolished by seven times repetition of immobilization stress in the rabbits with lesions in ARC, VMH and FX; they were similar to sham-operated groups. (3) In rabbits with ST lesions, the acetate metabolic responses to the 7th exposure (exposure on the 7th day) to immobilization stress were exactly the same as those after the 1st exposure of immobilization stress, but these metabolic responses were completely abolished by the seven times repetition of exposure in the sham-operated animals. (4) These results suggest that firstly, the ARC, VMH, amygdala(AMYG)-ST system and dorsal hippocampus(HPC)-FX system are involved in the acetate metabolic responses to the 1st exposure of immobilization stress, and secondly, that only the AMYG-ST is involved in the disappearance process of acetate metabolic responses to immobilization stress by the daily repetition of immobilization stress.
