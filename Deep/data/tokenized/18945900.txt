S100B is the principal calcium-binding protein of astrocytes and known to be secreted to extracellular space. Although secreted S100B has been reported to promote neurite extension and cell survival via its receptor [receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)], effects of extracellular S100B on neural activity have been mostly unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that secreted S100B enhances kainate-induced gamma oscillations. Local infusion of S100B in S100B(-/-) mice enhanced hippocampal kainate-induced gamma oscillations in vivo. In a complementary set of experiments, local application of anti-S100B antibody in wild-type mice attenuated the gamma oscillations. Both results indicate that the presence of extracellular S100B enhances the kainate-induced gamma oscillations. In acutely isolated hippocampal slices, kainate application increased S100B secretion in a neural-activity-dependent manner. Further pharmacological experiments revealed that S100B secretion was critically dependent on presynaptic release of neurotransmitter and activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3. Moreover, the kainate-induced gamma oscillations were attenuated by the genetic deletion or antibody blockade of RAGE in vivo. These results suggest RAGE activation by S100B enhances the gamma oscillations. Together, we propose a novel pathway of neuron-glia communications--astrocytic release of S100B modulates neural network activity through RAGE activation.
