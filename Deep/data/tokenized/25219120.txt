OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture intervention on expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp 78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in the hippocampus in epilepsy rats so as to explore its mechanism underlying improvement of hyperspasmia-induced brain injury. METHODS: Forty-two SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group (n = 6), model group (n = 18), and acupuncture group (n = 18). The epileptic seizure model was established by intraperitonel injection of Pentylenetetrazol (50 mg/kg, 2 mL). Manual acupuncture stimulation of "Baihui" (GV 20) and "Dazhui" (GV 14) was conducted for rats of the acupuncture group for 30 min. Two hours (h), 12 h and 48 h after acupuncture intervention, the hippocampal tissue was sampled (6 rats at each time-point). The expression levels of Grp 78 and CHOP proteins in the hippocampal CA 1 region were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the expression levels of Grp 78 protein at time-points of 2 h and 12 h, and those of CHOP protein at 2 h, 12 h and 48 h after epilpeptic seizure were significantly increased in the model group (P < 0.01). After acupuncture treatment, the expression levels of Grp 78 at 12 and 48 h were significantly increased, and those of CHOP protein at 2 h, 12 h and 24 h in the acupuncture group were considerably downregulated (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Acupuncture treatment can up-regulate Grp 78 protein expression and down-regulate CHOP protein expression level in epilepsy rats , which may contribute to its protective effect on seizure-induced brain injury.
