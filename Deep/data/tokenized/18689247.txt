The comparative effects of antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 on the epileptiform activity development in CA1 hippocampal neurons were studied in different functional models of epileptogenesis that are not accompanied the visible morphological disturbances in the brain cells: --in vitro hypoxic model in the rat hippocampal slices; 2--in vitro disinhibitory model with using GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, in the rat hippocampal slices; 3--partial hippocampal kindling model in freely moving rats. Interleukin-10 (1 ng/ml) depressed the posthypoxic hyperexcitability in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampal slices through a decrease of the effectiveness of hypoxia to depresses the functional neuronal activity in the rat hippocampal slices during hypoxic episode. On the other hand, interleukin-10 (1 ng/ml) did not affect an initiation of epileptiform activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampal slices induced by bicuculline. Interleukin-10 (1 ng/5 microl) applied to the dorsal hippocampus in awake rats depressed an initiation of focal seizures ("ictal"-like components of afterdischarges) induced by hippocampal kindling during the first six hours after an application. However, this cytokine did not affect neither the duration of "interictal"-like component of afterdischarges nor motor seizure development. Thus, our findings showed that antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, in addition to its antihypoxic action, exert the neuroprotective effect on the initiation of "ictal"-like, but not "interictal"-like, epileptiform discharges.
