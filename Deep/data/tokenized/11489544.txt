Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP) has a neuroprotective effect in neonatal and adult rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of FBP on hippocampal neuronal damage in fetal sheep asphyxiated by 10 min of complete umbilical cord occlusion. Thirteen fetal sheep at 124 days of gestation were surgically instrumented with catheters. Cardiorespiratory parameters were monitored, and biochemical analyses were performed with the blood samples. During the insult seven fetuses were given FBP (500 mg/kg) and six were given iso-osmotic saline, and hippocampal neuronal damage was examined histologically and scored. Cardiorespiratory changes were the same in both groups, and there was no neuroprotective effect of FBP in this study. However the decrease of serum total Ca level implied the Ca- chelating effect of FBP.
