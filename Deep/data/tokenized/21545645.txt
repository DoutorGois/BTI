In the present study, we investigated age-related changes in pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) immunoreactivity and its protein levels in the gerbil hippocampus at various ages using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. In the post-natal month 1 (PM 1) group, PACAP-immunoreactive cells were found in all hippocampal subregions. The number of PACAP-immunoreactive cells was decreased in the PM 3 group and was still more decreased in the PM 6 and 12 groups. Thereafter, in the PM 18 and 24 groups, PACAP-immunoreactive cells were significantly increased again. However, in the mossy fibre zone, PACAP immunostaining was very strong in the adult group, especially in the PM 6 group. In addition, PACAP protein level was highest at PM 6, showing a slight decrease at PM 24. These results indicate that PACAP-immunoreactive cells are lowest in the adult stage and highest in the aged stage. However, PACAP immunoreactivity in the mossy fibre zone and PACAP protein level in the hippocampus are highest in the adult stage.
