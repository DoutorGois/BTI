MRI signal changes within the hippocampal sulcus have been attributed to a dilated Virchow-Robin space within that sulcus, but no clinical correlates have previously been described. We present a 64-year-old man who developed right temporal seizures. MRI revealed an unusually enlarged Virchow-Robin space within the hippocampus, suggesting space-occupying effect. Such an abnormality should be considered a possible etiology in patients with late-onset temporal lobe epilepsy.
