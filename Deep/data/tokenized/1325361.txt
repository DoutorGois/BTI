The specific glutamate metabotropic receptor agonist 1S,3R-aminocyclopentane dicarboxylate (ACPD), but not its inactive enantiomer 1R,3S-ACPD, induced a slowly developing potentiation of synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal slices. This effect was independent of its ability to potentiate responses mediated by the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Perfusion with 1S,3R-ACPD provides, therefore, a means of chemically inducing a form of long-term potentiation.
