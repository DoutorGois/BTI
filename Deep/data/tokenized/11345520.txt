Cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that has been implicated in neuronal responses to ischemia. We examined the effect of global cerebral ischemia in the rat on the expression of CREB, its transcriptionally active phosphorylated form (pCREB), and the nuclear adaptor protein, CREB binding protein (CBP). Global ischemia induced the expression of pCREB and CBP in vulnerable neurons of the hippocampal CA1 sector. In primary cultures of murine cortical neurons subjected to hypoxia, CBP was selectively expressed in cells with morphologically intact cell nuclei, and not in cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei indicative of irreversibly damaged neurons. These results support a role for transcriptional activation by CREB and CBP in neuronal cell-survival programs following cerebral ischemia.
