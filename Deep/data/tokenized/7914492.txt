The excitotoxins kainic acid and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) were unilaterally injected in the rat striatum. Kainic acid injections resulted in a widespread pattern of Fos protein induction, mainly involving cortical olfactory structures and hippocampus. Immunoreactive cells were observed in large number 2-24 h after injection and had almost completely disappeared by 48 h. NMDA injections elicited a shorter (2-8 h) expression of Fos protein, involving a lower number of cells in cortical olfactory structures, a much larger number of cells in the other cortical regions, and not involving the hippocampus at all. Characteristically none of the two excitotoxins stimulated Fos expression from striatal neurons, even in the close vicinity of the needle tract. In addition to striatal lesions almost equivalent in size, the two excitotoxins caused distant lesions of different extension: kainic acid resulted in extensive neuronal degeneration in the olfactory-entorhinal cortices and among pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus; NMDA caused a less widespread neurodegeneration, restricted to the olfactory cortex. Administration of the competitive NMDA antagonist CGP 39551 largely prevented the distant, but not the local, neuropathological changes caused by intrastriatal kainic acid or NMDA. The expression of Fos protein, however, was partially prevented only in NMDA cases. The present results show a good relationship between the spreading of circuit overexcitation caused by the two excitotoxins and the regional and temporal patterns of Fos expression. The relationship between Fos expression and neuropathological condition remains, however, elusive.
