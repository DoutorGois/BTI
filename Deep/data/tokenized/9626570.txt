It is generally agreed that lipid peroxides play an important role in the pathogenesis of ethanol-induced cellular injury and that free sulfhydryl groups are vital in cellular defense against endogenous or exogenous oxidants. It has been observed that oxidative stress induces the synthesis of the 70-kDa family of heat-shock proteins (HSPs). Induction of HSPs represents an essential and highly conserved cellular response to a variety of stressful stimuli. In the present study we measured in various brain areas and in liver the intracellular levels of HSP70 proteins, sulfhydryl groups and the antioxidant enzyme status after chronic administration of mild intoxicating doses of ethanol to rats. Expression of HSP70 in response to alcohol administration was particularly high in the hippocampus and striatum. In these brain areas, the increase in HSP70 protein levels occurred in absence of significant changes of antioxidant enzyme activities and was correlated with a marked depletion of intracellular bound thiols and with a decreased susceptibility to lipid peroxidation. Lower levels of HSP70 induction were found in cortex and cerebellum and were associated to decreases in SOD and CAT enzyme activities, with a lower depletion of protein bound thiols and with an increased susceptibility to lipid peroxidation. This study agrees with our previous results performed on acute alcohol intoxication and supports the hypothesis that HSP70 induction protects the different brain areas against oxidative stress.
