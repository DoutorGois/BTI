Using magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, we examined volumetric measurements of total brain, hemispheres, lateral ventricles and the hippocampus/amygdala complex in male subjects (41 first-episode schizophrenics, 30 chronic schizophrenic patients and 32 healthy controls). We found significantly smaller total brain size in the chronic schizophrenic group, significantly larger lateral ventricles in both patient groups and hippocampal volume reduction bilaterally in first-episode patients (-13.2% left, -12.05% right) and chronic patients (-10.6% left, -10.5% right) compared to controls--irrespective of diagnostic subtype, family history for psychiatric diseases, psychopathology, duration of illness or age at onset.
