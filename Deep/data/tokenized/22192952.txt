The effects of tungsten carbide nanoparticles (nano-WC) on the properties of voltage-dependent potassium currents and evoked action potentials were studied in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons of rats at the ages of postnatal days 10-14 using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The results indicated that: (1) the amplitudes of transient outward potassium current (I(A)) and delayed rectifier potassium current (I(K)) were significantly decreased by 10(-7) g/ml nano-WC, while the current-voltage curves of I(A) and I(K) were significantly decreased by nano-WC from +10 to +90 mV. (2) Nano-WC produced a depolarizing shift in the steady-state activation curve of I(A) and I(K) with increased slope factors, and delayed the recovery of I(A) from inactivation, but no significant effects were found on the inactivation of I(A). (3) Nano-WC prolonged the evoked action potential duration and lowered the firing rate. These results suggest that 10(-7) g/ml nano-WC can decrease the amplitudes of I(A) and I(K) currents by reducing the opening number of voltage-gated potassium channels and delaying the recovery of I(A) from inactivation, which indicate that nano-WC has the potential neurotoxicity.
