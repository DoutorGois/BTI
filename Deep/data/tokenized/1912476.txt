Differential patterns of developmental changes were observed between 10 and 150 days of age in numerical densities of ethanolic-phosphotungstic acid stained synapses in the molecular layer of cingulate cortex (area 29 c,d) and hippocampus (CA1)-dentate region in rat. Chronic caloric undernutrition commencing prenatally caused considerable reduction of synaptic densities up to 45 days of age in both the cortices, but showed opposite trends subsequently; the density attained was higher than control in the cingulate area, but lower than control in hippocampus-dentate area. Post-weaning rehabilitatory nutrition resulted in a reduced deviation from normal in the cingulate area but not in the hippocampus-dentate area.
