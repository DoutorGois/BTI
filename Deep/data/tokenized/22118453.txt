The brain's grid and place cells, which contribute to spatial representations of the external environment, are thought to be modulated by the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)). Giocomo et al. and Hussaini et al. now provide new insights into these cells' unique activity patterns by studying transgenic mice lacking I(h).
