Phosphorylation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in slices from immature rats is stimulated by glutamate via a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR II) and by absence of external Ca2+ in reactions that are not additive (Wofchuk and Rodnight, Neurochem. Int. 24:517-523, 1994). These observations suggested that glutamate, via an mGluR, inhibits Ca(2+)-entry through L-type Ca2+ channels and down-regulates a Ca(2+)-dependent dephosphorylation event coupled to GFAP. Because ryanodine receptors are present on internal Ca2+ stores and are associated with L-type Ca(2+)-channels, we investigated the possibility that the glutamatergic modulation of GFAP phosphorylation involves internal Ca2+ stores regulated by ryanodine receptors and whether the Ca2+ originating from these stores acts in a similar manner to external Ca2+. The results showed that the ryanodine receptor-agonists, caffeine and ryanodine and thapsigargin, all of which in appropriate doses increase cytoplasmic Ca2+, reversed the stimulation of GFAP phosphorylation given by 1S,3R-ACPD, an mGluR II agonist.
