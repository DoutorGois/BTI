[125I][Tyr14]Orphanin binds to a number of saturable non-interacting binding sites in rat brain cortical membrane preparations, with a density of 510 fmol/mg protein and affinity 0.9 nM. This high affinity, saturable [125I][Tyr14]orphanin binding was not inhibited by leu-enkephalin and by other ligands for opiate and neurotransmitter receptors both in membrane preparations and brain sections. In rat brain sections, the highest density of binding was found in the outer and medial cortical layers, subiculum, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens; intermediate binding densities were found in the inner cortical layer, pontine nuclei, thalamus and hypothalamus. Very low specific binding was seen in the cerebellum and striatum, according to the described distribution of ORL1 transcripts. These results suggest that [125I][Tyr14] orphanin binding in rat brain occurs to the described ORL1 receptor.
