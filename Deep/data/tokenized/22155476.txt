The substance P/NK1 receptor system plays an important role in the regulation of stress and emotional responding and as such had been implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression. The present study investigated whether alterations in the substance P/NK1 receptor system in brain areas which regulate emotional responding accompany the depressive behavioural phenotype observed in the olfactory bulbectomised (OB) mouse. The effect of NK1 receptor deletion on behavioural responding and monoamine levels in discrete brain regions of the OB model, were also examined. Substance P levels in the frontal cortex and NK1 receptor expression in the amygdala and hippocampus were enhanced following olfactory bulbectomy. Although NK1 receptor knockout (NK1-/-) mice did not exhibit altered behavioural responding in the open field test, noradrenaline levels were enhanced in the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, as were serotonin levels in the frontal cortex. Locomotor activity and exploratory behaviour were enhanced in wild type OB mice, indicative of a depressive-like phenotype, an effect attenuated in NK1-/- mice. Bulbectomy induced a decrease in noradrenaline and 5-HIAA in the frontal cortex and an increase in serotonin in the amygdala, effects attenuated in OB NK1-/- mice. The present studies indicate that alterations in substance P/NK1 receptor system underlie, at least in part, the behavioural and monoaminergic changes in this animal model of depression.
