The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on Neuroglobin (Ngb) and Cytoglobin (Cygb) as well as oxidative stress gene expression in the cerebellum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cortex. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: Control and two groups receiving 2 different daily BPA dosages, 5 or 25 mg/kg from postnatal day 50 (PND50) through PND90 and they were euthanized at PND105. In the cortex, we found an increase in Ngb gene expression and also in superoxide dismutase 1 and Catalase (Cat). In the cerebellum, we found an increase in Ngb and Cat, in the hypothalamus, there was a decrease in Cygb and an increase in glutathione peroxidase and Cat and in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1alpha) at the low dosage and a decrease in Hif1alpha at the high BPA dosage. Finally, in the hippocampus, we observed a decrease in Ngb and Cygb and an increase in Hif1alpha. In summary, BPA promotes the modulation of both Ngb and Cygb, but such changes occur by different mechanisms depending on the exposure dose and anatomical area.
