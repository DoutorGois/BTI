Alterations in inflammatory process, neuronal death, and glia response have been observed under manipulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and subsequent signaling through the type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1). To investigate the influence of IL-1R1 activation in the pathophysiology of a chemical-induced injury to the murine hippocampus, we examined the level and pattern of neuronal death and neuroinflammation in male weanling mice exposed to trimethyltin hydroxide (2.0 mg TMT/kg, i.p.). Dentate granule cell death occurred at 6 h post-TMT as detected by active caspase 3 immunostaining and presence of lectin positive microglia. The severity of neuronal death and microglia response increased by 12-24 h with elevations in mRNA levels for TNFalpha and IL-1alpha. In IL-1R1 null (IL-1R1-/-) mice, the pattern and severity of neuronal death at 24 or 72 h post-TMT was similar as compared to wildtype (WT) mice. In both groups, mRNA levels for TNFalpha and MIP-1alpha were elevated, no significant change was seen in either IL-1alpha or IL-1beta, and the early activation of microglia, including their ability to progress to a phagocytic phenotype, was maintained. Compared to WT mice, IL-1R1-/- mice displayed a limited glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytic response, as well as a preferential induction in mRNA levels of Fas signaling components. Cumulatively, these results indicate that IL-1R1 activation is not necessary for TMT-induced death of dentate granule neurons or local activation of microglia; however, IL-1R1 signaling is involved in mediating the structural response of astrocytes to injury and may regulate apoptotic mechanisms via Fas signaling components.
