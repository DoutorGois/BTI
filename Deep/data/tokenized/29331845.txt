Levetiracetam (LEV) is an anticonvulsant drug with a unique mechanism of action that is not completely understood. However, its activity profile may involve effects on excitatory and/or inhibitory neurotransmission since the primary target of LEV, synaptic vesicle protein 2A, is ubiquitously expressed in all types of synaptic vesicles. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore the effect of LEV (300mg/kg/day for one week, administered via osmotic mini-pumps) on neurotransmitter release and its probable selective effect on extracellular gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), aspartate (Asp), glutamine (Gln), taurine (Tau) and glycine (Gly) concentrations (using in vivo microdialysis under basal and high-K(+) conditions) in the dorsal hippocampus (DH), a region that undergoes major synaptic changes during epilepsy. Epileptic rats developed clear signs of hyperexcitability, i.e., an elevated Glu/GABA ratio in the DH. The LEV concentration in blood after 7days of treatment was within the therapeutic range. In contrast, LEV was not detected four days after mini-pump removal (washout period). Furthermore, LEV restored the Glu/GABA ratio to approximately the control level and significantly increased the GABA concentration after the initiation of high-K(+) conditions. Based on these data, LEV treatment restored the lost balance between the excitatory and inhibitory systems under basal conditions. Moreover, LEV showed a selective effect by preferentially increasing vesicular release of GABA, a mechanism by which LEV could reduce epileptic seizures.
