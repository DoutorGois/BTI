OBJECTIVE: Ideal temperature and flow rate for selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) are not known. We examined regional organ perfusion in a piglet SCP model. METHODS: Three groups underwent SCP at 30 mL/kg/min at different temperatures (15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 32 degrees C) and 4 groups remained at 25 degrees C for SCP at different flow rates (10, 30, 50 and 75 mL/kg/min). Fluorescent microspheres were injected at 5 minutes of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), immediately before SCP, SCP 45 minutes, SCP 90 minutes, and 2 hours after CPB. Brain and lower body organs were collected to examine regional blood flow (RBF, mL/min/g). RESULTS: At 2 hours after CPB, RBF of the 32 degrees C group was higher than that of the 15 degrees C group (P < .05) at the caudate nucleus and hippocampus; RBF of the 32 degrees C group was higher than that of the 25 degrees C and 15 degrees C groups (P < .05) at the neocortex. No significant difference in RBF was observed among any of the 25 degrees C groups at different flow rates. Also, there was no significant difference between the RBF to the left and right sides of brain in either the temperature or flow rate groups. RBF did significantly increase with temperature in the liver and quadriceps during SCP (P < .05). At the kidney, RBF at SCP 90 minutes was significantly higher than that at SCP 45 minutes when all temperature groups were combined (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: SCP at 32 degrees C provides higher brain RBF 2 hours after CPB. Increasing SCP flow rate does not increase RBF significantly at 25 degrees C. Higher temperature during SCP results in improved RBF to the liver and quadriceps.
