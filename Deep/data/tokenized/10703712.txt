Changes of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the hippocampus and the basal ganglia were studied in rats treated i.p. with L-carnitine (CRT) and 7-methoxytacrine (7-MEOTA) (i.m.) separately or 3-days treated with L-carnitine and then with one administration of 7-MEOTA. Both compounds increased ChAT activity when administered separately. 3-day treatment of CRT followed by administration of 7-MEOTA normalized ChAT activity.
