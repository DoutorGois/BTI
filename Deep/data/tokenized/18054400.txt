The hippocampus is essentially involved in learning and memory, and is known to be a target for androgen actions. Androgen receptors are densely expressed in CA1 of rat hippocampus, and mediate the effects of testosterone (T) on learning and memory. T depletion or administration can modulate neural function and cognitive performance. We conducted series of experiments to further investigate the effect of castration or intra hippocampal injection of T on acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of inhibitory avoidance learning and memory. Male adult rats were bilaterally cannulated into CA1 of hippocampus, and then received T (1, 10, 20, 40 and 80mug/0.5mul/side) or vehicle (DMSO), 30min before training, immediately after training and 30min before retrieval in inhibitory avoidance task. Castration was made by gonadectomy of male rats and behavioral tests performed 4 weeks later. Our results showed that gonadectomy of male rats did not influence performance on inhibitory avoidance task, as compared to sham-operated rats. We have also found that pre-training, post-training and pre-retrieval intra CA1 injections of T significantly decreased step-through latencies in inhibitory avoidance learning at doses 1 and 80, 20, and 20 and 40mug/0.5mul/side, respectively. The data suggest that intra CA1 administration of T could impair learning and memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval, while systemic androgen's depletion have no effect on memory, in inhibitory avoidance task.
