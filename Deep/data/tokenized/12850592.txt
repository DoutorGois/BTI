Cannabinoids have been shown to disrupt memory processes and these effects occur primarily through cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the brain. The present study investigates, for the first time, the regional variations and age-related changes in CB1 protein expression in the hippocampus and its neighbouring entorhinal, perirhinal, postrhinal and temporal cortices using Western blotting. In young adult rats, CB1 protein was highly expressed in the hippocampus and within the hippocampus, the greatest density of CB1 protein was located in CA1. When a comparison was made between young (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) rats, CB1 protein expression was significantly increased in the aged entorhinal and temporal cortices and was significantly decreased in the aged postrhinal cortex. The present study demonstrates region-specific changes in CB1 protein expression during ageing and further suggests that cannabinoid CB1 receptors may contribute to the aging process.
