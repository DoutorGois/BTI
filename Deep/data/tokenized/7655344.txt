Senile plaques found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are surrounded by clusters of reactive microglia. Isolated human microglia placed in contact with plaques in vitro are activated to release a factor which is toxic to neurons. This same neurotoxin is found in AD brain tissue and causes damage to pyramidal neurons in vivo when infused into rat hippocampus. Highest concentrations of the neurotoxin are in those brain structures most burdened by reactive microglia, suggesting that plaque-activated cells contribute to the neuronal damage and impaired cognition seen in patients with Alzheimer's dementia.
