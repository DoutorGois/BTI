The influence of trimethyl tin (TMT) intoxication on muscarinic cholinergic receptors and histochemistry of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the rat brain 21 days after treatment was studied. The topographical distribution and reduction in muscarinic receptor sites were analysed by means of quantitative receptor autoradiography using [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). TMT treatment produced a decrease in cholinergic receptors in a large number of brain regions. The quantitative distribution of AChE was examined in over 60 regions following TMT intoxication. The activity of AChE was significantly affected. Reduced AChE content was found in several brain regions following TMT intoxication. The effect on AChE content was confined to cholinergic terminal areas, e.g. the hippocampus, while in the area dentata a significant increase in AChE content was detected. The results are interpreted in terms of TMT producing disruption of the cholinergic system with implications for a neuroanatomical basis of impaired memory mechanisms.
