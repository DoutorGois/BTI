The indusium griseum (IG) and anterior hippocampal continuation (AHC) are longitudinal and continuous structures that consist of two narrow strips of gray matter overlying the rostrocaudal length of the corpus callosum, extending rostrally to the genu of the corpus callosum and ventrally to the rostrum. The present study aimed to characterize the phenotype of neuronal innervations to the IG-AHC and their intra-structural topographic organization. Using immunohistochemistry, we found nerve fibers expressing choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, the serotonin reuptake transporter as well as glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 and parvalbumin. These suggest that the IG and AHC are innervated by acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine and GABA neurons. More importantly, all these fibers display a topographic laminar distribution in both brain areas. The presence of varicosities along the nerve fibers suggests that these neurotransmitters are released extracellullarly to exert a physiological action. Finally, the structural similarities with the dentate gyrus support the idea that the IG and AHC are anatomically associated, if not continuous, with this area and may represent in mammals a vestige of the hippocampus.
