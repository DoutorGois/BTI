Background: Memory retrieval refers to re-exposure to information previously encoded and stored in the brain. Following retrieval, a once-consolidated memory destabilizes and undergoes reconsolidation, during which gene expression changes to restabilize memory. Investigating epigenetic regulation during reconsolidation could provide insights into normal memory formation and pathological memory associated with psychiatric disorders. Methods: We used cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) to assess the cocaine-associated memory of mice and used chemogenetic methods to manipulate the activity of the pyramidal neurons in the dHC. We isolated the ribosome-associated transcripts from the excitatory neurons in the dHC by RiboTag purification to identify the potential epigenetic regulators, and we specifically knocked down gene expression in pyramidal neurons with a Cre-dependent lentivirus. Results: Chemogenetically silencing the activity of the pyramidal neurons in the dHC immediately after memory retrieval markedly impaired memory reconsolidation, and the ribosome-associated mRNA level of the ten-eleven translocation (Tet) family methylcytosine dioxygenase Tet3, but not Tet1 or Tet2, was dramatically upregulated 10 min after memory retrieval. The protein level of Tet3 in the dHC but not in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was dramatically increased 1 hr after memory retrieval. Specifically, knockdown of Tet3 in pyramidal pyramidal neurons in the dHC decreased the activation of pyramidal neurons and impaired the reconsolidation of cocaine-associated memory. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the new function of the DNA demethylation regulator Tet3 in pyramidal neurons of the dHC in regulating the reconsolidation of cocaine-associated memory.
