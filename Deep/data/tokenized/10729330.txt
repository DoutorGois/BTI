The proto-oncogene ras plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation. However, ras genes are abundantly expressed in the adult CNS, although neuronal cells normally do not proliferate. Recently, several lines of evidence implicated the involvement of Ras signaling pathway in synaptic plasticity. To explore the role of the Ras proteins in the CNS, we generated knock-out mice lacking the H-ras gene and then used them to study the roles of Ras in synaptic transmission and plasticity. An investigation of protein phosphorylation and synaptic transmission in H-ras null mutant mice has shown that the NMDA receptor is a final target molecule of the Ras protein pathway in the CNS. In the H-ras null mutant hippocampus, the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A (epsilon1) and NR2B (epsilon2) subunits of NMDA receptors is increased, and, correspondingly, NMDA synaptic responses are selectively enhanced. In addition, long-term potentiation is markedly enhanced in mutant mice, most likely because of a selective enhancement of NMDA synaptic responses. Therefore, although Ras proteins have been implicated in cell proliferation and differentiation, the regulation of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult animals by downregulation of the phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor may be another major and pivotal role for H-Ras protein.
