Synapse formation, maintenance and plasticity are critical for the correct function of the nervous system and its target organs. During development, these processes enable the establishment of appropriate neural circuits. During adulthood, they allow adaptation to both physiological and environmental changes. In this review, we discuss emerging roles for two families of classical axon and vascular guidance cues in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, the semaphorins and the vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). Their contribution to synapse formation and function add a new facet to the spectrum of overlapping and complementary roles for these molecules in development, adulthood and disease.
