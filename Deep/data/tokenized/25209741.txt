The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of hypothermia on S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in serum and hippocampus CA1 area in asphyxiated rats after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A total of 100 SD rats were designated into four groups: group A, sham operation group; group B, rats received conventional resuscitation; group C, rats received conventional resuscitation and hypothermia at cardiac arrest; group D, rats received conventional resuscitation and hypothermia at 30 min after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Rats were then killed by cardiac arrest at 2 and 4 h after ROSC; brain tissue was taken to observe dynamic changes of S100B and GFAP in serum and hippocampus CA1 area. Following ROSC, S100B levels increased from 2 to 4 h in group B, C, and D. In addition, S100B in serum and hippocampus CA1 area was all significantly increased at different time points compared with group A (P < 0.05). Following ROSC, serum S100B level at 2 h in group C was significantly decreased compared with group B, but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Moreover, S100B in serum at 4 h after ROSC was significantly decreased (P < 0.05), S100B in cortex was significantly decreased (P < 0.05). The expression of GFAP was also examined. GFAP level in hippocampus CA1 area was significantly decreased in group B, C, and D at 4 h after ROSC compared with group A (P < 0.05). S100B and GFAP were expressed in rat serum and hippocampus CA2 area at early stage after ROSC, which can be used as sensitive markers for brain injury diagnosis and prognosis prediction. Hypothermia is also shown to reduce brain injury after CPR.
