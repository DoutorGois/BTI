The whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to study the mechanisms of induction of long term depression (LTD) occurring at the mossy fibre-CA3 synapse between postnatal (P) day 6 and P13. In control conditions, when two pulses were delivered to the mossy fibres with an interval of 50 ms a potentiation of the EPSC evoked by the second pulse associated with a reduction in the number of failures was observed. Tetanization of the mossy fibres induced LTD of the responses to the first and second stimulus without affecting the paired pulse facilitation. Loading the postsynaptic cell with BAPTA prevented the induction of LTD but did not modify the paired pulse facilitation, suggesting that LTD induction occurs at the postsynaptic site.
