Using spectrofluorimetric methods, endogenous levels of tryptophan (TRP), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined in various structures of the growing brain of cats. After one month, 5-HT metabolism is comparable to that observed in adult cats. The third week after birth is marked by increasing levels of TRP and 5-HIAA and seems to be a critical period for the maturation of serotoninergic neurons.
