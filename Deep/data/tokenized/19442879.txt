Current knowledge of the central nervous system distribution of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (beta(1)-AR) is incomplete. Here we present a general map of the beta(1)-AR distribution in the rat brain. beta(1)-AR-immunoreactivity was detected throughout the entire rat brain, but particularly dense staining was observed in the cerebellar cortex and basal ganglia. Brainstem areas displaying significant beta(1)-AR-immunoreactivity include the ventrolateral medulla, nucleus ambiguus and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Within the hypothalamus, only the paraventricular nucleus and the median eminence (ME) showed beta(1)-AR immunostaining. Numerous beta(1)-AR-immunoreactive cells were also found in the hippocampus, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. These results extend our knowledge of the expression profile of beta(1)-AR in the central nervous system. The identification of several distinct beta(1)-AR immunoreactive substrates linked with neuropathophysiological roles in cardiovascular disease supports the hypothesis that the therapeutic benefit of beta(1)-AR blockade may be conferred at least in part through central nervous system mechanisms.
