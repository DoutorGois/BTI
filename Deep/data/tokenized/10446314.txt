We used ouabain (100 microM) to block Na+,K(+)ATPase of in vitro rat hippocampal slices. This treatment was sufficient to cause the sudden depolarization that is the hallmark of both spreading depression (SD) and of the SD-like anoxic depolarization (AD). This depolarization was accompanied by a large and sudden increase in [K](o), also reminiscent of that observed during both SD and AD. Ouabain-induced SD did not require a complete inactivation of Na+,K(+)ATPase, as it occurred when the enzyme was still capable of providing recovery of both V(o) and [K](o). The data indicate that functional inactivation of Na+,K(+)ATPase per se initiates events that lead to an SD-like AD. This ouabain-induced depolarization was not affected by block of synaptic transmission, instead it was abolished by hyperosmolarity of the extracellular space. The possible relevance of these findings to the pathophysiology of AD is discussed.
