The local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was measured in the different areas and layers of the Ammon's horn and dentate gyrus of young adult (3 to 4-month-old) rats, and of 27-month-old rats with proven cognitive deficits. The LCGU was determined by quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. Compared to young animals, in the old rats the LCGU was significantly reduced by 12% to 15% in the oriens layers of CA1 and CA2, the pyramidal layers of the CA sectors 1-3, the radiatum and lacunosum-molecular layers of CA2 and CA3 and in the lucidum layer of CA3. The LCGU values of all the other layers of the Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus did not differ significantly between young and old rats. The pattern of the LCGU reduction found in the old rats roughly resembles changes found after fimbra-fornix lesions or systemic administration of scopolamine, suggesting a functionally important deficit in the cholinergic innervation of the old rats' hippocampi.
