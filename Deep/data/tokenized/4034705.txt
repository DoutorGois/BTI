The effects of the oral administration of thyroid hormones on the hippocampal glial cells in fasting or fed adult rats were studied. The hormone treatment and/or fasting were done during two periods of five days interpolated by ten days without any hormone treatment or fasting. Prominent histological changes and increased number of glial cells were observed in the hippocampus of rats when the thyroid hormone administration was associated with fasting.
