The commonly used nitric oxide donor, hydroxylamine (NH(2)OH), can block or reverse the inhibition of glutamatergic transmission by adenosine or an adenosine A(1) agonist in rat hippocampal slice. In these experiments, hydroxylamine did not affect the adenosine A(1) receptor-mediated depression of postsynaptic excitability. We conclude that hydroxylamine acts presynaptically to counter adenosine A(1) receptor-mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission.
