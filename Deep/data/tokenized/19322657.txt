Ouabain exerts neurotoxic action and activates the population of NMDA receptors. Herein the effect of ouabain on the expression of NMDA subunits was evaluated. Adult Wistar rats were administered intracerebroventricularly with 0.1, 10 and 100 nmol ouabain or saline solution (control). Two days later, membranes of cerebral cortex and hippocampus were isolated. Western blots with antibodies for the NMDA receptor subunits: NR1; NR2A; NR2B; NR2C and NR2D were carried out. In cerebral cortex, NR2D subunit increased 30% with 10 nmol ouabain dose. With 100 nmol ouabain, NR1 and NR2D subunits enhanced 40 and 20%, respectively. In hippocampus, with the dose of 0.1 nmol ouabain, NR1 subunit enhanced roughly 50% whereas NR2B subunit decreased 30%. After administration of 10 nmol ouabain dose, NR2A, NR2B and NR2C subunits decreased 40, 50 and 30%, respectively. With the dose of 100 nmol of ouabain, NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits diminished 10-20%. It is concluded that ouabain administration led to a differential regulation in the expression of NMDA subunits. These results may be correlated with the modulatory action of ouabain on NMDA receptor.
