The purpose of this study is to evaluate the extent of brain damage following deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), using behavior and pathological findings. The dogs underwent 60, 90 or 120 min of DHCA. After 72 h or 6 months, their cerebrum pathological findings were examined. No neurological deficit was found in any of the dogs. After 72 h, hippocampus cells (CA1) were TUNEL positive in 120-min-DHCA dogs. This study demonstrates that 90-min-DHCA-dogs can survive healthily over 6 months, and apoptotic cell death occurs in canine hippocampus following 120 min of DHCA at 15 degrees C.
