Trains of high-frequency stimulation to the perforant path cause (i) long-term potentiation (LTP) of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP), (ii) a lasting increase in the population spike, and (iii) a lasting alteration of the relationship between the EPSP and population spike (E-S relationship), consisting of a decreased x-intercept and decreased slope of the linear regression. To compare the thresholds of these changes, we applied a series of trains, increasing in duration from below LTP threshold. The EPSP potentiated with about the same low threshold as the reduction in E-S slope, whereas the reduction in E-S x-intercept required longer trains. In the second experiment, LTP of the EPSP was reduced by concurrent high-frequency stimulation of the commissural input and a lasting reduction of the population spike height was observed. In a third experiment, picrotoxin, an antagonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition, blocked the decrease in slope of the E-S relationship which normally accompanies LTP. These results imply that perforant path/granule cell LTP is normally accompanied by long-term potentiation of a feed-forward inhibitory pathway which may involve interneurones.
