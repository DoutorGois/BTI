This study characterizes changes occurring in the central histaminergic system associated with ischemia-reperfusion pathology in the rat. Specifically, after a postocclusion time period of 48 h, we have analyzed histamine H(1) receptor mRNA expression, histamine H(2) receptor protein amount and binding densities, and histamine H(3) receptor mRNA expression and binding densities in brain regions that have been suggested to be selectively vulnerable to transient global ischemia, i.e. hippocampus, thalamus, caudate-putamen, and cerebral cortex. We found an increase in H(1) receptor mRNA expression in the caudate-putamen: given that ischemia reduces glucose uptake and H(1) receptor activation has been shown to decrease this effect, an increase of expression levels may result in mitigating tissue damage due to energy failure observed in ischemia. A decrease in H(2) receptor binding densities in the caudate-putamen was also observed; the ischemia-induced decrease in H(2) receptor protein was also detectable by Western blot analysis. This phenomenon may underlie the previously reported ischemia induced striatal dopamine release. H(3) receptor mRNA expression was increased in the caudate putamen of the postischemic brain but was decreased in the globus pallidus and the thalamus; in association with this, H(3) receptor binding densities were increased in the cortex, caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, and hippocampus. The upregulation of H(3) receptor ligand binding may be involved in the previously reported continuous neuronal histamine release. Our data suggest that central histamine receptor expression and ligand binding are altered in brain ischemia in distinct areas, and may participate in neuroprotection and/or ischemia-associated neuronal damage.
