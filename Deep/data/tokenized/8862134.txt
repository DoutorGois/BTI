The distribution of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) mRNA in the adult rat brain was examined by in situ hybridization technique. The intense signals of LIFR mRNA were restricted to specific brain regions relevant to the motor and sensory systems. The moderate expression of LIFR mRNA was observed in several brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. Most of the signals of LIFR mRNA were detected on likely neuronal cells. These findings suggest the possibility that LIF has potential actions on the neuronal cells in the central nervous system of the adult rat.
