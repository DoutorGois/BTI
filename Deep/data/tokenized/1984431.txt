This study extends the unexpected finding of Sloviter et al. (Science, 1989, 243: 535-538) that adrenalectomy (ADX) of young rats casues a loss of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. In particular, we determined how the vulnerability of dentate granule neurons to the cytocidal effect of ADX is related to the completeness of the ADX and whether sulfated glycoprotein-2, a putative component of programmed cell death, is associated with the death of granule neurons after ADX. We report that 4 months after bilateral ADX of young (150-175 g) rats only ADX rats that had attenuated weight gain and less than 2 ng/ml of serum corticosterone lost granule neurons; whereas as little as 15 ng/ml of serum corticosterone was sufficient to protect granule neurons from cell death. In addition, by immunocytochemistry, SGP-2 was distributed as punctate deposits throughout the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in glial cells juxtaposed to surviving neurons in the dentate of ADX rats with a granule cell loss. However, immunoreactivity for SGP-2 was not found in granule neurons that exhibited morphological signs of cellular generation after ADX.
