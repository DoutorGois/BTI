AIM: To study the effect of argipressin (4-8) (AVP4-8) on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in astroglial culture and fetal neuronal culture from rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Some protein kinases involved in this signal pathway were also addressed. METHODS: Rat brain primary cells were cultured in serum free medium or starved for 24 h before use. Cells were transferred to Ca2+ and Mg2+ free Dulbeco's phosphate buffer (D-PBS) with various drugs. MAPK activity was measured. RESULTS: The main findings were: (1) AVP4-8 induced the MAPK activity in rat brain astroglial culture but not in fetal neuronal cultures. And this was blocked by ZDC (C) PR, an antagonist of AVP4-8. (2) PD98059, a potent selective inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and GF109203X, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) abolished AVP4-8-evoked MAPK activity on astrocytes. CONCLUSION: AVP4-8 can activate the MAPK activity in astrocytes but not in fetal neuronal culture. MEK and PKC may be involved in the AVP4-8-evoked cascade.
