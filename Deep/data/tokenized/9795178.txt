Levels of PLCgamma, a phospholipase C (PLC) isozyme, were significantly increased in the cytosol in the injured left cortex (LC) at 5, 30 and 120 min after brain injury. In the same site, although levels of membrane PLCgamma did not alter at 5 and 30 min, they were found to be decreased at 2 h after brain injury. In general, the levels of both cytosolic and membrane PLCgamma were unaltered in the contralateral right cortex (RC), ipsilateral left hippocampus (LH) and contralateral right hippocampus (RH) between 5 and 120 min after brain injury. These results suggest that, in addition to well-proposed excitatory neurotransmitter-receptor systems, increased levels of PLCgamma may also contribute to alterations in PIP2 signal transduction pathway, particularly in the greatest injury site (LC) after lateral FP brain injury.
