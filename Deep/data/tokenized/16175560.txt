GLT1, the predominant glutamate transporter of the forebrain, exists in two splice variant isoforms, i.e., GLT1a and GLT1b. Although GLT1 was originally detected only in astrocytes, we have recently demonstrated that GLT1a protein is expressed by neurons in the hippocampus as well. In the present study, the mRNA distribution patterns for the two isoforms were examined throughout the rat brain by using nonisotopic in situ hybridization and variant-specific RNA probes. Both isoforms were expressed in neuronal subgroups outside the hippocampus, such as in the cerebral cortex layer VI, or the neurons in the olfactory tubercle. As was the case in the hippocampus, GLT1a was the predominant transcript in neurons in these regions as well. Both GLT1 isoforms were widely expressed in astrocytes throughout the brain. GLT1a mRNA expression in astrocytes showed noticeable variation in labeling intensity in subregions of the hippocampus and other areas, whereas GLT1b expression in astrocytes was relatively homogeneous. On the subcellular level, GLT1a mRNA was expressed primarily in astrocyte processes, whereas GLT1b mRNA was more restricted to the astrocyte cell body. The two isoforms showed similar distributions in the subfornical organ and in tanycytes of the third ventricle. However, GLT1 expression in the pineal gland and the retina was due primarily to GLT1b, whereas GLT1a was more strongly expressed in Bergman glia in the cerebellum. These findings suggest that the expression of the two GLT1 isoforms is regulated by different mechanisms. Moreover, the function of the two isoforms may be subject to different regulatory processes.
