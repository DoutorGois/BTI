Berberine is one kind of isoquinoline alkaloid with anti-apoptotic effects on the neurons suffering ischemia. To address the explanation for these activities, the berberine-induced cell cycle arrest during neurons suffering ischemia/reperfusion had been studied in the present study. According to the in vitro neurons with oxygen-glucose deprivation and in vivo ICR mice with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, it was found that berberine could protect the mRNA of retinoblastoma (Rb) from degradation through its function on the poly(A) tail. The prolonged half-life of retinoblastoma 1 (gene of Rb, RB1) mRNA level secures the protein level of retinoblastoma, which facilitates cell cycle arrest of neurons in the process of ischemia/reperfusion and subsequently avoids cells entering in the apoptotic process. The poly(A) tail of RB1 mRNA, as a newly identified target of berberine, could help people focus on the interaction between berberine and mRNA to further understand the biological activities and functions of berberine.
