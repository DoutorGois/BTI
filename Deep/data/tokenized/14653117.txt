OBJECTIVE: To observe the number and morphological changes of cholinergic neurofibers in rats under the destruction of kainic acid, and to investigate the protective effect and the mechanism of polygonum multiflorum thunb (PMT) on acetyl-chorine esterase (AChE) neurofibers. METHODS: Excitative neurotoxin kainic acid was injected into the basal forebrain, Meynert neucleus, medial septal neucleus and the Broca neucleus to establish the destruction model. Then the destructive experimental group was fed with PMT, and the histochemical method was used to display the changes of AChE fibers, the protection and activation of PMT. RESULTS: The number of projecting AChE fibers to the cortex and the hippocampus in PMT group was larger than that in the control group, and no morphological destruction was seen in the experimental group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: PMT has a protective effect on AchE projecting fibers in rats.
