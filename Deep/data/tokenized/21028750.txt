Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia with gradual memory loss and progressive decline in mental functions (1, 2). It is characterized pathologically by neuronal loss, extracellular senile plaques (aggregates of beta-amyloid peptides consisting of 40-42 amino acids), and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (filaments of microtubule-binding hyperphosphorylated protein tau) in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and associative regions of the cortex (3, 4). beta-Amyloid peptides and the tau protein are implicated as the main causes of neuronal degeneration and cell death (5, 6). Early diagnosis of AD is important for treatment consideration and disease management (7). Various beta-amyloid imaging agents have been developed for magnetic resonance imaging, single-photon emission computed tomography, and positron emission tomography (PET) (8-13). The binding of different derivatives of Congo red, thioflavin, stibene, and aminonaphthalene has been studied in human postmortem brain tissue and in transgenic mice. Of these analogs, 2-(1-(6-[(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl)ethylidene)malono nitrile ([(18)F]FDDNP) was studied in humans and showed more binding in the brains of patients with AD than in those of healthy people (14). However, [(18)F]FDDNP showed low signal/noise ratios for PET imaging because it is highly lipophilic. N-Methyl-[(11)C]-2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiasole, a beta-amyloid binding compound based on a series of neutral thioflavin-T derivatives (15), was radiolabeled with the positron-emitting radionuclide (11)C ([(11)C]6-OH-BTA-1 or [(11)C]PIB). [(11)C]6-OH-BTA-1 was found to be a promising imaging agent for the senile plaques in the brain (16). Ono et al. (17) reported the development of a series of fluorinated polyethylene glycol chalcones for PET imaging of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. One of them, (E)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-1-(4-(2-(([(18)F]fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)pheny l)-2-propen-1-one ([(18)F]7c), has been evaluated as a useful probe for detection of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain.
