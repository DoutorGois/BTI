The amygdala (AMYG) stimulation caused a marked decrease in the circulating level of insulin coincident with a considerable rise in the glucose level in rabbits. The stimulation of dorsal hippocampus (DHPC), on the other hand, greatly increased the insulin level and decreased the glucose level. The results suggested that the reciprocal influence of AMYG and DHPC on plasma levels of insulin and glucose played some roles in the regulation of insulin release and the homeostasis glucose metabolism in rabbits.
