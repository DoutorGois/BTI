Retinoic acid (RA) is essential for cellular growth and differentiation in developing and adult animals. The central nervous system (CNS) suffers developmental defects if embryonic levels of RA are too high or too low. The production and function of RA in adult brain are unclear. We report that RA is present throughout the brain and spinal cord of adult, vitamin A-deficient (VAD) rats treated with a physiological amount of all-trans-retinol. The hippocampus/cortex contained the highest proportion of RA in the brain (27.2 +/- 2.9% of the organic phase radioactivity, and 23.5 +/- 0.8% of the organic phase radioactivity extracted from spinal cord was RA). RA comprises a higher proportion of the retinoid pool in the CNS compared with amounts reported in other target tissues (E Werner and HF DeLuca. Arch Biochem Biophys 393: 262-270, 2001). However, RA is not preferentially transported from the blood to the brain. There were 2.90 +/- 0.20 fmol RA/g tissue transported to the brain of VAD rats treated with 2.00 nmol [20-(3)H]all-trans-retinoic acid, but higher amounts of RA were delivered to the liver, testis, and spleen. Because RA is not transported preferentially to brain, this tissue likely synthesizes RA more efficiently than other target tissues.
