Working memory for order information is mediated by different cognitive mechanisms that rely on different neural circuits. Here we discuss evidence that order memory involves mechanisms that range from general supervisory processes to process that maintenance fine-grained temporal position information. We suggest that neural regions-including the prefrontal cortex, motor cortex, parietal cortex and medial temporal structures-operate at different levels and processing stages to give rise to working memory for order information.
