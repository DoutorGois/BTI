Acute administration of an opiate has been suggested to result in the development of supersensitive dopamine receptors. This hypothesis was tested in mice by determining the effect of a single administration of morphine or levorphanol on dopamine agonist-induced stereotypic behaviors and [3H]spiroperidol binding. Administration of morphine (1.0 mg/kg s.c.), which itself had no significant effect on spontaneous locomotor activity 3 h following administration, significantly potentiated locomotor activity induced by 1.5 or 4.5 mg/kg of apomorphine (i.p.) administered 3 h later. Morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) or levorphanol (0.2 and 2.0 mg/kg, s.c.), but not dextrorphan (up to 20 mg/kg, s.c.), enhanced climbing behavior induced by apomorphine (i.p.) or (-)-N-n-propylnorapomorphine (i.p.; NPA) administered 3 h later. An increase in whole brain and striatal [3H]spiroperidol binding sites was found 3 h after administration of 10 mg/kg of morphine. Concurrent administration of 5 mEq/kg of LiCl (i.p.) or 5 mg/kg of naloxone (i.p.; administered twice) attenuated both the potentiation of the climbing behavior induced by the two dopamine agonists and the increase in [3H]spiroperidol binding sites. These results suggest that a single administration of an opiate can induce the development of supersensitive dopamine receptors that is mediated by an interaction at opioid receptors.
