The present study investigated the effects of luteolin on Abeta (1-40)-induced impairment of Morris water maze (MWM) spatial performance, reference memory, and passive avoidance (PA) behavior in rats. Luteolin treatment was started 4 days before the initiation of behavioral testing (passive avoidance on treatment day of 4-5; MWM spatial performance memory testing on treatment day of 5-7 and MWM reference memory testing on treatment day of 7) and continued until the end of the study. We also measured the activity of Mn-SOD, copper/zinc (Cu/Zn)-SOD and glutathione (GSH) levels in rat cortex and hippocampus to understand the ameliorating effect of luteolin on Abeta (1-40) induced memory impairment. The present results showed that luteolin (5, 10 mg/kg) has a protective effect on Abeta (1-40)-induced memory dysfunction in spatial performance, reference memory, and inhibitory avoidance response impairment. Finally, luteolin also increases the level of Mn-SOD, (Cu/Zn)-SOD and glutathione (GSH) in the cortex and hippocampus to reduce the oxidative stress by Abeta (1-40). Taken together, the results in this study suggest that luteolin (5, 10 mg/kg) treatment improves the learning and memory in Abeta (1-40)-induced cognition deficit in rats. The ameliorating mechanisms of luteolin on Abeta (1-40)-induced amnesia may be related to activating the anti-oxidation system.
