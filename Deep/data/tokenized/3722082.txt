Ambulatory EGG and EEG recordings were recorded under a 14/10-h light-dark illumination schedule using rats. The rats consisted of two groups: a suprachiasmatic (Sch) lesioned group (n = 5) and a normal control group (n = 5). Bilateral Sch nuclei were lesioned electrically (DC, 2.5 mA, 30 s for each) using a pair of platinum electrodes 0.3 mm in diameter. After recovery from surgery, recordings of ECGs (leads I, II, and III) and EEGs from the cortex and the left dorsal hippocampus were continued for 6 days. Diurnal periodicity in bradyarrhythmia (sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block) and heart rate was analyzed by the least square fit of 24-h cosines. Significant diurnal rhythm was observed in control rats, whereas Sch-lesioned rats showed no significant diurnal rhythm. The integrity of the Sch nuclei, therefore, is necessary for the generation and/or the expression of diurnal periodicity in bradyarrhythmia in rats.
