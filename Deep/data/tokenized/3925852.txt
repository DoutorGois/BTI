In summary, the data presented here suggest that depleting ACh in the HPC has long term consequences on cognitive behavior. It is suggested that HPC cholinergic processes are an important neurobiological substrate of cognitive behavior. Finally, AF64A seems a useful tool for elucidating the cholinergic mechanisms underlying the modulation of behavior.
