This study examined the dose-dependent effects of acute ethanol on recurrent inhibitory mechanisms of hippocampal CA1 neurons in anesthetized rats. The effects of micropressure-ejected GABAergic compounds were studied on evoked field responses and recurrent inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons. None of the systemic doses of ethanol examined altered recurrent inhibition of CA1 neurons. In contrast, local application of both GABAa and GABAb compounds produced clear changes in evoked field responses and blocked recurrent inhibition. These results suggest that (a) recurrent inhibition in the CA1 region in vivo is resistant to the effects of ethanol, and (b) both GABAergic receptor subtypes modulate recurrent inhibition in the CA1 region in vivo.
