Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP EC 2.4.2.30) is a key enzyme in the DNA repair machinery, but its excessive stimulation during reperfusion after ischemia could play a critical role in cell death. Our previous study indicated that the PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) significantly protected neuronal cells against death after a short ischemic insult. In this study we investigated the effect of 3-AB on the ischemia-evoked alterations in intracellular organelles. Gerbils were submitted to 3 min of transient forebrain ischemia followed by reinstitution of recirculation for 1-7 days. Electron microscopy showed only the signs of necrotic cell death after ischemia-reperfusion. The examination of specimens revealed a pronounced protective effect of 3-AB on the swelling of astrocytes and neurons 1 day after the ischemic insult. 3-AB also decreased the swelling of pericytes, but it had no effect on the accumulation of osmiophilic inclusions and fibril formation in astrocytes. 3-AB decreased the ischemia-induced swelling of mitochondria. The protective effects of 3-AB on cellular ultrastructure were also observed 7 days after reperfusion. These findings indicate that the inhibition of PARP may have a protective effect on cell swelling and on the state of intracellular organelles after a short-term ischemic episode.
