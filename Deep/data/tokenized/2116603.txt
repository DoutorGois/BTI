We studied spectral components of human hippocampal EEG in relation to behavioral status in 19 patients with intractable complex partial seizures who had depth electrodes implanted into the anterior hippocampi as a part of their preoperative evaluations. Behavioral conditions included: eyes closed resting, eyes open resting, eyes open with a verbal task, and eyes open with a visuospatial task. Hippocampal EEG spectral power uniformly decreased during behavioral activation. EEG activation was quantitatively different among the 3 activated conditions, with the most prominent change occurring during the visuospatial task. The degree of EEG activation corresponded inversely with the site of epileptic focus during the verbal task. The results demonstrate the response of human hippocampal EEG to behavioral activation. The magnitude of EEG change may reflect the degree of functional activation of the given hippocampus.
