Gostatin, an inhibitor of aspartate aminotransferases isolated from Streptomyces sumanensis NK-23, was tested as an antagonist of acidic amino acid-mediated responses in the in vitro hippocampal slice and of acidic amino acid binding. Gostatin blocked responses to N-methyl-aspartate (AMPA) or L-glutamate. Gostatin also displaced N-methyl-D-aspartate-sensitive [3H]-L-glutamate binding (Ki = 22.0 microM) more potently than [3H]-kainate binding. Gostatin appears to be a relatively nonselective acidic amino acid antagonist in the mammalian central nervous system.
