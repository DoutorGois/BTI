RATIONALE: Although emerging number of data supports the role of glutamate receptors and the potential of their antagonists in anxiety disorders, the involvement of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptors in anxiety is less well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the anxiolytic potential of 2,3-benzodiazepine (2,3BDZ) type AMPA receptor antagonists in various models of anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Whole-cell currents, hippocampal field potentials, elevated plus maze (EPM), meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP)-induced anxiety model, Vogel test in rats and light-dark test (LD) in mice were used to determine AMPA/kainite receptor properties and anxiolytic-like activity of a series of 2,3BDZ-type compounds. RESULTS: The reference compound GYKI 52466 was proved active in two anxiety models in non-sedative doses: minimal effective dose (MED) was especially low in EPM (0.01 mg/kg) GYKI 53405 and GYKI 53655 showed anxiolytic-like activity in two tests (EPM and mCPP). EGIS-8332 was active in EPM and LD while EGIS-9637 showed anxiolytic-like potency in EPM, mCPP and Vogel model. EGIS-10608 was the most effective compound among 2,3BDZs tested in EPM and Vogel models (MEDs are 0.01 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively). 2,3BDZs were active in anxiety models at doses lower than those produced sedative effects. NBQX showed anxiolytic-like activity in EPM only (3 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonists can profoundly block anxiety-like behavior in rodents independently from their motor depressant activity. However, the sedative properties at higher doses might limit their therapeutic utility as new anxiolytic drugs.
