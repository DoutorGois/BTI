Cipazoxapine is a new tetracyclic dopamine antagonist which we tested to validate an animal model for neuroleptics. This model was based on drug affinity to dopamine receptors in hippocampus versus striatum. For haloperidol the ratio was 0.67, for cipazoxapine 0.06. In this preliminary trial on eight schizophrenic patients we found that cipazoxapine in doses between 0.40 and 2 mg had an antipsychotic effect (measured by the BPRS) without extrapyramidal side-effects (measured by the Simpson-Angus-Scale). Our preliminary results thus support the animal findings.
