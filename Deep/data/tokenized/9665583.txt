The present study was designed to investigate the effects of infusions into reticular nucleus of thalamus (NRT) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of muscarinic M1 and M2 receptor subtype selective drugs on thalamocortically generated neocortical high voltage spindles (HVSs) in awake immobile rats. NRT administration of 2.0 and 20.0 microg McN-A-343, a muscarinic M1 agonist, and 20.0 microg methoctramine, a muscarinic M2 antagonist, suppressed HVSs. The results suggest that the blockade of presynaptic M2 receptors and activation of postsynaptic M1 receptors in the NRT suppress thalamocortical oscillations and increase neocortical electrical arousal.
