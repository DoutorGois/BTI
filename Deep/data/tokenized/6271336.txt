The effect of baclofen was investigated on mossy fiber, Schaffer collateral and perforant path synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices. Baclofen completely inhibits mossy fiber and Schaffer collateral synaptic transmission with an IC50 of 3.8 microM. The lateral perforant path is insensitive to baclofen, while the response in the medial zone was partially blocked. Baclofen does not appear to act in a GABA-like manner.
