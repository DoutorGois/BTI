We used quantitative L-[1-(14)C]leucine autoradiography to study the maturation of cerebral protein synthesis metabolism in kittens, starting at birth and through postnatal age (P) 180 days as well as in adult cats. We found that at birth most brain structures show protein synthesis (nmol/min/g; lCPS(leu)) rates already within the range of adult values (with some exceptions; e.g., the hippocampus and putamen). Likewise, most structures show a transient developmental peak during which the rates climb to levels higher than in adulthood. This peak often occurred at P60, but in some regions lasted from P30 to P90. Therefore, there is some regional heterogeneity in the maturation of brain protein synthesis. These results are compared with our previous findings on the maturation of cerebral glucose utilization and oxidative metabolism. We discuss the meaning of these maturational profiles in terms of time course of morphological development and of maturation of behavior in the cat. Correlations with findings in other mammalian species are also discussed.
