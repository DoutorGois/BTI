Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to detect fluoride-induced alterations in the proteome of the rat hippocampus. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=30) were subjected to treatments three weeks after weaning. Animals of the first group were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with aqueous NaF (20 mg/kg/body weight/day), the second group, injected with physiological saline, served as the control. After 30 days, the body weight of the fluoride-treated rats was lower than that of the control, and F- levels in serum were higher than in the control. The hippocampus was subjected to proteomic analysis, and the fluoride-treated group was found to contain 19 up-regulated and eight down-regulated proteins. The proteins, identified by mass-spectroscopic analysis of their fragments obtained after digestion, were found to be involved in amino acid biosynthesis, the insulin signaling pathway and various other crucial functions. Our results also provide useful information on the mechanism of the reduction of the learning ability and memory induced by F.
