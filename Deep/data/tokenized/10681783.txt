Using immunohistochemical technique, the distribution of immunoreactive products of antiubiquitin and MAP30 in the neurons of hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain were studied. Nurofibrillary tangles (NFT), dystrophic neurites in plaques and neuropil threads were labeled by the antibody of ubiquitin. NFT and pretangle neurons (PTN) were stained by the antibody of MAP30, but not detectable signal in axons or distal dendrites. The neurons immunostained with antibodies to ubiquitin and MAP30 were found in all the areas of CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4 of hippocampus of AD. These neurons labeled by 2 antibodies used in this study were distributed more in the CA1 and CA2 than those in CA3 and CA4. The results indicate that ubiquitin is seen associated when NFT is already formed, and MAP30 may be a novel antigenic component of NFT in Alzheimer's disease.
