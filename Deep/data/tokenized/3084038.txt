After 21 days of twice daily i.p. injections of bupropion (10 mg/kg), B.W.306U (10 mg/kg) or saline, 5 rat brain regions were removed for [3H]flunitrazepam binding assay. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed no change in the Bmax in any brain regions in drug-treated rats compared to controls. There was, however, a significant change in the Kd value in the limbic forebrain of B.W.306U-treated rats.
