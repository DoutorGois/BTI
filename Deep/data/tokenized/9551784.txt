Status epilepticus is a neurological emergency associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Experimental and clinical investigations suggest that prolonged seizure activity is associated with injury to vulnerable neurons. Compounds with neuroprotective properties may minimize such injury. Existing methods of inducing experimental status epilepticus result in seizure activity of variable duration and neuronal injury of variable degree. To minimize such variability, status epilepticus may be stopped with anticonvulsants, but this limits the ability to screen for independent neuroprotective properties. We have developed a simple and reliable non-pharmacological model of limbic status epilepticus in which the duration of status epilepticus is under direct experimental control. Status epilepticus is induced by continuous, unilateral hippocampal stimulation. Using this model, the degree of hippocampal pyramidal cell injury varies in direct proportion to status epilepticus duration across a range of 15-140 min. A progressive sequence of EEG changes unfolds with increasing status epilepticus duration, resembling that seen in other models. This model may serve as a reference against which the effects of potential neuroprotective compounds can be studied.
