D-Fen-induced hyperthermia has been shown to coincide with an enhanced depletion of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA). Because these observations have relied on D-Fen exposure at multiple environmental temperatures, some have questioned the validity of the findings. Therefore, this experiment was designed to determine if the correlation between elevated body temperature and 5-HT depletion could be observed when D-Fen exposure occurred in one warm environment (28 degrees C) and to determine if a hyperthermia-enhanced glial-cell response could be evoked by D-Fen exposure. Hyperthermia-enhanced 5-HT and 5-HIAA depletion resulting from D-Fen exposure was dependent on body temperature during drug exposure. In the frontal cortex, 5-HT concentrations ranged from 3 to 45% of control values. Likewise, in the striatum and hippocampus, 5-HT concentrations ranged from 13 to 53% and 6 to 40%, respectively. The 5-HIAA concentrations had a wider range than the 5-HT concentrations for each brain region. In the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus, 5-HIAA ranged from 0 to 93%, 15 to 72% and 0 to 83% of control, respectively. In spite of the substantial reductions in 5-HT, there was no detectable glial-cell response. D-Fen-induced hyperthermia does not appear to cause generalized damage to neurons in the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus.
