Classical theories on absence epilepsy suggest that spike-wave discharge (SWDs) represent thalamo-cortical oscillations, where an abnormally excitable cortex interacts with thalamus and brain stem reticular formation. The limbic system is generally not included in any theory about the pathogenesis of absence seizures. However, some data demonstrated that the alterations in the limbic system attribute to the expression of absence epileptic phenotype in genetic models of absence epilepsy. The present study investigated whether local intrahippocampal administration of progesterone (a GABA(A)-mimetic) and tiagabine (an inhibitor of GABA (re)uptake) might affect the occurrence of SWDs. Male WAG/Rij rats were implanted with permanent electroencephalograph (EEG) electrodes and bilateral cannulas in the CA1-CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus. Control rats had bilateral cannulas in the cortical area above the hippocampus. Rats received intracerebral injections of progesterone (5mg/ml), 45% beta-cyclodextrin (CD), saline, or tiagabine (2mg/ml). EEG recordings were made before and after injection. Progesterone, CD, and tiagabine administration to the hippocampus reduced SWDs for 60min following administration without behavioral or electroencephalographic side-effects. Both progesterone administration into the cortex and saline injection into the hippocampus yielded no changes in the occurrence of SWDs. These data suggest that activation of GABA-ergic transmission in the hippocampus has an inhibitory effect on cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits underlying the generation of SWDs and might be critically involved in the regulation of absence seizures.
