OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of Ca(2+) on the apoptosis induced by hyperthermia in neonate rat hippocampal neurons to provide the applicative evidence of dantrolene for preventing brain injuries. METHODS: Dantrolene, Ca(2+) specific blocking agent, was used in the hyperthermia-induced apoptosis of primary hippocampal neurons in vitro to observe its effect on the apoptosis, fluorescent intensity, and dynamic change of Ca(2+) by flowcytometry and laser confocal microscopy. RESULTS: The rate of apoptosis was decreased significantly after hyperthermia treatment by dantrolene sodium. The intracellular Ca(2+) fluorescent intensity in 42 degrees C treatment group (107.35 +/- 6.0) was significantly lower than that in control group (159.12 +/- 33.8). The concentration of Ca(2+) began to decrease 20 approximately 25 s after adding dantrolene sodium, and reached the lowest level about 50 s later, and then kept lower than the basal level. CONCLUSION: Dantrolene sodium has an important protective effect on hippocampal neurons apoptosis induced by hyperthermia and may have some applicative value of preventing heat-induced brain injury.
