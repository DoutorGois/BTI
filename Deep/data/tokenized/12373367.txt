Neurons and axon terminals containing neuron-specific nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were examined in the rat subiculum and CA1 area of Ammon's horn. In the subiculum, a large subpopulation of the pyramidal neurons and non-pyramidal cells are immunoreactive for nNOS, whereas in the neighbouring CA1 area of Ammon's horn only non-pyramidal neurons are labelled with the antibody against nNOS. In the pyramidal layer of the subiculum, nNOS-positive axon terminals form both asymmetric and symmetric synapses. In the adjacent CA1 area the nNOS-positive terminals that form symmetric synapses are found in all layers, whereas those terminals that form asymmetric synapses are only in strata radiatum and oriens, but not in stratum lacunosum-moleculare. In both the subiculum and CA1 area, labelled terminals make symmetric synapses only on dendritic shafts, whereas asymmetric synapses are exclusively on dendritic spines. Previous observations demonstrated that all nNOS-positive non-pyramidal cells are GABAergic local circuit neurons, which form exclusively symmetric synapses. We suggest that nNOS-immunoreactive pyramidal cells of the subiculum may innervate neighbouring subicular pyramidal cells and, to a smaller extent, pyramidal cells of the adjacent CA1 area, forming a backward projection between the subicular and hippocampal principal neurons.
