OBJECTIVE: To investigate if hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO) may induce structural changes of neurons in hippocampus from infantile rats and if the changes are reversible. METHODS: All 27 healthy SD infantile rats were exposed to HBO (0.25 MPa) or hyperbaric air (HBA) for 1 to 3 courses (10 days as 1 course). The hippocampus was taken at the end of each course to observe its morphology b y light microscope and electron microscope. RESULTS: HBO exposure induced capillary dilation, nuclear membr ane winding or blurring and some mitochondria swelling with its crista blurring i n neurons. The changes occurred after 1 course exposure and became significant w ith time. Most of the changes recovered 20 days after stopping exposure. No chan ge was found after HBA exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term HBO exposure can cause capillary dilati on and ultrastructural injury of neurons in hippocampus from infantile rats. The damage is not serious, but reversible.
