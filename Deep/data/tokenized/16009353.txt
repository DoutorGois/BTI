The influence of pulsed magnetic fields (PMF) on the release and uptake of glutamate was investigated. While the release was examined using hippocampal slices, synaptosomes were chosen to characterize the uptake process. (3)H-D-aspartate was used as a marker of glutamergic transmission. The pulsed magnetic fields (9-15 mT) applied according to the pattern which induced epileptic discharges in hippocampus amplified and attenuated the release and uptake of glutamate, respectively. However, the magnetic fields which induced an increase in neuronal excitability without concomitant seizures amplified both processes. These results confirm our previous reports and indicate that the glutamergic synapses are the target of magnetic fields action.
