Transduction of a viral vector expressing the GluR6 receptor subunit (HSVGluR6) to cultured hippocampal slices resulted in loss of CA3 and hilar neurons. Synaptic activity was required for this neuronal loss. This study investigates which synaptic connections were needed. Slice cultures responded heterogenously to HSVGluR6; cultures originating from the septal hippocampus showed greater neuronal loss than temporal cultures. Septal cultures also exhibited mossy fiber sprouting suggesting that activation of mossy fiber synapses contributed to neuronal loss. This was tested by transection of fiber tracts between the dentate gyrus and CA3 stratum pyramidale. Neuronal loss was blocked in transected cultures even though HSVGluR6-induced epileptiform activity was unaltered. These data suggest a role for mossy fiber activation in selective neuronal loss.
