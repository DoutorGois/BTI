Changes in the astrocytic cytoskeleton were examined in amygdala kindled rats using immunocytochemical techniques. One week following kindling, there was a dramatic increase in immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin in astrocytes throughout amygdala, pyriform cortex and hippocampus bilaterally. Since these changes occurred in anatomical sites involved in the propagation of kindled seizures, the observed cytoskeletal reorganization in astrocytes may signify important functional alterations in the kindled brain.
