Microinjection of kainic acid into the CA3 subfield of hippocampus in anesthetized rats elicited seizure-like hippocampal EEG activity that persisted for more than 180 minutes. There was a concomitant rise in plasma prolactin level that peaked at 15 to 20 minutes but endured less than 60 minutes. We conclude that plasma prolactin exhibited only transient elevations during experimental temporal lobe status epilepticus in rats.
