The effects of adrenalectomy and corticosterone supplementation on the neurotoxicity of trimethyltin (TMT) were tested. CD-1 mice with or without adrenalectomy were injected with TMT at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg body wt. At 48 h post-TMT administration, the animals were killed for pathological examination. It was found that the adrenalectomized animals developed even more severe lesions in the hippocampal formation (fascia dentata granule cells) than the intact animals. When animals were given a supplement of corticosterone pellets at doses of 0.15, 1.5, and 7.5 mg, there was a reduction of lesion development. Total alleviation of pathology was seen at the two higher doses of supplementation. Our present investigation strongly indicates that there may be a close and important interrelationship between TMT-induced neurotoxicity and adrenal function.
