To characterize further the roles of norepinephrine (NE) and cyclic nucleotides in seizure mechanisms, an examination was made of the effects of several drugs purported to depress noradrenergic influence in the CNS on pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure activity and regulation of cyclic AMP levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in mice. Depletion of brain stores of NE with reserpine or treatment of neonatal mice with 6-hydroxy-dopamine decreased seizure latency and/or threshold and diminished seizure-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP in brain. Propranolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and yohimbine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, had effects qualitatively similar to reserpine and 6-hydroxy-dopamine, but phentolamine, a mixed alpha-adrenergic antagonist, increased seizure threshold and latency and did not reduce the accumulation of cyclic AMP. None of the drugs tested had any consistent effect on the regulation of cyclic GMP levels in brain during seizures. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that cyclic AMP in brain may be mediating an inhibitory influence of NE on seizure activity.
