The dynamics of hypokinesia in male C57Bl/6 mice induced by single administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine was studied on the model of parkinsonian syndrome. The neurochemical effect of this neurotoxin was evaluated at the peak of locomotor disorders. Severe hypokinesia was accompanied by an increase in serotonin content and decrease in the rate of serotonin biodegradation in the striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex. The content of dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and dopamine turnover decreased in the striatum, but increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Norepinephrine content decreased in the hypothalamus and cortex. Aspartate content decreased in the hypothalamus and hippocampus.
