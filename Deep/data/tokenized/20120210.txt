AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the correlations among hippocampal damage, spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), and mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model. METHODS: Chronic epileptic model was established by administration of PTZ. Behaviour and EEG seizure activity were recorded. Rats' hippocampus were analyzed with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain for histological lesions and evaluated for MFS with Timm stain. RESULTS: Prominent MFS was observed in area CA3 rather than the inner molecular layer in PTZ treated rats and the degree of MFS progressed with the development of behavioral kindled seizures. MFS preceded the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. No obvious neuronal necrosis and loss were observed in different regions of the hippocampus during kindling progression. CONCLUSION: MFS is not the outcome of SRS. Severe hippocampal damage is not required in the development of MFS and SRS.
