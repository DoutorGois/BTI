Bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BoHV-5) is the causative agent of herpetic meningoencephalitis in cattle. The purinergic system is described as a modulator of the immune response and neuroinflammation. These functions are related to the extracellular nucleotides concentration. NTPDase and 5'-nucleotidase are enzymes responsible for controlling the extracellular concentration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine monophosphate (AMP), and adenosine (ADO). The aim of this study is to determinate the ectonucleotidase activity in cortical synaptosomes and synaptosomes from the hippocampus of rabbits experimentally infected with BoHV-5. Rabbits were divided into four groups, two control groups (non-inoculated animals), and two infected groups (inoculated with BoHV-5). The infected groups received 0.5 ml of BoHV-5 suspension with 10(7.5)TCID50 of viral strain SV-507/99, per paranasal sinuses, and the control groups received 0.5 ml of minimum essential media per paranasal sinuses. Animals were submitted to euthanasia on days 7 and 12 post-inoculation (p.i.); cerebral cortex and hippocampus were collected for the synaptosomes isolation and posterior determination of the ectonucleotidase activities. The results showed a decrease (P < 0.05) in ectonucleotidase activity in synaptosomes from the cerebral cortex of infected rabbits, whereas an increased (P < 0.05) ectonucleotidase activity was observed in synaptosomes from the hippocampus. These differences may be related with the heterogeneous distribution of ectonucleotidases in the different brain regions and also with the viral infectivity. Therefore, it is possible to speculate that BoHV-5 replication results in changes in ectonucleotidase activity in the brain, which may contribute to the neurological signs commonly observed in this disease.
