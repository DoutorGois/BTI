The major pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease are beta amyloid deposits and cognitive impairment. Calycosin is a typical phytoestrogen derived from radix astragali that binds to estrogen receptors to produce estrogen-like effects. Radix astragali Calycosin has been shown to relieve cognitive impairment induced by diabetes mellitus, suggesting calycosin may improve the cognitive function of Alzheimer's disease patients. The protein kinase C pathway is upstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and exerts a neuroprotective effect by regulating Alzheimer's disease-related beta amyloid degradation. We hypothesized that calycosin improves the cognitive function of a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease by activating the protein kinase C pathway. Various doses of calycosin (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected into APP/PS1 transgenic mice that model Alzheimer's disease. Calycosin diminished hippocampal beta amyloid, Tau protein, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde levels in a dose-dependent manner, and increased acetylcholine and glutathione activities. The administration of a protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, abolished the neuroprotective effects of calycosin including improving cognitive ability, and anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. Our data demonstrated that calycosin mitigated oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease model mice by activating the protein kinase C pathway, and thereby improving cognitive function.
