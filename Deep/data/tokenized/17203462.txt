Latent inhibition (LI), that is the decrease in conditioned response induced by the repeated nonreinforced pre-exposures to the to-be-conditioned stimulus, is disrupted by entorhinal cortex (EC) lesions. The mechanism involved in this disruption is unknown, and in particular the experimental stage (pre-exposure or conditioning) at which the integrity of EC is necessary has to be determined. The purpose of this study was to address this issue by using reversible inactivation of the EC by local micro-infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX). TTX was infused either before the pre-exposure phase, before the conditioning phase, or before both phases. LI was unaffected in rats that received TTX before conditioning or before both pre-exposure and conditioning. In contrast, LI was disrupted in rats that received TTX before pre-exposure only. These results are discussed in the framework of LI models.
