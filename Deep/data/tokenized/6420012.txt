The physiological and pharmacological properties of septo-hippocampal neurons (identified through antidromic stimulation of the fimbria) were studied in the Rat under urethane anaesthesia. Half of these neurons (located in the medial septum and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca) displayed a rhythmic, bursting activity at about 4/s. A large majority of these neurons (bursting as well as non-bursting) could be excited through iontophoretic application of acetylcholine or carbachol.
