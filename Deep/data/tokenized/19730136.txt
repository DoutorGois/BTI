Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are ligand-gated cation channels that are highly expressed in nervous system. Little is known about the regulation of these channels. Therefore, we tested whether muscarinic M1 receptors can modulate ASICs. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine methiodide applied to the bath solution strongly inhibited the whole-cell current in Chinese hamster ovary cells heterologously expressing ASIC1a and M1 receptors. Maximal current was inhibited 30% during muscarinic receptor stimulation. These effects were fast, fully reversible and subunit specific. The acid-sensing current in population of isolated rat hippocampus CA1 and striatum interneurons, thought to be carried primarily by ASIC1a, was similarly inhibited by oxotremorine methiodide. Thus, the current study identifies ASIC1a as a novel target for muscarinic signaling.
