The effects of some steroid hormones (corticosterone, hydrocortisone, testosterone and estrone) on the Zn, Cu metabolism and metallothioneins levels in the mouse brain were studied. To administrate the hormones, aqueous suspensions and olive oil solutions injected subcutaneously were used alternatively. The quantification of metals and metallothioneins concentrations in brain homogenates revealed significant alterations of both metal ions and protein expression levels, yet the subcutaneous oil injection increased per se the tissue metallothionein expression and metal content. We have also defined by immunohistochemistry the area-specific distribution of metallothioneins isoforms-I/II and of glial fibrillar acid protein. Upon treatment, corpus callosum, mesencephalon, pons, hippocampus and cerebellum were found to be the areas that increase the protein expression levels, whereas all other brain areas were marginally affected or were unaffected in terms of immunopositive metallothionein reaction. The metallothionein-I/II expression was compared with the immunopositivity of glial fibrillar acid protein and the results are discussed within the framework of the physiological role of corticosteroids and the potential therapeutical importance of sexual hormones.
