We have previously reported an ectopic expression of neuropeptide-Y (NPY) immunoreactivity in mossy fibres (MFs) in the contralateral hippocampus following a unilateral intrahippocampal (IH) injection of kainic acid (KA). In the present study we report that, in addition to MF NPY expression, unilateral IH KA injections also induce tolerance towards a subsequent intracerebroventricular (ICV) contralateral KA injection, resulting in a reduction in the number of overt seizures and degree of cell loss.
