The administration of convulsant drugs has proven a powerful tool to study experimental epilepsy. We have already reported that the administration of convulsant 3-mercaptopropionic acid (mp) at 150 mg/kg enhances binding affinity of muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to certain rat CNS membranes during seizure and postseizure without affecting site number. Results obtained with a 100-mg/kg dose of mp have shown reversible increases in [3H]QNB binding to cerebellum and hippocampus, whereas a delayed response has been found in striatum. Neither a subconvulsant dose nor in vitro addition modifies binding. In order to evaluate preseizure, seizure as well as early (30 min) and late (24 h) postseizure stages, we employed a 50 mg/kg dose and tested [3H]QNB binding to CNS membranes. Changes in binding were as follows (in %): in cerebellum, +37, +86, and +40 at preseizure, seizure and early postseizure stages, respectively, but there was a decrease at late postseizure; in hippocampus, +27 at pre- and seizure stages, but a decrease at early and late postseizure. No changes were found in striatum or cerebral cortex membranes at any stage studied. Saturation curves analysed by Scatchard plots indicated that changes in [3H]QNB binding to cerebellar membranes are attributable to an increase in ligand affinity at seizure, followed by a decrease in binding site number at postseizure. A similar profile was observed for hippocampus except that the decrease in binding site number, though lower than at postseizure, was already evident at seizure stage. Results confirm a region-specific response to the convulsant and transient changes provide an example of neuronal plasticity.
