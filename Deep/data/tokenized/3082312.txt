As demonstrates the electron microscopical investigation, 6-hydroxidophamine possesses a wider sphere of influence than it was previously considered. It produces not only certain specific lesions in the hippocampal noradrenergic terminals, but also changes in non-catecholaminergic synapses; that is manifested as overfilling of the terminals with synaptic vesicles, lasting up to 24 h, and formation of vacuoles penetrating into invaginations of dendrites and astrocytes. The data obtained confirm the ideas of physiologists on modulating influence of the noradrenergic system on the noncatecholaminergic neural elements.
