Systemic administration of the glutamic acid analog kainic acid (KA) causes neuronal cell death in brain-vulnerable regions, such as the piriform cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala in rats. We investigated the relationship between the KA-induced neuronal apoptosis and expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and cyclin D1, key regulators of cell cycle progression. Expression of CDK4 and cyclin D1 was upregulated in neurons of the rat piriform cortex and amygdala 1-3 d after KA administration in vivo. CDK4 and cyclin D1 proteins were induced in the cytoplasm and nuclei of neurons, with a concomitant increase of CDK4- and cyclin D1-positive microglia in the affected areas. Continuous infusion of 100 microm CDK4 or cyclin D1 antisense oligonucleotides into the lateral ventricle using mini-osmotic pumps suppressed the excitotoxin-induced neuronal cell death in the piriform cortex and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, whereas sense oligonucleotides exhibited no such effect. Although KA administration causes prolonged c-Fos expression in the vulnerable regions that preceded the induction of neuronal apoptosis, the CDK4 or cyclin D1 antisense oligonucleotides exhibited no suppressive effect on c-Fos levels. Our results suggest that CDK4 and cyclin D1 are essential for KA-induced neuronal apoptosis in vivo.
