Host responses to immune challenges involve central neurotransmission, the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis, and the immune system. In the present work, we investigated the possibility of an asymmetry in the modification of brain monoamine metabolism induced by a systemic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adult female mice. We also studied the possible influence of behavioral lateralization, as assessed by a paw preference test, on the reactivity of the nervous, neuroendocrine, and immune systems to a LPS challenge. The results showed that LPS administration induced an enhanced brain activity as demonstrated by an increase in noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and dopaminergic metabolism. Increased serotonin metabolism, observed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, only occurred on the left side. Furthermore, the increase in serotonin turnover in the medial hypothalamus, the elevation of plasma adrenocorticotropin levels, and the decrease in T lymphocyte proliferation were observed in right-handed and ambidextrous mice but not in left-handed animals. Taken together, the results demonstrate that an immune challenge could induce neurochemical, neuroendocrine, and immune responses similar to those of stress, suggesting that LPS may be a stress inducer. Interestingly, these responses that may be asymmetrically expressed appear to depend on behavioral lateralization.
