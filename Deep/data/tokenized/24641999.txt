beta-amyloid (Abeta)-mediated neuronal apoptosis contributes to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether Dalesconol B (TL-2), a potent immunosuppressive agent with an unusual carbon skeleton, could inhibit Abeta-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Abeta(1-42) was injected to bilateral hippocampus of mice to make the AD models in vivo. TL-2 was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and attenuate memory deficits in the AD mice. TL-2 also inhibited Abeta(1-42)-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, TL-2 could activate the AKT/GSK-3beta pathway, and inhibition of AKT and activation of GSK-3beta partially eliminated the neuroprotective effects of TL-2. Furthermore, TL-2 induced the nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and enhanced its transcriptional activity through the AKT/GSK-3beta pathway to promote neuronal survival. These results suggest that TL-2 might be a potential drug for AD treatment.
