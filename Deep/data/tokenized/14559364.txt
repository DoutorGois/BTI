Ihara epileptic rat (IER) is an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with genetically programmed microdysgenesis in the hippocampal formation. The neuronal microdysgenesis is thought to be a cause for recurrent spontaneous seizures. To identify differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of IER in comparison to control Wistar rat, we performed serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). As many as 21 differentially expressed genes were identified.
