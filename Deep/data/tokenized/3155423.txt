The effect of organic Ca2+ channel blockers and Co2+ on kainate-induced changes in 45Ca2+ efflux and amino acid release was studied in the rabbit hippocampus with the dialysis-perfusion technique. Administration of 1 mM kainate caused a transient, 50% drop of extracellular Ca2+. This effect was insensitive to 100 microM flunarizine or verapamil, 10 microM nimodipine, and 6 mM CoCl2. The organic Ca2+ entry blockers did not significantly influence kainate-induced changes in extracellular amino acids, whereas Co2+ affected both basal and kainic acid stimulated release of amino acids. These results indicate that kainate-regulated Ca2+ ionophores differ from Ca2+ channels in peripheral tissues in terms of sensitivity to Ca2+ entry inhibitors.
