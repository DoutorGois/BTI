INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Interdisciplinary research made by neuropsychologist, neurologists and radiologists is making possible descriptions of the anatomic bases of memory. The hippocampus is one of the main structures related to memory processing. The aim of the present study was to study the relationship between verbal and visual memory, and the volumetry and relaxometry of the. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 36 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Fist, a neuropsychological assessment of was made the verbal and visual memory. Second, hippocampal structure were studied by magnetic resonance image (hippocampal volumetry and relaxometry). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Reactive gliosis measured by T2 relaxation time predicted poorer visual memory in patients with right or left MTS. These results indicate that structural damage in right hippocampus implies worse performance in visual memory. Moreover, MTS was found to have negative effects on contralateral memory (poorer verbal memory in right MTS, and poorer visual memory in left MTS). These results could be due to memory compensation. Thus, the memory function associated with the sclerotic hippocampus is adopted by the contralateral structure. Therefore, the more damage there is to the latter, the poorer is the memory functioning.
