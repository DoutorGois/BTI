Mammalian cells accumulate DNA lesions when they undergo phases of the cell cycle or during normal cellular activity. In this regard, several DNA repair signaling pathways have evolved to maintain genome stability and avoid the potential acquisition of mutations. To define and further characterize the expression of DNA double-strand breaks in humans and mice, we used immunocytochemistry to localize a DNA damage signal within the spatial confines of the cell nucleus. We show that DNA double-strand breaks are abundantly expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the human and mouse brain. Notably, DNA double-strand breaks are present in human hypothalamic and mouse striatal and hippocampal cells, with stable expression of the nuclear signal detected throughout the mammalian brain. Analysis of the mouse tongue, heart and testis shows that expression of DNA double-strand breaks is only demonstrated in circumscribed populations of peripheral cells. These data suggest that levels of DNA double-strand breaks are tissue-specific with the tongue, heart and testicular tissue having different thresholds of DNA repair and DNA damage from those outlined at the brain level.
