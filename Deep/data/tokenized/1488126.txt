Calretinin and calbindin-D28k are homologous calcium-binding proteins, each present in a variety of neurons in the brain. Their distributions in the rat brain have been compared at the cellular level to determine whether they tend to occur in the same or in different cells, and to determine whether calbindin-positive cells show any common features once crossreaction with calretinin has been eliminated. The results show great heterogeneity. Most cells which contain one of the proteins do not contain the other, but many cells do contain both; even in the ventral cochlear nucleus, where there is abundant calretinin and most calbindin-like immunoreactivity is due to crossreaction, a few cells contain both proteins. In the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, many cells are double-positive but some only contain one or the other protein. Only the triangular septal nucleus is uniformly positive for both proteins. Cells which look like local-circuit neurons in many forebrain areas (cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus) are exclusively positive for either calretinin or calbindin, in spite of their similar morphology. In the more heterogeneous parts of the brain (including hypothalamus central gray and substantia gelatinosa), there are mixtures of calretinin-positive, calbindin-positive, and double-positive cells. In comparison with previous data on the chick, some aspects of the distributions are conserved, but double-positive cells are more frequent in the rat. The degree of heterogeneity observed, even within comparatively well-defined neuronal populations, makes it difficult to infer in what neuronal properties these proteins could be involved.
