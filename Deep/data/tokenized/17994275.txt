In order to better understand the effects of repeated low-dose exposure to organophosphorus (OPs) on physiological and behavioural functions, we analysed the levels of endogenous monoamines (serotonin and dopamine) in different brain areas after repeated exposure of mice to sublethal dose of soman. Animals were injected once a day for 3 days with 0.12 LD50 of soman (47 microg/kg, i.p.). They did not show either severe signs of cholinergic toxicity or pathological changes in brain tissue. 24 h after the last injection of soman, inhibition of cholinesterase was similar in plasma and brain (32% and 37% of inhibition respectively). Afterwards, recovery of cholinesterase activity was faster in the plasma than in the brain. Dopamine levels were not significantly modified. On the other hand, we observed a significant modification of the serotoninergic system. An increase of the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was maintained for 2 and 4 weeks after exposure in the hippocampus and the striatum respectively. This study provides the first evidence of a modification of the 5-HT turnover in the hippocampus and the striatum after repeated low-dose intoxication with a nerve agent. Further experiments are necessary to evaluate the relationship between these modifications and the unexpected neuropsychological disorders usually reported after chronic exposure of organophosphorus.
