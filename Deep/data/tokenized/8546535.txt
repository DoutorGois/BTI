The effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A agonists, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and flesinoxan, on the delayed hyperactivity and on the ensuing neuronal degeneration induced by transient global cerebral ischaemia, were studied. In normothermic, male Mongolian gerbils, subjected to 3 min bilateral carotid artery ligation, the locomotor activity was measured 1 day after ischaemia. The neuronal damage was quantified 7 days later using an image analysis system. Buspirone (3 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and flesinoxan (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.), administered twice a day for 3 days both in pre- and post-ischaemic conditions, failed to significantly protect the CA1 zone of the hippocampus against neuronal damage. In contrast, 8-OH-DPat (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the neuronal degeneration. All compounds abolished the hyperactivity but there was no correlation between this parameter and the extent of the reduction in neuronal damage. The ineffectiveness of buspirone and flesinoxan was not the result of too low a dose - as evidenced by the complete inhibition of hyperactivity with both compounds and by the appearance of a serotonin behavior syndrome with flesinoxan - but is possibly related to a partial agonist activity at the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor, as reported for buspirone. Further studies are necessary to explain the differences between these agonists.
