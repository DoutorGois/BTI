A wealth of animal and human research has pointed to a significant involvement of the temporal lobes in memory processing, and yet the different functional roles of temporal cortical vs. mesial structures remain unclear. We studied verbal declarative memory, by using a word list paradigm that differentiates among learning (immediate recall), memory (delayed recall), and recognition, in epilepsy patients being considered for surgical resection of the left temporal lobe. Verbal memory was evaluated preoperatively and during the recording of intracranial event related potentials and postoperatively after selective hippocampectomy, temporal cortical lesionectomy, or anterior two-thirds en bloc temporal lobe resection procedures. Preoperative differences in verbal memory performance as a function of differences in underlying neuropathology, concurrent event-related potentials, and specific patterns of postoperative memory impairments lead to converging evidence that verbal declarative memory relies on a synergistic interaction of at least two functionally distinct brain systems. Material-specific data acquisition, or working memory, is mediated by neocortical temporal structures, whereas long-term consolidation/retrieval is particularly mediated by temporomesial structures. In contrast to the left temporal neocortex, the function of the temporomesial system appears to be material nonspecific. Apparently, its preferential involvement in verbal memory is due to its close interaction with overlying neocortical structures that are specialized for language processing.
