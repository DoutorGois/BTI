Specific [3H]MK-801 binding was measured under equilibrium conditions in 8 brain regions (frontal cortex, area entorhinalis, hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, thalamus, substantia nigra and nucleus dentatus) in the right hemisphere of the human brain (n = 4). In addition, binding was assessed in 3 of these regions (frontal cortex, area entorhinalis and putamen) in the left hemisphere. High [3H]MK-801 binding levels occurred in the area entorhinalis, frontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, medium levels were observed in the putamen and thalamus and low levels were found in the substantia nigra and nucleus dentatus. No evidence for laterality of [3H]MK-801 binding sites was observed in the 3 regions which were investigated on both sides of the brain.
