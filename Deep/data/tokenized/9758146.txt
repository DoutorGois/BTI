Expression of the voltage-dependent sodium channel has been analysed in adult rat central nervous system by Northern blotting and in situ hybridization. Northern blots showed that all the territories studied express beta 2 transcripts, albeit with widely varying levels (with cerebellum >> hippocampus > brain > brainstem > spinal cord). In situ hybridization confirmed that in these structures, all the neuronal cell bodies contain beta 2 mRNA; expression was particularly high in the granule cells of the cerebellum, in both pyramidal cell layer and dentate gyrus in the hippocampus, and in spinal cord motor neurons. Northern blots also showed that RNA extracted from optic nerve and cultured cortical astrocytes contained beta 2 mRNA, while it was totally absent from sciatic nerve. In situ hybridization evidenced the presence of a numerous population of beta 2-positive cells in cerebellum white matter, spinal cord white matter, and in corpus callosum, where frontal sections showed labelled cells arranged in the chain-like or row pattern typical of interfascicular oligodendrocytes. Combination of antiglial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunofluorescent histochemistry with detection of beta 2 mRNA evidenced that expression of the transcripts was indeed restricted to GFAP-negative cells in white matter.
