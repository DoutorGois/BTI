The promoter region of the alpha-subunit of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alpha-CaMKII) gene was inserted into a beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) reporter plasmid, and beta-gal activities were examined in neuroblastoma (NB2a) and pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells after transient or stable transfections. The alpha-CaMKII promoter was 12- to 45-fold more active in NB2a compared with PC12 cells after transient or stable transfections. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) stimulated reporter gene expression at both protein and mRNA levels in transfected PC12 cells. RA increased the level of endogenous alpha-CaMKII mRNA in untransfected PC12 cells by 4.4-fold. The transcription initiation site(s) (TIS) of the alpha-CaMKII gene in PC12 cells and rat brain was examined by RNase protection assays (RPA) and reverse transcriptase PCRs. The TIS for the alpha-CaMKII/beta-gal reporter gene in transfected PC12 cells was indistinguishable from the TIS+1 in rat hippocampus. In contrast, the only detectable TIS for the alpha-CaMKII gene in untransfected PC12 cells was located near the ATG translation start codon, 147 nucleotides 3' to TIS+1 in hippocampus. This unusual TIS was also the predominant TIS in rat cerebellum. These results suggest that the alpha-CaMKII promoter may contain sequences that respond directly or indirectly to RA. In addition, the unusual TIS of the alpha-CaMKII gene in PC12 cells and rat cerebellum may contribute to the very low expression of this gene compared with that in hippocampus.
