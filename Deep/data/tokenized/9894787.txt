Embryonic rat hippocampal neurons were cultured for 1-2 days in serum-free, HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution. The effects of cortical astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned saline on neuron survival, membrane surface area and the expression of functional amino acid neurotransmitter receptors were studied. Neurons grown in Tyrode's solution alone survived well for 1 day but deteriorated thereafter both in terms of percent neurons surviving and the amplitudes and densities of GABA-, glycine-, kainate-and NMDA-induced currents. Neurons grown in Tyrode's previously conditioned by astrocytes for 24 h had significantly larger apparent plasma membrane surface area, as indexed by whole-cell membrane capacitance, and larger amplitudes and densities of the amino acid-induced currents after both 1 and 2 days. The survival rate and neurite outgrowth were also greater in the astrocyte-conditioned saline group after 2 days in culture. Similarly, neurons cultured on glass cover-slips facing a confluent monolayer of astrocyte were larger in apparent plasma membrane area and amino acid-induced currents than neurons cultured in Tyrode's alone. Neurons cultured in saline conditioned by astrocytes provide a strategy to study the physiological basis of astrocyte-directed neuronal differentiation in the absence of ambiguities arising from the inclusion of sera and other additives often used in vitro.
