The contributions of two subclasses of excitatory amino acid transmitter receptors to the induction and expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) were analyzed in hippocampal slices. The quisqualate/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX (6,7-dinitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione) blocked 85% of the evoked field potential, leaving a small response that was sensitive to D-AP5 (D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker. This residual D-AP5-sensitive response was of comparable size in control and previously potentiated inputs. High-frequency stimulation in the presence of DNQX did not result in the development of robust LTP. Washout of the drug, however, revealed the potentiation effect. Thus NMDA-mediated responses can induce, but are not greatly affected by, LTP; non-NMDA receptors, conversely, mediate responses that are not needed to elicit LTP but that are required for its expression.
