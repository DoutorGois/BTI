In adult male rats, castration induces a progressive decrease in the number of [3H]imipramine binding sites in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, and a progressive increase in the hippocampus. Testosterone completely prevents this effect of castration, but has no effect on the characteristics of brain imipramine binding sites in intact, non-castrated animals. These data suggest that threshold levels of testosterone are necessary for the maintenance of a normal number of imipramine binding sites in the rat brain, but that these binding sites are not modified by excess testosterone.
