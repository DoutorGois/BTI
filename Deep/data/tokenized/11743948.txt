C3H and DBA/2 mice differ in their hippocampal inhibitory function, as measured by the inhibitory gating of pyramidal neuron response to repeated auditory stimulation. This functional difference appears to be related to differences in expression of the alpha7 nicotinic cholinergic receptor, which may be generally expressed by interneurons. This study examines the relationship between genetic variation in alpha7 receptor subunit expression and GABAergic interneuron distribution in various regions and layers of the hippocampus in the two mouse strains. Subpopulations of hippocampal interneurons in both mouse strains were found to bind [(125)I]alpha-bungarotoxin. However, the distribution of the [(125)I]alpha-bungarotoxin-positive hippocampal interneurons was significantly different between C3H and DBA/2 mice. In region CA1, and to a lesser extent in region CA3, DBA/2 mice had increased numbers of [(125)I]alpha-bungarotoxin-positive neurons in stratum lacunosum-moleculare and decreased numbers in stratum oriens. Similar differences in GABAergic neuron distribution were observed in region CA1 in the two strains. C3H/DBA/2 F1 animals were backcrossed to the C3H parental strain for six generations, with selection for either the DBA/2 or C3H allelic variant of the alpha7 receptor gene. The distribution of [(125)I]alpha-bungarotoxin labeling closely resembled the DBA/2 parental phenotype in animals retaining the DBA/2 allele of the alpha7 gene. These data suggest that the alpha7 receptor gene locus may influence the anatomical organization of at least a subset of hippocampal interneurons by an as yet unidentified mechanism. This difference in interneuron anatomy may also contribute to functional differences in inhibitory sensory gating between the two strains.
