Lipid composition and parameters of infrared (IR) spectrum of the tissues controlling heart activity (hypothalamus and hippocamp) were studied in rabbits with experimental hyperlipoproteinemia. Thin-layer chromatography discovered that in atherogenic dislipoproteinemia hypothalamic and hippocampal cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids and phospholipids occurred in higher quantities while the levels of phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylserines were subnormal. Altered parameters of IR-spectrum of hypothalamic and hippocampal tissue homogenates in atherogenesis were seen in the regions reflecting specific features of structural organization of water molecules. The analysis of the data allows the conclusion that disturbed structural transformation of water in the central nervous system in atherosclerosis is an important link of pathogenesis of electric heart unstability which may result in a sudden cardiac death.
