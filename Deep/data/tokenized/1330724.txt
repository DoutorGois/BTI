A 2-week neurotization of two rat lines formed a long-term stress and increased neuronal Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity in hippocampus, locus coeruleus and n. raphe dorsalis, whereas the glial enzyme activity was decreased in hippocampus and N. raphe dorsalis. (Line H). In rats with low threshold of excitability (line L), the decrease of the Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity occurred in n. raphe dorsalis and hippocampus. After a 15-day rest, the activity decreased in all the structures of the line rats, whereas in the line L rats the activity was still increased in hippocampal neurons. Differences between the rat lines and dependence of the enzyme activity on the functional state of the nervous system, are discussed.
