The clinical results of six cases of open stereotactic amygdalohippocampectomy for medically intractable epilepsy are presented. Outcome in terms of seizure control (highly satisfactory in five patients) and neuropsychological sequelae (all cases had poor functioning of the contralateral temporal lobe pre-operatively) are detailed. In addition the use of post-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is demonstrated and shown to be a valuable tool in providing the crucially accurate baseline that is required for more meaningful follow-up outcome studies.
