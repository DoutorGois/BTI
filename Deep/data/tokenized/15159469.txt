BACKGROUND: Recent MRI-based volume reconstruction studies in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS) suggested atrophy that extends to the adjacent neocortical areas. OBJECTIVE: To study the extent of temporal lobe volume (TLV) abnormalities in patients with pathologically confirmed HS (with or without cortical dysplasia [CD]) who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy for the treatment of drug-resistant TLE. METHODS: Fifty patients (right TLE: n = 24; left TLE: n = 26) were found to have HS (hippocampal cell loss of >30%). Associated neocortical CD was seen in 20 patients (43%). MRI-based TLVs and hippocampal and hemispheric volume reconstructions in all patients were compared between pathologic groups and with volumes acquired from 10 age-matched control subjects. RESULTS: TLVs ipsilateral to the epileptogenic zone in patients with TLE were smaller than TLVs in control subjects (p < 0.01). In patients with left TLE, TLVs ipsilateral to the epileptogenic zone were smaller than contralateral TLVs (left: 66.6 +/- 8.3 cm3, right: 74.9 +/- 10.0 cm3; p < 0.001). In patients with right TLE, there were no significant asymmetries. The contralateral TLVs (regardless of the side of surgery) were smaller in the HS + CD group than the HS group (HS + CD group: 74.9 +/- 8.6 cm3, HS group: 79.7 +/- 6.6 cm3; p < 0.05). Patients with HS + CD had a tendency to have less hippocampal atrophy and slightly smaller TLVs ipsilateral to the epileptogenic zone, accounting for significantly smaller TLV/hippocampal volume ratios compared with patients with HS alone. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-resistant TLE due to HS is associated with extrahippocampal temporal lobe atrophy. The presence of bilateral temporal lobe atrophy is suggestive of a more widespread (bilateral) temporal lobe involvement in patients with HS and CD.
