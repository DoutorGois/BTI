The book by Gluck and Myers (Gateway to memory: An introduction to neural network modelling of the hippocampus and learning, 2001) provides a clear and well organised description of a particular connectionist approach to modelling hippocampal function. We argue that such an approach may help conceptualise the function described, but does not have the power to explain the relations between the function and the neural structure that subserves it.
