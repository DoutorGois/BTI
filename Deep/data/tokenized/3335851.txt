The effect of bicuculline-induced convulsive seizures on lipid metabolism has been studied in four brain areas (cerebellum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem) using [2-3H]glycerol and [1,2-14C]ethanolamine as radioactive lipid precursors administered simultaneously with bicuculline. Twelve minutes after the administration, the uptake of radioactivity depended both on brain area and treatment, being generally higher in convulsing rats. The uptake of glycerol was influenced to a larger extent than that of ethanolamine and increased during convulsions, but its incorporation into lipids did not. In contrast, the amount of ethanolamine incorporated into lipids increased during bicuculline-induced seizures. The difference in behavior of glycerol and of ethanolamine is also indicated by the decrease of the 3H/14C ratio of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine in various brain areas during convulsions. It is, therefore, evident that the metabolism of the two precursors is affected differently by seizures.
