The channel activity of NMDA receptors is regulated by phosphorylation by protein kinases and by interaction with other proteins. Recombinant NR1/NR2A subtype NMDA receptor channels are potentiated by the protein tyrosine kinase Src, an effect which is mediated by a reduction in the high-affinity, voltage-independent Zn(2+) inhibition. However, it has been reported that Src-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor currents in hippocampus neurons is not mediated by a reduction in Zn(2+) inhibition. The post-synaptic density protein PSD-95 interacts with the C-terminus of NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor. Here we demonstrate that PSD-95 eliminates the Src-induced potentiation of NR1/NR2A channels expressed in oocytes and reduces the sensitivity of the channels to Zn(2+). Our results reveal that the absence of Src-induced potentiation of PSD-95-coupled NR1/NR2A channels is not to due to the reduced sensitivity of these channels to Zn(2+). These results indicate that PSD-95 functionally modulates NR1/NR2A channels and explain why Src-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor currents in hippocampus neurons is not mediated by a reduction in Zn(2+) inhibition.
