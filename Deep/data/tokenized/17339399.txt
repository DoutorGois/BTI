The chemokine SDF-1alpha and its cognate receptor CXCR4 are expressed in several neuronal populations. This review focuses on our current knowledge about the actions of this chemokine on neuronal excitability, through CXCR4 or other yet unknown pathways. In various neuronal populations (CA1 neurons of the hippocampus, granular and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, melanin-concentrating hormone neurons of the lateral hypothalamus, vasopressinergic neurons of the supraoptic and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra), SDF-1alpha can modulate the activity of neurons by multiple regulatory pathways including and often combining: (i) modulation of voltage-dependent channels (sodium, potassium, and calcium), (ii) activation of the G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium current, and (iii) increase in neurotransmitter release (gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and dopamine), often through Ca-dependent mechanisms. The possible mechanisms underlying these effects and their consequences in terms of modulation of neuroendocrine systems and physiopathology are discussed.
