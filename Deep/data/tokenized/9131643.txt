Rats were pretreated with 0.9% NaCl, or 0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg MK-801, an anticonvulsant and a psychotomimetic drug, and 60 minutes later given ECS or sham ECS. After six sessions the animals were sacrificed and neuropeptide Y (NPY-), neurokinin A (NKA-), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP-) like immunoreactivity (-LI) measured with radioimmunoassays. ECS increased NPY-LI in frontal cortex, striatum, occipital cortex and hippocampus, and NKA-LI in occipital cortex and hippocampus. MK-801 increased CGRP in a dose-response manner in frontal cortex, and NKA-LI in occipital cortex. Although the higher MK-801 dose reduced seizure duration by 50%, the ECS induced NPY-LI increase in striatum, occipital cortex and hippocampus, and NKA-LI in occipital cortex was not diminished. In contrast, there was a parallel decrease in seizures and NPY-LI and NKA-LI changes in frontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively. Investigation of neuropeptides in brain may contribute to understanding of the mechanisms of action of antidepressive and antipsychotic treatments and of psychotomimetic drugs.
