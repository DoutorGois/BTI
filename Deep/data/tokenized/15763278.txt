Early destruction of the ventral hippocampus from postnatal day 7 (P7) has been shown to induce behavioral alterations in post-pubertal rats, similar to those observed in models for schizophrenia. Using a single injection of tetanus toxin into the ventral hippocampus at P1, we tested the consequences of an early neonatal activity deprivation (<P7) on behavioral and neurochemical parameters of pre- and post-pubertal rats. We found no significant differences in either behavioral or biochemical pattern, indicating that an early neonate neural activity blockade does not induce behavioral alterations in pre- and post-puberty rats.
