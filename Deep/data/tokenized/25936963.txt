AIMS: We investigated whether trans-fat supplemented over two generations of rats could alter neuronal membranes and influence mania-like behaviors, as well as the effects of lithium (Li). MAIN METHODS: Two generations of female rats were supplemented with soybean oil (SO-C, rich in n-6 fatty acids - FA) or hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF, rich in trans-fatty acids - TFA). Male rats born from the 1st and 2nd generations were maintained in the same supplementation until adulthood, when they were exposed to an amphetamine (AMPH)-induced model of mania and co-treated with Li or not. KEY FINDINGS: AMPH increased locomotion of both generations and this influence was higher in the HVF than in the SO-C group. Conversely, AMPH increased long-term memory in SO-C group of the 2nd generation. HVF supplementation allowed hippocampal TFA incorporation in rats of both generations (0.1 and 0.2%, respectively). Oxidative parameters indicated higher levels of protein carbonyl (PC) in the HVF group with no changes in catalase (CAT) activity in the 1st generation. In the 2nd generation, AMPH increased PC levels of both experimental groups, whereas CAT activity was lower per se in the HVF group only. The co-treatment with Li leveled out all behavioral parameters, PC levels and CAT activity indicating a significant neuroprotective role. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that chronic HVF consumption allows a rising incorporation of TFA in the brain, which may be reflected on the neuropsychiatric conditions related to mania, whereas the effects of Li are not modified in the course of this harmful dietary habit.
