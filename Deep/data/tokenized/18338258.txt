The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of streptozotocin-induced type 1diabetes and a subchronic treatment with cyclohexanonic long-chain fatty alcohol, 3-(15-hydroxypentadecyl)-2,4,4-trimethyl-2-cyclohexen 1-one (tCFA15) on contents of amino acids including aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, GABA, glycine, taurine, alanine, serine, threonine, and arginine in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Levels of glutamate, threonine, taurine, alanine, arginine, and the ratio of glutamate/glutamine were altered region-differently in the brain of diabetic rats. However, tCFA15 region-specifically antagonized the changes in taurine and arginine levels and the ratio of glutamate/glutamine. The alteration in glutamate/glutamine ratio may indicate that experimental models of type 1 diabetes have abnormalities of neuron-gria interaction in brain.
