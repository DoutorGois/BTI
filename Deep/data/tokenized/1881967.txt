Moderate reduction of cerebral blood flow by bilateral clamping of carotid arteries (BCCA) in pentobarbital anaesthetized Wistar rats induces decreased PO2 and temperature values in vulnerable brain structures such as hippocampus and frontal cortex during the acute phase of clamping. Up to two weeks chronic increased GABA contents in hippocampus, substantia nigra and frontal cortex could be observed. During this time the development of hippocampal kindling was difficult. These results demonstrated an acute and chronic influence of GABA on most vulnerable brain structures which, however, do not lead to ischemic impacts as histological analyses demonstrate.
