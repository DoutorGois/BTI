A bilamination involving the whole dentate stratum granulosum associated with a hippocampal sclerosis is reported. This morphological abnormality could be an unusual aspect of granule cell dispersion, plastic change induced by an early post-natal injury, or the the result from a neuronal migration disorder during the embryonic period. Whatever its origin, this bilamination is an abnormality of the hippocampal development which continues during the first years of life.
