Mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage are early pathological features of the Alzheimer's disease-affected brain. Memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease is a manifestation of brain pathologies such as accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide and mitochondrial damage. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms and effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that decreased PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) expression is associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Restoring neuronal PINK1 function strikingly reduces amyloid-beta levels, amyloid-associated pathology, oxidative stress, as well as mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction. In contrast, PINK1-deficient mAPP mice augmented cerebral amyloid-beta accumulation, mitochondrial abnormalities, impairments in learning and memory, as well as synaptic plasticity at an earlier age than mAPP mice. Notably, gene therapy-mediated PINK1 overexpression promotes the clearance of damaged mitochondria by augmenting autophagy signalling via activation of autophagy receptors (OPTN and NDP52), thereby alleviating amyloid-beta-induced loss of synapses and cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease mice. Loss of PINK1 activity or blockade of PINK1-mediated signalling (OPTN or NDP52) fails to reverse amyloid-beta-induced detrimental effects. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism by which PINK1-dependent signalling promotes the rescue of amyloid pathology and amyloid-beta-mediated mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunctions in a manner requiring activation of autophagy receptor OPTN or NDP52. Thus, activation of PINK1 may represent a new therapeutic avenue for combating Alzheimer's disease.
