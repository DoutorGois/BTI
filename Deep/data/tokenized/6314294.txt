Electroencephalographic and behavioral effects of the following ACTH fragments: 1-4, 4-9, 4-11, 1-10, 4-10, 1-13, 1-17 and 1-24 were studied in rabbits. Sequences 4-9, 1-10 and 4-10 displayed some epileptic properties, i.e., they induced epileptic seizures (only electrographic or also behavioral) or increased hippocampal spiking. The 4-9 sequence seemed to be the common sequence responsible for these proconvulsant effects. The possible involvement of the enkephalinergic system is discussed.
