To study the effects of ketamine on ERK expression in hippocampal neural cell and the ability of learning behavior in minor rats. Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats of 21 days old were randomly divided into nine groups. The Y-maze was used to test the ability of learning and spatial localization. At the end of training, all rats were killed and the expression levels of ERK1, ERK2 and p-ERK1/2 were tested by immunohistochemistry. The learning times and total reaction time (TRT) of group K2a, K2b, K2c and K3 have significant differences compared with T group (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the level of ERK1, ERK2 and p-ERK1/2 in all rats which received light-electricity integrated training increased remarkably relative to the C group (P < 0.01). The expression levels of ERK1, ERK2 and p-ERK1/2 in hippocampal neural cell of group K2a, K2b and K3 significantly decreased when compared with T group (P < 0.05). Therefore, the results demonstrate that administration of over-anesthetic ketamine may impair learning ability of 21 days old rats within 24 h. ERK signal transduction pathway may be involved in the ability of learning and spatial localization. The inhibition of ERK signal transduction pathway may be one of the mechanisms of the impairment of learning and memory ability by ketamine.
