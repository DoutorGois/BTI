Kainic acid (KA) induces status epilepticus and delayed neurodegeneration of CA3 hippocampal neurons. Downregulation of glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) subunit mRNA [the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) subunit that limits Ca2+ permeability] is thought to a play role in this neurodegeneration, possibly by increased formation of Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptors. The present study examined early hippocampal decreases in GluR2 mRNA and protein following kainate-induced status epilepticus and correlated expression changes with the appearance of dead or dying cells by several histological procedures. At 12 h, in situ hybridization followed by emulsion dipping showed nonuniform decreases in GluR2 mRNA hybridization grains overlying morphologically healthy-appearing CA3 neurons. GluR1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor mRNAs were unchanged. At 12-16 h, when little argyrophilia or cells with some features of apoptosis were detected by silver impregnation or electron microscopy, single immunohistochemistry with GluR2 and GluR2/3 subunit-specific antibodies demonstrated a pattern of decreased GluR2 receptor protein within CA3 neurons that appeared to predict a pattern of damage, similar to the mRNA observations. Double immunolabeling showed that GluR2 immunofluorescence was depleted and that GluR1 immunofluorescence was sustained in clusters of the same CA3 neurons. Quantitation of Western blots showed increased GluR1:GluR2 ratios in CA3 but not in CA1 or dentate gyrus subfields. Findings indicate that the GluR1:GluR2 protein ratio is increased in a population of CA3 neurons prior to significant cell loss. Data are consistent with the "GluR2 hypothesis" that reduced expression of GluR2 subunits will increase formation of AMPA receptors permeable to Ca2+ and predict vulnerability to a particular subset of pyramidal neurons following status epilepticus.
