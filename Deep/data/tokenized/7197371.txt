Bilateral olfactory bulbectomy produced the increased tendency of mouse-killing behavior in nonkiller rats (60% on the 14th day after surgery). Scopolamine hydrobromide (4 and 8 mg/kg, IP) significantly suppressed the killing response in a dose-dependent manner, whereas methylscopolamine nitrate was ineffective. In order to investigate a possible neural mechanisms, choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and acetylcholinesterase (ACh-E) activities were measured in 7 discrete brain areas: cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, tegmentum, hippocampus, and pons plus medulla oblongata. Although the central anticholinergic drug suppressed mouse-killing, no significant difference in either CAT and ACh-E activities was found between the killer and nonkiller rats in any of the brain areas determined in this study. The evidence suggests that the neurochemical findings may not fit the pharmacological findings for supporting a unified cholinergic hypothesis for mouse-killing behavior.
