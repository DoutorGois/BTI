Following cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus by medial septal (MS) lesions, an unusual neuronal reorganization occurs in which peripheral sympathetic fibers, originating from the superior cervical ganglia, grow into the hippocampus (hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth; HSI). Previously, we have found that with MS lesions, animals with (the HSI(+) group) and without (HSI(-) group) ingrowth differed in carbachol stimulated PI hydrolysis, in PKC activity, and in muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR). In this study, performed in hippocampal slices obtained four weeks after MS lesions, we utilized the hydrophilic muscarinic antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) and hydrophobic muscarinic antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) in the presence of either 4-alpha-phorbol or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) to determine the effect of MS lesions with and without ingrowth on PKC-mediated mAChR internalization. In the presence of PDBu, a group effect was observed in [3H]NMS binding, with control groups > HSI(+) group > HSI(-) group. However, [3H]QNB binding was similar across groups. These results suggest that the cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus enhances the internalization of mAChRs, which is modified in the presence of HSI.
