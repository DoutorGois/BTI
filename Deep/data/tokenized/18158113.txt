The spontaneously epileptic rat (SER), a double mutant (zi/zi, tm/tm), exhibits both tonic convulsions and absence-like seizures from the age of 8 weeks. Since the first point mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) beta(1) subunit in human generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) was identified, more and more types of genetic epilepsy have been causally suggested to be related to gene changes in VGSC. However, there are no reports that can elucidate the effects of VGSC in SER. The present study was undertaken to detect sodium channel I alpha-isoform (Na(v)1.1), sodium channel III alpha-isoform (Na(v)1.3) and beta(1) subunit from both the level of mRNA and protein in SERs hippocampus compared with control Wistar rats. In this study, the mRNA expressions of Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.3 and beta(1) subunit in SERs hippocampus were significantly higher than those in control rats hippocampus by real-time RT-PCR; The protein distributions and expressions of Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.3 and beta(1) subunit in SERs hippocampus were detected by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and western blot, and the protein expressions of Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.3 and beta(1) subunit were significantly increased. In conclusion, our study suggested for the first time that sodium channel Na(v)1.1, Na(v)1.3 and beta(1) subunit up-regulation at the mRNA and protein levels of SER hippocampus might contribute to the generation of epileptiform activity and underlie the observed seizure phenotype in SER. The results of this study may be of value in revealing components of the molecular mechanisms of hippocampal excitation that are related to genetic epilepsy.
