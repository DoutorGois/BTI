A single 20 mg/kg dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) administered to rats markedly decreased serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum seven days following injection. MDMA also significantly decreased type II glucocorticoid receptor levels in the striatum, but not in hippocampus or frontal cortex. Since no difference in basal serum corticosterone levels was observed between the two groups, MDMA may decrease striatal type II glucocorticoid receptors via a corticosterone-independent mechanism.
