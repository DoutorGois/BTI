The neural tissue (the hippocamp and septal cerebral area) obtained from rat embryos is transplanted into the anterior eye chamber of mature animals. The developing grafts are sized and measured and light optic microscopy is performed 3-4 months after transplantation. Essential differences in development and organization of the septal cerebral area (SCAG) and the hippocampal (HG) grafts are revealed. The SCAG have a spherical form, a limited contact with the host iris and are vascularized by one--two ingrowing and branching vessels. The HG are elongated in their form, have contacts with the host iris by the wide plane parallel to their long axis and a great number of blood vessels growing into them. The size of the HG is much larger than that of the SCAG. The latter contain diffusely scattered multipolar neurons, while the HG neurons are organized as a layer with their apical dendrites oriented towards the iris.
