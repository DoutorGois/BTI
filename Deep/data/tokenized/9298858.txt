Functional changes in astrocytes are among the earliest cellular responses to a wide variety of insults to the central nervous system (CNS). Such responses significantly contribute to maintaining CNS homeostasis. In this context, by controlling energetic metabolism and overall excitability of the CNS, the modulation of glutamate uptake and catabolism in astrocytes is crucial. Here, we review specific modulations of the expression of glutamate catabolizing enzymes (glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase) in response to CNS insults (degeneration of serotonergic neurons or viral infection by a human retrovirus, HTLV-I). The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the control of the glutamate catabolism are discussed in relation to neurological disorders.
