Allylglycine increased the concentration of pyridoxal phosphate in cerebral cortex from 1011.4 +/- 25.0 to 1318.0 +/- 66.3 and decreased it in cerebellum from 1289.0 +/- 49 to 1147.7 +/- 119.4 ng/g wet tissue during the preictal period. Mercaptopropionic acid increased the concentration of pyridoxal phosphate in cerebellum from 1525 +/- 91 to 1985.7 +/- 275 ng/g wet tissue. Similar effects were noted in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Picrotoxin increased the concentration of pyridoxal phosphate in hippocampus from 938.7 +/- 44 to 1043 +/- 118 but decreased it in cerebral cortex from 1124.52 +/- 124 to 979.4 +/- 15 ng/g wet brain. The effects of strychnine were identical to those of allylglycine. Bicuculline reduced the concentration of pyridoxal phosphate in cerebral cortex from 1184 +/- 61 to 1075.14 +/- 78 ng/g wet brain.
