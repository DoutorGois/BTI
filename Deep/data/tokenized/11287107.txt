The Y(2) receptor is the predominant neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor subtype in the brain. Y(2) receptor mRNA is discretely distributed in the brain, including specific subregions of the hippocampus and the hypothalamus, and is largely consistent with the distribution of Y(2) receptor protein demonstrated by radioligand-binding methods. Y(2) receptor-mediated effects have been reported principally based on the observations using the C-terminal fragments of NPY. Recent studies indicate an involvement of the receptor in food intake, gastrointestinal motility, cardiovascular regulation, and neuronal excitability. Very recently, Y(2) receptor selective antagonist has been developed and Y(2) receptor-deficient animals have been created. These new pharmacological tools will help to clarify the roles of this receptor in brain functions.
