The effect of ether and sodium pentobarbital on the synaptic transmission of the hippocampal CA1 region was studied in chronically implanted rats. Animal behavior, EEG, and the average evoked potentials (AEPs) following electrical stimulation of the alveus or the stratum radiatum in the CA1 region were recorded. Components of the AEPs, interpreted previously as generated by population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), population inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) (Leung 1979a, b, c) or population postsynaptic spikes (Andersen et al. 1971), were differentially sensitive to ether or pentobarbital. Ether reduced the population EPSPs and population spike evoked at all intensities tested (1-4 X threshold); the population IPSP was slightly enhanced at intermediate stimulus intensities. Pentobarbital suppressed the population EPSP evoked by alvear stimulation but not that by radiatum stimulation, reduced the population spike and greatly enhanced and prolonged the population IPSP evoked at low stimulus intensities. At high stimulus intensities, the IPSP was interpreted to be smaller after pentobarbital but neuronal output from the hippocampal CA1 region, as seen from the evoked population spike, remained attenuated. It is concluded that ether and pentobarbital both suppress hippocampal neuronal excitability but the effect of anesthesia differs for different anesthetics, for different synapses and for different levels of activity in the input fibers.
