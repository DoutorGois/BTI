Monoamine and amino acid content were measured in brain regions from 12 week old male, homozygous Brattleboro (DI, n = 12) and Long-Evans control (LE, n = 12) rats. Norepinephrine (NE) content was significantly elevated (16-25%) in the spinal cord, pons-medulla and anterior hypothalamus of DI rats when compared to LE controls. NE content of the neurointermediate lobe of pituitary in DI rats was almost twice that of LE controls. Serotonin content was also significantly elevated in the spinal cord, pons-medulla, anterior hypothalamus and forebrain of DI rats relative to the LE controls. Taurine content in DI rats was increased (31-42%) above that of LE rats in the anterior hypothalamus, striatum and forebrain. Glutamine content was also greater in DI rats than LE in the spinal cord, pons-medulla, anterior hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and forebrain. The changes in monoamine and amino acid content were discussed in relation to the cardiovascular and osmoregulatory deficits that are present in DI rats due to arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency. The possible role of AVP in modulating NE turnover was also discussed. The increase in brain TAU content in DI rats may be a physiological response to hypernatremia.
