The effect of neuropeptide Y on spontaneous epileptiform discharges was studied in cortical and hippocampal slices using an extracellular recording. Epileptiform activity which was induced by superfusion of slices with Mg(2+)-free medium was attenuated by neuropeptide Y (0.5 microM) in both the frontal cortex and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells.
