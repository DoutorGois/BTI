Experimental manipulations suggest that in vivo administration of cholinergic agonists or inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) increases the concentration of acetylcholine. Biochemical studies have proposed a role for AChE in brain mechanisms responsible by development to status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine. The present study was aimed at investigating the changes in AChE activities in hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex of adult rats after pilocarpine-induced SE. The control group was treated with 0.9% saline (s.c., control group) and another group received pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, s.c.). Both groups were sacrificed 1 h after treatment. The results have shown that pilocarpine administration and resulting SE produced a significant decrease in the AChE activity in the hippocampus (63%), striatum (35%) and frontal cortex (27%) of adult rats. Our results demonstrated a direct evidence of a decrease in the activity of the AChE in rat brain regions during seizure activity that could be responsible by regulation of acetylcholine levels during the establishment of SE induced by pilocarpine.
