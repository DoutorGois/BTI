abtract The complete mitochondrial genome of the Hedgehog Seahorse (Hippocampus spinosissimus) is 16 530 bp in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and a control region. The gene organization of H. spinosissimus was similar to that observed in most vertebrate creatures. All protein-coding genes use the typical initiation codon ATG, except for COX1 that uses GTG. The overall base composition of H. spinosissimus is 32.2% for A, 22.72% for C, 30.19% for T, and 14.89% for G, with a slight AT bias of 62.39%. Hippocampus spinosissimus showed a closer genetic relationship with H. kelloggi according to the phylogenetic analysis.
