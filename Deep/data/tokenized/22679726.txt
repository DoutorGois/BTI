OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) combined with Compound Salviae Miltiorrhizae Tablet (CSMT) on the expressions of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hippocampus CA1 of chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI) rats. METHODS: Totally 50 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the normal control group, the model group, the CSMT group, the EA group, and the EA +CSMT groups, 10 in each group. The CCI model was prepared by permanent bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion. One week after modeling, CSMT at 0.75 g/kg was given to rats in the EA + CSMT group and the CSMT group by gastrogavage, once daily, for 5 successive weeks. EA at Baihui (DU20) and Dazhui (DU14) was performed to rats in the EA group and the EA + CSMT group, lasting for 30 min, once daily, for 5 successive weeks. The expressions of BDNF and VEGF in the hippocampus CA1 area were detected by immunohistochemical assay and image analysis. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the number of positively expressed BDNF and VEGF neurons and their expression intensity in the hippocampus CA1 of the model group obviously decreased (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the number of positively expressed BDNF and VEGF neurons and their expression intensity in the hippocampus CA1 of the CSMT group, the EA group, and the EA + CSMT groups obviously increased (P < 0.01, P < 0.05). The number of positively expressed BDNF and VEGF neurons and their expression intensity were obviously higher in the EA + CSMT group than those of the CSMT group and the EA group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: EA combined with CSMT could significantly increase the expressions of BDNF and VEGF in the hippocampus CA1 of CCl rats. Besides, their effects were significantly higher than those of the CSMT group or the EA group.
