Lesions of the medial septum were produced in 7 of 14 rabbits prior to classical conditioning of the nictitating membrane response. Lesions significantly altered the hippocampal electroencephalogram, attenuated conditioned hippocampal unit responses, and slowed the behavioral rate of acquisition. The contrast of the behavioral results with those of studies of massive septal or hippocampal ablation suggests a functional subdivision of the septo-hippocampal system in learning.
