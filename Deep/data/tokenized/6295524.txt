Specific binding of 3H-L-glutamate to synaptic membranes isolated from the cerebral cortex and hippocamp of Wistar and Krushinsky-Molodkina (KM) rats examined both in a quiet awake state and after audiogenic seizures was compared. The dissociation constant (KD) values and binding capacity (Bmax) for KM rats did not differ significantly from the corresponding parameters of binding determined for Wistar rats (KD--89.8 +/- 18.1 and 102.6 +/- 12.5 nm, Bmax--1.23 +/- +/- 0.08 and 1.30 +/- 0.15 pmol/mg for the cortex and hippocamp, respectively). After audiogenic seizures the binding capacity of the hippocamp of KM rats was reduced by 30%. It is suggested that hippocampal glutamate receptors of KM rats are involved in the mechanism of convulsive activity formation.
