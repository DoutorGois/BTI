We have studied alterations in the properties of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices of juvenile rats induced by the exposure of animals to different individual stressors usually used in batteries of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS), a widely used model of depression. Social isolation for 16 h did substantially affect neither the magnitude and nor the development of LTP. The effects of stroboscopic illumination and water deprivation appeared most severe, though opposite: the first stressor had activating effect, whereas the second one inhibited the development of LTP. In addition to the effects of these factors on the LTP magnitude, they also affected the patterns of LTP development. In this study weak tetanization with different probability of maintenance was used, and most of stressors, in spite of the similar LTP magnitude, influenced significantly on the process of consolidation. In hippocampal slices from rats maintained on wet bedding for 16 h, the time course but not magnitude of LTP significantly differed from that observed in the control or socially isolated rats. The weakest effect on LTP was observed in hippocampal slices of the rats exposed to food deprivation. In these animals, only some differences were observed in the development of LTP as compared to socially isolated rats. These data allow ranging stressors used in CUS paradigms according to the severity of their potential effects on neuronal function and animal behavior.
