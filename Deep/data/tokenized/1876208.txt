Structure of receptive fields of visually sensitive neurons in areas CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus was investigated in alert cats with the brain-stem pretrigeminal section. The receptive field (RF) structure of 76 hippocampal neurons was analyzed by methods of scanning the RF by moving stimuli and mapping all their surface by a stationary flashing spot. According to presented data the neurons were classified into three groups: neurons with homogeneous structure of the RF (54%), with nonhomogeneous (28%) and neurons more sensitive to stimulus motion (18%) than to a stationary flashing light. Experiments have shown that responses of hippocampal neurons are highly specific ones. Thus, 9% of neurons with the nonhomogeneous RF structure have shown specific responses to variation of the contrast and contours of moving stimuli. The presented results show that hippocampal visually driven neurons have well developed mechanism for processing visual sensory information and apparently this quality ensures participation of the limbic system in visually controlled behavior of the animal.
