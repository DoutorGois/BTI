Protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha and -betaII are expressed specifically and differentially in the septal formation. Following unilateral fimbria-fornix lesions, there was a marked reduction in punctiform PKC-alpha immunoreactivity in the lateral septum and in the number of PKC-betaII immunoreactive neurons in the medial septum and the lateral septum, while some PKC-alpha and PKC-betaII immunoreactive glia-like cells were observed in the lateral septum. The response of each PKC isozyme to this lesion supports the suggested role for PKC in the plasticity of the central nervous system.
