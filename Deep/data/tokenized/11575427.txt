Light microscopic observations of healthy adult rat brain sections stained with anionic iron colloid indicated that 5-10% of neurons in the hippocampal subiculum and all neurons in the medial cerebellar nucleus possessed an intensely positively charged perineuronal net. This net was demonstrated to react to oxine, and therefore suggested to consist of guanidino compounds. It was further shown that the intensely positively charged perineuronal net, in accordance with the intensely negatively charged perineuronal net of proteoglycans, was digested by chondroitinase ABC, hyaluronidase, and collagenase, but not by endo-alphaN-acetylgalactosaminidase. This finding suggested that the former positively charged net might be linked to the latter negatively charged one.
