We studied the induction of tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate-inducible sequences (TIS)1, 7, 8, 11, and 21 in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum after electroconvulsive shock (ECS). These genes were reported to be induced by depolarization in PC-12 cells. Single ECS induced TIS1, 8, 11, and 21, but not TIS7 genes in the rat brain regions examined. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus, induction of TIS1, TIS8, and TIS21 reached peak at 30 or 45 min after ECS. The induced mRNA of TIS1 and 21 decreased rapidly and returned almost to the basal level by 90 min after ECS, whereas those of TIS8 and 11 lasted longer. In cerebellum, TIS genes were induced and disappeared more rapidly than in the other two regions. The 10 and 20 daily ECSs did not affect the inducibility of TIS1, 11, and 21 in cerebellum, but the induction of TIS8 was attenuated by 35% after 20 daily ECSs. Our study indicated that ECS could induce some of the TIS genes in various rat brain regions, but the induction patterns were different depending on the TIS genes and brain regions. Our study also suggested that chronic ECS could not attenuate the induction of some immediate early genes.
