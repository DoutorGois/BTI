4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin) and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (4-HBA) are natural phenolic compounds, which present in many plants and have diverse biological properties. In this study, we examined effects of vanillin and 4-HBA on learning and memory function, cell proliferation, and neuroblast differentiation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in a mouse model of scopolamine-induced amnesia. Scopolamine (SCO; 1 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), vanillin, and 4-HBA (40 mg/kg/day, orally) were administered for 28 days. Treatment with scopolamine alone impaired learning and memory function in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests, in addition, the treatment significantly reduced cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus, which were examined by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 (a classic marker for cell proliferation) and doublecortin (a marker for neuroblasts). However, treatment with vanillin or 4-HBA significantly attenuated SCO-induced learning and memory impairment as well as the reduction of cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation in the dentate gyrus. These results indicate that vanillin and 4-HBA may be helpful in improving cognitive function and in increasing endogenous neuronal proliferation in the brain.
