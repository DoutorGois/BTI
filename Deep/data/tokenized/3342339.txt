A data acquisition program is described for the Apple II series of microcomputers that allows for continuous, direct monitoring of electrographic elements from cortical, hippocampal and muscle leads from rats. The program detects cortical delta waves and sigma activity, hippocampal theta activity and electromyographic activity. The detected elements are counted and stored in memory at 15 second intervals (bins). Every three hours, the data are transferred to disks for permanent storage and off-line analysis.
