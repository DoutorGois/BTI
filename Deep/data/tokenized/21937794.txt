OBJECTIVE: To explore the related neurobiochemical mechanism by comparing the concentration change of dopamine (DA), dihydroxy-phenyl acetic acid (DOPAC), glutamate (Glu), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain tissues in schizophrenia (SZ) developmental model rats and chronic medication model rats. METHODS: A total of 60 neonatal male Spragur-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups at the postnatal day 6: an SZ developmental rat model group (subcutaneous injection with MK-801 at the postnatal day 7-10, 0.1 mg/kg, Bid), a chronic medication model group (intraperitoneal injection at the postnatal day 47-60, 0.2 mg/kg,Qd), and a normal control group (injection with 0.9% normal saline during the corresponding periods). DA, DOPAC, Glu, and GABA of the tissue homogenate from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus were examined with Coularray electrochemic detection by high performance liquid chromatogram technique. The utilization rate of DA and Glu was calculated. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the concentration of DA and DOPAC in the mPFC and the hippocampus in the SZ developmental model group significantly decreased (P<0.05), and the GABA concentration and Glu utilization rate in the mPFC also decreased (P<0.05). Compared with the chronic medication model group, the DA concentration of the mPFC in the SZ developmental group decreased (P<0.05), and the DOPAC concentration and the utility rate of DA in the hippocampus also decreased (P<0.01, P<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: The activities of DA, Glu and GABA system decrease in the mPFC and the DA system function reduces in the hippocampus of SZ developmental rats.
