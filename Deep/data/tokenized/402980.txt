The effects of spinal cord hemisection on protein labeling in the medulla, pons, midbrain, and cortex in the Cebus monkey were studied by measuring the uptake of [3H]lysine into the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitable and non-precipitable fractions of brain. Animals were sacrificed 3, 6 or 13 days after hemisection. Two normal animals and a 3-day sham operate were utilized as controls. Differences included individual animals, operated vs. unoperated animals, brain areas, and variation of brain areas over all postoperative days. The overall trend in brain radioactivity over postoperative days indicates stress and non-stress related components of brain response to spinal injury. Left-right side differences (L greater than R) were noted in the uptake of [3H]lysine into specific areas of brain over postoperative time, including leg areas of motor cortex, occipital cortex, and superior colliculus. A biphasic action of leg sensory cortical areas over time was noted, where L greater than R for the first 6 postoperative days and R greater than L at day 13. The factors possibly mediating radiolabeled amino acid uptake into protein are discussed in relation to demonstrated anatomical and neurochemical regenerative processes.
