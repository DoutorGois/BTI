Intracellular recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal neurones in the rat hippocampus slice preparation. The recording electrodes contained potassium acetate (4 M) with or without the quaternary lidocaine derivative, QX-314 (50 mM). Both fast (f) and slow (s) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP) were evoked by low-frequency orthodromic stimulation. The s-IPSP was rapidly reduced by QX-314 injection. It decreased along a similar time course to the dV/dt of the action potential (AP). The f-IPSP and excitatory postsynaptic potential were not significantly reduced in size at a time when the s-IPSP was virtually abolished by QX-314. It is concluded that conductance through the K+ channels which are coupled to GABAB receptors is readily blocked by QX-314, while the Cl- channels which are coupled to GABAA receptors and the cation channels coupled to the glutamate receptors are relatively resistant to the local anaesthetic.
