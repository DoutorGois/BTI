The post-training administration of tricyclic antidepressant imipramine impairs memory consolidation in the passive avoidance task. The present study investigated the effects of intrahippocampal (i.h.) injection of adrenoceptor agents on imipramine-induced (2-8 microg/rat) amnesia. The administration of the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (0.05 microg/rat) and the alpha1-adrenceptor antagonist prazosin (0.5 microg/rat) did not alter the effect of imipramine. The lower doses of phenylephrine (0.005 and 0.015 microg/rat) impaired, while the higher dose of the drug (0.025 and 0.05 microg/rat) improved retention. The effect of phenylephrine was not altered by prazosin (0.5 and 1 microg/rat) pretreatment, although prazosin alone decreased retention latencies. The alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.5 and 1 microg/rat) decreased the response induced by imipramine. However, the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.08 microg/rat) did not alter the effect of the drug. Clonidine (0.15 and 0.3 microg/rat) by itself decreased, while yohimbine (1 and 2 microg/rat) increased retention latencies. Yohimbine pretreatment attenuated the effect of clonidine. It is concluded that alpha2-adrenoceptor mechanism(s) may be involved in imipramine-induced impairment of memory.
