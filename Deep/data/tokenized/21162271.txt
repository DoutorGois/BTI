AIM: To investigate effect of ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-activated currents (I(NMDA)) and evaluate further the modulatory effects of Micro-GBE/Nano-GBE. METHODS: By means of whole-cell patch clamp technique, NMDA-activated currents from acutely isolated rat hippocampal neurons were recored. RESULTS: The majority of the neurons examined (81.8%, 90/110) were sensitive to NMDA (1 mmol/L) and its co-agonist Gly (10 micromol/L). NMDA activated an inward current, which manifested apparent desensitization and could be blocked by its specific antagonist MK-801. After the neurons were treated with Micro/Nano GBE (0.1 mg/ml) followed by the application of NMDA (1 mmol/L) and Gly (10 micromol/L) for 30 s, it was show that NMDA-activated currents were obviously inhibited (P < 0.01, n = 8). The inhibitory rate were 40% +/- 17% and 64% +/- 15% respectively. It showed that the modulatory effect of Nano-GBE (dissolved in the stander extracellular solution) on NMDA-activated current was significantly higher than that of Micro-GBE (dissolved in DMSO) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The inward currents activated by NMDA could be depressed by Micro-GBE and Nano-GBE. The modulatory effects of GBE on NMDA-activated current are expected to contribute to the neuroprotective effects of ginkgo biloba extracts. In addition, at the same concentration, the modulatory effect of Nano-GBE on NMDA-activated current is better than that of Micro-GBE.
