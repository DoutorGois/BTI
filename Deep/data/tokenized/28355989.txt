Introduction There is evidence for hippocampal dysfunctions in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which may contribute to neuropsychiatric impairments. However, fine structural alterations of the hippocampus have not been investigated in SLE. Methods We measured the volume of hippocampal subfields in 18 SLE patients and 20 healthy control individuals matched for age, gender, and education. The MRI protocol included structural T1 volumes (Philips Achieva 3T scanner, magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE)). For image processing, we used the neuGRID platform and the longitudinal pipeline of FreeSurfer v6.0 with the "hipposubfields" flag. Results Patients with SLE showed reduced volumes of CA1 (Cornu Ammonis 1) and CA4-dentate gyrus subfields relative to the control individuals. Smaller CA1 volumes were associated with worse performance on the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination. Conclusions These preliminary results indicate a prominent vulnerability and functional relevance of the CA1 hippocampal subfield in SLE.
