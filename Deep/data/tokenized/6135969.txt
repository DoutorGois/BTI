Cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity (CCK) and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SRIF) were determined in fourteen brains from patients dying with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and in twelve brains from control cases. The schizophrenics had been rated during life and were divided into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of negative symptoms (affective flattening and poverty of speech). CCK was reduced in temporal cortex of the schizophrenics and in hippocampus and amygdala of those patients with negative symptoms. SRIF was reduced in the hippocampus in samples from the latter group. The selectivity of these changes to limbic lobe may reflect the presence of a degenerative process in that area. The association of changes in hippocampus and amygdala with negative symptoms of schizophrenia suggests a separate mechanism underlying these symptoms.
