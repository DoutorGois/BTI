Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease associated with oxidative stress, damage to biomolecules such as DNA, and neuroinflammation. Taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid widespread in the brain, has neuroprotective properties that might prevent tissue injury and DNA damage induced by chronic hyperglycemia. We evaluated the effects of chronic taurine treatment on oxidative stress parameters, DNA damage and inflammatory markers in the frontal cortex, and hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats displayed increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage in both areas, evidencing the pro-oxidant effects of diabetes in the brain. Moreover, this condition increased levels of several inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IL-12, TNF-gamma, and IFN-alpha, more pronouncedly in the hippocampus. Supporting our hypothesis, taurine treatment reduced ROS, DNA damage, and inflammatory cytokine levels, providing evidence of its beneficial effects against genotoxicity and neuroinflammation associated with diabetes. Our data endorse the necessary clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of taurine supplementation in the prevention and treatment of neurochemical and metabolic alterations related to diabetes.
