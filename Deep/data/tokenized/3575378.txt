During pregnancy mice are more susceptible to flurothyl-induced seizures than are non-pregnant controls. The potential role of brain catecholamines in mediating this behavior was examined in the present study. The concentration and turnover of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) were measured in hippocampus, striatum, midbrain and cortex in control, pregnant and delivery-day mice. There were no significant changes from control in DA levels during pregnancy and parturition. The turnover of DA was not altered during pregnancy, except for a small increase in turnover rate in the hippocampus. The concentration of NE decreased during pregnancy, and rose at parturition. This effect was most striking in the hippocampus. The turnover of NE was markedly depressed during pregnancy, with the hippocampus again being most affected. These data imply a role for NE, but not DA in the mediation of increased seizure susceptibility during pregnancy.
