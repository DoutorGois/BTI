The influence of transient forebrain ischemia on the temporal alteration of protein kinase C (PKC) activity in the gerbil hippocampus was analyzed by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). The [3H]PDBu binding activity in the stratum oriens of the CA1 subfield increased at 6 h after ischemia, but the binding activity in this subfield decreased at 7 days after ischemia. In contrast, the [3H]PDBu binding activity increased in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus at 7 days after ischemia. Pre-treatment of pentobarbital prevented an increase in the [3H]PDBu binding activity in the stratum oriens of the CA1 subfield at 7 days after ischemia. These results indicate the possibilities that PKC may play a pivotal role in the post-ischemic neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 subfield.
