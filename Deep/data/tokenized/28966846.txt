Fluorescence microendoscopy is becoming a promising approach for deep brain imaging, but the current technology for visualizing neurons on a single focal plane limits the experimental efficiency and the pursuit of three-dimensional functional neural circuit architectures. Here we present a novel fast varifocal two-photon microendoscope system equipped with a gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens and an electrically tunable lens (ETL). This microendoscope enables quasi-simultaneous imaging of the neuronal network activity of deep brain areas at multiple focal planes separated by 85-120 microm at a fast scan rate of 7.5-15 frames per second per plane, as demonstrated in calcium imaging of the mouse dorsal CA1 hippocampus and amygdala in vivo.
