The incidence of segments of rhythmic metrazol activity (RMA) in cortical leads and in the thalamus and hippocampus was studied in acute experiments on nine male albino laboratory rats. First of all we studied activity after administering metrazol in an i.p. dose of 50 mg/kg, without any further treatment, and then, after a control recording, we induced cortical spreading depression and observed its effect on the incidence and synchronization of RMA in the individual leads. We came to the conclusion that the thalamus is incapable of isolated production of RMA. The cortex is able to produce RMA without participation by the studied structures of the specific thalamus and hippocampus; RMA probably originates in the cortex itself. Generalization is impaired, but not eliminated, by a cortical block. The hippocampus independently produces another type of rhythmic activity.
