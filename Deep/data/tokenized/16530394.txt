In our prospective study of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we measured hippocampal mean diffusivity (MD) and volumes in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Thirteen MCI patients were followed-up by clinical assessment over a mean 112-year period. MCI patients who converted to dementia (6 of 13) during the observation period had slightly elevated left hippocampal mean diffusivity at baseline compared with MCI patients who remained clinically stable. Hippocampal volumes as well as baseline verbal memory and MMSE did not differ significantly between stable MCI patients and converters. Hippocampal diffusivity was superior to hippocampal volumes for prediction of conversion to dementia in MCI patients during a 112-year period.
