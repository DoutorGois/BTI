Turnover of [3H]phosphoinositides (PI) was examined in brain slices from the hippocampus of rats undergoing soman-induced seizure activity. Hydrolysis of PI was determined by measuring the accumulation of [3H]inositol-1-phosphate (IP1). Incubation of hippocampal slices in the presence of carbachol or norepinephrine (NE) increased PI hydrolysis. Stimulated hydrolysis by NE, but not carbachol was significantly reduced in slices from soman-challenged rats undergoing convulsive activity. NE-stimulated PI hydrolysis was not reduced in slices from animals exposed to soman that did not exhibit convulsive activity. In rats surviving for 24 h, the response to NE was not different from control rats. In control slices, NE-stimulated hydrolysis of PI was potentiated by GABA. No potentiation by GABA was seen in slices from animals undergoing seizures. Uptake and incorporation of myo-[2-3H]inositol into phospholipids was reduced in slices from rats undergoing convulsions. Reduced IP1 production appeared to be owing, in part, to decreased synthesis of inositol lipids. These observations suggest that during soman-induced seizure activity, there is an apparent decrease in the response of the PI second messenger system to NE stimulation, and that this may contribute to the severity and duration of convulsions and brain damage resulting from exposure to soman and other anticholinesterase compounds.
