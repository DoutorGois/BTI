OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of Musk and Borneol on cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury at different time points of acute phase in rats. METHODS: 180 rats were divided into seven groups including sham, ischemia-reperfusion after 24 h and 72 h model group, Musk 50 and 25 mg/kg groups, Borneol 50 and 25 mg/kg groups, and Xingnaojing 10 mL/kg group. Ischemia-reperfusion model was made after administration of each drug. The neurologic impairment scores at different time points after ischemia and reperfusion was evaluated, activities of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in brain tissue were determined, and the expression of CysLT2 protein and mRNA in hippocampus were explored. RESULTS: Musk and Borneol significantly improved the neurologic impairment scores of ischemia-reperfusion injury rats, improved the pathological morphology of rats brain tissue, reduced the activities of COX-2 and 5-LOX in brain homogenates,and inhibited the expression of CysLT2 protein in hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Musk and Borneol have protective effect on inflammatory injury of acute injury in ischemia-reperfusion injury rats, the mechanism is related to inhibition the activity of COX-2 and 5-LOX in brain.
