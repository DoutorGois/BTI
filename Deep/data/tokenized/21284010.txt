Neurons in the hippocampus exhibit subpopulations of dendritic spines that contain endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER in spines is important for synaptic activity and its associated Ca(2+) signaling. The dynamic distribution of ER to spines is regulated by diacylglycerol and partly mediated by protein kinase C, metalloproteinases and gamma-secretase. In this study, we explored whether pharmacological activation of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) known to activate phospholipase C would have any effect on spine ER content. We found that DHPG (100 muM) but not carbachol (10 muM) caused a reduction in the number of spines with ER. We further found that ER Ca(2+) depletion triggered by thapsigargin (200 nM) had no effect on ER localization in spines.
