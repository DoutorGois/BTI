In order to decide where to exit blood vessels and enter tissues, leukocytes roll along endothelial surfaces. Recent studies suggest that an 'automatic braking system' (ABS), involving selectin cell-adhesion molecules, enables leukocytes to roll at a fairly constant velocity despite large variations in blood flow rate.
