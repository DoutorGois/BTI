To clarify the role of serotonin in cerebral ischemia, we examined the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, citalopram and clomipramine, on ischemic neuronal damage in the gerbil. Pretreatment with citalopram (40 mg/kg i.p.) and clomipramine (20 mg/kg i.p.) protected against neuronal destruction of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells following 5 min of forebrain ischemia. Furthermore, microdialysis assays showed that a striking increase in extracellular excitatory amino acid levels during ischemia was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with citalopram and clomipramine. However, citalopram (40 mg/kg i.p.) did not alter the extracellular amino acid concentrations in normal gerbils. Thus, serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a protective effect against ischemic neuronal damage. Furthermore, the present result suggests that the protective effect is mediated through prevention of the accumulation of extracellular excitatory amino acids during and after ischemia.
