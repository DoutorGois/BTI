Many studies have used the channel blocker ZD 7288 to assess possible physiological and pathophysiological roles of hyperpolarization-activated cation currents (Ih). In view of the known interplay between Ih and other membrane conductances, the effects in Wistar rats of ZD 7288 on low-voltage-activated (LVA (- or T-type)) Ca2+ channels were examined in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in the presence of TTX, TEA, 4-AP, CsCl, BaCl2 and nifedipine. ZD 7288 reduced T-type calcium channel currents and this effect was concentration dependant. ZD 7288 blocked T-type currents when applied extracellularly, but not when included in the recording pipette. Furthermore, ZD 7288 altered the steady-state voltage-dependent inactivation of T-currents. These results indicate that the blocker ZD 7288 has effects on voltage sensitive channels additional to those reported for the Ih current.
