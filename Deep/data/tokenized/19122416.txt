In the present study, we compared differences in ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivities for microglia and astrocytes, respectively, in the hippocampus of the seizure-resistant (SR) and seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils. The density of Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia in the hippocampal CA1 region (CA1) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the SS gerbil was higher than that in the SR gerbil, and many Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia in the SS gerbil were hypertrophied in morphology. In contrast, we could not find significant difference in the density of GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes between the SR and SS gerbils. This result indicates that Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia in CA1 and DG of the SS gerbil are activated compared to those in the SR gerbil.
