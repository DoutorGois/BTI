Entorhinal cortex (EC), fascia dentata (FD), hippocampus (HP), and basal ganglia (BG) were studied in Rett syndrome (RS) cases and compared with control brains and an autism case. Kluver-Barrera and Golgi methods were used. In RS most of the areas of EC, HP, and FD showed severe cell hypochromia. In the EC all cells of layer II and most in layer III were in a state of total chromatolysis or were "ghost" cells, but the cells of layers V and VI were preserved and moderately hyperchromic. In FD and HP the majority of the granular cells and cells of CA3 and CA4 fields were severely hypochromic, whereas in the CA1 field most cells were normal or slightly hypercaryochromic. In BG mostly mild or moderate aberration from normal cell structure was observed: in striatum, mild hypercaryochromia of small neurons and more expressive hyperchromia of large neurons were found; and in pallidum, mild or moderate hypercaryochromia to severe hyperchromia in pallidum internum was found. Degeneration of thick myelinated fibers was evident in pallidum. Large striatal and pallidal neurons showed signs of constructive changes in Golgi slices. These data allow the determination of the cause of the main symptoms of RS. The motor disorders, including specific stereotyped movements, could be related to the enhanced activity of BG cells due to their deafferentation from the side of the neocortex and to supposed hyperactivity of the EC-striatal pathway; the mental retardation and epileptic seizures could be due to FD-HP involvement.
