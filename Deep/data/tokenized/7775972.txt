For long-lasting memory traces, structural synaptic changes remain a probable mechanism. However, in higher animals it has proved difficult to provide positive evidence for this notion. The main reason may be that the changes are subtle and are to be found in a relatively small subset of synapses and in a distributed manner in the cellular network in question. Here, we discuss possible strategies for finding structural changes in the hippocampus associated with spatial learning, an activity for which this structure is important. Spatial learning may induce new excitatory synapses in a small subset of hippocampal CA1 neurons because we observe a higher spine density without alteration in dendritic length or branching. The dendritic synapses are regularly spaced, irrespective of spine density, suggesting the operation of an intersynaptic dispersing force.
