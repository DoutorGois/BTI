A characteristic feature of developing neural circuits is that they are spontaneously active. There are several examples, including the retina, spinal cord, and hippocampus, where spontaneous activity is highly correlated among neighboring cells, with large depolarizing events occurring with a periodicity on the order of minutes. One likely mechanism by which neurons can "decode" these slow oscillations is through activation of second messenger cascades that either influence transcriptional activity or drive posttranslational modifications. Here, we describe recent experiments where imaging has been used to characterize slow oscillations in the cAMP/PKA second messenger cascade in retinal neurons. We review the latest techniques in imaging this specific second messenger cascade, its intimate relationship with changes in intracellular calcium concentration, and several hypotheses regarding its role in neurodevelopment.
