Effect of prenatal exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin (LCT) has been assessed on the integrity of NMDA receptors and associated post-synaptic signalling in hippocampus of developing rats. Decrease in the binding of [3H]-MK 801, known to label NMDA receptors was observed in hippocampus of rats prenatally exposed to LCT (1 and 3mg/kg body weight) on PD22, compared to controls. Consistent with this, decrease in the mRNA and protein expression of NR1 and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors was evident in rats prenatally exposed to LCT (1 and 3mg/kg body weight) on PD22. There was no change in mRNA and protein expression of NR2A subunit of NMDA receptors. Prenatal exposure to LCT (1 and 3mg/kg body weight) decreased the expression of positive regulators (PSD95, pERK1/2, CaMKIIalpha & pCREB) and increased the expression of negative regulators (Cdk5 & SynGAP) associated with NMDA receptor dependent synaptic plasticity in hippocampus and impaired learning and memory of rats on PD22. The neurobehavioral changes continued to persist in rats exposed to LCT at high dose (3mg/kg body weight) while exhibited trend of recovery in those exposed at moderate dose (1mg/kg body weight) on PD45, compared to controls. No change in any of the neurobehavioral endpoint was observed in developing rats prenatally exposed to LCT at low dose (0.5mg/kg body weight) on PD22 and PD45. The results exhibit that alterations in NMDA receptors on prenatal exposure to LCT may affect postsynaptic signalling associated with impaired learning and memory in developing rats.
