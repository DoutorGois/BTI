Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the single major cause of dementia in middle- to old-age individuals, and, as of yet, no disease-modifying therapeutic drug is available for its treatment. A major obstacle in the successful development of disease-modifying therapeutic drugs has been the lack of suitable animal models of the sporadic form of AD as well as a biomarker that can be used both for therapeutic preclinical studies and for human clinical trials. Previously we showed neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity deficits and cognitive impairment and their rescue with a neurotrophic peptidergic compound, DGGLAG named P021, in aged Fisher rats. Here we show that P021 is blood-brain-barrier-permeable, and chronic oral treatment with this compound can reduce the brain level of total tau in the aged rats. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of both tau and Abeta/AbetaPP are elevated in the aged animals, and chronic treatment with P021 can reduce tau but not Abeta/AbetaPP to that of the levels found in young adult rats. Importantly, P021 does not induce any detectable immune reaction in rats. Collectively, these studies show the therapeutic potential of P021 as a disease-modifying compound and the suitability of the aged Fisher rats as a model of cerebral aging in which the therapeutic efficacy of a tau-reducing compound can be monitored in the CSF.
