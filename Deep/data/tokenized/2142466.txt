The protective effect of anticalcium drugs on the development of quinolinate destruction in the dorsal hippocampus and nuclei of the lateral septum was studied on rats with the cannulae chronically implanted into the lateral ventricles. It was found that single doses of kynurenic acid (50 micrograms), taurine (300 micrograms) and verapamil (25 micrograms) prevented the destructive effect of quinolinic acid (30 micrograms) during central administration whereas cinnarizine (25 micrograms) and corinfar (15 micrograms) were active in oral 8-day-long administration.
