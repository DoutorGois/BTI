Proton-induced X-ray emission analysis (PIXE) was applied to determine ischemia-induced changes in the content of calcium, iron, nickel and zinc in the rat hippocampus. After 30 min or 2 h reperfusion following 20 min of ischemia, the nickel content decreased and the zinc content increased. The calcium content was increased 50% after 30 min but was normal after 2 h reperfusion.
