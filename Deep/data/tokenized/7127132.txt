Bilateral intraventricular injections of 0.5 microgram of kainic acid were used to selectively destroy CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, in an effort to clarify the possible localization of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the rat hippocampal formation. Thirty days after treatment, there was 43% decrease in the total number of [3H]L-QNB binding sites per hippocampus, with no change in affinity. Histological examination confirmed the selective loss of pyramidal neurons in subareas CA3a-b while other regions of the hippocampal formation were spared. The unilateral transection of the fimbria-fornix, done 14 days after kainic acid, produced a further reduction in binding in relation to control hippocampi (-57%). The results demonstrate that in the pyramidal cells of CA3 there is a high concentration of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors. However, the slight further decrease, found after fimbria-fornix transection, suggests the possible existence of a small population of presynaptic receptors that, hitherto, had only been demonstrated indirectly by physiological methods.
