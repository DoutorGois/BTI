A study was carried out on 8 adult cats of functional role of the frontal, parietal and occipital parts of the neocortex, and also of the dorsal hippocampus, mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and caudate nucleus head, in realization of a delayed spatial choice (DSCh) before and after compensatory reorganizations of the brain activity caused by multiple electrical stimulation of the frontal part of the cerebral cortex. Compensatory reorganization led to a change of functional significance of these structures. While before this change the frontal cortex, hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus were critically necessary brain areas for the realization of the DSCh, after it parietal and occipital cortical areas acquired such significance. The obtained data are discussed proceeding from the principle of the integrity in the brain activity.
