RATIONALE: Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), a protein involved in survival and maintenance of several cell phenotypes as well as in synaptic plasticity, is modulated by stress (Molteni et al., Brain Res Rev 37:249-258, 2001; Fumagalli et al., Neurobiol Dis 20:731-737, 2005) and cocaine (Fumagalli et al., J Neurochem 96:996-1004, 2006). OBJECTIVES: Since it is widely recognized that stress influences drug seeking, we decided to investigate whether stress, acute or repeated, could influence the changes in FGF-2 gene expression brought about by cocaine. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that stress and cocaine interact to produce significant changes on FGF-2 expression in rat prefrontal cortex and striatum. In prefrontal cortex, our experiments demonstrated that a single exposure to stress potentiated cocaine-induced FGF-2 elevation, whereas prolonged stress prevented the modulation of the trophic factor in response to cocaine. In striatum, the magnitude of cocaine-induced FGF-2 response is enhanced by repeated stress, whereas no interaction was observed when acute stress and single exposure to cocaine were combined. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that stress interacts with cocaine to alter the pattern of FGF-2 expression in a way that depends on whether stress is acute or chronic and in a regionally selective fashion. These results identify a potential molecular target through which stress alters cellular sensitivity to cocaine and might prove useful in understanding the mechanisms underlying brain vulnerability to stress.
