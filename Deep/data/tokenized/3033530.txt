The effect of phenobarbital (100 mg/kg i.p.) and 6-aminonicotinamide (6AN) (35 mg/kg i.p.) on enzyme activities related to energy transduction was investigated on the homogenate "in toto", non-synaptic mitochondrial fraction and synaptosomal fraction isolated from different rat brain areas (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, and medulla oblongata). 6AN treatment decreased: phosphofructokinase in all the areas tested; lactate dehydrogenase on the homogenate "in toto" in striatum and hypothalamus, and on the synaptosomal fraction in cerebral cortex and corpus striatum; succinate dehydrogenase on non-synaptic mitochondrial fraction in hippocampus and striatum. Finally, aspartate aminotransferase was increased on non-synaptic mitochondrial fraction in striatum and medulla oblongata. Phenobarbital treatment induced an increase of total NADH cytochrome c reductase on mitochondrial fraction in hippocampus and hypothalamus, and a decrease of cytochrome oxidase activity on non-synaptic mitochondrial fraction in hypothalamus and medulla oblongata.
