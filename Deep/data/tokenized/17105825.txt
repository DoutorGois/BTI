Maternal smoking is a risk factor associated with nicotine abuse, so the effect of perinatal nicotine exposure was studied on the responsiveness to nicotine across adolescence in the rat. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with s.c. Alzet osmotic minipumps delivering nicotine (L-nicotine hydrogen tartrate, 2 mg/kg/day free base) or vehicle (0.9% saline) on gestational day 7. There was no effect of nicotine on dam weight gain, food consumption, or water consumption or on the number of live pups or weights at the time of birth. Pups were cross-fostered to obtain the following prenatal/postnatal exposure groups: control/control, nicotine/nicotine, nicotine/control, and control/nicotine. On postnatal days 28, 35, 49, and 63, nicotine-stimulated (86)Rb(+) efflux was measured in synaptosomes prepared from the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum (STR), and thalamus (THL), using a previously developed method. Significant effects of treatment and concentration were detected in all four brain regions, and significant effects of age were observed in the STR and THL. Significant interactions of age and treatment were observed in each of the four brain regions. Nicotine-stimulated (86)Rb(+) efflux peaked during adolescence in control rats. However, perinatal exposure to nicotine eliminated this peak during adolescence. These results are consistent with recent behavioral and receptor binding results from other laboratories and are the first direct evidence at the cellular level that the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor response varies during adolescence and is affected by perinatal nicotine exposure.
