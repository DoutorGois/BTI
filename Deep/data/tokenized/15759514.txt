A similarity in the sequence of restoration of the EEG spectrum between ground squirrels arousing from torpor and rats passing out of artificial hypothermia (17-18 degrees C) was shown. First of all, the low-frequency part of the EEG spectrum was restored. As animals warmed up, their breathing became hurried, cold shivering appeared, and the theta- and alpha-rhythms increased. During the exit from hypothermia, the activity of the protein-synthesizing system in both rats and ground squirrels was almost entirely restored when the animal body temperature achieved 21-22 degrees C. In ground squirrel, the rate of protein synthesis in the neocortex was lower than in hippocampus CA1 and CA3 areas, whereas in rats, on the contrary, it was higher in the neocortex in comparison with the CA3 area.
