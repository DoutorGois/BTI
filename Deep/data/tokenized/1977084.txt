Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission could be a mechanism underlying memory. Induction of LTP requires Ca2+ influx into postsynaptic neurons through ion channels gated by NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors in hippocampus (area CA1 and dentate gyrus) and neocortex. Here we report that a component of LTP not requiring the activation of NMDA receptors can be induced in area CA1. The component is dependent on tetanus frequency, requires increases in postsynaptic intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and is suppressed by an antagonist of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels.
