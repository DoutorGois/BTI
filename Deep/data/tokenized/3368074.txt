We used intraoperative electrocorticography to identify and compare specimens from two groups of patients undergoing temporal lobectomy: (1) spiking cortex (12 patients)--epileptic activity recorded over much of the temporal convexity; and (2) nonspiking cortex (9 patients)--temporal convexity free of interictal spiking, epileptic activity confined to the hippocampus and/or amygdala. Comparative amino acid levels were (mumol/g protein, mean +/- SEM): glutamate--spiking 109.8 +/- 1.8, nonspiking 87.4 +/- 2.0 (p less than 0.001); aspartate--spiking 15.2 +/- 0.9, nonspiking 12.2 +/- 0.5 (p less than 0.05); GABA--spiking 15.0 +/- 1.0, nonspiking 13.9 +/- 1.4 (NS); taurine--spiking 14.5 +/- 0.8, nonspiking 12.2 +/- 0.8 (NS); and glycine--spiking 11.5 +/- 0.8, nonspiking 7.4 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.01). Cortical epileptic activity appears to be associated with elevated concentrations of glutamate, aspartate, and glycine, but not GABA and taurine, perhaps indicating a relative imbalance between putative excitatory and inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters.
