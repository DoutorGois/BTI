Phospho-Ser129 alpha-synuclein is the modified form of alpha-synuclein that occurs most frequently within Parkinson's disease pathological inclusions. Here we demonstrate that the antidiabetic drug metformin significantly reduces levels of phospho-Ser129 alpha-synuclein and the ratio of phospho-Ser129 alpha-synuclein to total alpha-synuclein. This effect was documented in vitro in SH-SY5Y and HeLa cells as well as in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. In vitro work also elucidated the mechanisms underlying metformin's action. Following metformin exposure, decreased phospho-Ser129 alpha-synuclein was not strictly dependent on induction of AMP-activated protein kinase, a primary target of the drug. On the other hand, metformin-induced phospho-Ser129 alpha-synuclein reduction was consistently associated with inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Evidence supporting a key role of mTOR/PP2A signaling included the finding that, similar to metformin, the canonical mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was capable of lowering the ratio of phospho-Ser129 alpha-synuclein to total alpha-synuclein. Furthermore, no decrease in phosphorylated alpha-synuclein occurred with either metformin or rapamycin when phosphatase activity was inhibited, supporting a direct relationship between mTOR inhibition, PP2A activation and protein dephosphorylation. A final set of experiments confirmed the effectiveness of metformin in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Addition of the drug to food or drinking water lowered levels of phospho-Ser129 alpha-synuclein in the brain of treated animals. These data reveal a new mechanism leading to alpha-synuclein dephosphorylation that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention by drugs like metformin and rapamycin.
