BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Schizophrenia is well-known to be associated with hippocampal structural abnormalities. We used (1)H-MR spectroscopy to test the hypothesis that these abnormalities are accompanied by NAA deficits, reflecting neuronal dysfunction, in patients compared with healthy controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with schizophrenia (11 men; mean age, 40.6 +/- 10.1 years; mean disease duration, 19.5 +/- 10.5 years) and 11 matched healthy controls (5 men; mean age, 33.7 +/- 10.1 years) underwent MR imaging and multivoxel point-resolved spectroscopy (TE/TR, 35/1400 ms) (1)H-MRS at 3T to obtain their hippocampal GM absolute NAA, Cr, Cho, and mIns concentrations. Unequal variance t tests and ANCOVA were used to compare patients with controls. Bilateral volumes from manually outlined hippocampal masks were compared by using unequal variance t tests. RESULTS: Patients' average hippocampal GM Cr concentrations were 19% higher than that of controls, 8.7 +/- 2.2 versus 7.4 +/- 1.2 mmol/L (P < .05); showing no differences, concentrations in NAA were 8.8 +/- 1.6 versus 8.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/L; in Cho, 2.3 +/- 0.7 versus 2.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/L; and in mIns, 6.1 +/- 1.5 versus 5.2 +/- 0.9 (all P > .1). There was a positive correlation between mIns and Cr in patients (r = 0.57, P = .05) but not in controls. The mean bilateral hippocampal volume was approximately 10% lower in patients: 7.5 +/- 0.9 versus 8.4 +/- 0.7 cm(3) (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the hippocampal volume deficit in schizophrenia is not due to net loss of neurons, in agreement with histopathology studies but not with prior (1)H-MR spectroscopy reports. Elevated Cr is consistent with hippocampal hypermetabolism, and its correlation with mIns may also suggest an inflammatory process affecting some cases; these findings may suggest treatment targets and markers to monitor them.
