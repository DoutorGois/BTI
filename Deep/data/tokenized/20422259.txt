We investigated MK-801 effect on ischemia-induced oxidative stress-the most important factor that exacerbates brain damage by reperfusion. The common carotid arteries of gerbils were occluded for 5, 10, or 15 min. Immediately after the occlusion, MK-801 (3 mg/kg i.p.) or saline were given in normothermic conditions. The MK-801 effects were followed in vivo by monitoring the neurological status of animals and at the intracellular level by standard biochemical assays. We investigated nitric oxide levels, superoxide production, superoxide dismutase activity, index of lipid peroxidation (ILP), and reduced glutathione content in hippocampus, striatum, forebrain cortex, and cerebellum. The measurements took place at different times (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 days) after reperfusion. Increased duration of cerebral ischemia resulted in a progressive induction of oxidative stress. Our results revealed pattern of dynamic changes in each oxidative stress parameter level which corresponded with ischemia duration in all tested brain structures. Most sensitive oxidative stress parameters were ILP and superoxide production. Our study confirmed spatial distribution of ischemia-induced oxidative stress. Tested brain structures showed different sensitivity to each oxidative stress parameter. As judged by biochemical and neurological data, applied MK-801 showed neuroprotective efficiency by reduction of ischemia-induced oxidative stress in brain.
