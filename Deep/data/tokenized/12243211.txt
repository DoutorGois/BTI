Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neuropathologically diagnosed cause of degenerating dementia after Alzheimer's disease. We report the first autopsy-confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa in a Nigerian patient. The case presented highlights the varied clinical presentation of DLB, and is intended to raise awareness about another possible cause of dementia in Nigerian subjects.
