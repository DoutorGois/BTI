Lysine vasopressin (5.2 and 10.4 microM) failed to significantly alter the spontaneous release of (3H)-noradrenaline from hippocampal slices in vitro or the release observed after stimulation with potassium chloride (15 and 25 mM). Uptake of (3H)-noradrenaline by synaptosomes prepared from hippocampal tissue was not significantly changed by incubation with vasopressin (5.2 and 10.4 mu M). Our results fail to support the hypothesis, derived from behavioural and in vivo biochemical studies, that vasopressin modulates the activity of noradrenergic nerve terminals in this part of the limbic system.
