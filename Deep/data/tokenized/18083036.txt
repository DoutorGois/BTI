In the search for AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonists, 2,3-benzodiazepines represent a family of specific noncompetitive antagonists with anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties. We have previously shown that 2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones possess marked anticonvulsant properties and high affinity for the noncompetitive binding site of the AMPAR complex. In this paper, we report the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a full set of 2,3-benzodiazepin-4-ones in order to better define the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this class of compounds. Binding assays and functional tests were performed to evaluate the antagonistic activity at the AMPARs. Through these results we have identified a potent AMPAR antagonist, 1-(4-amino-3-methylphenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-ethylenedioxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-o ne (5c). This compound noncompetitively inhibited AMPAR-mediated toxicity in primary mouse hippocampal cultures with an IC(50) of 1.6muM and blocked kainate-induced calcium influx in rat cerebellar granule cells with an IC(50) of 6.4muM. Thus, 5c has the in vitro potential as therapeutic drug in the treatment of various neurological disorders.
