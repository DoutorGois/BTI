Recurrent excitatory circuits and abnormal recurrent excitatory inputs are essential in epileptogenesis. Studies in temporal lobe epilepsy have shown that mossy fiber sprouting, which represents synaptic reorganization, renders the formation of abnormal recurrent excitatory circuits and inputs. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway has recently been proved important in mossy fiber sprouting. In the present study, rapamycin, a mTOR inhibiter, was injected into the mouse of temporal lobe epilepsy. Electrophysiological and histological properties of the hippocampus were investigated by whole cell patch clamp, extracellular recording and Timm staining. Following the development of epilepsy, frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and amplitude of antidromically evoked EPSCs in granule cells were remarkably increased, as well as the epileptiform activity and mossy fiber sprouting were detected, which indicated the formation of abnormal recurrent excitatory circuits. By the use of rapamycin, frequency of spontaneous EPSCs, amplitude of antidromically evoked EPSCs, the epileptiform activity and mossy fiber sprouting were all remarkably suppressed. Our findings suggested an anti-epileptogenic role of rapamycin by suppressing the recurrent excitatory circuits of dentate gyrus.
