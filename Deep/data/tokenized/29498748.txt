Mindfulness interventions have been beneficial for healthy adults and individuals experiencing a stressful medical or mental health diagnosis. The purposes of the current study were to: (a) determine feasibility of mindfulness for older adults in long-term residential settings, and (b) examine differences in outcomes between a mindfulness and cognitive activity. The current study is the first mindfulness study to include individuals in moderate and severe stages of dementia, and included 36 individuals with a range of cognitive abilities. A crossover design was used, and the intervention was feasible for continued practice by individuals with cognitive impairment. Statistically significant short-term changes in agitation, discomfort, anger, and anxiety were found. Nighttime sleep did not improve, but participants slept less during the day. Long-term changes in outcomes were not found. Mindfulness may be useful in decreasing emotional reactivity and improving well-being of older adults in long-term care. TARGETS: Individuals with multiple chronic conditions, including cognitive impairment. INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION: The Present in the Now (PIN) intervention is a mindfulness intervention with three components: attentional skill exercises, body awareness activities, and compassion meditation. MECHANISMS OF ACTION: Mindfulness acts to decrease emotional reactivity through cognitive and affective mechanisms of action and neural activation of the cingulate cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. OUTCOMES: Agitation, affect, stress, sleep, discomfort, and communication of need. [Res Gerontol Nurs. 20xx; x(x):x-x.].
