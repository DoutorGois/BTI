We investigated the effect of dysfunctional teeth on age-related changes in the septohippocampal cholinergic system by assessing acetylcholine (ACh) release and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the hippocampus and ChAT immunohistochemistry in the medial septal nucleus and the vertical limb of the diagonal band in young-adult and aged SAMP8 mice after removal of their upper molar teeth (molarless condition). Aged molarless mice showed decreased ACh release and ChAT activity in the hippocampus and a reduced number of ChAT-immunopositive neurons in the medial septal nucleus compared to age-matched control mice, whereas these effects were not seen in young-adult mice. The results suggest that the molarless condition in aged SAMP8 mice may enhance an age-related decline in the septohippocampal cholinergic system.
