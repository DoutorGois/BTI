To investigate the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSC) in epileptic brain, spaciotemporal expression of immunoreactive bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was examined in kindling development of rat. Amygdaloid kindling in partial seizure (PS) was effective in proliferation of NSC detected with BrdU-labeling in subventricular zone (SVZ), but not in dentate gyrus (DG). In SVZ, however, the BrdU-labeling cells decreased at stage generalized seizure (GS). These facts indicate that proliferation of NSC increased with PS and decreased with more severe seizures of GS in SVZ, that such a proliferation did not occur in DG with PS or GS. Thus, the proliferation of NSC was spacially and temporally different between brain regions depending on different kindling stages.
