Trait anxiety, a personality dimension that measures an individual's higher disposition to anxiety, has been found to be associated with many functional consequences viz. increased distractibility, attentional bias in favor of threat-related information etc. Similarly, volumetric studies have reported morphological changes viz. a decrease in the volume of left uncinate fasciculus (fiber connecting anterior temporal areas including the amygdala with prefrontal-/orbitofrontal cortices) and an increase in the volume of the left amygdala and right hippocampus, to be associated with trait anxiety. The functional and morphological changes associated with trait anxiety might also be associated with the changes in the integrity of WM tracts in relation with the trait anxiety levels of the subjects. Therefore, in the present diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) study, we investigated the possible relationship between the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived indices of a wide array of fiber tracts and the trait anxiety scores in our subject group. A positive correlation between trait anxiety scores and the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) value was obtained in fornix and left uncinate fasciculus. The study provides first account of a positive relation between sub-clinical anxiety levels of subjects and the FA of fornix thereby providing interesting insights into the biological foundation of sub-clinical anxiety.
