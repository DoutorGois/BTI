Research is here reported on the distribution of immunoreactivities of the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin D-28K in the entorhinal cortex of normal human brains. Topographically, parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons were only seen in the lateral portion of the rostral entorhinal cortex, in continuity with the adjacent perirhinal cortex. The intermediate and caudal portions gave positive results along the mediolateral extension of the entorhinal cortex. The laminar distribution of parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons was similar throughout the entorhinal cortex. Heavy immunostaining, largely coincident with cell islands, was observed in cells and fibers in layer II, being densest in the deep half of layer III and more sparsely distributed in layers V and VI. Calbindin D-28K immunoreactivity was found throughout the entorhinal cortex. In contrast to parvalbumin immunoreactivity, calbindin D-28K was present from layer I up to upper layer III, the neurons being most numerous in the cell islands of layer II. These results show that rostromedial portions of the human entorhinal cortex contain calbindin immunoreactivity, but not parvalbumin, while the lateral, intermediate and caudal portions of the entorhinal cortex contain both calcium-binding proteins. As it is known that these two proteins belong to a subset of GABAergic neurons, we suggest that a topographical diversity in some of the cells may be responsible for inhibitory effects in the human entorhinal cortex. This proposed diversity might be relevant to the processing of information that the entorhinal cortex conveys to the dentate gyrus and receives from various components of the hippocampus, the subicular complex and other cortical and subcortical sources.
