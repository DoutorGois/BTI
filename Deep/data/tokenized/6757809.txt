The effects of lesions and stimulations of the telencephalic limbic system on experimental gastric ulcers and erosions are reviewed. It is concluded that the centromedial amygdala and the anterior cingulate gyrus are facilitatory structures, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and posterolateral amygdala are inhibitory areas during stressful experiences, e.g., immobilization. Both the centromedial amygdala and the anterior cingulate gyrus may be part of an "ancillary" pain system, mediating the affective components of aversive experiences. The inhibitory structures, on the other hand, are assumed to be part of a "preventive" mechanism which is initiated by the selective nuclear binding of glucocorticoids when under stress.
