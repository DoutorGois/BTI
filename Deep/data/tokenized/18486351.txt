It has previously been reported that dopamine (DA) responses observed in the core and dorsomedial shell parts of the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) in latent inhibition (LI) are dependent on the left entorhinal cortex (ENT). The present study was designed to investigate the influence of the left ventral subiculum (SUB) closely linked to the ENT on the DA responses obtained in the Nacc during LI, using an aversive conditioned olfactory paradigm and in vivo voltammetry in freely moving rats. In the first (pre-exposure) session, functional blockade of the left SUB was achieved by local microinjection of tetrodotoxin (TTX). In the second session, rats were aversively conditioned to banana odor, the conditional stimulus (CS). In the retention (test) session the results were as follows: (1) pre-exposed (PE) conditioned animals microinjected with TTX, displayed aversion toward the CS; (2) in the core part of the Nacc, for PE-TTX-conditioned rats as for non-pre-exposed (NPE) conditioned animals, DA levels remained close to the baseline whereas DA variations in both groups were significantly different from the DA increases observed in PE-conditioned rats microinjected with the solvent (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)); (3) in the shell part of the Nacc, for PE-TTX-conditioned rats, DA variations were close to or above the baseline. They were situated between the rapid DA increases observed in NPE-conditioned animals and the transient DA decreases obtained in PE-PBS-conditioned animals. These findings suggest that, in parallel to the left ENT, the left SUB controls DA LI-related responses in the Nacc. The present data may also offer new insight into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
