This article presents the most significant results and trends concerning current research on the neurobiological basis of memory. The important contribution of neuropsychological research and the resulting constraints that its findings impose to every neurobiological approach are briefly reviewed. The main results about the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, together with those obtained by several approaches such as electrophysiology, neurochemistry are reported and discussed with respect to their degree of pertinence and coherence with the issues. Finally, the problems relating to the nature, properties, mechanisms of construction and evolution of the internal representations are examined.
