Distribution of hippocalcin in rat brain was analysed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical methods. Hippocalcin mRNA and immunoreactivity were expressed more intensely in the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, intensely in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, moderately in the dentate granule cells and pyramidal cells of cerebral cortex layers II-VI and weakly in the large neuronal cells of the caudate-putamen. Some discrepancies in the localization of hippocalcin mRNA and immunoreactivity were noted in the mamillary nuclei, anterior part of the thalamus and the septal nuclei. In most cell types, hippocalcin immunoreactivity was localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of cell bodies and dendrites.
