Oligodendrocytes are myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. Research into the effects of aging on oligodendrocyte protein expression remains limited. The present study aimed to determine the alterations in oligodendrocytespecific protein (OSP) expression in the gerbil hippocampus at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 24 months of age with western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. OSP expression levels in the hippocampus were highest at 6 months of age. OSP immunoreactivity was identified in numerous cell bodies at 1 month, although the number of OSP immunoreactive cells was different according to hippocampal subregion. The number of OSP immunoreactive cells significantly decreased at 2 months and, thereafter, numbers decreased gradually. The detection of OSP immunoreactive fibers was negligible in all layers in the hippocampal subregions until 4 months. OSP immunoreactive fibers were abundant at 6 and 24 months, although the fiber distribution patterns in the CA13 areas and dentate gyrus were different. The results demonstrated that OSP expression in the gerbil hippocampus was agedependent. The detection of OSP immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers was significantly different according to the layers of hippocampal subregions, indicating that myelination may be continuously altered in the hippocampus during normal aging.
