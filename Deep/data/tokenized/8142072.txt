The recent cloning of the mouse delta opioid receptor (Evans et al., 1992; Kieffer et al., 1992) has demonstrated it to be a member of the seven transmembrane G-protein coupled family of neurotransmitter receptors. The present study describes the cellular localization in the central nervous system (CNS) of an mRNA encoding this receptor and compares it with the distribution of delta receptor binding and proenkephalin mRNA using a combination of in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiographic techniques. Delta receptor mRNA was visualized with a cRNA probe (472-903 bp) corresponding to transmembrane domains III-VI of the receptor, while proenkephalin mRNA was labeled with a cRNA probe to exon 3 (139-832 bp). A high level of correspondence was observed between the distribution of delta receptor mRNA and delta receptor binding as defined by the selective ligand [3H]D-Pen2-Pen5-enkephalin. Delta receptor mRNA and binding were expressed in the neocortex, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, diagonal band of Broca, amygdala and the nucleus of the solitary tract. Discrepancies in the distribution of delta receptor mRNA and binding in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, globus pallidus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, may in part be due to differential receptor synthesis and transport. These results are discussed in relation to the distribution of proenkephalin mRNA and how this may affect our understanding of opioid circuitry in the CNS.
