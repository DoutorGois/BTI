Receptor binding and synaptosomal uptake of L-[3H]glutamate and L-[3H]aspartate were measured in hippocampus derived from rats maintained on zinc restricted diets from weaning. Despite near lethal zinc deficiency, these markers of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission were unaffected compared to zinc-supplemented controls. However, addition of zinc in vitro markedly inhibited binding of glutamate and aspartate to hippocampal membranes. These data suggest that zinc can modulate the receptor affinities for glutamate and aspartate and may function as a tonic inhibitor of excitatory synapses in vivo.
