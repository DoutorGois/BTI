The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of maternal lead exposure on expression of P2X7 receptor and synaptophysin in the hippocampus of mice offspring. Lead exposure initiated from beginning of gestation to weaning. Lead acetate administered in drinking solutions was dissolved in distilled deionized water at the concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% groups, respectively. On the 21st postnatal day, the Pb levels were also determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The expression of P2X7 receptor and synaptophysin in hippocampus was examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The lead levels in blood and hippocampus of all lead exposure groups were significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression of P2X7 receptor was increased in lead exposed groups (P<0.05), but the expression of synaptophysin was decreased (P<0.05). The high expression of P2X7 receptor and low expression of synaptophysin in the hippocampus of pups may contribute to the neurotoxicity associated with maternal Pb exposure.
