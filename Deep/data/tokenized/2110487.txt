In has been established that intrahippocampal bilateral injection of NA did not influence common frequency of lateral hypothalamic self stimulation. After the destruction of hippocampal NA - terminals of 6-OHDA increased the frequency of self stimulation and rearing. It is suggested that NA hippocampus inhibit the recall trace of the memory of sensory reinforcement stimuli in the course of stimulation "reward".
