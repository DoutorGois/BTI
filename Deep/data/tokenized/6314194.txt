The effect of 2-chloroadenosine (5 and 10 microM) on long-term potentiation of the perforant path has been investigated. Experiments were performed in vivo using a push-pull cannula implanted in the dentate gyrus. A high intensity, high frequency train applied to the perforant path during perfusion with the adenosine agonist 2-chloroadenosine, was markedly attenuated in its ability to produce long-term potentiation. Inhibitory effects on pre- and post-synaptic calcium calcium influx are discussed.
