2-Oxo-2H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole derivatives were found to inhibit the in vitro binding of (3)H-Ro 15-1788 ((3)H-flumazenil) to rat cortical benzodiazepine receptors with IC(50) values in the range of 0.7-13 micromol/l. The most potent compound, 2-oxo-4-phenyl-2H-pyrimido[2,1-b]- benzothiazole showed a similar potency to inhibit (3)H-Ro 15-1788 binding to membrane preparations of rat brain cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus as well as to various subunit combinations of recombinant human gamma-aminobutyric acid(A)/benzodiazepine receptors. Scatchard plot analysis showed that 2-oxo-4-phenyl-2H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole is a competitive inhibitor of (3)H-Ro 15-1788 binding to rat brain cortical membrane preparations.
