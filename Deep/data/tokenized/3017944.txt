Novel sulfated glucuronic acid-containing glycolipids have been identified in the nervous system. These glycolipids are highly antigenic and share antigenic determinants with several nervous system glycoproteins, such as neural cell adhesion molecules, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and ependymins. The structure of the major antigenic glycolipid from human peripheral nerve was determined by chemical and enzymatic degradation, incorporation studies, sugar analysis after permethylation, pertrimethylsilylation, and gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques as well as fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of the native antigen. The following structure was established for the major antigenic glycolipid. sulfate-3-GlcA beta(1---3)Gal beta(1----4)GlcNAc beta(1----3)Gal beta(1----4)Glc beta(1----1)-ceramide. The major fatty acids in the ceramide were 18:0, 18:1, 24:0, and 24:1, with C18-sphingenine as the long chain base.
