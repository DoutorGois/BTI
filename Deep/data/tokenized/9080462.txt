The effects of midazolam, one of the most popular benzodiazepines, was examined on excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Both CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1-PCs) and dentate gyrus granule cells (DG-GCs) were studied in rat hippocampal slices with extracellular recordings. Midazolam depressed the amplitudes of orthodromic population spikes (O-PS) and excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) slopes of CA1-PCs in a dose-dependent manner, but depressed those of DG-GCs to a lesser extent. On the other hand, midazolam had little effect on the amplitudes of antidromic population spikes of both CA1-PCs and DG-GCs. A GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline strongly antagonized the depressant effects of 75 microM midazolam on the amplitudes of O-PS by 73% in CA1-PCs, whereas it did not antagonize the effects of midazolam in DG-GCs. These results suggest that the differential effects of midazolam could be due to the different types and/or density of GABAA receptors between CA1-PCs and DG-GCs.
