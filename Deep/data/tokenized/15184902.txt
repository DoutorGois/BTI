In hippocampal pyramidal cells, a rise in Ca(2+) releases endocannabinoids that activate the presynaptic cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) and transiently reduce GABAergic transmission-a process called depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI). The mechanism that limits the duration of endocannabinoid action in intact cells is unknown. Here we show that inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), not fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), prolongs DSI, suggesting that COX-2 limits endocannabinoid action.
