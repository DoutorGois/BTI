In in vitro rat hippocampal slices a short period (2 min) of hypoxia resulted in lasting potentiation of the population spike transynaptically evoked in CA1 by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals ("anoxic LTP"). Pretreatment of slices with antiserum against S-100 protein fully prevented this anoxic LTP. Since also "classical" (i.e., induced by high-frequency electrical stimulation) long-term potentiation is prevented by anti S-100 serum, this represents one more important similarity between these events.
