Parvalbumin was isolated from human cerebral cortex and biceps and triceps muscles by HPLC. The immunological properties of the human protein and the mobility in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels were similar to that of parvalbumin isolated from the muscles of rat, mouse, rabbit, and chicken. The tryptic peptide maps of the human parvalbumin, however, differed considerably from all other parvalbumins, indicating a distinct primary structure. The immunolabeled cells in the hippocampus of the human brain were of different sizes and forms; they occurred in all subfields and probably represent interneurons.
