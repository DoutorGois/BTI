Extended release of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the nervous system during immunological and infectious conditions may trigger demyelinating disorders and cause disturbances in brain function. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of IFN-gamma on neuronal function in rat hippocampal cell cultures by using whole cell patch clamp analysis together with quantitative immunocytochemistry. Acute application of IFN-gamma to differentiated neurons in culture caused no immediate neurophysiological responses, but recordings after 48 h of incubation displayed an increase in frequency of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). Quantitative immunocytochemistry for the AMPAR subunit GluR1 showed no alteration in receptor clustering at this time point. However, prolonged treatment with IFN-gamma for 2 weeks resulted in a significant reduction in AMPAR clustering on dendrites but no marked differences in EPSC frequency between treated neurons and controls could be observed. On the other hand, treatment of hippocampal neurons for 4 weeks, instituted at an immature stage (1 day in culture), caused a significant reduction in spontaneous EPSC frequency. These neurons developed with no overt alterations in dendritic arborization or in the appearance of dendritic spines as visualized by alpha-actinin immunocytochemistry. Nonetheless, there was a marked reduction in AMPAR clustering on dendrites. These observations show that a key immunomodulatory molecule, IFN-gamma, can cause long-term modifications of synaptic activity and perturb glutamate receptor clustering.
