Gld2, a noncanonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, interacts with the RNA binding protein CPEB1 to mediate polyadenylation-induced translation in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons. Depletion of Gld2 from the hippocampus leads to a deficit in long-term potentiation evoked by theta burst stimulation. At least in mouse liver and human primary fibroblasts, Gld2 also 3' monoadenylates and thereby stabilizes specific miRNAs, which enhance mRNA translational silencing and eventual destruction. These results suggest that Gld2 would be likely to monoadenylate and stabilize miRNAs in the hippocampus, which would produce measurable changes in animal behavior. We now report that using Gld2 knockout mice, there are detectable alterations in specific miRNA monoadenylation in the hippocampus when compared to wild type, but that these modifications produce no detectable effect on miRNA stability. Moreover, we surprisingly find no overt change in animal behavior when comparing Gld2 knockout to wild-type mice. These data indicate that miRNA monoadenylation-mediated stability is cell type-specific and that monoadenylation has no measurable effect on higher cognitive function.
