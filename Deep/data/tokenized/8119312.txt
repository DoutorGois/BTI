The pharmacological activity of the histamine H3 receptor antagonist VUF 9153 (S-[3-(4(5)-imidazolyl)]propyl-N-(4-chlorobenzyl)isothiourea) has been investigated in vitro and in vivo. VUF 9153 displaced [3H]N alpha-methylhistamine binding to rat cortex/hippocampal membranes (pKi = 9.77 +/- 0.03) and antagonised the inhibitory responses to (R)-alpha-methylhistamine against electrical field stimulation in the isolated longitudinal smooth muscle preparation of guinea-pig ileum (pKB = 9.95 +/- 0.07). In these assays, VUF 9153 was 10-50-fold more potent than the prototype H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide. VUF 9153 showed no or very weak activity in in vitro functional assays for histamine H1 or H2 receptors. Systemic administration of VUF 9153 (s.c. or p.o.) dose-dependently inhibited the ex vivo binding of [3H]N alpha-methylhistamine to rat cortex/hippocampal membranes and dipsogenic responses induced by (R)-alpha-methylhistamine. Calculation of ED50 values, at the 1 h pretreatment time used, revealed that VUF 9153 administered s.c. or p.o., was approximately 2-fold weaker than thioperamide. These data indicate that, like thioperamide, VUF 9153 is a potent and selective antagonist for histamine H3 receptors in vitro, possesses the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to access central H3 receptors and can inhibit H3 receptor-mediated functional responses in vivo.
