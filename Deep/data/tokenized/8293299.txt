We investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (ahCRF), on increases in noradrenaline (NA) turnover caused by immobilization stress in rat brain regions. Pretreatment with ahCRF (50 or 100 micrograms) significantly attenuated increases in levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol sulfate (MHPG-SO4), the major metabolite of NA in rat brain, in the locus coeruleus (LC) region, and attenuated the MHPG-SO4/NA ratio after immobilization stress for 50 min in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, midbrain and hypothalamus. However, stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone levels were not decreased significantly by pretreatment with ahCRF. These results suggest that CRF, released during stress, causes increases in NA release in extended brain regions of stressed rats.
