Moderately induced genes often escape detection in conventional subtraction hybridisation cloning. Here a modification of a phagemid subtraction protocol is described that overcomes this problem. The protocol uses low ratio hybridisation of driver to target sequences to allow enrichment of the sequences of interest, and back-hybridisation of the subtracted sequences with induced sequences to reduce the accumulation of false positive clones. The procedure takes advantage of the quantitative representation of cellular RNA populations in cDNA libraries, therefore, they may serve not only as renewable sources of driver and target sequences, but also as sources of population cRNAs used in northern blots and differential Southern blots.
