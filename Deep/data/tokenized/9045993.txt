To localize and quantify the state-dependent changes in various opioid receptor subtypes in the limbic system of non-hibernating and hibernating Columbian ground squirrels, quantitative receptor-binding autoradiography was used. Compared to the non-hibernating animals, the binding density of [3H]-[D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin (DPDPE) to the delta receptor in the lateral septum, CA3, and the hippocampal fissure of the hippocampal formation was significantly decreased in the hibernating ground squirrels. A significant reduction in the binding density of [3H]-[D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAGO) to mu receptor was also observed in the medial septum and the CA3 region of the hippocampus of the hibernating animals. In contrast, a decrease in [3H]ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) binding to the kappa receptor was only observed in the claustrum and CA3 of the hippocampus during hibernation. The differential changes in binding to various opioid receptors suggest that different opioid subtypes may exert different physiological roles in regulating the specific states (entrance, maintenance and arousal) of a hibernation bout.
