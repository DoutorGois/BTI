Shaffer collateral evoked extracellular DC potentials with latencies greater than 100 ms are demonstrated in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice preparation. The most prominent potential following the population spike is a positive potential peaking between 150 and 400 ms after the stimulus. The amplitude of the potential is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the population spike. This potential shares several characteristics with the P300 from electroencephalogram studies of evoked potentials. Thus, it was dubbed the in vitro P3. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of the in vitro P3 is a negative potential that immediately follows it. The negative potential is smaller in amplitude than the in vitro P3, but lasts for several seconds. A similar potential also follows the P300 in electroencephalogram studies. These data suggest that the in vitro P3 is an in vitro version of the long latency evoked potential known as the P300 in electroencephalogram studies.
