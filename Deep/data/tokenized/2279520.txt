We examined the effects of stimulation of the dorsal hippocampus and lesions of the dorsal fornix on glucose metabolism in liver slices of rabbits. Hippocampal stimulation decreased the 14C transfer rates from 14C-glucose into CO2, ketone bodies, cholesterol ester and free fatty acids, but increased the rates into triglyceride, phospholipids and glycogen. Fornix lesions had various effects on glucose metabolism, and the effects of hippocampal stimulation on glucose metabolism were abolished by fornix lesions. These observations support the hypothesis that the hippocampus is an integral part of the brain regulator system in the hepatic glucose metabolism.
