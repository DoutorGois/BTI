Brain regions involved in visual recognition memory, including the hippocampus, have been investigated by measuring differential neuronal activation produced by novel and familiar pictures. Novel and familiar pictures were presented simultaneously, one to each eye, using a paired viewing procedure. Differential neuronal activation was determined using immunohistochemistry for the protein products of c-fos as an imaging technique. The results establish that the regions of the rat brain associated with discriminating the novelty or familiarity of an individual item (such as a single object) differ from those responding to a spatial array of items (such as a scene). Perirhinal cortex and area TE of the temporal lobe are activated significantly more by pictures of novel than of familiar individual objects, but the hippocampus is not differentially activated. In contrast, pictures of novel arrangements of familiar items produce significantly greater activation than familiar arrangements of these items in postrhinal cortex and subfield CA1 of the hippocampus but significantly less activation in the dentate gyrus and subiculum; perirhinal cortex and area TE are not differentially activated. Thus, the hippocampus is importantly involved in processing information essential to recognition memory concerning the relative familiarity of arrangements of items, as needed for episodic memory of scenes, whereas the perirhinal cortex processes such information for individual items.
