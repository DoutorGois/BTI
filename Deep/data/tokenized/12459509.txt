An activity-dependent intracellular Ca(2+) increase represents a key signal for the activation of mechanisms involved in synaptic long-term plasticity. Here we present data from confocal microscopic imaging in conjunction with electrophysiological studies, that local 100 Hz stimulations of the hippocampal Schaffer collateral fibers, usually used for the induction of synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP), elicits an intradendritic Ca(2+) rise, that propagates as a short-distance wave within dendrites of CA1-neurons, which could be involved in triggering the dendritic (local signal cascade) machinery of LTP generation. Pharmacological investigations elucidated the coincidental involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate- and of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in the generation of the Ca(2+) wave.
