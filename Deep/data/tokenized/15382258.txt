Previous studies demonstrated that the spiny rat Proechimys guyannensis exhibits resistance to experimental epilepsy. Neural activation was studied in the Proechimys hippocampus, using Fos induction, within 24 h after pilocarpine-induced seizures; neurodegenerative events were investigated in parallel, using FluoroJade B histochemistry. These parameters were selected since pilocarpine-induced limbic epilepsy is known to elicit immediate early gene expression and cell loss in the hippocampus of seizure-prone laboratory rodents. At variance with matched experiments in Wistar rats, pilocarpine injection resulted in Proechimys in seizure episodes that, as previously reported, did not develop into status epilepticus. At 3 h and 8 h after seizure onset, Fos immunoreactivity filled the dentate gyrus of both rat species, and was quite marked in pyramidal cells of the Proechimys Ammon's horn. At 24 h, Fos immunoreactivity dropped in the Wistar hippocampus and persisted in Proechimys. At 8 h and 24 h, FluoroJade-stained neurons were very few in the Proechimys hippocampus, whereas they were abundant in that of Wistar rats. Double immunohistochemistry for Fos and parvalbumin, the protein expressed by fast-spiking hippocampal interneurons, indicated that Fos was induced up to 24 h in the vast majority of parvalbumin-containing cells of the Proechimys hippocampus, and in a minority of these cells in the Wistar hippocampus. The findings demonstrate that early postepileptic neurodegeneration is very limited in the Proechimys hippocampus, in which sustained Fos induction persists for several hours. The findings also indicate that Fos induction and persistence may not correlate with seizure intensity and may not be associated with neuronal death. Finally, the data implicate differential mechanisms of interneuron activity in anti-convulsant and pro-convulsant phenomena.
