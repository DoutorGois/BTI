In previous studies we have demonstrated that raphe grafts, implanted into serotonin-depleted rat hippocampus can restore behavioral and physiological functions impaired by serotonin depletion. Since aging is associated with a reduction in serotonergic functions, we explored the possibility that grafting embryonic raphe tissue will ameliorate age-associated reduction of serotonergic functions in the hippocampus. Aged rats were implanted with E14 embryonic neural tissue, containing the raphe, or part of the parietal cerebral cortex. Three months later, the rats were anesthetized, and the responses of the dentate gyrus to perforant-path stimulation were measured. Serotonin-containing neurons were found in the raphe-grafted hippocampi. No differences were found between the two groups in the volume of the graft in the host brain. Raphe-grafted rats were not different from the cortex-grafted rats in reactivity to perforant path stimulation or in the response to a second of a pair of stimuli to the perforant path. They did, however, express a pronounced commissural inhibition, unlike the cortex-grafted rats. These results are similar to those found previously with a pharmacological enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission. It is suggested that a graft of serotonergic neurons can ameliorate age-associated reduction in serotonergic functions in the hippocampus.
