D-serine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor coagonist predominantly produced by glial cells in the brain and the retina. Whereas a role for D-serine as a modulator of NMDA receptors in neurons has been suggested, its function in glial cells has not been analyzed. We here show that D-serine modulates gene expression in Muller glial cells from the retina through the induction of transcription factor CREB phosphorylation and the expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos. Pharmacological analysis indicates that D-serine effect involves NMDA receptor activation. Comparison of the effect of D-serine in Muller cells, hippocampal astrocytes and hippocampal neurons suggests that D-serine could function as a retinal NMDA receptor coagonist activating functionally relevant transcription factor pathways in glial cells.
