The number of the nerve cells, appearance of Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles and of senile plaques in the hippocampus of 100 female autopsy cases aged 56-101 were compared in relation to age and grade of dementia. The number of nerve cells of granular and pyramidal layers decreased significantly with age, however, the decrease in number did not necessarily correlate with the grade of dementia. Appearance of Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles was increased in grade with age and with grade of dementia of all types. Appearance of senile plaques increased in grade only in cases with dementia of Alzheimer's type, but not in case with cerebrovascular type of dementia.
