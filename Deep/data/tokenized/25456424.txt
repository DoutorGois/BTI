ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Gualou Guizhi decoction (GLGZD) prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine has been reported to have protective effects on ischemic stroke. The present study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of GLGZD on ischemic stroke and explore its mode of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GLGZD was studied on transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion in vivo, as well as on hippocampal primary neuron cultures in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, it was shown that GLGZD treatment for 7 days could ameliorate transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced neurological deficit, histopathology changes and decrease infarct area. Further study demonstrated that GLGZD inhibited over-activation of astrocytes and apoptosis of neurons and GLGZD promoted up-regulation of neuronal specific marker neuron-specific nuclear (NeuN) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) in brain. Moreover, the in vitro study revealed that GLGZD treatment protected against NMDA-induced cell apoptosis and neuronal loss, and promoted up-regulation of neuronal specific marker NeuN. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the present study demonstrates that GLGZD produces a protection in the MCAO model rats via inhibiting over-activation of astrocytes, apoptosis of neurons and up-regulation of neuronal specific marker NeuN and MAP-2. Our study reveals that GLGZD might be a potential neuroprotective agent for stroke and can provide basic data for clinical use.
