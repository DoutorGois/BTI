In neuronal cells, nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and performs various functions including neurotransmission, modulation of nociception and long-term potentiation and memory. Recently, a novel 89-amino acid protein, designated PIN, has been shown to interact specifically with nNOS and inhibit nNOS dimerization. In this report, we investigated the distribution and the correlation of PIN with that of nNOS in various brain regions of rats. Amplified PIN cDNA from brain tissues revealed an open reading frame which is identical to that of human PIN. Northern blotting of brain RNA with PIN cDNA produced two transcripts, a major 0.9 kb and a minor 2.5 kb. Expression of PIN cDNA as a fusion protein in E. coli produced a 10 kDa protein which interacted specifically with pure nNOS in an overlay assay. Immunoblotting of rat brain regions with nNOS antibody demonstrated strong expression in the cerebellum, moderate expression in the cerebral cortex, midbrain, medulla and hippocampus with only weak expression in the spinal cord. By comparison, PIN expression was stronger in the cerebral cortex, midbrain, hippocampus and medulla compared with that of cerebellum and spinal cord. We conclude that PIN interacts strongly with nNOS and is constitutively expressed in various brain regions. The dissimilarity between nNOS and PIN expressions in various brain regions may explain the well known differences in NOS activity between these regions. Our results also suggest that PIN may serve other functions other than nNOS inhibition.
