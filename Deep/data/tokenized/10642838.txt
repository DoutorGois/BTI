Theta burst stimulation (TBS) and primed bursts (PBs) stimulation are among the effective tetanic stimulations for induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Recent studies have indicated that TBS is effective in LTP induction of layer III synapses of neocortex, only if applied to layer IV. However, the possibility of neocortical LTP induction using PBs has not been investigated yet. Sensory deprivation greatly influences the development of neocortex. According to the effect of sensory deprivation on synaptic plasticity of developing neocortex, we studied the induction of LTP by PBs in visual cortical slices of control and dark-reared rats. The results showed that application of PBs to layer IV could effectively induce LTP of layer II/III field potentials. These potentials are consisted of two components: pEPSP1, (population excitatory postsynaptic potential 1) and pEPSP2. In control slices PBs led to selective potentiation of pEPSP2. Visual deprivation increased the incidence of LTP of pEPSP1 and decreased the amount of LTP of pEPSP2. These findings showed that PBs could be used as an effective tetanic stimulation to study the synaptic plasticity in neocortex. The effects of visual deprivation on PBs-induced LTP are consistent with its role in the development of excitatory system in neocortex.
