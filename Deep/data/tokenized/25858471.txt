Futokadsura stem has been traditionally used to dispel wind-damp obstruction syndrome manifested as painful and stiff joints, tendon and muscle spasms, lower back pain, painful knees and pain from external injury. An aqueous extract of Futokadsura stem has previously been found to have neuro-protective effects in vitro. In this study, we aimed to investigate if the Futokadsura stem extract could protect the neuron in the brain of an Abeta-induced Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-like rat model by improving the learning and memory ability of the rats. Learning and memory ability of the rats were measured by the Morris water maze test. Neuronal morphology in the hippocampus was examined by HE staining. Expression levels of Abeta, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and synaptophysin (SYP) were measured by immunofluorescence. Nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels were measured by NO and NOS detecting kit. We found that aqueous extract of Futokadsura stem alleviated Abeta(25-35)-induced impairment of spatial learning and memory in the AD rats. Furthermore, the extract protected the neurons by decreasing the expression of Abeta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 and the content of NO and NOS in the brain, and increasing the expression of SYP in the hippocampus. Our data indicated that aqueous extract of Futokadsura stem improved the learning and memory ability of AD rats. The neuro-protective effect was accomplished probably by depressing inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.
