Bihemispheric transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is thought to upregulate excitability of the primary motor cortex (M1) using anodal stimulation while concurrently downregulating contralateral M1 using cathodal stimulation. This "dual" tDCS method enhances motor learning in healthy subjects and facilitates motor recovery after stroke. However, its impact on motor system activity and connectivity remains unknown. Therefore, we assessed neural correlates of dual and unihemispheric anodal tDCS effects in 20 healthy older subjects in a randomized, sham-controlled study using a cross-over design. Participants underwent tDCS and simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging during a choice reaction time task and at rest. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) allowed us to relate potential functional changes to structural parameters. The resting-state analysis demonstrated that, compared with sham, both dual and anodal tDCS decreased connectivity of right hippocampus and M1 (contralateral to the anode position) while increasing connectivity in the left prefrontal cortex. Notably, dual but not anodal tDCS enhanced connectivity of the left dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, dual tDCS yielded stronger activations in bilateral M1 compared with anodal tDCS when participants used either their left or right hand during the motor task. The corresponding tDCS-induced changes in laterality of activations were related to the microstructural status of transcallosal motor fibers. In conclusion, our results suggest that the impact of bihemispheric tDCS cannot be explained by mere add-on effects of anodal and concurrent cathodal stimulation, but rather by complex network modulations involving interhemispheric interactions and areas associated with motor control in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex.
