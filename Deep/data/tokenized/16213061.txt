Subthreshold electrical stimulation of the amygdala (kindling) activates neuronal pathways increasing the expression of several neuropeptides including thyrotropin releasing-hormone (TRH). Partial kindling enhances TRH expression and the activity or its inactivating ectoenzyme; once kindling is established (stage V), TRH and its mRNA levels are further increased but TRH-binding and pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase II (PPII) activity decreased in epileptogenic areas. To determine whether variations in TRH receptor binding or PPII activity are due to regulation of their synthesis, mRNA levels of TRH receptors (R1, R2) and PPII were semi-quantified by RT-PCR in amygdala, frontal cortex and hippocampus of kindled rats sacrificed at stage II or V. Increased mRNA levels of PPII were found at stage II in amygdala and frontal cortex, and of pro-TRH and TRH-R2, in amygdala and hippocampus. At stage V, pro-TRH mRNA levels increased and those of PPII, decreased in the three regions; TRH-R2 mRNA levels diminished in amygdala and frontal cortex and of TRH-R1 only in amygdala. In situ hybridization analyses revealed, at stage II, enhanced TRH-R1 mRNA levels in dentate gyrus and amygdala while decreased in piriform cortex; those of TRH-R2 increased in amygdala, CA2, dentate gyrus, piriform cortex, thalamus and subiculum and of PPII, in CAs and piriform cortex. In contrast, at stage V decreased expression of TRH-R1 occurred in amygdala, CA2/3, dentate gyrus and piriform cortex; of TRH-R2 in CA2, thalamus and piriform cortex, and of PPII in CA2, and amygdala. The magnitude of changes differed between ipsi and contralateral side. These results support a trans-synaptic modulation of all elements involved in TRH transmission in conditions that stimulate the activity of TRHergic neurons. They show that reported changes in PPII activity or TRH-binding caused by kindling relate to regulation of the expression of TRH receptors and degrading enzyme.
