To examine whether exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) at low levels affect brain function, monoamine concentrations in hippocampus, striatum and brain stem, were investigated in neonatal male rats injected intracranially with BPA at 0-10microgkg(-1). Significant increases of serotonin (5-HT) in hippocampus, 5-HIAA and 5-HIAA/5-HT in brain stem, dopamine (DA) and DOPAC in striatum were observed at 28d after the injection on postnatal day 2. At 7d after the injection, increases in 5-HT and norepinephrine (NE) and decreases in DOPAC and 5-HIAA were observed in hippocampus. To investigate the degradation of BPA in brain, we also measured BPA concentrations of whole neonatal rat brain. Free BPA disappeared from brain tissues within 5h, even when the highest dose (1000microgkg(-1)) was injected. The present results suggest that BPA exposure at lower doses than environmentally relevant levels may have a great impact on monoamine levels in neonatal brain over 28d after its disappearance.
