Slices of various brain regions were prepared from newborn and from 7-day old rats and co-cultured in different combinations. In the majority of co-cultures of septal and hippocampal slices, acetylcholinesterase-positive fibres originating in the septal nuclei invaded the adjacent hippocampal slice. A similar pattern of hippocampal ingrowth by acetylcholinesterase-positive fibres occurred with slices prepared from the nucleus basalis of Meynert and from spinal cord. Septal neurones also projected to cortical slices, an effect which even occurred in the presence of their natural target tissue. In contrast to these massive projections to brain areas which in situ receive cholinergic inputs, no significant acetylcholinesterase-positive fibre ingrowth was observed in tissues which lack major cholinergic afferents in situ (hypothalamus, substantia nigra and cerebellum). These results indicate that under our culture conditions, acetylcholinesterase-positive fibres selectively invade cholinergic target areas. This effect is independent of the brain area from which the cholinergic neurones were derived.
