In cats, there was no apparent difference between the average low thresholds for evoking EEG arousal when stimulating the mesencephalic RF, thalamic CM or some cortical structures (sensorimotor area, inferior part of auditory Ep). Most of other cortical points had much higher thresholds (g. lateralis anterior, g. suprasylvius posterior, g. ectosylvius med. and sup.). The possible role of some cortical and mesencephalic structures in the brain activating mechanisms is discussed.
