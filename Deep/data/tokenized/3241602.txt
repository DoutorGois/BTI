Mongolian gerbils were exposed to 15 min of cerebral ischemia. Quantitative histology was used to establish neuronal damage in the CA1, CA2/3, and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus 2 weeks after the insult. Seven moribund animals were sacrificed earlier to examine whether there is a correlation between hippocampal damage and mortality. Surviving animals had a 86.6% loss of CA1 neurons. In the CA2/3 and CA3 sectors 62.7 and 72.6% of the neurons were preserved. Moribund animals had a further dramatic loss of nerve cells in these sectors, to 14.8 and 20.3%, respectively. The reduction of CA2/3 neurons and survival time were correlated. In addition, gerbils which would later become moribund were found to have a significant increase in plasma osmolarity from 319 to 342 mosm/liter and of hematocrit from 47.4 to 53.9 at day 4 after ischemia.
