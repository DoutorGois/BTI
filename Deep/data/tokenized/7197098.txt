The effect of self-stimulation of the septum on impaired delayed reactions was studied on cats in a state of neurotization. Reduction of intervals between tests from 3-5 min to 30-40 s produced a complex of motor and vegetative reactions testifying to augmentation of emotional stress. This was followed by disturbance of short-term memory of complex perception of the location of food. Self-stimulation of the septum by animals in a state of experimental neurosis caused considerable improvement and then recovery of the maximum of delayed reactions This testifies to the important role of the septum in regulation of the level of emotional stress, and hence, a normal course of higher brain functions.
