The functional role of the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM) was investigated by means of the quantitative autoradiographic 14C-deoxyglucose method. Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was measured bilaterally in 53 discrete brain areas of conscious rats 1 week and 1 month following electrolytic lesion of the VM. There was no difference observed in the LCGU values between the two groups of lesioned animals. In the VM-lesioned rats glucose consumption was decreased in several ipsilateral (pre-frontal, frontal, cingulate, sensorimotor, visual) and in some contralateral (cingulate, sensorimotor, visual) cortical areas. Furthermore, LCGU values were depressed bilaterally in the striatum, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, substantia nigra compacta, superficial layers of the superior colliculus, oculomotor complex, and cerebellar dentate nuclei. Glucose utilization was diminished also in the deep layers of the superior colliculus and in the fastigial nucleus ipsilateral to the lesion. Within the thalamus, glucose metabolism was decreased in several nuclei either bilaterally (reticular, intralaminar, paralamellar mediodorsal) or ipsilaterally (lateroposterior, ventrobasal, ventrolateral, ventroanterior, and medioventral) to the lesion. A significant correlation between the percentage of injured VM and the regional metabolic depression was demonstrated in the areas displaying the most pronounced decrease in LCGU. These results support a widespread influence of the VM on brain function extending beyond the limits of purely motor systems and reveal the consequences of a unilateral lesion of the thalamus on metabolic activity in several contralateral structures.
