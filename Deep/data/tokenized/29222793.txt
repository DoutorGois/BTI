The intrahippocampal injection of amyloid beta peptide (1-42) (Abeta(1-42)) represents one of the most useful animal models of Alzheimer disease. Since none of these available models fully represents the main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease, stereotaxic Abeta(1-42) infusion provides researchers with an in vivo alternative paradigm. When performed by well-trained individuals, this model is the best-suited one for short-term studies focusing on the effects of Abeta(1-42) on a specific brain region or circuitry. Here, we describe all methodological phases of such a model.
