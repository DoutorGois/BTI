The subiculum has a strategic position in controlling hippocampal activity and is now receiving much experimental attention. However, information regarding this structure remains fragmented and there are important gaps in our knowledge between what we know about the subicular architecture and its biological function. In recent years a substantial amount of in vitro experimentation has explored many aspects of the functional organization of the subicular microcircuits. Here we review these recent findings. We aim to identify the rules that govern the operation of subicular microcircuits in vitro and to relate these to the role of the subiculum in the intact brain.
