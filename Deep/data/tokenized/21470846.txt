The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex subserve spatial working memory in rodents. Recent evidence has demonstrated functional interactions between these brain regions in the form of sychronization of oscillatory activity during behavior. The nature of this synchrony and its relationship to behavioral performance suggests an important role in the function of the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.
