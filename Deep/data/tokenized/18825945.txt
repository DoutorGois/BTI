Hippocampal unit activity in the right and left CA1 and CA3 fields was studied in rats divided in two groups by the method of "emotional resonance": the animals which did ("A") and did not stop ("E") crying of a partner rat. The rate of neuronal firing was studied in the state of hunger, satiation, and under exposure to intracranial electrical stimulation of the emotional positive and negative structures of the brain. It was shown that units increasing their activity after satiation prevailed in the CA1 field, whereas, in the CA3 field, the majority of neurons decreased the firing rate under these conditions. Intracranial stimulation, especially positive, increased the rate of firing in both hippocampal fields. Under exposure to emotional stimuli, "A" rats displayed asymmetric unit activity only in the CA1 field, whereas in "E" rats, activity was asymmetric only in the CA3 field. Under these conditions in both groups of animals, the left-side activity was more intense than the right-side activity independently of the emotion sign.
