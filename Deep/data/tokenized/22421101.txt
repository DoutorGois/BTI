Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a neural huntingtin interactor that is widely expressed as a core molecule of the stigmoid body (a neurocytoplasmic inclusion) in the limbic and hypothalamic regions and has putative protective functions against some neurodegenerative diseases (HAP1 protection hypothesis). Although HAP1 has been reported to be intimately associated with several steroid receptors, HAP1-immunoreactive (HAP1-ir) cells remain to be identified in the hippocampus, which is one of the major steroidal targets. In this study, we determined the distribution of hippocampal HAP1-ir cells in light and fluorescence microscopy and characterized their morphological relationships with steroid receptors, markers of adult neurogenesis, and the GABAergic system in adult male and female Wistar rats. HAP1-ir cells, which were sporadically distributed particularly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus and in the interface between the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and stratum radiatum of Ammon's horn, were identified as the "sporadically lurking HAP1-ir (SLH)" cells. The SLH cells showed no clear association with neural progenitor/proliferating or migrating cell markers of adult neurogenesis, such as Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, doublecortin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the SGZ, whereas all the SLH cells expressed a neuronal specific nuclear protein (NeuN). More than 90% of the SLH cells expressed nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) alpha but neither ERbeta nor the androgen receptor, whereas glucocorticoid receptor was differently stained in the SLH cells depending on the antibodies. More than 60% of them exhibited GABA immunoreactivity in the SGZ, suggestive of basket cells, but they were distinct from the ones expressing cholecystokinin or parvalbumin. We conclude that SLH cells, which should be stable against apoptosis due to putative HAP1 protectivity, might be involved in estrogen-dependent maturation, remodeling and activation of hippocampal memory and learning functions via ERalpha and partly through GABAergic regulation.
