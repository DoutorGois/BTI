BALB/c mice were bilaterally implanted with bipolar electrodes either in anterodorsal (ADH) or posteroventral hippocampus (PVH) in order to compare the effects of postsession electrical stimulation on memory processes. For each experiment, 30 s after the end of the first session, the animals were stimulated during 80 s. For both hippocampal regions, the stimulation intensity was half of the afterdischarge threshold value. Control groups were naive, ADH and PVH implanted non-stimulated animals. Different appetitive and aversive tasks were used. Subseizure stimulation never created a deficit. Depending on the region of the hippocampus stimulated and on the learning task, a retention enhancement was eventually observed. These data are in agreement with the involvement of hippocampus in initial stages of memory consolidation. Further, the subseizure stimulation permitted a functional dissociation between the two hippocampal regions. Both regions seemed involved in the integration of information, but the anterodorsal part would be rather related to behavioral inhibition, while the posteroventral part would have the capacity to induce an arousal state allowing behavioral flexibility.
