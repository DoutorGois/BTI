Oxidative stress is related to the development of central nervous system diseases involving memory processes. Cholinergic system and memory processes are disrupted by ozone exposure. In rats, ozone induces motor disturbances and memory deficits as well as biochemical changes in brain regions related to memory processes. In this work, we analyzed the effect of chronic tibolone (TIB) administration in central nervous system, specifically the content of choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase, acetylcholine and oxidative stress markers in the hippocampus of male rats exposed to ozone. Our results reveal a neuroprotective effect of TIB treatment on neuronal damage induced by chronic ozone exposure. Furthermore, we suggest that TIB can prevent memory deficits by providing a protective effect against oxidative stress and the cholinergic system disruption induced by ozone exposure. Together, these findings present a potential neuroprotective effect of TIB in processes linked to memory deficits induced by aging or neurodegenerative diseases.
