To understand the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the regulation of gene expression, methods are needed for the in vivo identification of RNA-protein interactions. We have developed the peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-assisted identification of RBP technology to enable the identification of proteins that complex with a target RNA in vivo. Specific regions of the 3' and 5' UTRs of ankylosis mRNA were targeted by antisense PNAs transported into cortical neurons by the cell-penetrating peptide transportan 10. An array of proteins was isolated in complex with or near the targeted regions of the ankylosis mRNA through UV-induced crosslinking of the annealed PNA-RNA-RBP complex. The first evidence for pharmacological modulation of these specific protein-RNA associations was observed. These data show that the PNA-assisted identification of the RBP technique is a reliable method to rapidly identify proteins interacting in vivo with the target RNA.
