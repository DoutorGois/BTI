OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune-prone B-cell activating factor transgenic mice, a mouse model of systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren's syndrome exhibit neuroinflammation, anxiety-like phenotype, deficit in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and impaired neurogenesis-dependent and neurogenesis-independent dentate gyrus long-term potentiation. Given that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids regulate hippocampal plasticity and inflammatory responses, we investigated whether n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids-enriched diet might prevent age-dependent hippocampal changes in B-cell activating factor transgenic mice. METHODS: B-cell activating factor transgenic mice were fed for 12 weeks with either n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids-enriched or control diet and we tested the effect of this dietary supplementation on hippocampal inflammation, progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis-dependent and neurogenesis-independent long-term potentiation. RESULTS: Dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly decreased hippocampal microglial activation and increased the density of bromodeoxyuridine and doublecortin-positive newly-formed cells in the subventricular zone of hippocampus. Furthermore, B-cell activating factor transgenic mice fed with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids-enriched diet displayed normal long-term potentiation at the medial perforant pathway/dentate gyrus connections. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that n-3 fatty acids prevent neuroinflammation and deficits of hippocampal plasticity in B-cell activating factor transgenic mice and suggest that increased n-3 fatty acids intake might represent a potential therapeutic option to prevent neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with autoimmune diseases.
