We have designed and synthesized novel piperazine compounds with low lipophilicity as sigma1 receptor ligands. 1-(4-Fluorobenzyl)-4-[(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)methyl]piperazine (10) possessed a low nanomolar sigma1 receptor affinity and a high selectivity toward the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (>2000-fold), sigma2 receptors (52-fold), and adenosine A2A, adrenergic alpha2, cannabinoid CB1, dopamine D1, D2L, gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA), NMDA, melatonin MT1, MT2, and serotonin 5-HT1 receptors. The corresponding radiotracer [(18)F]10 demonstrated high brain uptake and extremely high brain-to-blood ratios in biodistribution studies in mice. Pretreatment with the selective sigma1 receptor agonist SA4503 significantly reduced the level of accumulation of the radiotracer in the brain. No radiometabolite of [(18)F]10 was observed to enter the brain. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed suitable kinetics and a high specific binding of [(18)F]10 to sigma1 receptors in rat brain. Ex vivo autoradiography showed a reduced level of binding of [(18)F]10 in the cortex and hippocampus of the senescence-accelerated prone (SAMP8) compared to that of the senescence-accelerated resistant (SAMR1) mice, indicating the potential dysfunction of sigma1 receptors in Alzheimer's disease.
