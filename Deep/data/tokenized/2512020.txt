The afferent connections of septal nuclei from the brain areas relating to pain in the rat were studied with HRP, WGA-HRP and CB-HRP methods. Some brain areas relating to pain, for instance, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, hypothalamus, lateral habenular nucleus, amygdaloid complex, hippocampus and cingulate cortex, project to medial septal nucleus, lateral nucleus and diagonal band nucleus. The many areas relating to acupuncture analgesia project to septal nuclei, it is possible that the septal nuclei participate in regulating pain in the central nervous system.
