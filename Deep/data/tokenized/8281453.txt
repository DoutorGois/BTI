Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic structure represents a plastic feature of the neuron, although the plastic nature of newly formed and existing adult synapses has not yet been fully characterized. Following ipsilateral entorhinal cortical lesions, the rat dentate gyrus offers an excellent model for studying synaptogenesis and plasticity in the adult central nervous system. Unilateral entorhinal lesions were performed in young adult male rats. Synaptic counts and structural features were quantified at 3, 6, 10, 15, and 30 days post-lesion. The lesions resulted in an 88% synaptic loss in the denervated dentate middle molecular layer, which was followed by a period of rapid synaptogenesis. Synaptic element size decreased during the period of maximal synaptogenesis, which was associated with a peak in the presence of non-vesicular and perforated synapses. Following this period, synapses showed a gradual increase in the size of their pre- and postsynaptic elements. These data support the suggestion that newly formed adult synapses have smaller synaptic components than existing adult synapses (resembling synapses seen during development), and increase in size over time with usage. The results are discussed in terms of synaptic structural development and plasticity in the adult central nervous system.
