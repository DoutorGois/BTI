Over 90% of all spontaneously active hippocampal pyramidal cells in freely moving rats signal the animal's spatial position by reliably changing their firing rate each time the animal enters a given place within an environment. This place-field activity exhibits plasticity when specific environmental variables are manipulated. Indeed, the hippocampus is perhaps best known as a system that serves as a model of neuronal plasticity. Although place-field activity has previously been examined only over relatively short experimental sessions, this behavioral correlate of hippocampal functional activity has been assumed to exhibit stability rather than plasticity in the absence of environmental changes. The present study shows that hippocampal neurons have stable place-field correlates that persist over very long periods of time. Single-unit activity was chronically recorded from the dorsal hippocampus of rats foraging repeatedly in a stable spatial environment. The location of the place fields of all units were stable over all time periods tested, for intervals up to 153 days in duration. The consistency of the information conveyed by this single-unit activity in a fixed spatial environment indicates that stability of neuronal activity may be as important as plasticity in the integrated processing of information that occurs in the hippocampus and throughout the nervous system.
