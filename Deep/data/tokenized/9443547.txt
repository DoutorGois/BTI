We investigated the effect of successive administrations of SA4503 (1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine dihydrochloride), a novel cognitive enhancer with high affinity and selectivity for the sigma1 receptor subtype, on the cortical cholinergic dysfunction-induced impairment of the spatial learning performance in the Morris water maze (MWM) task in rats. The impairment of the spatial learning performance was produced by the ibotenic acid-induced lesion of the basal forebrain (BF) area in rats. Escape latencies to find the platform during the training trials of the MWM task were significantly prolonged in the BF-lesioned rats compared with the sham-operated rats. Daily treatment with SA4503 (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, P.O./day) for 13 days ameliorated this learning deficit. In the probe trial, BF-lesioned rats reduced the number of times each rat crossed the former platform location during the training trials (goal area) in comparison with sham-operated rats. Successive administrations of SA4503 (0.25 mg/kg, P.O./day) also significantly increased the BF lesion-induced reduction of the number of times each rat crossed the goal area. These results suggest that the successive administrations of SA4503 attenuate the impairment of the spatial learning performance in rats with cortical cholinergic dysfunction, and that SA4503 is useful as a therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease.
