Disturbances in neuronal calcium homeostasis have been implicated in a variety of neuropathological conditions, including cerebral ischemia, hypoglycemia, and epilepsy, and possibly constitute part of the cell death process associated with chronic neurodegenerative disorders. We investigated if endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores participate in neuronal death triggered by moderate glycolysis inhibition induced by iodoacetate, an inhibitor of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, in cultured hippocampal neurons. Results show that exposure to iodoacetate leads to a slow partial decrease in cell survival, which is significantly prevented in the absence of Ca(2+) or in the presence of the calcium chelator BAPTA-AM. Treatment with caffeine and a low (1 microM) concentration of ryanodine, which activates the ryanodine receptor (RyR), exacerbates neuronal death, whereas dantrolene and 25 microM ryanodine, which antagonizes RyR, prevents damage. Xestospongin C (XeC), an antagonist of the inositol-3-phosphate (IP(3)) receptor (IP(3)R) also prevents neuronal damage. Inhibitors of the ER calcium ATPase (sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase; SERCA) have no effect. The decrease in ATP levels induced by iodoacetate is potentiated by caffeine and prevented by dantrolene. Although only a slight increase in glutamate extracellular levels is observed 3.5 hr after iodoacetate exposure, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, MK-801, efficiently prevents neuronal damage. Taken together, the data suggest that neuronal death induced during moderate glycolysis inhibition involves calcium influx through NMDA receptors and calcium release from intracellular ER stores. These results might be relevant to the understanding the mechanisms involved in neuronal damage related to aging and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, which have been associated with decreased glucose metabolism.
