This study investigated whether serotonergic lesion may affect density, sensitivity, and plasticity of muscarinic receptors in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) in rats produced a 90% reduction in cortical and hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) contents. In these brain areas, the 5,7-DHT lesion did not affect the overall density of muscarinic receptors or those of M1 and non-M1 muscarinic receptor subtypes as assayed using [3H]N-methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS), [3H]pirenzepine, and [3H]NMS in the presence of pirenzepine, respectively. In addition, the binding of the muscarinic agonist [3H]oxotremorine-M (OXO-M), taken as an indirect index of coupling efficiency of non-M1 receptors with G-proteins, did not change significantly in cortex and hippocampus of 5,7-DHT-lesioned rats. Similarly, carbachol-induced accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (InPs) in hippocampal miniprisms showed no significant differences between tissues from 5,7-DHT-lesioned and sham-operated rats. In sham-operated rats, an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine (10 mg/kg once daily) during 21 days caused an increased density of [3H]NMS binding sites in cortex (+20%) and hippocampus (+26%). This up-regulation was restricted to non-M1 receptors subtypes. In 5,7-DHT-lesioned rats, chronic scopolamine failed to modify significantly the density of cortical or hippocampal M1 or non-M1 receptors. These results suggest 1) that 5-HT denervation did not affect the density and sensitivity of muscarinic receptors and 2) that the ability of cortical and hippocampal non-M1 receptors to up-regulate following repeated injection of scopolamine requires the integrity of 5-HT neurons terminating in these brain structures.
