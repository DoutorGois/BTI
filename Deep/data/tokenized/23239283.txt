Evidence from different laboratories using cell culture and in vivo model systems indicates that histone deacetylase-4 (HDAC4) plays an essential role in maintaining neuronal survival. Indeed, HDAC4 null knockout mice, which die within 2 weeks of birth, display cerebellar degeneration, whereas RNAi-mediated knockdown of HDAC4 expression in the retina of normal mice leads to apoptosis of retinal neurons. As a step toward analyzing the role of HDAC4 in the regulation of neuronal survival in more detail, we generated two separate lines of conditional knockout mice by breeding HDAC4-flox mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase through a Thy1 or nestin promoter. Surprisingly, both Thy1-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice, in which HDAC4 is ablated in neurons of the cortex and hippocampus, as well as Nes-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice, in which HDAC4 is ablated in neural progenitor cells of the CNS, appear normal at birth, have normal body weight, are fertile, and perform normally in locomotor activity assays. Histological analysis of the brains of Nes-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice revealed no obvious abnormalities in cytoarchitecture. Immunohistological analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin also showed no discernible defects. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling staining showed no difference in the level of neuronal death in the cortex and cerebellum of Nes-Cre/HDAC4(-/-) mice compared with controls. These results indicate that neurons are less dependent on HDAC4 expression for their survival than previously believed and suggest that neuronal death observed in HDAC4 null knockout mice and after RNAi injection may result from HDAC4 deficiency in nonneural cells.
