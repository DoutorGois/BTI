To study the effect of glutamate on the intracellular calcium signal of pure cultured rat astrocytes and the role of NMDA and AMPA receptors in the procedure, the change of calcium signal was investigated by monitoring the fluctuation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) on the basis of Fura-2 single cell fluorescent ratio (F345/F380). The changes in the effect of glutamate on the intracellular calcium signal were observed after blockage of NMDA and (or) AMPA receptors. It was found that L-glutamate could induce an increased [Ca2+]i in most of the cells in concentration- and time-dependent manner. D-(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP-5, a selective antagonist of the NMDA receptor) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX, a selective antagonist of the AMPA receptor) could abolish the effects of NMDA and AMPA respectively. The treatment of D-AP-5 and CNQX simultaneously or respectively could attenuate the effect of L-glutamate at varying degrees. All these indicated that glutamate could modulate intracellular Ca2+ of pure cultured rat astrocytes through different pathways. The activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors took part in the complex mechanisms.
