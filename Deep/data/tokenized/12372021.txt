We have determined the properties of seizures induced in vitro during the first postnatal days using intact rat cortico-hippocampal formations (CHFs) and extracellular recordings. Two main patterns of activity were generated by nominally Mg2+-free ACSF in hippocampal and cortical regions: ictal-like events (ILEs) and late recurrent interictal discharges (LRDs). They were elicited at distinct developmental periods and displayed different pharmacological properties. ILEs were first observed in P1 CHFs 52 +/- 7 min after application of low-Mg2+ ACSF (frequency 1.5 +/- 0.3 h-1, duration 86 +/- 3 s). There is a progressive age-dependent maturation of ILEs characterized by a decrease in their onset and an increase in their frequency and duration. ILEs were abolished by d-APV and Mg2+ ions. From P7, ILEs were followed by LRDs that appeared 89 +/- 8 min after application of low-Mg2+ ACSF (frequency approximately 1 Hz, duration 0.66 s, amplitude 0.31 +/- 0.03 mV). LRDs were no longer sensitive to d-APV or Mg2+ ions and persisted for at least 24 h in low-Mg2+ or in normal ACSF. ILEs and LRDs were synchronized in limbic and cortical regions with 10-40 ms latency between the onsets of seizures. Using a double chamber that enables independent superfusion of two interconnected CHFs, we report that ILEs and LRDs generated in one CHF propagated readily to the other one that was being kept in ACSF. Therefore, at a critical period of brain development, recurrent seizures induce a permanent form of hyperactivity in intact brain structures and this preparation provides a unique opportunity to study the consequences of seizures at early developmental stages.
