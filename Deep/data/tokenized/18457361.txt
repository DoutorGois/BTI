To investigate whether HT008-1, a prescription used in traditional Korean medicine to treat mental and physical weakness, has a neuroprotective effect on a rat model of global brain ischemia and an enhancing effect against memory deficit following ischemia. Global brain ischemia was induced for 10 min by using 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO). HT008-1 was orally administered at doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg respectively twice at 0 and 90 min after ischemia. The effect on memory deficit was investigated by using a Y-maze neurobehavioral test 4 days after brain ischemia, and the effect on neuronal damage was measured 7 days after ischemia. The mechanism of action was studied immunohistochemically using an anti-CD11b (OX-42) antibody. The oral administration of HT008-1 at 100 and 300 mg/kg significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal cell death by 49% and 53%, respectively, compared with a vehicle-treated group, and also improved spatial memory function in the Y-maze test. Immunohistochemically, HT008-1 inhibited OX-42 expression in the hippocampus. The effects of HT008-1 were more pronounced than those of its individual herb components. The herbal mixture HT008-1 protects the most vulnerable CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and enhances spatial memory function against global brain ischemia; an anti-inflammatory effect may be one of the mechanisms of action.
