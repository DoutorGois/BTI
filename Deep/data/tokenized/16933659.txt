The hallucinogenic "designer drug" known as Foxy or Methoxy Foxy and formally know as 5-Methoxy-N,N-di(iso)propyltryptamine hydrochloride (5-MeO-DIPT) is rapidly gaining popularity among recreational users. However, little is known about the consequences of its use on neuropsychological development or behavior. During one of two adolescent periods, the rats were given repeated injections of either saline or 5 mg/kg of 5-MeO-DIPT. Once the animals reached 80 days of age, they were trained and tested on a number of tasks designed to assess the effects of 5-MeO-DIPT, if any, on memory tasks with spatial components that presumably involve declarative memory systems and on a nonspatial task that is considered sensitive to disruptions in nondeclarative memory. With one exception, both the 5-MeO-DIPT- and saline-treated rats were able to master the spatial navigation tests at comparable rates. However, the performance of the drug-treated rats was markedly inferior to that of the control animals on a response-learning task, suggesting a lack of flexibility in adapting their responses to changing task demands. This could indicate reductions in serotonin activity in the forebrain similar to the effects of studied drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), suggesting 5-MeO-DIPT may act as a toxin compromising serotoninergic systems in the brain.
