In this issue of Neuron, record from synaptically coupled pairs of CA3 neurons to closely examine the induction of synaptic depression at a small number of identified synapses. The authors provide convincing evidence that the activation history of a synapse determines both the ability of a synapse to depress and the mechanism of depression.
