Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a member of the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide gene family (VIP) that was originally isolated from rat hypothalamus. The high affinity PACAP receptor, PAC1, is expressed in the basal forebrain area of adult, as well as developing rat brain. Hippocampus, a targeting area of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, contains PACAP. Thus, hippocampal-derived PACAP may have an effect on basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Indeed, we have reported that PACAP showed neurotrophic effects on these neurons in embryonic and early postnatal culture. Here we report that PACAP has a neurotrophic effect on adult cholinergic neurons in culture. PACAP increases the number of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactive neurons about 2-fold. A similar effect was observed on treatment with cAMP analogue but not nerve growth factor. PACAP also improved the survival and neurite outgrowth of total neurons. These results indicate that PACAP acts as a neurotrophic factor even on adult neurons in vitro.
