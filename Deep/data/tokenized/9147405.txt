Abnormality of cytoskeletal proteins is closely related to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. As neurofilament proteins are major cytoskeletal components of neurons, abnormality of neurofilaments is proposed in brain with Alzheimer's disease. Free-floating sections of the hippocampus with Alzheimer's disease were studied immunohistochemically, using a polyclonal antibody specifically bound to the tail region of neurofilament L (NF-L). In brains with early onset type of Alzheimer's disease, many neurons and dystrophic neurites were labeled by the antibody, while these observations were not seen in either brains with late onset type or control brains. Double immunohistochemical staining of NF-L and tau protein demonstrated that abnormal deposition of NF-L was not always accompanied with that of tau protein, indicating that the abnormal deposition of NF-L might not occur in parallel with that of tau protein. These observations suggest the involvement of neurofilament proteins on the pathology of Alzheimer's disease in a different way than tau protein.
