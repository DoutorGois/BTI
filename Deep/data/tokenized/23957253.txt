BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Explorations into the heterogeneous population of native GABA type A receptors (GABAA Rs) and the physiological functions governed by the multiple GABAA R subtypes have for decades been hampered by the lack of subtype-selective ligands. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The functional properties of the orthosteric GABAA receptor ligand 5-(4-piperidyl)-3-isothiazolol (Thio-4-PIOL) have been investigated in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. KEY RESULTS: Thio-4-PIOL displayed substantial partial agonist activity at the human extrasynaptic GABAA R subtypes expressed in Xenopus oocytes, eliciting maximal responses of up to approximately 30% of that of GABA at alpha5 beta3 gamma2S , alpha4 beta3 delta and alpha6 beta3 delta and somewhat lower efficacies at the corresponding alpha5 beta2 gamma2S , alpha4 beta2 delta and alpha6 beta2 delta subtypes (maximal responses of 4-12%). In contrast, it was an extremely low efficacious agonist at the alpha1 beta3 gamma2S , alpha1 beta2 gamma2S , alpha2 beta2 gamma2S , alpha2 beta3 gamma2S , alpha3 beta2 gamma2S and alpha3 beta3 gamma2S GABAA Rs (maximal responses of 0-4%). In concordance with its agonism at extrasynaptic GABAA Rs and its de facto antagonism at the synaptic receptors, Thio-4-PIOL elicited robust tonic currents in electrophysiological recordings on slices from rat CA1 hippocampus and ventrobasal thalamus and antagonized phasic currents in hippocampal neurons. Finally, the observed effects of Thio-4-PIOL in rat tests of anxiety, locomotion, nociception and spatial memory were overall in good agreement with its in vitro and ex vivo properties. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The diverse signalling characteristics of Thio-4-PIOL at GABAA Rs represent one of the few examples of a functionally subtype-selective orthosteric GABAA R ligand reported to date. We propose that Thio-4-PIOL could be a useful pharmacological tool in future studies exploring the physiological roles of native synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA Rs.
