Though all in vitro models of gamma frequency network oscillations are critically dependent on GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission little is known about the specific role played by different subtypes of GABAA receptor. Strong expression of the alpha5 subunit of the GABAA receptor is restricted to few brain regions, amongst them the hippocampal dendritic layers. Receptors containing this subunit may be expressed on the extrasynaptic membrane of principal cells and can mediate a tonic GABAA conductance. Using hippocampal slices of wild-type (WT) and alpha5-/- mice we investigated the role of alpha5 subunits in the generation of kainate-induced gamma frequency oscillations (20-80 Hz). The change in power of the oscillations evoked in CA3 by increasing network drive (kainate, 50-400 nm) was significantly greater in alpha5-/- than in WT slices. However, the change in frequency of gamma oscillations with increasing network drive seen in WT slices was absent in alpha5-/- slices. Raising the concentration of extracellular GABA by bathing slices in the GABA transaminase inhibitor vigabatrin and blocking uptake with tiagabine reduced the power of gamma oscillations more in WT slices than alpha5-/- slices (43%versus 15%). The data suggest that loss of this GABAA receptor subunit alters the dynamic profile of gamma oscillations to changes in network drive, possibly via actions of GABA at extrasynaptic receptors.
