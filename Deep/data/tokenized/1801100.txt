The dopamine system in weaver mutant mice, a model of cerebellar atrophy, was studied. Dopamine levels of 6-week-old weaver mice were 37%, 44%, 34%, and 41% of levels in age-matched controls in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, septal region and striatum, respectively. Noradrenaline levels did not differ from controls. This study shows that weaver mice have specific deficiencies in the dopamine system.
