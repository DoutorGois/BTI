Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently suffer from dexterous deficits impeding activities of daily living. There is controversy whether impaired fine motor skill may stem from limb kinetic apraxia (LKA) rather than bradykinesia. Based on classical models of limb praxis LKA is thought to result when premotor transmission of time-space information of skilled movements to primary motor representations is interrupted. Therefore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we tested the hypothesis that dexterous deficits in PD are associated with altered activity and connectivity in left parieto-premotor praxis network. Whole-brain analysis of fMRI activity during a task for LKA (coin rotation) showed increased activation of superior and inferior parietal lobule (SPL, IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (vPM) in PD patients compared to controls. For bradykinesia (assessed by finger tapping) a decreased fMRI activity could be detected in patients. Additionally, psychophysical interaction analysis showed increased functional connectivity between IPL and the posterior hippocampi in patients with PD. By contrast, functional connectivity to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was decreased in patients with PD compared to controls. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that dexterous deficits in PD were associated with enhanced fMRI activation of the left praxis network upstream to primary motor areas, mirroring a neural correlate for the behavioral dissociation of LKA and bradykinesia. Furthermore, the findings suggest that patients recruit temporal areas of motor memory as an attempt to compensate for impaired motor skills. Finally, dysexecutive function may contribute to the deficit.
