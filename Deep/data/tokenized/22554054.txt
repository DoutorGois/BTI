BACKGROUND INFORMATION: PIX proteins are exchange factors for Rac and Cdc42 GTPases that are differentially expressed in the brain, where they are implicated in neuronal morphogenesis. The PIX family includes the two members alphaPIX and betaPIX, and the gene of alphaPIX is mutated in patients with intellectual disability. RESULTS: We have analysed the expression of PIX proteins in the developing brain and addressed their role during early hippocampal neuron development. Mass spectrometry identified several betaPIX isoforms and a major p75 alphaPIX isoform in brain and hippocampal cultures. PIX proteins expression increased with time during neuronal differentiation in vitro. The PIX partners GIT1 and GIT2 are also found in brain and their expression was increased during neuronal differentiation. We found that alphaPIX, but not betaPIX, was required for proper hippocampal neuron differentiation, since silencing of alphaPIX specifically hampered dendritogenesis and axonal branching. Interestingly, the depletion of GIT2 but not GIT1 mimicked the phenotype observed after alphaPIX knock-down. Over-expression of alphaPIX specifically enhanced dendritic branching, while both alphaPIX and betaPIX over-expression affected axonal morphology. Again, only over-expression of GIT2, but not GIT1, affected neuritic morphology. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that alphaPIX and GIT2 are required for neuronal differentiation, and suggest that they are part of the same pathway, while GIT1 and betaPIX are dispensable for early hippocampal neurons development.
