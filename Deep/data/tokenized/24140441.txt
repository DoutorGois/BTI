To explore the effect of rhynchophylline (Rhy) on the expression of p-CREB and c-Fos in the striatum and hippocampal CA1 area of methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) rat, methamphetamine (2 mg/kg) was injected to rats and the conditioned place preference was observed in these rats treated with or without Rhy. An immunohistochemistry assay was used to determine the expression of p-CREB and c-Fos in the striatum and hippocampal CA1 area. Methamphetamine induced significant behavior alteration in CPP, while after pretreatment with rhynchophylline or ketamine, the time of staying in methamphetamine-paired compartment of rats was significantly reduced. Methamphetamine also increased the number of p-CREB positive cells in the striatum and hippocampal CA1 zone, as well as p-Fos positive cells. However, the compound Rhy could attenuate the effect. These findings show that Rhy can suppress the acquisition of CPP in rats induced by methamphetamine and the action may be related with the reduced expression of p-CREB and p-Fos in the striatum and hippocampus.
