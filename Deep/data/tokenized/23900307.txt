Biochanin-A (BCA), a potent phytoconstituent, has been previously used as an antitumour, a dopaminergic neuron protective agent, an antioxidant, an anticholinergic and on other pharmacological activities including neuroprotection. The present study was aimed to evaluate the behavioural and neurochemical evidence of BCA in cognitive-deficit mice in scopolamine challenged and natural aged-induced amnesia models in young and aged mice, respectively. BCA has exhibited decrease in the transfer latency and increase in step through latency significantly (p < 0.001) in scopolamine-treated and natural aged mice of exteroceptive behavioural models such as elevated plus maze and passive shock avoidance paradigm, respectively. A decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity of whole brain was seen in scopolamine and aged mice with standard piracetam (Pira; p < 0.001) and BCA in dose-dependent manner. The antioxidant property of BCA was proven by increase in GSH (p < 0.01) and decrease in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level significantly in a scopolamine-challenged and aged mice. The scopolamine-treated mice exhibited significant (p < 0.01) increase in the content of noradrenalin and dopamine, which is a sign of dementia, and these excess increased neurotransmitters were reversed by BCA 40 mg kg(-1) (p < 0.05), BCA 20 mg kg(-1) (p > 0.05), BCA 10 mg kg(-1) (p < 0.05) and standard Pira (p < 0.05) when compared with scopolamine group. Furthermore, in histopathology of hippocampus, the Pira and BCA-treated mice were protected from the formation of pyknotic neurons, increases in the viable cells count and decreases in the number of degenerative cells compared with the scopolamine group. Hence, BCA could be potential enough for the betterment of Alzheimer's disease.
