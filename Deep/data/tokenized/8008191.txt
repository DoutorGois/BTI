Behavioral and immunocytochemical techniques were used to study the effects of adrenal medulla grafts implanted in hippocampus--after lesion of this structure--on the memory capacities of rats. Performances of the grafted rats in the radial maze test were significantly improved and, in some aspects, fully restored. On the other hand, grafts had no significant effects on a one-trial spatial recognition test and impaired object recognition. Immunocytochemical identification showed that the grafts contained chromaffin cells with a choline acetyltransferase stainings while, in parallel, phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase stainings seemed to be decreased. Cholinergic innervation was established between the graft and the host hippocampus. A likely interpretation of this complex pattern of results is that the functional effects of the grafts depended on the arousal level induced by the behavioral task. At the neurobiological level, these effects probably set into play an interaction between opioid, catecholaminergic and cholinergic factors. Our results may contribute to the clarification of the problem of specificity of functional effects of intracerebral grafts as well as the problem of hippocampal role in learning and memory.
