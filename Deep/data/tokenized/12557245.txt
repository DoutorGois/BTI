The effects were investigated of a partially purified subfraction (FS-1) isolated from Delphinium denudatum on sustained repetitive firing (SRF) of cultured neonatal rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons. The blockade of sustained repetitive firing is one of the basic mechanisms of antiepileptic drugs at the cellular level. Using the whole cell current-clamp technique, sustained repetitive firing was elicited in pyramidal neurons under study by a depolarizing pulse of 500 ms duration, 0.3 Hz and 0.1-0.6 nA current strength. FS-1 (0.01-0.06 mg/mL) reduced the number of action potentials per pulse in a dose-dependent manner until no action potentials were elicited for the remainder of the pulse. There was a corresponding use-dependent reduction in amplitude and Vmax of action potentials. The Vmax of action potential 1 exhibited a dose-dependent reduction. At a dose of 0.06 mg/mL FS-1 reduced Vmax to 29%-38% and amplitude to 16%-20 % of the control values. The blockade of sustained repetitive firing by FS-1 was reversed by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential (-65 to -75 mV) while depolarization of the membrane potential (-53 mV to -48 mV) potentiated the block. The results suggest that FS-1 blocks sustained repetitive firing in hippocampal neurons in a use-dependent and voltage-dependent manner similar to the prototype anticonvulsant drug, phenytoin. However, unlike phenytoin, which binds preferably to the inactive state, the compounds present in FS-1 also interacted with the resting state of the Na+ channels by reducing Vmax of action potential 1. The results indicate that the partially purified FS-1 subfraction of Delphinium denudatum contains a potent anticonvulsant compound.
