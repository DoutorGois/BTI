Pubertal and adolescent exposure to cannabinoids is associated with enduring alterations in anxiety and memory. However, periadolescence virtually remains unexplored. Here, we measured anxiety in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) in adult Wistar rats treated at periadolescence (P28-P38) with the cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 (CP) (0.4 mg/kg; 2 ml/kg i.p., 1 daily injection), and we also defined their recognition memory in the novel object paradigm and spatial learning and memory in the water maze. Additionally, we measured the expression of hippocampal PSA-NCAM (Polysialic Acid-Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule) and long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as, given their role in mnemonic processing, the levels of plasma corticosterone and estradiol. We found that CP had no robust effects on anxiety or in recognition memory. In the water maze, only a slight decreased percentage of failed trials in the reference memory task and an improvement in an indirect index of attention were observed. However, we detected an up-regulation of hippocampal PSA-NCAM expression, only in CP-males, although this effect was not related to changes in LTP. No hormonal alterations were evident. Based on our data, minimal long-term effects on anxiety, learning and memory appear to result from cannabinoid exposure during the periadolescent period.
