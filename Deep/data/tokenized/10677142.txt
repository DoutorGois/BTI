To determine the antioxidant effects of taurine on changes in memory and lipid peroxidation levels in brain caused by exposure to ozone, we carried out two experiments. In the first experiment, 150 rats were separated into three experimental blocks (young, mature, and old) with five groups each and received one of the following treatments: control, taurine, ozone, taurine before ozone, and taurine after ozone. Ozone exposure was 0.7-0.8 ppm for 4 h and taurine was administered ip at 43 mg/kg, after or before ozone exposure. Subsequently, rats were tested in passive avoidance conditioning. In the second experiment, samples from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum were obtained from 60 rats (young and old), using the same treatments with 1 ppm ozone. Results show both an impairment in short-term and long-term memory with ozone and an improvement with taurine after ozone exposure, depending on age. In contrast to young rats, old rats showed peroxidation in all control groups and an improvement in memory with taurine. When taurine was applied before ozone, we found high peroxidation levels in the frontal cortex of old rats and the hippocampus of young rats; in the striatum, peroxidation caused by ozone was blocked when taurine was applied either before or after ozone exposure.
