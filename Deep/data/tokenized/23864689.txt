NG2 cells are equipped with transmitter receptors and receive direct synaptic input from glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. The functional impact of these neuron-glia synapses is still unclear. Here, we combined functional and molecular techniques to analyze properties of GABA(A) receptors in NG2 cells of the juvenile mouse hippocampus. GABA activated slowly desensitizing responses in NG2 cells, which were mimicked by muscimol and inhibited by bicuculline. To elucidate the subunit composition of the receptors we tested its pharmacological properties. Coapplication of pentobarbital, benzodiazepines, and zolpidem all significantly increased the GABA-evoked responses. The presence of small tonic currents indicated the presence of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. To further analyze the subunit expression, single cell transcript analysis was performed subsequent to functional characterization of NG2 cells. The subunits alpha1, alpha2, beta3, gamma1, and gamma2 were most abundantly expressed, matching properties resulting from pharmacological characterization. Importantly, lack of the gamma2-subunit conferred a high Zn(2)(+) sensitivity to the GABA(A) receptors of NG2 cells. Judging from the zolpidem sensitivity, postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in NG2 cells contain the gamma2-subunit, in contrast to extrasynaptic receptors, which were not modulated by zolpidem. To determine the effect of GABA(A) receptor activation on membrane potential, perforated patch recordings were obtained from NG2 cells. In the current-clamp mode, GABA depolarized the cells to approximately -30 mV, indicating a higher intracellular Cl(-) concentration ( approximately 50 mM) than previously reported. GABA-induced depolarization in NG2 cells might trigger Ca(2)(+) influx through voltage-activated Ca(2)(+) channels.
