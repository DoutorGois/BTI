Previous in vivo microdialysis studies have shown increased spontaneous release of 5-HT in the hippocampus of adult behaving rats exposed to prenatal protein malnutrition. Furthermore, behavioral studies have shown that adolescent rats (PD30) that have been prenatally protein malnourished demonstrate an increased sensitivity to the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Given this altered sensitivity to benzodiazepines in adolescent malnourished rats, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the increased release of 5-HT in the hippocampus is present in adolescent rats and that this release is modulated by CDP. An altered release of 5-HT at PD30 would suggest an early developmental change associated with prenatal malnutrition. PD30 rats were implanted with microdialysis probes into the dorsal hippocampus and 5-HT release was monitored before and after administration of CDP. As previously reported in adult rats, release of 5-HT was significantly elevated in the dorsal hippocampus of PD30 rats as compared to well-nourished 30-day-old controls. Administration of CDP did not affect the release of 5-HT from the hippocampal formation of well-nourished rats but significantly decreased the elevated release of 5-HT in the malnourished rats. Following CDP, 5-HT release in the malnourished rats was at the same levels as release in well-nourished animals. Benzodiazepines have been reported to decrease extracellular 5-HT in stressed rats but not in unstressed rats. Thus, the elevated 5-HT release in the hippocampus in rats exposed to prenatal protein malnutrition may be associated with an increased response to stress. These data support other data that prenatal protein malnutrition alters the response to stressful stimuli possibly through changes in the GABAergic and/or serotonergic systems.
