This paper estimates the accuracy of hippocampal subfield alignment via shape-based normalization. Evaluation takes place in postmortem MRI dataset acquired at 9.4 Tesla with many averages and approximately 0.01 mm3 voxel resolution. Continuous medial representations (cm-reps) are used to establish geometrical correspondences between hippocampal formations in different images; the extent to which these correspondences match up subfields is evaluated and compared to normalization driven by image forces. Shape-based normalization is shown to perform only slightly worse than image-based normalization; this is encouraging because the former is more applicable to in vivo MRI, which typically lacks features that distinguish hippocampal subfields.
