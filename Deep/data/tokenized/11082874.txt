INTRODUCTION: Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is a progressive drug-resistant epileptic syndrome which requires rapid, effective diagnosis and treatment. Histologically there is atrophy and gliosis of the hippocampus. OBJECTIVE: To establish magnetic resonance (MR) imaging guidelines for correct diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We made a prospective study of 78 patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (44 women and 34 men; age 6-66 years, mean 31 years). Using a magnet of 1.5 Teslas paracoronal sections were made of the hippocampus with T1 volumetric with inversion-recovery, FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery) and T2 relaxometry. A control group of 30 healthy volunteers was established. The reduction in volume and hippocampal T2 hyperintensity were considered to be MTS diagnosed on MR. RESULTS: No hippocampal differences were observed among the healthy volunteers. The confidence intervals (mean +/- 1.96 SD) were: right volume: 4.169-5.911 mm3; left volume: 4.097-5.940 mm3; time of T2 relaxation: 98-113 ms. MTS was observed in 42 patients (54%): 24 left, 14 right and four asymmetrical bilateral. The results of the diagnostic validity (sensitivity/specificity) were: T1 volumetric 91/92%, FLAIR 93.5/98% and T2 relaxometry 91/92%. There was atrophy of other extrahippocampal structures in five cases of MTS; 10 patients with MTS (23.5%) had another extrahippocampal lesion associated (dual pathology), particularly migration disorders; 21 patients (27%) had lesions without MTS (tumors, alterations of migration, nonspecific gliosis) and in 15 cases (19%) there were no abnormal findings. A total of 27 patients were operated on: 22 with MTS (21 had diagnostic MR, one case had no abnormal findings), four cases had tumors and one had cortical dysplasia. CONCLUSION: The combination of quantitative techniques (T1 volumetric with inversion-recovery and T2 relaxometry) and FLAIR optimize MTS diagnosis using MR.
