Sensorimotor gating, as measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle, is deficient in human beings with schizophrenia and is greatly reduced in rats after bilateral infusion of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) into the ventral hippocampus (VH). The disruption of PPI by bilateral VH NMDA infusion is blocked by bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) lesions, but not by bilateral lesions of the fornix, which is the principal output pathway of the hippocampal formation of the VH. Tract-tracing studies have shown the presence of additional nonfornical pathways by which the VH and neighboring structures of the amygdala may reach forebrain regions that regulate PPI, including the mPFC. To determine whether these nonfornical pathways might mediate forebrain activation after VH NMDA infusion, we examined the effects of bilateral VH NMDA infusion on c-Fos protein expression in the mPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAC) after sham vs. bilateral fornix lesions. Significant increases of c-Fos expression were observed in both the mPFC and NAC after bilateral VH NMDA infusions. Fornix lesions blocked enhanced c-Fos expression in the NAC but not the mPFC after VH NMDA infusion. The results suggest that an intact fornix may be necessary for VH activation of the NAC, but that the VH uses additional nonfornical projections to activate PPI-regulatory circuits within the mPFC.
