We evaluated the neurotrophic activity of dietary polyphenols by using primary cultures of fetal rat hippocampal neurons in a serum-free medium. Among the tested compounds, chlorogenic acid and its metabolite, m-coumaric acid, together with catechins and flavanone, were found to promote neuronal differentiation comparable to the phytochemical, honokiol, which has been reported to show potent neurotrophic activity. The present findings may contribute to the development of further neurotrophic studies on dietary polyphenols and their metabolites.
