Previously we demonstrated that the threshold for inducing hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was reduced when the pattern of electrical stimulation mimicked physiological activity. This form of LTP, termed primed burst (PB) potentiation, is blocked by stress. In the present study, we tested the possibility that adrenal hormones contribute to the stress-related inhibition of PB potentiation. Our primary finding is that the amount of stimulation current necessary to induce PB potentiation was lower in adrenalectomized rats than in controls. This finding indicates that adrenal hormones exert an inhibitory influence on the induction of physiological plasticity in the hippocampus.
