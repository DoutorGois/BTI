We have measured the amount of Gi (the inhibitory G-protein) or Go (a similar G-protein of unknown function) in 5 areas of the medial temporal lobe of control and schizophrenic brains utilizing pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation. The material used has previously been shown to have asymmetrical structural abnormalities of the ventricular system. The amount of Gi or Go was reduced on the left side in the hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, the difference reaching significance in the hippocampus. This data is the first report of a neurochemical correlate of the structural change in the brains of patients with schizophrenia. Decreased Gi or Go in hippocampus may relate to other reported neurochemical deficits or other transmembrane signalling abnormalities. Further investigations of these indices of secondary messenger function in relation to structural changes are indicated.
