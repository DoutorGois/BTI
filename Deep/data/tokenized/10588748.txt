The effects of the 29-amino acid neuropeptide galanin [GAL (1-29)], GAL(1-15), GAL(1-16), and the GAL subtype 2 receptor agonist D-tryptophan(2)-GAL(1-29) were studied in the dorsal hippocampus in vitro with intracellular recording techniques. GAL(1-15) induced, in the presence of tetrodotoxin, a dose-dependent hyperpolarization in hippocampal CA3 neurons. Most of the GAL(1-15)-sensitive neurons did not respond to GAL(1-29), GAL(1-16), or D-tryptophan(2)-GAL(1-29). These results indicate the presence of a distinct, yet-to-be cloned GAL(1-15)-selective receptor on CA3 neurons in the dorsal hippocampus.
