Single electroconvulsive shock (ECS) induced no change in [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors in rat cortex and hippocampus. ECS administered once daily for 7 days induced a significant reduction in [3H]QNB binding in both brain areas. Concurrent ECS reversed the significant increase in cortical [3H]QNB binding induced by chronic atropine administration. These findings may have relevance to the antidepressant or amnestic effects of electroconvulsive therapy.
