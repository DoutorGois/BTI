The serum- and glucocorticoid-dependent kinase SGK1 is regulated by alterations of cell volume, whereby cell shrinkage increases and cell swelling decreases the transcription, expression and activity of SGK1. The kinase is expressed in all human tissues studied including the brain. The present study was performed to localize the sites of SGK1 transcription in the brain, to elucidate the influence of the hydration status on SGK1 transcription and to explore the functional significance of altered SGK1 expression. Northern blot analysis of human brain showed SGK1 to be expressed in all cerebral structures examined: amygdala, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus and thalamus. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in the rat revealed increased expression of SGK1 in neurons of the hippocampal area CA3 after dehydration, compared with similar slices from brains of euvolaemic rats. Additionally, several oligodendrocytes, a few microglial cells, but no astrocytes, were positive for SGK1. The abundance of SGK1 mRNA in the temporal lobe, including hippocampus, was increased by dehydration and SGK1 transcription in neuroblastoma cells was stimulated by an increase of extracellular osmolarity. Co-expression studies in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that SGK1 markedly increased the activity of the neuronal K+ channel Kv1.3. As activation of K+ channels modifies excitation of neuronal cells, SGK1 may participate in the regulation of neuronal excitability.
