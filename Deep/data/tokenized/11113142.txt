A number of studies have demonstrated that cholera toxin (CT) is found in detergent-insoluble, cholesterol-enriched domains (rafts) in various cells, including neurons. We now demonstrate that even though CT is associated with these domains at the cell surface of cultured hippocampal neurons, it is internalized via a raft-independent mechanism, at both early and late stages of neuronal development. CT transport to the Golgi apparatus, and its subsequent degradation, is inhibited by hypertonic medium (sucrose), and by chlorpromazine; the former blocks clathrin recruitment, and the latter causes aberrant endosomal accumulation of clathrin. Moreover, both internalization of the transferrin receptor (Tf-R), which occurs via a clathrin-dependent mechanism, and CT internalization, are inhibited to a similar extent by sucrose. In contrast, the cholesterol-binding agents filipin and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin have no effect on the rate of CT or Tf-R internalization. Finally, once internalized, CT becomes more detergent-soluble, and chlorpromazine treatment renders internalized CT completely detergent-soluble. We propose two models to explain how, despite being detergent-insoluble at the cell surface, CT is nevertheless internalized via a raft-independent mechanism in hippocampal neurons.
