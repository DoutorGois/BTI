OBJECTIVE: To detect the expressions of neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD11b in the Abeta1-42 induced newborn rat hippocampal slices in vitro and investigate the neuroprotective effect of tanshinone IIA. METHODS: Hippocampal slices were randomly divided into 7 groups: normal control group; Abeta1-42 (5.0, 0.5 mug/mL) groups; Abeta (5.0 mug/mL) + low or high (8.0 mg or 16 mg) doses of Tan IIA groups, Abeta (0.5 mug/mL) + low or high (8.0 mg or 16 mg) doses of Tan IIA groups. The expression levels of GFAP, NeuN and CD11b were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the expression of NeuN decreased in the two different doses of Abeta1-42 groups, especially in the high-dose group (P<0.05); while the level significantly increased after high-dose Tan IIA treatment (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression levels of GFAP and CD11b increased in the two different doses of Abeta1-42 groups, and the levels in the high-dose group were the highest (P<0.05); while the levels were reduced significantly by Tan IIA treatment, the more by the high-dose Tan IIA (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Tan IIA can down-regulate the levels of GFAP and CD11b and inhibit the activity of glial cells in rat hippocampal slices induced by Abeta1-42 in vitro.
