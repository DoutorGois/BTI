The present study was undertaken to observe changes in cGMP contents, calcium-dependent and non-calcium-dependent NOS activities in brain regions isolated from morphine-dependent mice as well as the effect of NOS inhibitor (L-NMMA) on the development of this dependence. It was found that (1) cGMP contents in cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex were significantly decreased. (2) Calcium-dependent NOS activity was noticeably increased in striatum and cerebral cortex, which was inhibited by PKA inhibitor. No similar changes were found in cerebellum and hippocampus. Changes of non-calcium-dependent NOS activity did not occur in morphine-dependent mice brain. (3) In the striatum and cerebral cortex of morphine-dependent mice, the level of 150 kD protein phosphorylation in vitro was noticeably decreased, which was inhibited by IP20 (PKA inhibitor). (4) NOS inhibitor injected (icv) 15 min prior to daily morphine injection could prevent the development of morphine dependence. (5) All the changes above were not observed in mice treated with naloxone 30 min prior to daily morphine injection. Our data suggest that the reduction of cGMP contents and the increase of calcium-dependent NOS activity in striatum and cerebral cortex isolated from morphine-dependent mice may be mediated by opioid receptors and involved in the development of morphine-dependence. Why the increase of NOS activity was in association with the reduction of cGMP contents remains to be answered and it implies that the effect of NO/NOS involved in morphine-dependence may be produced through other mechanisms other than those producing cGMP signal. NOS phosphorylation in some other brain regions, which may be regulated by PKA, probably contributes to the increase of NOS activity in morphine-dependent mice.
