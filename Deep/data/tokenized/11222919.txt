Activation of adenosine A(1) receptors by endogenous adenosine plays a neuroprotective role under various pathophysiological conditions including hypoxia. Intracellular recordings were made in rat pyramidal cells of the somatosensory cortex. Hypoxia (5 min) induced a membrane depolarization and a decrease of input resistance. The A(1) receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA, 100 microM) reversibly inhibited the hypoxic depolarization. The inhibition was also present after blockade of the A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) receptor subtypes by selective antagonists. CPA had no effect on the hypoxic decrease of input resistance. 1,3-Dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), a selective A(1) receptor antagonist, which did not alter hypoxic depolarization when given alone abolished the inhibitory effect of CPA. Neither CPA nor DPCPX influenced membrane potential or apparent input resistance under normoxic conditions. The novel pyrimidoindole (R)-9-(1-methylbenzyl)-2-(4'-pyridyl)-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indole-4-amine (APPPI, 1 and 10 microM) reversibly diminished hypoxic depolarization but had no significant effect on input resistance. The effect of APPPI at a concentration of 1 microM, but not at 10 microM, was blocked by DPCPX (0.1 microM). CPA (100 microM) inhibited [(3)H]-noradrenaline ([(3)H]-NA) release from rat hippocampal brain slices significantly only in the presence of rauwolscine (0.1 microM), an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist. APPPI (1 and 10 microM) exhibited an inhibitory effect similar to that observed with CPA. The effects of both CPA and APPPI were antagonized by DPCPX (0.1 microM). The present data suggest that mainly presynaptic mechanisms prevent neurons from hypoxic changes by an inhibition of transmitter release. However, in contrast to CPA, APPPI exhibited additional effects, which require further investigation.
