Cell death in the subicular complex and hippocampus occurs from P0 to P7 in the rat. Dead cells first appear in the subcortical and subammonic plates, and predominate in the border region between the main regional subfields. Cell death in the cellular layers predominates in the subicular complex. CA1 and intermediate region between CA1 and CA3. Dead cells are almost absent in the upper plexiform layers and dentate gyrus.
