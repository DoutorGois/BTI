There has been little electrophysiological examination of the afferent projection from lateral entorhinal cortex to dorsal subiculum. Here we provide evidence that synaptic inputs from lateral entorhinal cortex and CA1 converge onto single dorsal subicular neurons in vivo. Subicular responses to CA1 stimulation consisted of excitation and/or long-duration inhibition. Neurons excited by CA1 activation usually showed inhibition to entorhinal stimulation. The latter inhibition was usually of short duration, however, long duration inhibition was seen in a significant proportion of responses. Entorhinal stimulation produced excitatory responses in four bursting cells and it was these cells that also tended to show the longest inhibition. Only bursting cells could be driven antidromically by entorhinal stimulation. Biocytin-filled multipolar and pyramidal cells displayed excitation-inhibition sequences to CA1 and inhibition to entorhinal stimulation. These data strongly suggest that subicular inhibitory neurons receive excitatory input from CA1 and display mutual inhibition. The source of entorhinal-evoked inhibition is less clear. The relative sparseness of observed entorhinal-evoked responses suggests that the input to dorsal subiculum from any one part of lateral entorhinal cortex is spatially restricted. These data show that excitation-inhibition sequences can be seen in subicular pyramidal and multipolar cells and that single subicular neurons receive convergent inputs from CA1 and entorhinal cortex. We show for the first time that bursting cells can be driven both orthodromically and antidromically by direct entorhinal stimulation. These data support the existence of a reciprocal excitatory connection between lateral entorhinal cortex and dorsal subiculum and suggest further that this connection may involve only bursting subicular neurons.
