OBJECTIVE: Are ontogenetic differences in the resistance of the brain towards ischemia reflected by differences in the postischemic disturbance of cerebral protein synthesis (PS) independently from energy metabolism (EM)? METHODS: We studied hippocampal slices from immature (E60) and mature (E60) fetal guinea pigs as well as from adult guinea pigs. Cerebral EM and PS were measured during and up to 24 h after ischemia. RESULTS: After in vitro ischemia there was no inhibition in cerebral PS in immature fetuses, a transient inhibition in mature fetuses, and a permanent inhibition in adults. During and after in vitro ischemia cerebral EM was hardly disturbed in immature fetuses. No differences in cerebral EM could be observed between mature fetuses and adults. CONCLUSION: Ontogenetic differences in the resistance of the brain towards ischemia are reflected by differences in the postischemic disturbance of cerebral PS. The differences between mature fetuses and adults are independent from cerebral EM.
