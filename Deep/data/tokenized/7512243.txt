The potential neurotrophic effect of substance P-like immunoreactivity present in culture media was assessed in rat embryonic day 18 hippocampal cultures. The neurokinin-1 (substance P) receptor antagonist CP-96345 induced neurotoxicity that was dose dependent and attenuated by addition of substance P or the neurokinin-1 agonist [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-SP. These studies suggest that under some conditions neurokinin-1 receptor stimulation promotes neuronal survival.
