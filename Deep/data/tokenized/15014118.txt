It is argued that the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning by supporting the acquisition of a conjunctive memory representation of context, which associates with shock. This function was examined by studying the context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE). A rat that is shocked immediately after being placed into a context subsequently displays almost no fear of that context. However, if it is pre-exposed to the context the day before immediate shock, it displays significant freezing to that context. By using 5-aminomethyl-3-hydroxysoxazole to temporarily inactivate the dorsal hippocampus (DH) at three different phases of the procedure, which produces the CPFE, we show that the hippocampus is necessary for the following: (1) acquisition of the context memory, (2) retrieval of this memory at the time of immediate shock, and (3) retrieval of the context-shock memory at the time of testing. In contrast, inactivating the DH before a standard contextual shock experience had no effect on contextual fear conditioning. These results support the view that two processes can support contextual fear conditioning: (1) conditioning to the conjunctive representation, which depends on the hippocampus, and (2) conditioning to the features that make up the context, which does not.
