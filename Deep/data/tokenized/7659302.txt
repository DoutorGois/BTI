We examined the effect of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulfated type (CCK-8S) on dysfunction of CA1 pyramidal neurons induced by in vitro ischemic insult in hippocampal slices of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). CCK-8S shortened the time required for partial recovery from block of a population spike produced by ischemia. Furthermore, CCK-8S reduced ischemic insult-induced accumulation of K+ in extracellular space. Suppression of the K+ conductance by the CCKB receptor activation is suggested to contribute to neuroprotection by CCK-8S.
