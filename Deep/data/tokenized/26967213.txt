BACKGROUND: The earliest stage of preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by low levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Abeta42). However, covariance in longitudinal dynamic change of Abeta42 and tau in incipient preclinical AD is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To examine dynamic interrelationships between Abeta42 and tau in preclinical AD. METHODS: We followed 47 cognitively intact participants (CI) with available CSF data over four years in ADNI. Based on longitudinal Abeta42 levels in CSF, CI were classified into three groups: 1) Abeta42 stable with normal levels of Abeta42 over time (n = 15); 2) Abeta42 declining with normal Abeta42 levels at baseline but showing decline over time (n = 14); and 3) Abeta42 levels consistently abnormal (n = 18). RESULTS: In the Abeta42 declining group, suggestive of incipient preclinical AD, CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) showed a similar longitudinal pattern of increasing abnormality over time (p = 0.0001). Correlation between longitudinal slopes of Abeta42 and p-tau confirmed that both trajectories were anti-correlated (rho = -0.60; p = 0.02). Regression analysis showed that Abeta42 slope (decreasing Abeta42) predicted p-tau slope (increasing p-tau) (R2 = 0.47, p = 0.03). Atrophy in the hippocampus was predicted by the interaction of Abeta42 and p-tau slopes (p < 0.0001) only in this incipient preclinical AD group. In all groups combined, memory decline was predicted by p-tau. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of Abeta42 and p-tau CSF biomarkers in CI subjects follows an anti-correlated trajectory, i.e., as Abeta42 declined, p-tau increased, and thus was suggestive of strong temporal coincidence. Rapid pathogenic cross-talk between Abeta42 and p-tau thus may be evident in very early stages of preclinical AD.
