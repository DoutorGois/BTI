UNLABELLED: The aggregation of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in brain is an early event and hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We combined the advantages of in vitro and in vivo approaches to study cerebral beta-amyloidosis by establishing a long-term hippocampal slice culture (HSC) model. While no Abeta deposition was noted in untreated HSCs of postnatal Abeta precursor protein transgenic (APP tg) mice, Abeta deposition emerged in HSCs when cultures were treated once with brain extract from aged APP tg mice and the culture medium was continuously supplemented with synthetic Abeta. Seeded Abeta deposition was also observed under the same conditions in HSCs derived from wild-type or App-null mice but in no comparable way when HSCs were fixed before cultivation. Both the nature of the brain extract and the synthetic Abeta species determined the conformational characteristics of HSC Abeta deposition. HSC Abeta deposits induced a microglia response, spine loss, and neuritic dystrophy but no obvious neuron loss. Remarkably, in contrast to in vitro aggregated synthetic Abeta, homogenates of Abeta deposits containing HSCs induced cerebral beta-amyloidosis upon intracerebral inoculation into young APP tg mice. Our results demonstrate that a living cellular environment promotes the seeded conversion of synthetic Abeta into a potent in vivo seeding-active form. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this study, we report the seeded induction of Abeta aggregation and deposition in long-term hippocampal slice cultures. Remarkably, we find that the biological activities of the largely synthetic Abeta aggregates in the culture are very similar to those observed in vivo This observation is the first to show that potent in vivo seeding-active Abeta aggregates can be obtained by seeded conversion of synthetic Abeta in a living (wild-type) cellular environment.
