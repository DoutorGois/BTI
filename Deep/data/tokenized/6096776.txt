The uptake ratio of 65zinc into the postnatally developing hippocampal formation, cerebellum and remainder of the brain showed only minor differences, whilst following subcellular fractionation a marked decrease in 65zinc uptake from postnatal day 15 to adulthood was found in nuclear sediments (hippocampal formation 44.3%, cerebellum 27.5%), along with an increase in synaptosomal fractions on the hippocampal formation by 55.4% and of the cerebellum by 37.1%. The shift of zinc out of the perikarya into terminal fields during the postnatal development without substantial alterations of the net zinc content is supposed to be a consequence of a functional relation of zinc to synaptic transmission processes.
