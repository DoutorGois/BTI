Postsynaptic GABAA-responses of cortical neurones may be composed of an early 'somatic' hyperpolarization (h-GABAA) and a 'dendritic' depolarization (d-GABAA). In order to study underlying anion-fluxes the gradient of bicarbonate across the membrane of CA3-neurones in hippocampal slices (guinea-pig) was reduced by several manoeuvres (NH4-prepulse-technique, CO2/bicarbonate-withdrawal-technique, acetazolamide, DIDS). Each manoeuvre resulted in an attenuation of d-GABAA. The inhibition of a Cl-/bicarbonate-exchanger with DIDS could also weaken h-GABAA which was selectively impaired by ethacrynic acid--known to block an ATP-driven somatic Cl(-)-extrusion mechanism. In conclusion, bicarbonate-fluxes contribute to d-GABAA rather than to h-GABAA which is mainly driven by Cl(-)-fluxes. An uneven distribution of Cl(-)-extrusion mechanisms along the adult CA3-neurones is likely to build up the anion-gradients necessary to generate biphasic GABAA-responses.
