Developmental ethanol exposure is a well-known cause of lifelong cognitive deficits, behavioral hyperactivity, emotional dysregulation, and more. In healthy adults, sleep is thought to have a critical involvement in each of these processes. Our previous work has demonstrated that some aspects of cognitive impairment in adult mice exposed at postnatal day 7 (P7) to ethanol (EtOH) correlate with slow-wave sleep (SWS) fragmentation (Wilson et al., 2016). We and others have also previously demonstrated that co-treatment with LiCl on the day of EtOH exposure prevents many of the anatomical and physiological impairments observed in adults. Here we explored cognitive function, diurnal rhythms (activity, temperature), SWS, and parvalbumin (PV) and perineuronal net (PNN)-positive cell densities in adult mice that had received a single day of EtOH exposure on P7 and saline-treated littermate controls. Half of the animals also received a LiCl injection on P7. The results suggest that developmental EtOH resulted in adult behavioral hyperactivity, cognitive impairment, and reduced SWS compared to saline controls. Both of these effects were reduced by LiCl treatment on the day of EtOH exposure. Finally, developmental EtOH resulted in decreased PV/PNN-expressing cells in retrosplenial (RS) cortex and dorsal CA3 hippocampus at P90. As with sleep and behavioral activity, LiCl treatment reduced this decrease in PV expression. Together, these results further clarify the long-lasting effects of developmental EtOH on adult behavior, physiology, and anatomy. Furthermore, they demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of LiCl co-treatment on this wide range of developmental EtOH's long-lasting consequences.
