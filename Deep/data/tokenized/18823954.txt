Converging lines of evidence have supported a role for the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NB) in attentional mechanisms; however, debate continues regarding the role of the medial septum in behavior (MS). Recent studies have supported a role for the septohippocampal system in the online processing of internally generated cues. The current study was designed to investigate a possible double dissociation in rat food protection behavior, a natural behavior that has been shown to depend on external and internal sources of information. The study examined the effects of intraparenchymal injections of 192 IgG-saporin into either the MS or NB on the organization of food protection behavior. NB cholinergic lesions reduced the number of successful food protection behaviors while sparing the temporal organization of food protection behavior. In contrast, MS cholinergic lesions disrupted the temporal organization of food protection behavior while sparing the ability to successfully protect food items. These observations are consistent with a double dissociation of NB and MS cholinergic systems' contributions to processing external and internal sources of information and provide further evidence for the septohippocampal system's involvement in processing internally generated cues.
