Glutamate-induced oxidative injury causes neuronal degeneration related to many central nervous system diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and ischemia. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the EtOH extract of the root bark of Dictamnus dasycarpus Trucz. provided one neuroprotective limonoid, obacunone, together with a degraded limonoid, fraxinellone and two alkaloids, dictamine and haplopine. At concentrations of 100-150 microM, obacunone showed the potent neuroprotective effects on glutamateinduced neurotoxicity and induced the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in the mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. In addition, we found that obacunone increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation and induced HO-1 expression via p38 MAPK pathway. These results suggest that obacunone isolated from the root bark of D. dasycarpus increases cellular resistance to glutamate-induced oxidative injury in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, presumably through the p38 MAPK pathway-dependent HO-1 expression. These results suggest that obacunone could be the effective candidates for the treatment of ROS-related neurological diseases.
