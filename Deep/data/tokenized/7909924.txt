Intracellular recording from CA1 neurones of the rat hippocampal slice preparation was carried out to assess the ability of the endogenously-occurring neuropeptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to modulate responses elicited by the excitatory amino acid agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). TRH (5 microM) produced no change in resting membrane potential or input resistance but facilitated on-going synaptic activity. In the continuous presence of the peptide responses to NMDA were selectively enhanced for about 20 min. In approximately 50% of cells the potentiating effect of TRH persisted in tetrodotoxin (TTX) solution and was associated with removal of the apparent voltage-dependent increase in input resistance usually found during the NMDA-induced depolarization. It is suggested that TRH evoked a transient upregulation of NMDA responses which might account for the reported facilitation by this peptide of long term potentiation in the hippocampus.
