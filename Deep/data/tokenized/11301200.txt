TREK-1 is a member of the two-pore-domain potassium channel family which is expressed predominantly in the CNS. Using an anti-peptide polyclonal antiserum, we have determined the distribution of TREK-1 in the brain and spinal cord of adult rats. Specificity of the antiserum was tested using a TREK-1-transfected cell line and confirmed with c-myc-tagged TREK-1. In thin tissue sections, immunoreactivity was widespread throughout the rat brain and spinal cord. TREK-1-like signals were observed in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and various other subcortical nuclei in the hypothalamus, thalamus, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. TREK-1 labelling appeared to be over the entire cell membrane, including the cell body and processes. Cells that morphologically resembled projection neurones and interneurones but not glial cells were labelled. As interneurones and known GABAergic projection neurones were the predominant population labelled, we investigated the possibility that TREK-1 is expressed in GABA-containing neurones using a specific anti-GABA antiserum. Expression of TREK-1 in GABA-containing neurones was observed in a number of areas, including the isocortex, hippocampus and thalamus. Thus, TREK-1 expression defines a unique and specific subset of interneurones and principal cells. These studies indicate a widespread distribution of TREK-1 potassium channels throughout the rat brain and spinal cord, with expression in a number of areas being demonstrated to be present on GABA-containing neurones.
