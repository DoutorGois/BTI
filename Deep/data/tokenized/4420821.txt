Administration of morphine or ethanol to rats produces a decrease in regional brain calcium in vivo. This effect is selectively antagonized by the stereospecific narcotic antagonist naloxone. Reserpine and the dopamine-acetaldehyde conjugate salsolinol also produce a depletion of regional brain calcium, but only the salsolinol depletion is antagonized by naloxone. Experiments with naloxone provide evidence for two calcium-sensitive pools in the central nervous system.
