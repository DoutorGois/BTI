The circling (cir) mouse strain, a murine model of deafness caused by a spontaneous mutation, exhibits characteristic behaviors of circling and hyperactivity. In an induced-noise paradigm, cir mice display a significant loss in their spatial orientation abilities, and this has been suggested to be due at least in part to changes in calcium homeostasis. Auditory information is transferred from the cochlear nucleus to the hippocampus, where it is processed to modulate motor and sensory activity. Such a pathway could be affected at the cellular level by alterations in neurotransmission, including alterations that involve Ca(2+). However, there have been no studies in a hearing deficit model examining the concomitant molecular alterations in the hippocampus. Thus, in the present study we used immunohistochemistry to compare the distribution of the calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) calbindin D-28k, parvalbumin, and calretinin in the hippocampi of heterozygous (+/cir), homozygous (cir/cir), and wild-type (+/+) mice. The expression of the CaBPs in various hippocampal subfields appeared to be significantly lower in cir mice (+/- and -/-) than in +/+ mice. Such a decrease in CaBP expression in cir/cir mice would alter calcium homeostasis, which in turn could affect the connection of the tri-synaptic circuit of the hippocampus as well as the cortical region. A decrease in CaBPs and the probable resultant glutamate-mediated excitability could contribute to the functional changes that lead to the characteristic behavioral features of cir mice.
