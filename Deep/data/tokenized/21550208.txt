We compared hippocampal abnormalities in 42 healthy adults identified by voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) and by visual inspection. Hippocampal abnormalities were seen in 8 (19.0%) and 10 (23.8%) of subjects by VBR and visual inspection, respectively (p>0.05). Notably, 50% of the abnormalities seen by visual inspection were likely false positive. This suggests that VBR is a more specific measure and should be considered in subjects with questionable hippocampal abnormalities.
