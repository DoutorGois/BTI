Ischemic damage occurs well in vulnerable regions of the brain, including the hippocampus and striatum. In the present study, we examined neuronal damage/death and glial changes in the striatum 4 days after 5, 10, 15 and 20 min of transient cerebral ischemia using the gerbil. Spontaneous motor activity was increased with the duration time of ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). To examine neuronal damage, we used Fluoro-Jade B (F-J B, a marker for neuronal degeneration) histofluorescence staining. F-J B positive cells were detected only in the 20 min ischemia-group, not in the other groups. In addition, we examined gliosis of astrocytes and microglia using anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti- ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), respectively. In the 5 min ischemia-group, GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes were distinctively increased in number, and the immunoreactivity was stronger than that in the sham-group. In the 10, 15 and 20 min ischemia-groups, GFAP-immunoreactivity was more increased with the duration of I-R. On the other hand, the immunoreactivity and the number of Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia were distinctively increased in the 5 and 10 min ischemia-groups. In the 15 min ischemia-group, cell bodies of microglia were largest, and the immunoreactivity was highest; however, in the 20 min ischemia-group, the immunoreactivity was low compared to the 15 min ischemia-group. The results of western blotting for GFAP and Iba-1 were similar to the immunohistochemical data. In brief, these findings showed that neuronal death could be detected only in the 20 min ischemia-group 4 days after I-R, and the change pattern of astrocytes and microglia were apparently different according to the duration time of I-R.
