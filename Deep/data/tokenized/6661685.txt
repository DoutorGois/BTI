Stimulation of the septum and the hippocampus were found to elicit a great number of "wet-dog" shakes (WDS). Their occurrence is strongly related to the evocation and to the time course of the afterdischarges elicited by the stimulation. Morphine, apomorphine, diazepam, and antiserotoninergic drugs greatly reduce the incidence of these WDS but do not alter the afterdischarge duration. Based on electroencephalographic and pharmacological data we propose that WDS induced by stimulation of the septohippocampal system may share some common mechanisms with many other models inducing WDS and offer a useful method to study further the neuroanatomical substrate of this behavior.
