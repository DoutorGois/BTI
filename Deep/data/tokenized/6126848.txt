Acidic amino acid analogues varying in their omega-terminal were evaluated: (1) as neuronal excitants or antagonists of excitatory synaptic transmission, and (2) as inhibitors of L-[3H]glutamate binding to synaptic membranes. omega-Phosphonates were antagonists and inhibited L-glutamate binding to the 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB)-sensitive population of binding sites; omega-sulfonates and omega-carboxylates were excitants and inhibited L-glutamate binding to APB-sensitive and -insensitive sites. The data indicate that properties of the omega-acidic group are important for establishing the relative potencies of antagonist substances and the overall excitatory/antagonist activity of these analogues.
