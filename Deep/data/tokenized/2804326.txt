The structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle on the white rats with experimental parkinsonian syndrome was investigated, which was induced by administration of MPTP and oxotremorine. The EEG was recorded during 6 hours. The recordings were made 1.5 hours after the administration of the drugs. It was established that MPTP and oxotremorine broke the structure of the sleep-wakefulness cycle almost with complete reduction of paradoxal sleep and the decrease of SWS. The number of sleep spindles was reduced and changed the characteristics of the hippocampal theta rhythms. MPTP induces weakness of the phasic compound and strengthens the tonic compound.
