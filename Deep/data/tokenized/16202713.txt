Expression of VP16-CREB, a constitutively active form of CREB, in hippocampal neurons of the CA1 region lowers the threshold for eliciting the late, persistent phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway. This VP16-CREB-mediated L-LTP differs from the conventional late phase of LTP in not being dependent on new transcription. This finding suggests that in the transgenic mice the mRNA transcript(s) encoding the protein(s) necessary for this form of L-LTP might already be present in CA1 neurons in the basal condition. We used high-density oligonucleotide arrays to identify the mRNAs differentially expressed in the hippocampus of transgenic and wild-type mice. We then explored the contribution of the most prominent candidate genes revealed by our screening, namely prodynorphin, BDNF, and MHC class I molecules, to the facilitated LTP of VP16-CREB mice. We found that the overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor accounts for an important component of this phenotype.
