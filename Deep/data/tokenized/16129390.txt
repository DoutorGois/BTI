Neurons adapt their synaptic responses to the activity of the underlying network. In this issue of Neuron, Thiagarajan and colleagues report on specific subcellular mechanisms of homeostasis after prolonged neuronal inactivity. The results have important implications not only for neuronal homeostasis but also for further understanding of metaplasticity.
