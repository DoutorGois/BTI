The expression at the protein level of plasma membrane calcium pump (PMCA) isoforms in rat brain was detected by new antibodies that distinguished the four gene products and their alternatively spliced variants. All four gene products were distributed throughout hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum, but the alternate splices showed more distinct distribution patterns. The b splice of isoform 1 was not detectable in any of the brain regions, which makes it unlikely that this isoform performs an essential housekeeping role as is frequently proposed. The b splices of isoforms 3 and 4, although expressed in all three regions, showed evidence of proteolysis, which removed a portion of the carboxyl terminus. In contrast, isoform 2b retained its full length, indicating that PMCA2b is more resistant to proteolysis than the other b forms. Whereas substantial amounts of isoforms 1a, 2a, and 3a were expressed in all regions, 4a was found only in frontal cortex. The distinct patterns of expression of the PMCA isoforms in brain suggest that some of them play a special role in intracellular Ca regulation.
