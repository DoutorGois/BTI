Three groups of rats received either unilateral fimbria-fornix lesions by aspiration through the overlying cingulate cortex (group I), a fimbria-fornix lesion followed by an intrahippocampal transplant of acetylcholine (ACh)-rich embryonic septal tissue (group II), or a similar septal transplant placed into the intact hippocampus, in the absence of the denervating lesion (group III). The 3 groups were subdivided into equal subgroups receiving 6 intrahippocampal injections of nerve growth factor (NGF) at 4-day intervals, control injections of cytochrome c, or no injections. On the 28th day all animals were sacrificed and the majority taken for biochemical analysis of hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). The animals with intact hippocampi (group III) were given a denervating fimbria-fornix lesion 3 days prior to sacrifice in order to reveal graft-derived ChAT activity from intrinsic ChAT activity. The fimbria-fornix lesions (group I) depleted hippocampal ChAT activity to 15-20% of normal, which was not influenced by NGF injections. The ACh-rich grafts placed in the denervated hippocampus (group II) restored hippocampal ChAT activity to approximately 60% of the normal level, and this was promoted to approximately 84% of NGF, but not cytochrome c, injections into the hippocampus. Grafts placed into the intact hippocampus (group III) did not raise ChAT activity above the lesion-alone level, and this was not influenced by NGF injections. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry showed no difference in outgrowth from the grafts in the denervated hippocampus with or without NGF injections. The results are interpreted, in agreement with observations in tissue culture, as indicating that NGF enhances ChAT activity in grafted neurons, rather than promoting survival and growth per se.
