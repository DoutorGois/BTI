Associative long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression of compound and unitary CA3-CA excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were investigated in rat hippocampal slice cultures. The induction of LTP with synchronous pairing of synaptic activation and postsynaptic depolarization resulted in an increase in the amplitude of EPSPs to the same absolute level, regardless of whether the input was naive or had been previously depressed by asynchronous pairing of pre- and postsynaptic activity. Saturated LTP of compound and unitary EPSPs was reversed by asynchronous pairing and could be reinduced by synchronous pairing. The likelihood that an action potential in a presynaptic CA3 cell failed to trigger an unitary EPSP in a postsynaptic CA1 cell decreased after induction of associative potentiation and increased after induction of associative depotentiation. These changes in the rate of transmission failures were accompanied by large changes in the amplitude of nonfailure EPSPs. We conclude that the same CA3-CA1 synapses can alternatively undergo associative potentiation and depression, perhaps through opposite changes in a single expression mechanism.
