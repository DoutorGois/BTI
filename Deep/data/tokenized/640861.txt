The pattern of the multiple forms of the acetylocholinesterase (AChE, E.C. 3.1.1.7) of the rat brain is investigated using polyacrylamide gradient micro-gel electrophoresis with regard to a possible functional importance of this individual forms. The patterns of the AChE-forms of selected regions of the CNS are compared and certain differences could be shown. After increased cholinergic input (into the hippocampus by electrical stimulation of the nc. septi medialis) an aggregation of AChE subunits is detectable. Subletal intoxication with an irreversible inhibitor of AChE is followed by a faster recovery of the smaller forms. A suggestion of a possible functional role of the multiple forms of AChE is discussed.
