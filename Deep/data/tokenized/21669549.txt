OBJECTIVE: To explore in human potential hippocampal projections within and outside the temporal lobe. METHODS: We performed intra-cerebral electrical stimulations in seven patients investigated by depth electrodes for refractory epilepsy and analyzed the presence of evoked potentials (EPs) in all brain regions explored. Bipolar electrical stimulations, consisting of two series of 25 pulses of 1 ms duration, 0.2 Hz frequency, and 3 mA intensity, were delivered in a total of 36 hippocampal stimulations sites. RESULTS: Reproducible EPs were recorded in several brain regions with variable latencies, amplitudes and morphologies. Within the temporal lobe, EPs were present in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, temporal pole and temporal neocortex. EPs were also observed in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex, midcingulate and posterior cingulate gyrus, insula and thalamic pulvinar nucleus. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate a large distribution of direct or indirect hippocampal projections. SIGNIFICANCE: This widespread connectivity supports the previous definition of different networks involved mainly in memory and behavioral processes, implicating the temporal lobe, the cingulate gyrus or the prefrontal region. Our data provide some clues to further evaluate potential pathways of propagation of mesial temporal lobe seizure, via the insula or the pulvinar nucleus.
