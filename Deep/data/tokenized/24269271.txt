BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified the CACNA1C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1006737 as one of the most consistent genetic findings as susceptibility locus for major psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, animal and genetic imaging studies have reported strong functional evidence for the association of CACNA1C with learning, memory, neural plasticity, and its association with the hippocampal formation. In the present study we investigated the impact of the CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 on the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the hippocampal formation as well as on verbal learning and memory in healthy individuals. METHODS: 118 healthy individuals (72 males, 46 females, age 18-56years) initially underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), 100 of them were included in the final analysis. We used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to examine the impact of the CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 on the hippocampal formation as predefined region of interest (ROI). Furthermore, all participants completed the Verbal Learning and Memory Test (VLMT). RESULTS: In the VLMT genotype was significantly associated with learning performance. Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests indicated a diminished performance at the beginning of the learning curve in risk allele carriers compared to non-risk allele carriers. The TBSS ROI analysis revealed one cluster of reduced FA in risk allele carriers compared to non-risk allele carriers located in the right hippocampal formation. Moreover, an association between the initial learning performance and FA values was found. DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that genetic variation in the CACNA1C SNP rs1006737 is associated with FA reduction in the hippocampal formation as well as with differences in learning performance in healthy individuals.
