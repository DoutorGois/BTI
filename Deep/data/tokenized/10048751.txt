Clinical and experimental studies have demonstrated the neurotoxicity of aluminium (Al), notably as a result of lipid peroxidation in vitro. We previously showed that Al is able to cross the blood-brain barrier as an L-glutamate complex and be deposited in rat brain. The present work in young mature rats investigated the in vivo effects of chronic Al-L-glutamate treatment on Al and iron movement in plasma and selected brain regions. Brain lipid peroxidation was determined by evaluating the production of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and analysing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as C20:4n-6 and C22:6n-3. Our results indicate that iron concentration was decreased in plasma and that Al accumulated especially in striatum where iron levels were decreased and in the hippocampus where TBARS were increased without PUFA modifications. These data show that Al administered chronically as an L-glutamate complex is neurotoxic in vivo and thus provides a good model for studying Al toxic mechanisms.
