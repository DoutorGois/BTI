The fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (Fgfr3) is expressed in a rostral(low) to caudal(high) gradient in the developing cerebral cortex. Therefore, we hypothesized that Fgfr3 contributes to the correct morphology and connectivity of the caudal cortex. Overall, the forebrain structures appeared normal in Fgfr3(-/-) mice. However, cortical and hippocampal volumes were reduced by 26.7% and 16.3%, respectively. Hypoplasia was particularly evident in the caudo-ventral region of the telencephalon where proliferation was mildly decreased at embryonic day 18.5. Dysplasia of GABAergic neurons in the amygdala and piriform cortex was seen following GAD67 immunohistochemistry. Dye-tracing studies and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and tractography detected a subtle thalamocortical tract deficit, and significant decreases in the stria terminalis and lateral arms of the anterior commissure. These results indicate the subtle role of Fgfr3 in formation of caudal regions of the telencephalon affecting some brain projections.
