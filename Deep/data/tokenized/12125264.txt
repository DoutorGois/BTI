Sex-dependent description of the total protein heparin-binding activity in different rat brain regions was established in experiment on white rats. In norm named parameter above in males, than in females on a 22%. The specific alteration of the total heparine-binding activity was found in cortex, cerebellum, middle brain, hippocampus, striatum and pons 1, 12, 24, 120 and 168 hours after whole body single exposure to ionizing radiation with a dose of 0.25 Gy. The most pronounced changes were typical for limbic system. In the cortex and cerebellum of males no significant changes of the activity were found. The data suggest that modification of the system of heparin/heparin-binding proteins, which takes part in regulation of the intercellular brain communication, occurs at early hours after exposure to ionizing radiation.
