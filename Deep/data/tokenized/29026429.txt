BACKGROUND: To overcome the current overexploitation of fish rich in n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), microalgae have become a promising marine lipid source. The purpose of this study was to assess eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), isolated or combined from distinct marine origins, on the promotion of neuroprotective effects. METHODS: The experiment lasted for 10 weeks and involved 32 Wistar rats, divided into 4 diets (n = 8): a diet rich in milk fat was taken as control (Milk Fat) and compared to n-3 LCPUFA enriched diets, either in EPA + DHA form through fish oil (Fish Oil), or EPA through Nannochloropsis oil (Nanno), or DHA through Schizochytrium oil (Schyzo), while maintaining Milk Fat incorporation. RESULTS: Plasma lipid profile and dopamine levels were more beneficial in Fish Oil diet. In addition, n-3 LCPUFA incorporation was found increased in liver and erythrocytes from Fish Oil fed rats, suggesting that fish oil is a better dietary source for fatty acids deposition in the organism than microalgae. The Forced Swimming Test revealed a positive behavioural action of EPA + DHA, in opposition to Milk Fat and Nanno diets, which had higher immobile times. mRNA levels of serotonin receptors, HT1A and HT2A along with CREB, the transmission factor for learning and memory, were higher in the hippocampus of rats fed n-3 LCPUFA diets comparative to Milk Fat. CONCLUSION: Taken together, the combination of EPA and DHA from fish oil can counteract the undesirable health effects of saturated fat based diets and benefit, in the long run, neurological function.
