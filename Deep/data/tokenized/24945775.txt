It has been widely reported that beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) blocks long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal synapses. Here, we show evidence that Abeta more potently blocks the potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)-spike coupling (E-S potentiation). This occurs, not by direct effect on excitatory synapses or postsynaptic neurons, but rather through an indirect mechanism: reduction of endocannabinoid-mediated peritetanic disinhibition. During high-frequency (tetanic) stimulation, somatic synaptic inhibition is suppressed by endocannabinoids. We find that Abeta prevents this endocannabinoid-mediated disinhibition, thus leaving synaptic inhibition more intact during tetanic stimulation. This intact inhibition opposes the normal depolarization of hippocampal pyramidal neurons that occurs during tetanus, thus opposing the induction of synaptic plasticity. Thus, a pathway through which Abeta can act to modulate neural activity is identified, relevant to learning and memory and how it may mediate aspects of the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer's disease.
