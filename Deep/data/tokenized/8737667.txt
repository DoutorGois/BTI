Serotonin is a widely distributed neurotransmitter which elicits a range of central activities. We examined the effect of serotonin on cytokine mRNA expression by rat hippocampal astrocytes in primary cultures. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis shows that interleukin-6 (IL6) mRNA is expressed after 10(-12) M serotonin stimulation whereas transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) are induced by 10(-10) M serotonin. These inductions appeared after 1 h stimulation for IL6 and TNF alpha, whereas that of TGF beta appeared after 4 h. The present results provide the first evidence that serotonin can influence astrocyte cytokine production, and thus this neurotransmitter may be considered a potential neuroimmunomodulator.
