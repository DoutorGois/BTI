Rats exposed to repeated restraint stress exhibit structural and functional deficits in hippocampus that are similar to those observed in patients with depressive illnesses. Blood corticosterone concentrations are proportionally increased with catalase and glutathione-peroxidase activity and are inversely proportional with 3-nitrotyrosine concentrations.Cytochrome c oxidase, adenosin tryphosphatase and monoamine oxidase activities of CA3 hippocampal field mark a stress-time dependent decrease. Acridine-orange labeling of the CA3 field reveals an enhancing green fluorescence of glyocites in stress conditions. After three days of restraint stress, the secretory activity of CA3 neurons did not show significant decrease, and neurons appeared with normal shapes and distribution. CA3 neurons after seven days of restraint stress have marked a slight decrease of secretory activity. In contrast to a well-preserved histological appearance of the CA3 neurons, local and blood stress-related reactions are observed. CA3-glial activation and disturbance of blood oxidative homeostasis are tandem processes during three and seven days of RS. This study depicts the balancing role of CA3 area in time-varying stress conditions.
