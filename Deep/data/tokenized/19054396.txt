PURPOSE: We studied the variability of the slow-spike-and-wave discharges (SSWDs) derived from AY-9944 (AY) treatment during brain development of Long-Evans hooded (LEh) rats. METHODS: Although all LEh rats received the standard dose of AY (7.5 mg/kg), we have observed an intersubject variability of the total SSWD duration at postnatal day (P) 55. Therefore, we set out to investigate the underlying brain levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) and its metabolite (5-HIAA), as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses from four different brain regions: thalamus (Th), frontoparietal cortex (Cx), hippocampus (Hp), and brainstem (Bs). RESULTS: All brains were obtained after two baseline electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings with characteristic chronic, recurrent, bilaterally synchronous 4-6 Hz SSWD, at P 55 (336.25 +/- 97.23 s/h) and P60 (494.50 +/- 150.36 s) (r = 0.951, r(2) = 0.904, p < 0.005, Pearson product). The thalamic NE levels and the brainstem NE, DA, and 5HT levels were all significantly correlated with baseline SSWD duration at P55 and P60 (p < 0.01, Pearson product). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that brain monoamine levels may determine the intersubject variability of SSWD duration in AY rats with chronic atypical absence seizures.
