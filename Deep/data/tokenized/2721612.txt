This study describes the fine structure of input synapses on identified neurons in slices of the guinea pig hippocampus. For morphological identification, granule cells of the fascia dentata and pyramidal neurons of regio inferior of the hippocampus were impaled and intracellularly stained with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Input synapses on the HRP-stained neurons were identified in the electron microscope by the location of the synapses in inner or outer zones of the dentate molecular layer, as in the case of the synaptic contacts on injected granule cells, or by unique fine structural characteristics, as in the case of the giant mossy fiber boutons on CA3 pyramidal cells. As in tissue fixed in situ by transcardial perfusion, a large number of terminals arising from the different afferents in inner and outer zones of the dentate molecular layer were well preserved and formed synaptic contacts with small spines, large complex spines, and dendritic shafts of the HRP-filled granule cells. Mossy fiber synapses on the stained CA3 neurons were densely filled with clear vesicles, contained a few dense-core vesicles, and formed synaptic contacts with large spines or excrescences. Occasionally electrondense degenerating boutons were also found impinging on the stained dendrites and spines. The significance of the present findings for electrophysiological and pharmacological studies on brain slices is discussed.
