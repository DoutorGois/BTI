Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is frequently associated with polysialic acid (PSA), and its function is highly dependent on this polysialylation. PSA-NCAM plays an important role in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. STX and PST are the enzymes responsible for NCAM polysialylation. We investigated whether unilateral long-term potentiation (LTP) induction in vivo, in adult rat dentate gyrus (DG), triggered NCAM polysialylation by STX and PST produced in the hippocampus. We found that levels of STX and PST mRNA increased strongly since the early stage of hippocampal LTP and remained high during the maintenance of DG-LTP for 4 h. This rapid increase in polysialyltransferase gene expression occurred in both the hippocampi, probably resulting from bilateral LTP induction by strong unilateral HFS. Thus, LTP triggers interhemispheric molecular changes in the hippocampal network. This study is the first to describe the effects of LTP induction and maintenance on polysialyl-transferases in vivo. Our findings suggest that hippocampal synaptic remodeling requires NCAM polysialylation.
