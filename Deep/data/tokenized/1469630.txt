In an in vivo electrophysiological paradigm, we have shown in the companion paper that neuropeptide Y (NPY) potentiates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced neuronal activation via a non-Y1, non-Y2, non-Y3 receptor subtype, in the rat CA3 dorsal hippocampus. Because sigma ligands have also been shown to potentiate NMDA-induced activation and because NPY and peptide YY have been reported to have high affinity for sigma binding sites, the present study was carried out to assess the possibility that the modulation of the NMDA response by NPY might be mediated by a sigma receptor. In the same electrophysiological paradigm, low doses of haloperidol and alpha-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2- pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine butanol, two antagonists of sigma receptors, reversed the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by NPY, [Leu31, Pro34]NPY or NPY13-36 and blocked the suppressant effect of desamido-NPY on the NMDA response. In contrast, spiperone, which has low affinity for sigma sites, was ineffective in suppressing NPY, as well as desamido-NPY-induced modulation of the NMDA response. In our model, peptide YY, which acts as a NPY antagonist by suppressing the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by NPY, also antagonized the potentiation of the NMDA response induced by the administration of low doses of di(2-tolyl)guanidine and (+)N-cyclopropyl-methyl-N-,methyl-1,4- diphenyl-1-ethyl-but-3-en-1-ylamine hydrochloride, two high-affinity sigma agonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
