Noradrenaline (NA) release and its modulation via presynaptic opioid receptors were studied in rabbit hippocampal slices, which were preincubated with [3H]NA, continuously superfused in the presence of 30 microM cocaine and stimulated electrically. The evoked release of [3H]NA was strongly reduced by the preferential kappa-agonists ethylketocyclazocine, dynorphin A1-13, dynorphin A, trans-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl] -benzeneacetamide (U-50,488), and (-)-5,9-dimethyl-2'-OH-2-tetrahydrofurfuryl-6,7-benzomorphan [(-)-MR 2034], whereas (+)-MR 2035 [the (+)-enantiomer of (-)-MR 2034] was ineffective. In contrast, the preferential delta-agonists Leu-enkephalin, Met-enkephalin, and D-Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) as well as the mu-agonists morphine, normorphine, D-Ala2-Gly-ol5-enkephalin (DAGO), and beta-casomorphin 1-4 amide (morphiceptin) were much less potent. However, in similar experiments on rat hippocampal slices DAGO (1 microM) was much more potent than ethylketocyclazocine (1 microM) or DADLE (1 microM). (-)-N-(3-furylmethyl)-alpha-noretazocine [(-)-MR 2266], 1 microM, a preferential kappa-antagonist, antagonized the effect of ethylketocyclazocine more potently than (-)-naloxone or (+)-MR 2267 [the (+)-enantiomer of (-)-MR 2266]. Given alone, (-)-MR 2266 slightly and (+)-MR 2267 (1 microM each) greatly enhanced NA release, apparently due to alpha 2-adrenoceptor blockade since their effects were completely abolished in the presence of yohimbine (0.1 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
