This post mortem immunohistochemical study examined the localization and distribution of ubiquilin-1 (UBL), a shuttle protein which interacts with ubiquitin and the proteasome, in the hippocampus from Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia cases, and age-matched cases without dementia. In Braak stages 0-I-II cases, UBL immunoreactivity was detected in a dense fiber network in the neuropil, and in the cell cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of neurons in Cornu Ammonis (CA) fields and dentate gyrus granular neurons. In Braak stages III-IV and V-VI cases, UBL immunoreactivity was reduced in the neuropil and in the cytoplasm of the majority of CA1 neurons; some CA1 pyramidal neurons and the majority of CA2/3 pyramidal, CA4 multipolar, and dentate granular neurons had markedly increased UBL immunoreactivity in the nucleoplasm. Dual immunofluorescence analysis of UBL and antibody clone AT8 revealed co-localization most frequently in CA1 pyramidal neurons in Braak stage III-IV and V-VI cases. Further processing using the pan-amyloid marker X-34 revealed prominent UBL/X-34 dual labeling of extracellular NFT confined to the CA1/subiculum in Braak stage V-VI cases. Our results demonstrate that in AD hippocampus, early NFT changes are associated with neuronal up-regulation of UBL in nucleoplasm, or its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The perseverance of UBL changes in CA2/3, CA4 and dentate gyrus, generally considered as more resistant to NFT pathology, but not in the CA1, may mark a compensatory, potentially protective response to increased tau phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons; the failure of such a response may contribute to neuronal degeneration in end-stage AD.
