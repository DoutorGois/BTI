Fatty acid sensitive neurons located in hypothalamus, hippocampus or striatum are able to detect daily variations of plasma fatty acid levels. Thus, these neurons play a role to regulate energy balance by controling food intake, insulin secretion or hepatic glucose production. Molecular mechanisms that mediate fatty acid effects include receptor FAT (fatty acid transporter)/CD36. Deregulation of this brain lipid sensing may be an early event leading to further dysfunction of energy balance leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes.
