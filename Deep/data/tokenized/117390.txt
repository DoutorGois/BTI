Evoked reactions of the hypothalamic arcuate and medial preoptic nuclei neurons were recorded when the hippocampus was stimulated by single stimuli in anaesthetized rats. In the arcuate nucleus phasic responses and primary inhibition were found to be dominant and in the medial preoptic nucleus--both phasic and nonspecifical responses. After injection of the horseradish peroxidase into the stimulated hippocampal region stained cells were found in the nuclei of the mammillary complex, mediobasal hypothalamus and in the medial preoptic nucleus. Groups of stained neurons were observed in the periphery of ventro- and dorsomedial, lateral and mammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus. In all the studied structures, except the medial mammillary nucleus, reticular-like cells were found alongside with spindle-like and triangle neurons. The data obtained are discussed in connection with the problem of hypothalamo-hippocampal interaction.
