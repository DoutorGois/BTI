Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were raised against the hippocampal homogenate of young rats and classified into three types by immunohistochemical analysis: (1) MAbs specific for a granular structure observed within neurons, (2) MAbs specific for neuronal cell surface and cell body, and (3) MAbs specific for both neurons and astroglial cells. One MAb (2D11-7) specifically reacted with granular structures observed in neurons. A specific protein antigen was purified from rat homogenate by immunoadsorbent assay with MAb 2D11-7. Amino acid sequencing followed by lysyl endopeptidase digestion of the proteins in the eluate demonstrated that the antigens recognized by MAb 2D11-7 were E2 components of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. The cell specificity and age dependency of these proteins are also discussed.
