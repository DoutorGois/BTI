Changes in synaptic efficacy of the medial perforant pathway were studied after the long-term deprivation of the afferent inputs in hippocampus of rats under chloral hydrate or urethane anesthesia. Evoked field potential population spikes and population excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the dentate gyrus. The long-term deprivation obtained by cessation of stimulation of the tested input for up to 4 hours resulted in an enhancement (up to 190%, p < 0.01) of the population spike amplitude.
