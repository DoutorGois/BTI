The local cerebral bloodflow (LCBF) was studied by the hydrogen clearance technique in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) of rats with a deep stage of the informational pathology of behavior (IPB). The IPB was produced by the chronic negative emotional stress developed during the long period of testing delayed reactions (indirect variant: delay in 2-3 s) under conditions of time deficit between the signals (30 c) and high motivation level. A significant decrease in the LCBF level was demonstrated in the experimental group in comparison with the control animals. It is suggested that: (1) the decrease in the LCBF in the DH may be of a secondary character as a result of suppression of the functional activity of the DH by exposure to the chronic negative emotional stress; (2) it is not inconceivable that the LCBF decrease in the DH is of a primary character and may account for the dysfunction of this structure facilitating the emotional stress and its acquisition of pathogenic properties, thus being an important factor of the IPB formation.
