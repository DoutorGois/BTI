Recent findings demonstrate that synaptically released excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate activates receptors outside the immediate synaptic cleft and that the extent of such extrasynaptic actions is regulated by the high affinity glutamate uptake. The bulk of glutamate transporter systems are evenly distributed in the synaptic neuropil, and it is generally assumed that glutamate escaping the cleft affects pre- and postsynaptic receptors to a similar degree. To test whether this is indeed the case, we use quantitative electron microscopy and establish the stochastic pattern of glial occurrence in the three-dimensional (3D) vicinity of two common types of excitatory central synapses, stratum radiatum synapses in hippocampus and parallel fiber synapses in cerebellum. We find that the occurrence of glia postsynaptically is strikingly higher (3-4-fold) than presynaptically, in both types of synapses. To address the functional consequences of this asymmetry, we simulate diffusion and transport of synaptically released glutamate in these two brain areas using a detailed 3D compartmental model of the extracellular space with glutamate transporters arranged unevenly, in accordance with the obtained experimental data. The results predict that glutamate escaping the synaptic cleft is 2-4 times more likely to activate presynaptic compared to postsynaptic receptors. Simulations also show that postsynaptic neuronal transporters (EAAT4 type) at dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells exaggerate this asymmetry further. Our data suggest that the perisynaptic environment of these common central synapses favors fast presynaptic feedback in the information flow while preserving the specificity of the postsynaptic input.
