On the basis of both the authors' and published data, the structure and morphogenetic functions are analyzed for two zones of mammal brain during postnatal period: fascia dentata of hippocampus and cerebellar cortex. A conclusion is drawn that the local cambial zones arise in those brain regions which acquire in the process of morphogenesis a high degree of spatial separation from the ventricular zone. The main function of the cambial zones in question is the formation of a large number of microneurons during postnatal period.
