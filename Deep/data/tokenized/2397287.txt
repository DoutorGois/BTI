In the experiments on rats it was shown that the picrotoxin kindling, which consists of the progressive increasing of convulsive reactions during daily systemic administration of picrotoxin in subconvulsive dosages results also in the development of the pathologically enhanced defensive reactions. The destruction of hippocampal structures by kainic acid prevented the seizure syndrome, while their activation due to blood injection in hippocampus promoted its development; under these conditions the kindling of pathologically enhanced defensive reactions was not significantly changed. Bilateral amygdalar destruction significantly attenuated the development of pathologically increased defensive behavior; under these conditions the seizure syndrome was not significantly changed. The data are discussed on the theory of generator, and systemic mechanisms of neuropathologic syndromes and show that picrotoxin kindling results in the formation of two different pathologic systems which cause the development of two mentioned syndromes: seizure syndrome and syndrome of pathologically enhanced defensive behavior.
