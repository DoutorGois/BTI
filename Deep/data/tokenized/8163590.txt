The distribution of heat shock protein hsp70 mRNA after 10 min of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was investigated through in situ hybridization in transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) and in control nontransgenic (nTg) littermates. In the ischemic cortex of nTg mice, hsp70 mRNA was detected 1 h after reperfusion and was observed for up to 6 h. In Tg mice, however, it was still detectable within the cortex even at 24 h. In the caudate putamen, hsp70 mRNA appeared at 1 h and was present for up to 6 h in both nTg and Tg mice. Although hsp70 mRNA was detected in the thalamus only at 1 h in nTg mice, it was observed for up to 6 h in Tg mice. Similarly, hsp70 mRNA was detected in the hippocampus of nTg mice only at 1 h, whereas it was detected in Tg mice at 1 h and continued up to 24 h, with high intensity in the CA1 subfield. Despite the significant amounts of hsp70 mRNA in both Tg and nTg mice following ischemia, there was no observable neuronal necrosis (as assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining) for up to 7 days. Cortical cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry, did not differ between nTg and Tg mice during ischemia and reperfusion, despite exhibiting hyperemia following hypoperfusion. These results suggest that oxidative stress affects the expression of hsp70 following temporary focal ischemia. An alteration in oxidation stress, which resulted from reduced levels of superoxide radicals in the presence of the CuZn-SOD transgenes, may permit the prolonged expression of hsp70.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
