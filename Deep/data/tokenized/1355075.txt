Regional astrocyte cultures were derived by dissecting six regions; brain stem, cerebellum, mesencephalon, basal ganglia plus diencephalon, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, from 3 to 4-day-old neonatal rat brains. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the astrocyte composition of the cultures. The percentage of GFAP (+) cells between regions varied from 75% to 100%. Once confluent these cultures were incubated with radiolabeled serotonin or glutamate for uptake and autoradiographic studies. For the different brain regions Na(+)-dependent, [3H] L-glutamate, and fluoxetine-sensitive [3H] 5-HT uptake varied markedly. The relative order of uptake for [3H] 5-HT was MS (mesencephalon) greater than CC (cerebral cortex) greater than BG + DI (basal ganglia + diencephalon) greater than HP (hippocampus) greater than BS (brain stem) greater than CB (cerebellum). For [3H] L-glutamate the order was HP greater than CC greater than BG + DI greater than MS = BS greater than CB. For [3H] 5-HT this essentially corresponds to the reported order of binding in situ of the [3H] 5-HT-specific uptake ligand [3H] citalopram. For [3H] L-glutamate regional variation of the uptake for the different cultures corresponds to the regional uptake reported for different regions of rat brain. Double-label studies with GFAP and radiolabeled neurotransmitters were also used to study uptake into GFAP(+) astrocytes by autoradiography. Flat GFAP cells with or without processes comprised 65-98% of the cultures and represented most of the uptake. The percentage of all GFAP(+) cells that were positive for uptake of ARG varied from 50% to 90% and also showed differences in grain density both intra- and inter-regionally. These differences in transmitter uptake by GFAP(+) astrocytes in primary culture, which are dependent on the region of origin and correspond to regional differences in situ, suggest that such uptake in vitro may reflect uptake by astrocytes in vivo. Implied in this is that uptake by astrocytes represents a significant component of serotonin uptake in vivo.
