Noda epileptic rat (NER) is a mutant rat, found in a Crj: Wistar colony, which exhibits a tonic clonic convulsion spontaneously about once per 30 h from 14 weeks of age. We performed modified acoustic priming, that is, repeated weekly sound stimulations from 3 weeks of age. In addition, characteristics of audiogenic seizure (AGS), and ictal/interictal electroencephalograms (EEGs) were examined. We also studied the effect of repeated weekly stimulations from 14 weeks of age on AGS susceptibility in another NER. From 9 weeks of age, the NER primed from 3 weeks of age had a high incidence (100%) of AGS: a typical seizure was composed of sudden wild running and/or jumping (WRJ) followed by clonic or tonic-clonic convulsion. The severity and the duration of the AGS were intensified and prolonged with an increase in age, respectively. By contrast, the NER repeatedly stimulated from the age of 14 weeks, rarely showed AGS (20-40(%). The majority of the seizures in this NER were WRJ. The cortical and hippocampal EEG during the tonic convulsion showed a low-voltage spike-wave (5-7 Hz). This evolved into a high-amplitude spike- or polyspike-waves associated with the clonic convulsion. Immediately after cessation of the seizures, the EEG showed a flattening or diffuse slowing. In interictal EEG analysis, sporadic spikes predominantly in the hippocampus and spike-wave bursts in both the cortex and hippocampus occurred from 11 and 20 weeks of age, respectively. These results indicate that AGS susceptibility in NER can be induced consistently by modified acoustic priming and this rat strain is a new genetic model useful for experimental studies of human epilepsy.
