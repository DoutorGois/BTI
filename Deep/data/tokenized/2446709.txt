Substance P (SP) and substance K (SK) are structurally related peptides which are both encoded in the preprotachykinin A gene. The distribution of SP- and SK-like fibers and cell bodies in the rat hippocampus were studied by immunohistochemistry. The distribution of SK-like fibers was similar to that of SP-like fibers but there were few SK-like fibers. Fibers for both peptides were prominent in the dorsal and ventral subiculum and at the junction of CA2 and CA3. SP- and SK-like cell bodies were noted in the subiculum and in the stratum oriens of CA1 and CA2. SP- and SK-like cells were also noted in the ventral dentate gyrus but only SP-like cells were found in the dorsal dentate gyrus.
