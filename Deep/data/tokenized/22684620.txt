The detrimental role of leptin in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is opposite to its neuroprotective role in other neuropathologies. We hypothesize that a shifted cellular distribution of leptin receptors underlies the differential effects of leptin. A robust increase of ObR immunoreactivity was seen along glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)(+) intermediate filaments in reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of mice with EAE. Although astrocyte-specific GFAP mRNA and protein were both increased, ObRa mRNA was elevated only after resolution of EAE symptoms, and ObRb mRNA was even decreased at the peak time of symptoms of EAE. A cell type-specific action of leptin may underlie its differential effects.
