The primary function of neurons is to integrate synaptic inputs and to transmit the results to other cells. It was shown previously that separate excitatory inputs to hippocampal pyramidal neurons are summated nonlinearly. In the hippocampus, responses of pyramidal neurons are influenced by GABAergic inputs in feed-forward or feedback manner, and also by oscillatory network activities. It is likely that these GABAergic inputs regulate the way synaptic inputs are summated. To examine the roles of GABAergic inputs on synaptic summation, we made whole-cell recordings from the cell bodies of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices while stimulating two independent input pathways with short interstimulus intervals, and examined the manner by which postsynaptic potentials were summated. We found that: 1) the summation of the perforant pathway and the Schaffer collateral pathway inputs was sublinear when the interval between two inputs was shorter than 30 ms, 2) the blockade of GABA(A) receptors partially suppressed the sublinearity, and 3) further blockade of GABA(B) receptors removed the sublinearity totally. We also found that 4) the summation was superlinear under the concomitant blockade of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors when the two inputs arrived with no delay. Thus our study demonstrates that GABAergic inputs are responsible for keeping the summation of two separate inputs on CA1 pyramidal neurons sublinear.
