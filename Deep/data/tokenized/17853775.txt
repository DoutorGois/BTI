The regeneration of the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) requires changes of the nonpromising environment. Applying peripheral nerve grafts and their extracts are both the useful method to induce regeneration of injured CNS neurites. Our previous reports showed that degeneration of peripheral nerves enhanced their neurotrophic activity in a time-dependent manner. Electrophoretical analysis of proteins obtained from degenerating sciatic nerves revealed significant changes in fractions of low molecular mass. The aim of the present work was to examine the influence of fractionated extracts from 7-day-predegenerated and non-predegenerated peripheral nerves upon injured hippocampal neurites in adult rats. The extracts were closed in fibrin-filled connective tissue chambers (CTC) or within CTC-wrapped polymer hollow fibers (PHF) of 30 kDa cut-off. The cell bodies of regrowing fibers were labeled with FITC-HRP. The CTCs appeared to be useful tool for implantation of artificial grafts into mammalian CNS. Full-spectrum nerve extracts induced strong regeneration of injured hippocampal neurites. The number of labeled cells within hippocampus was significantly lower in PHF groups than in CTC ones, indicating that low-mass proteins present in peripheral nerve extracts are not sufficient to induce successful regeneration.
