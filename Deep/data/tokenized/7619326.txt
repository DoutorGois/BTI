Two groups of rats--1 with electrolytic lesions of the hippocampus and 1 consisting of sham-operated controls--received flavor-aversion conditioning with 2 flavors. All subjects had received prior nonreinforced exposure to Flavor A. Latent inhibition was apparent in slower acquisition of the aversion to Flavor A than to Flavor B. Hippocampal lesions had no effect on acquisition to the nonpreexposed Flavor B but produced a marked enhancement of the latent inhibition effect. The contrast between this result and previous findings of an attenuation of latent inhibition in subjects with hippocampal lesions is discussed.
