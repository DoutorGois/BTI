Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity increased in rat septum 2 weeks after a transient forebrain ischemia. Extracts were prepared from hippocampus in which CA1 pyramidal neurons had been selectively destroyed by the ischemic insult. ChAT activity in septal neuronal cultures treated with these extracts for 6 days was significantly higher than that in control cultures.
