Acidic amino acid antagonists were tested for their ability to block depolarizations produced by excitatory amino acids in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in hippocampal slices. 2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB) and serine-O-phosphate (SOP), potent synaptic blockers of the lateral perforant path input to this system, are moderately selective antagonists of kainate and N-methyl-DL-aspartate depolarizations, but not depolarizations produced by L-glutamate, quisqualate, or serine-O-sulfate. N-Methyl-DL-aspartate responses were potently blocked by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate, but this antagonist is less potent than APB or SOP against the synaptic response.
