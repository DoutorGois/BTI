Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-metabolizing enzyme of acetylcholine, is presently the most important therapeutic target for development of cognitive enhancers. However, AChE activity in brain has not been properly evaluated on the basis of age and sex. In the present study, AChE activity was investigated in different brain areas in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats of adult (3 months) and old (18-22 months) age. AChE was assayed spectrophotometrically by modified Ellman's method. Specific activity (micromoles/min/mg of protein) of AChE was assayed in salt soluble (SS) and detergent soluble (DS) fractions of various brain areas, which consists of predominantly G1 and G4 molecular isoforms of AChE respectively. The old male rats showed a decrease (40-55%) in AChE activity in frontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and pons in DS fraction and there was no change in SS fraction in comparison to adult rats. In the old female rats the activity was decreased (25-40%) in frontal cortex, cerebral cortex, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum and medulla in DS fraction whereas in SS fraction the activity was decreased only in hypothalamus as compared to adult. On comparing with old male rats, old female rats showed increase in AChE activity in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus of DS fraction and decrease in hypothalamus of SS fraction. There was a significant increase in AChE activity in DS fraction of cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus and cerebellum in female as compared to male adult rats. However, no significant change in AChE activity was found in the SS fraction, except hypothalamus between these groups. Thus it appears that age alters AChE activity in different brain regions predominantly in DS fraction (G4 isoform) that may vary in male and female. These observations have significant relevance to age related cognitive deficits and its pharmacotherapy.
