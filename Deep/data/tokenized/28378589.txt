Zn(2+) has remarkable impacts on amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) aggregation, which is crucial in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. However, the Zn(2+) concentration in human cerebrospinal fluid is commonly too low for interaction with Abeta, and only during neurotransmission is there a transient release of a high concentration of Zn(2+). It is difficult to explore the details of the interaction between Zn(2+) and Abeta within such a short time scale by using ordinary analytical methods. Herein, stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the fast aggregation kinetics of Abeta42 in the presence of Zn(2+) in the time scale from 1 ms to seconds. It was found that Zn(2+) bound to Abeta42 within 1 ms; caused immediate conformational transition around Tyr10, which led to the enhancement of Abeta42 hydrophobicity; and then promoted fast aggregation of Abeta42 through enhanced hydrophobic interactions. Among the two Zn(2+)-binding sites on Abeta42 (KD = 107 nM and 5.2 muM), the first one of higher affinity had a greater impact on the aggregation of Abeta42. Three kinetic phases were observed in the Zn(2+)-induced fast aggregation of Abeta42, and the fast phase was extremely accelerated by Zn(2+), indicating that accelerated aggregation mainly occurred in the fast phase. The reactions occurring in this phase were closely related to the association of Zn(2+) and Abeta42. Moreover, Zn(2+) largely broadened the pH range of Abeta42 fast aggregation from pH 5.2-6.2 without Zn(2+) to pH 5.2-7.8 in the presence of Zn(2+). Besides, the promoting effect of Zn(2+) on Abeta42 fast aggregation peaked at pH 6.8-7.8, which includes the pH values of the cerebrospinal fluid (pH 7.3) and hippocampus (pH 7.15-7.35). The findings demonstrate the significant effect of Zn(2+) on Abeta aggregation and provide new insight into its mechanisms.
