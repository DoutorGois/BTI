The temporal medial sclerosis (TMS) is characterized by hippocampal sclerosis in temporal and by distinguished grades of injury near to other neurological structures such as: amygdaloid nucleus, parahippocampal girus and entorhinal region. The study analyzed 40 patients with TMS and 40 people from the control cluster. All the cases were appreciated by one method for measurement of insula's cortex (E-Film) and another method to calculate the insula's volume (Neuroline). There is no variation statistical between the insula's volume and insula's measurement for the two clusters. This paper didn't show the insula's morphological variation when these two groups were compared.
