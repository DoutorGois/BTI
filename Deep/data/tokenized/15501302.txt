Our studies aimed at investigating whether the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nifedipine, could prevent anxiogenic-like consequences of diazepam withdrawal in rats. Animals withdrawn from chronic diazepam (2 mg/kg/day i.p. for 2 weeks) drank significantly less water than did control rats in the unfamiliar arm of a Y maze. This anxiogenic-like effect could be prevented by acute administration of nifedipine (at 10 mg/kg i.p., but not at lower doses), which, on its own, did not change water intake in naive rats. Given chronically in combination with diazepam for the second half of a 2-week treatment with this drug, nifedipine (at the daily dose of 5 mg/kg i.p.) also suppressed the reduction of water intake normally observed on diazepam withdrawal. Biochemical measurements showed that acutely, as well as chronically, administered nifedipine increased 5-HT turnover in the hippocampus of diazepam-treated rats, thereby suggesting that the prevention of diazepam withdrawal-induced anxiogenic behaviour by the calcium antagonist might be underlain by serotoninergic mechanisms.
