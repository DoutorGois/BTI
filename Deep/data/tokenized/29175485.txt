Continuous running wheel (RW) exercise increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of rodents. Evidence suggests that greater amounts of RW exercise does not always equate to more adult-generated neurons in hippocampus. It can also be argued that continuous access to a RW results in exercise levels not representative of human exercise patterns. This study tested if RW paradigms that more closely represent human exercise patterns (e.g. shorter bouts, alternating daily exercise) alter neurogenesis. Neurogenesis was measured by examining the survival and fate of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled proliferating cells in the DG of male Sprague-Dawley rats after acute (14days) or chronic (30days) RW access. Rats were assigned to experimental groups based on the number of hours that they had access to a RW over two days: 0h, 4h, 8h, 24h, and 48h. After acute RW access, rats that had unlimited access to the RW on alternating days (24h) had a stronger neurogenic response compared to those rats that ran modest distances (4h, 8h) or not at all (0h). In contrast, following chronic RW access, rats that ran a moderate amount (4h, 8h) had significantly more surviving cells compared to 0h, 24h, and 48h. Linear regression analysis established a negative relationship between running distance and surviving BrdU+ cells in the chronic RW access cohort (R(2)=0.40). These data demonstrate that in rats moderate amounts of RW exercise are superior to continuous daily RW exercise paradigms at promoting hippocampal neurogenesis in the long-term.
