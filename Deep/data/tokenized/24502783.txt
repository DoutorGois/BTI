Representation of head direction in medial entorhinal cortex shows a gradient of precision, from high directional precision dorsally to low ventrally; this parallels the gradient of spatial scale in place and grid cells, and suggests that the brain constructs spatial maps of varying resolution, perhaps to serve different requirements.
