St. John's wort has been the subject of studies focused on its therapeutic properties against several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), a critical peptide in AD, has been linked to the mitochondrial dysfunction often observed in this disease. Despite many efforts to prevent Abeta levels from increasing in AD, less has been done regarding the mitochondrial component. Therefore, we studied the effects of tetrahydrohyperforin (THH) on mitochondrial dysfunction of hippocampal neurons, challenged with Abeta oligomers (Abetao) and Abetao-AChE complexes. We show that THH prevents mitochondrial calcium overload and induces the modulation of fusion-fission events, arresting mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, our results suggest that the modulation of mitochondrial dynamics probably occurs through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1alpha-mediated mechanism, inducing mitochondrial fusion-fission protein expression. Our results offer further explanation for the effects observed for THH and the beneficial effects of this ethno-botanical drug in AD.
