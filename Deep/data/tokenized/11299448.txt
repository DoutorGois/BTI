We report on a patient presenting Pick's disease similar to the one reported by Pick in 1892, with ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions. His diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical (language disturbance and behavioural disorders), neuropsychological (progressive aphasia of the expression type and late mutism), neuroimaging with magnetic resonance (bilateral frontal and temporal lobes atrophy) and brain single photon emission computed tomography (frontal and temporal lobes hypoperfusion) studies. Macroscopic examination showed atrophy on the frontal and temporal lobes. The left hippocampus displayed a major circumscribed atrophy. The diagnostic confirmation was made by the neuropathological findings of the autopsy that showed neuronal loss with gliosis of the adjacent white matter and apearance of status spongiosus in the middle frontal and especially in the upper temporal lobes. There were also neuronal swelling (ballooned cell) and argyrophilic inclusions (Pick's bodies) in the left and right hippocampi. Anti-ubiquitin reaction tested positive and anti-tau tested negative.
