OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic effect of recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying anti-amyloid beta peptide single-chain antibody gene on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in animal models. METHODS: The recombinant adeno-associated viruses were injected to the leg muscle of mutant amyloid precursor protein transgenic AD mice. The latency of the mice in Morris water maze was tested before and 3, 7, 10 months after drug administration. The animal brains were harvested 10 months after drug administration and sectioned for amyloid plaques staining. RESULTS: The learning and memory abilities of AD model mice were improved significantly 3 months after gene drug administration. Ten months after gene therapy, the numbers of amyloid plaque in hippocampus of model mice decreased. CONCLUSION: The adeno-associated virus carrying anti-amyloid beta peptide single-chain antibody gene has therapeutic effect on AD in model mice.
