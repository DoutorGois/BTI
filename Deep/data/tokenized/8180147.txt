Incorporation of labelled thymidine into DNA of different rat brain regions was studied after 30 min of forebrain ischaemia and recirculation periods up to 24 hours. The amount of label incorporated into DNA showed a different pattern in the brain. After 1 hour of recirculation, the incorporation was reduced in the cortex and in the striatum, without any significant change in the hippocampus. After 3 to 9 hours the incorporation remained depressed in the cortex, diminished in the hippocampus, and increased by 2-2.5 fold in the striatum. Later, after 24 hours, the DNA labelling returned to control values in the striatum and in the cortex, but was increased in the hippocampus.
