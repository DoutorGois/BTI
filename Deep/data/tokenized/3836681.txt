Exposure to air ions has been reported to influence serotonin (5HT), although critical reviews of these studies and previous measurements in our laboratory of the concentration, release, and utilization of brain 5HT indicate that neither the data nor the interpretations of the data are particularly convincing. Measurements of other possibly relevant neurotransmitter systems--norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA)--were made in brain regions selected because of their importance in the modulation of brain functions relating to motivation, arousal, endocrine function, and motor activity, all responses that have been reported to be influenced by air ion exposure. Results indicate that exposure of male Holtzman rats to high concentrations (5.0 X 10(5)/cm3) of positive or negative air ions or to DC electric fields (3.0 kV/m) for periods up to 66 h failed to affect the concentration of NE or DA significantly in any of the brain regions.
