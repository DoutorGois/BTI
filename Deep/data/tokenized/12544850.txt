We compared beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) levels in the serum, CSF and brain (hippocampus) and correlated these with spatial learning in APP+PS1 transgenic mice. Compared with non-transgenic littermates, male 14-month-old APP + PS1 mice were impaired in spatial learning in the water maze. Among the APP + PS1 mice, only the hippocampal insoluble Abeta42 level correlated with spatial memory (r = -0.44). The levels of insoluble Abeta40 and Abeta42 were highly correlated (r = 0.92), and also correlated with soluble hippocampal Abeta42 (r = 0.64/0.69), which further correlated with the CSF Abeta42 (r = 0.52). None of these parameters correlated with serum Abeta40 levels. These findings support the role of insoluble Abeta42 in memory dysfunction and suggest a model with several pools (insoluble, extracellular soluble, CSF) of Abeta being in partial equilibrium with each other.
