Adenosine is acknowledged to have a primarily inhibitory function in the central nervous system, but is believed to have little effect on inhibitory neurones themselves. It is, however, difficult to determine the effect of adenosine on inhibitory synaptic potentials since adenosine directly depresses evoked potentials and, in the presence of bicuculline to block GABAA-mediated inhibition, the bicuculline-resistant fraction of paired-pulse inhibition (ppi) is greater between pairs of small potentials than between pairs of larger potentials. Here, adenosine increased bicuculline-resistant ppi when stimulus strength was constant between adenosine and control but ppi of responses in adenosine was markedly less than ppi of control responses of the same size. Adenosine had less effect on the size of 'conditioned' potentials than on control potentials. It is concluded that adenosine can reduce the bicuculline-resistant fraction of paired-pulse inhibition in the hippocampus. Further quantitative comparison of the effects of adenosine on ppi and on single evoked potentials excluded a difference in the potency of adenosine at excitatory and inhibitory terminals as an explanation for this activity. The results suggest that adenosine may diminish bicuculline-resistant paired-pulse inhibition by enhancing a simultaneous facilitatory component of the neuronal responses.
