We used tritiated amino acids to study projections to the basilar pons from prestriate cortices in 18 rhesus monkeys to determine how connectional and functional heterogeneity of these regions are reflected in corticopontine circuitry. Fibers travelled with those from other parasensory associative cortices before terminating in the pontine nuclei. Prelunate projections were derived from area 19 (OA) at the medial convexity (including areas V3 and PO) and from the lateral convexity dorsal to the caudal tip of the Sylvian fissure (including areas DP and the dorsal part of area V4d). Pontine projections also arose from area 19 (OA), and areas TF, TL, and TH in the posterior aspect of the parahippocampal gyrus. No pontine projections arose from the prelunate convexity ventral to the caudal tip of the Sylvian fissure (ventral part of area V4d and area V4v), area TEO, the inferior temporal gyrus, or the lateral ventral temporal region. Terminations in the pons were distributed in the dorsolateral and lateral nuclei, and the lateral part of the peripeduncular nucleus. Medial convexity injections produced more extensive rostrocaudal pontine labeling, as well as terminations in the extreme dorsolateral nucleus and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Dorsal prelunate injections had additional terminations in the ventral pontine nucleus. Posterior parahippocampal gyrus injections resulted in discrete label in the lateral and dorsolateral nuclei. Corticopontine projections destined for the cerebellum appear to be derived from extrastriate areas concerned mainly with visual spatial parameters, visual motion, and the peripheral field of vision, but not from areas subserving visual object identification and the central field of vision. Pontine afferents from the posterior parahippocampal gyrus may facilitate a cerebellar contribution to visual spatial memory, particularly when invested with motivational valence.
