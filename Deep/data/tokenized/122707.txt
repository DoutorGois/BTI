The physiological development of potentiating processes in the rat dentate gyrus were compared to morphological development. Rapid Golgi techniques were coupled with in vitro studies of dentate granule cell frequency potentiation, post-tetanic potentiation and long-term potentiation. Frequency potentiation and long-term potentiation exhibited a developmental progression between 7 and 210 days postnatal. Posttetanic potentiation remained constant across this period. The relation of these findings to synaptogenesis and dendritic spine formation are discussed.
