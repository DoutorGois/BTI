We analyzed the effect of glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on changes in functional bioelectric and calcium activity in dissociated hippocampal cell cultures under conditions of modeled acute normobaric hypoxia in vitro. GDNF (1 ng/ml) partially neutralized the negative effects of hypoxia on cell survival and parameters of functional network activity. GDNF exhibited a pronounced anti-hypoxic effect.
