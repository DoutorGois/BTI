The aim of the study was to analyze the intrauterine and postpartal effects of Chloroquine on the dendritic maturation in the hippocampus and on the expression of GABA within hippocampal interneurons of the stratum moleculare. Fifty-nine brains of rat fetus on day 22 of gestation and 37 brains from rats from postnatal day P7 were examined. We found changes in the cytoarchitecture of hippocampal CA3 neurons on P7 day. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a significant increase of the length of the apical shafts, apical dendrites and basal dendrites of the CA3 neurons (p < 0.05) under doses comparable to serum levels reached during long-term therapy. Furthermore, an early reduction of GABA-expressing interneurons of the hippocampal striatum moleculare was observed.
