SEC14 and Spectrin domain-1 (Sestd1) is a synapse protein that exhibits a striking shift from the presynaptic to postsynaptic space as neurons mature postnatally in the mouse hippocampus. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons from mice with global genetic deletion of Sestd1 have reduced dendrite arbors, spines, and excitatory synapses. Electrophysiologically this correlates with cell-autonomous reductions in both AMPA- and NMDA-excitatory postsynaptic currents in individual hippocampal neurons from which Sestd1 has been deleted in vivo. These neurodevelopmental and functional deficits are associated with increased activation of the Rho family GTPases Rac1 and RhoA. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry reveal that the Breakpoint Cluster Region protein, a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP), forms complexes with Sestd1 in brain tissue. This complements earlier findings that Sestd1 can also partner with other Rho family GAPs and guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Our findings demonstrate that Sestd1 is a developmentally dynamic synaptic regulator of Rho GTPases that contributes to dendrite and excitatory synapse formation within differentiating pyramidal neurons of the forebrain.
