Microglia are important in the inflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We showed previously that macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), encoded by the c-fms protooncogene, is overexpressed on microglia surrounding amyloid beta (Abeta) deposits in the APP(V717F) mouse model for AD. The M-CSFR is also increased on microglia after experimental brain injury and in AD. To determine the relevance of these findings, we transiently expressed M-CSFR on murine BV-2 and human SV-A3 microglial cell lines using an SV40-promoted c-fms construct. M-CSFR overexpression resulted in microglial proliferation and increased expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-alpha, and interleukin-6 and of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) itself. Antibody neutralization of M-CSF showed that the M-CSFR-induced proinflammatory response was dependent on M-CSF in the culture media. By using a co-culture of c-fms-transfected murine microglia and rat organotypic hippocampal slices and a species-specific real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we showed that M-CSFR overexpression on exogenous microglia induced expression of interleukin-1alpha by the organotypic culture. These results show that increased M-CSFR expression induces microglial proliferation, cytokine expression, and a paracrine inflammatory response, suggesting that in APP(V717F) mice increased M-CSFR on microglia could be an important factor in Abeta-induced inflammatory response.
