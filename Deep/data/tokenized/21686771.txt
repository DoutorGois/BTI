The authors report a patient with limbic encephalitis associated with an ovarian teratoma. An antibody against the membranes of neurones of the hippocampus was identified in both serum and CSF. Immunosuppressive treatments such as plasmapheresis and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin administration resulted in a rapid clinical recovery.
