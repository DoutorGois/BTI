Western blot analysis was performed by using a specific antibody to measure annexin IV in human postmortem brain samples from alcoholic subjects. The analysis showed a significantly augmented expression in the hippocampus compared with controls, whereas the expression in the frontal cortex was equivalent in both groups. Annexin IV expression in the occipital cortex tended to increase in alcoholics. It was shown further that autoantibodies to annexin IV were increased significantly in alcoholic patients compared with controls. Thus, annexin IV may become a novel biological marker for alcoholics.
