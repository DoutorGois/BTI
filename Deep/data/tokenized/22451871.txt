The effect of moderate hypobaric hypoxia on the expression of a peptide antioxidant Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in rat hippocampal neurons was evaluated in an immunocytochemical study. The expression of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase decreased significantly in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1 and CA2) and tended to decrease in ventral regions (CA3 and dentate gyrus) by the 24th hour after 3-fold exposure to hypoxia.
