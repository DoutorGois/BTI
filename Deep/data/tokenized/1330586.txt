The effect of CO2 inhalation on the function of the GABA(A)-coupled chloride channel was evaluated in rat brain. This treatment decreased the capability of GABA to stimulate 36Cl- uptake and produced a significant increase of [35S]-TBPS ([35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate) binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. These results demonstrate that a brief exposure of rats to CO2 inhalation reduces the function of the GABA(A)-ionophore receptor complex in rat brain.
