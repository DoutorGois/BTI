High-frequency electrical stimulation in the entorhinal-dentate pathway of male Wistar rats was found to increase the amplitudes of the population spikes recorded from granule cells located in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. This increase in synaptic efficacy attenuated the gastric ulceration produced by cold restraint. It was suggested that this limbic system structure modulates the ability to cope with environmental demands.
