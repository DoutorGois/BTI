The effects of pulsed direct current (dc) electric fields on the frequency of spontaneous bursting in a model epileptic focus were studied. The high potassium hippocampal slice model was used to generate spontaneous burst firing activity similar to interictal spikes in the pyramidal cell layer of CA3. Electric fields were generated from platinum subdural electrodes placed in the perfusion bath. Three hundred and seventy-eight experimental trials were performed on 10 hippocampal slices from 10 rats and the effects of field polarity, field strength and duration of stimuli on firing frequency was examined. Hippocampal slices were oriented horizontally with the CA3 layer towards the positive electrode, the average interburst interval did not correlate significantly with polarity of the delivering pulses (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.96). Average interburst interval showed a significant correlation with pulse duration of 200 and 400 msec (p = 0.030 and p = 0.004, respectively). As a function of field strength, there were significant average interval changes for fields of 33, 46, and 73 mV/mm (p = 0.024, p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, CA3 burst firing activity in high potassium concentration can therefore be altered by electric fields.
