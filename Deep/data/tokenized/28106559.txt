ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apolipoproteins and regulates the generation of high density lipoproteins. Previously, we have shown that lack of Abca1 significantly increases amyloid deposition and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease model mice expressing human amyloid-beta protein precursor (APP). The goal of this study was to determine if ABCA1 plays a role in memory deficits caused by amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers and examine neurite architecture of pyramidal hippocampal neurons. Our results confirm previous findings that Abca1 deficiency significantly impairs spatial memory acquisition and retention in the Morris water maze and long-term memory in novel object recognition of APP transgenic mice at a stage of early amyloid pathology. Neither test demonstrated a significant difference between Abca1ko and wild-type (WT) mice. We also examined the effect of intra-hippocampal infused Abeta oligomers on cognitive performance of Abca1ko mice, compared to control infusion of scrambled Abeta peptide. Age-matched WT mice undergoing the same infusions were also used as controls. In this model system, we found a statistically significant difference between WT and Abca1ko mice infused with scrambled Abeta, suggesting that Abca1ko mice are vulnerable to the effect of mild stresses. Moreover, examination of neurite architecture in the hippocampi revealed a significant decrease in neurite length, number of neurite segments, and branches in Abca1ko mice when compared to WT mice. We conclude that mice lacking ABCA1 have basal cognitive deficits that prevent them from coping with additional stressors, which is in part due to impairment of neurite morphology in the hippocampus.
