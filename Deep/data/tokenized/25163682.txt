Stillen has been used to treat patients with gastric mucosal ulcers and has an anti-inflammatory effect. It is well-known that neuro-inflammatory reactions are related to depression. Here we evaluated the antidepressant-like effect of Stillen on mice subjected to the forced swimming test (FST). Stillen and eupatilin (a major component of Stillen) significantly decreased immobility times compared with the FST control group. In the Stillen-administered group, increased levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein were observed in the hippocampus. Nissl bodies also increased in the hippocampus neuronal cytoplasm of the Stillen-administered group. Stillen decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (at the mRNA and protein levels) in the hippocampus and serum, compared with the control group. In addition, the mRNA expression of estrogen receptor-beta increased after Stillen administration in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that Stillen should be viewed as a candidate antidepressant.
