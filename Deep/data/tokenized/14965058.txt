The effect of streptozotocin-induced diabetes on glial intermediate filament and behavioral reactions of rats was investigated. The water Morris test shows cognitive deficit in diabetic rats. The results of an immunoblot show both an increase in GFAP degradation and an increase in common GFAP amount in the brain of diabetic rats. The observations presented here suggest that diabetes induces the changes in activity of GFAP-positive glial cells. Such glial cells may be considered a key element in plasticity of nervous system. These results suggest that the impairment of learning and memory is accompanied by glial cytoskeletal reconstruction.
