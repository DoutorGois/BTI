OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of naoyian (NYA) on the expression of phosph-Akt in neural stem cells injured with anoxia. METHODS: The hippocampal neural stem cells (NSC) taken from the Sprageu-Dawley rat brain at 5 days after birth were cultured in DMEM/F12 solution containing EGF and bFGF. After being treated with anoxia for 6 hours, the neural stem cells were incubated in solution containing the NYA serum or normal serum. The neural stem cells were then detected for phosph-Akt and TUNEL stain. RESULTS: After the neural stem cells were injured with anoxia, the expression of the phosph-Akt in NYA serum group was higher than that in the normal serum group and the serum-free group. Treated with NYA serum, the amount of apoptotic NSC decreased. CONCLUSION: After the neural stem cell injured by anoxia was treated with NYA serum, the phosphorylation of Akt increased, the apoptosis of NSC was inhibited.
