Infusion of 192 IgG-saporin (SAP) into the medial septum (MS) of rats selectively destroys cholinergic neurons projecting to the hippocampus and impairs acquisition of a delayed matching to position (DMP) T-maze task. The present study evaluated whether introduction of a mild aversive stimulus 30 min prior to training would attenuate the deficit in DMP acquisition caused by the SAP lesions. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received medial septal infusions of either artificial cerebrospinal fluid or SAP (0.22 microg in 1.0 microl). Fourteen days later, all animals were trained to perform the DMP task. Half of the SAP-treated animals and controls received an intraperitoneal injection of saline each day, 30 min prior to training. Results show that intraperitoneal saline attenuated the impairment in DMP acquisition in SAP lesioned rats. These results suggest that a mild aversive stimulus can attenuate cognitive deficits caused by medial septal cholinergic lesions.
