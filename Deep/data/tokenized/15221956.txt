The organization of the pigeon hippocampal formation was examined by tract tracing by using biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and by injections of kainic acid to produce excitotoxic lesions. The hippocampal formation was divided into seven subdivisions based on Nissl staining and intrinsic and septal connections: dorsomedial (DM), dorsolateral (DL), triangular (Tr), V-shaped layer, magnocellular (Ma), parvocellular, and cell-poor regions. DL was composed of dorsal and ventral portions and sent associational fibers to DM, the V-shaped layer, and Tr. DL had strong reciprocal connections with the densocellular part of the hyperpallium (HD) and projected to the dorsolateral corticoid area. DM had reciprocal fiber connections with the V-shaped layer, Ma, and DL as well as with several subdivisions of the arcopallium. DL and DM, but not the V-shaped layer, projected fibers to the septum where those from DM exceeded in number those from DL. These projections further extended to the hypothalamus, particularly the lateral hypothalamic area. The lateral and medial septal nuclei projected back a very small number of ascending fibers to the hippocampal formation. Intraventricular injections of kainic acid induced neuronal loss widely in the hippocampal formation and subsequently produced gliosis in DM. These results indicate that DL receives its main afferents from HD and in turn sends inputs to an intrinsic circuit composed of hippocampal subdivisions DM, Ma, Tr, and the V-shaped layer; and also that DM is the main exit to the septum and hypothalamus. It is suggested that neurons in the V-shaped layer are intrinsic. Together, the results suggest that the V-shaped layer is comparable to the dentate gyrus of the mammalian hippocampal formation and that DM incorporates components comparable to both Ammon's horn and the subiculum.
