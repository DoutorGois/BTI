Hippocampal place cells can process the environmental inputs and make up a cognitive map in the hippocampus, or strengthen the synaptic connections within an association cortical cell assembly,thus creating a permanent engram for a spatial site. Outputs from the hippocampus are then integrated with other inputs within the nucleus accumbens and finally initiate a goal-directed behavior through the motor circuit.
