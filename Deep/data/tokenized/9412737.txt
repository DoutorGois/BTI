We unilaterally destroyed the nasal radix of rat embryos on day 15.5 of gestation (E15.5) in utero so as to block the olfactory inputs to the ipsilateral forebrain vesicle. The embryonic brains were examined after 6 days' survival (E21.5). In the deafferented half of the brain, LHRH neurons were significantly reduced in number, indicating the successful blocking of the olfactory input. On the deafferented side, the olfactory bulb failed to develop, and the telencephalic hemisphere, small in size, accompanied various histogenetic retardations in the primary olfactory cortex, in the cortical plate, and in the hippocampal formation. The striatum revealed remarkable structural differences between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides: on the ipsilateral side, the striatum was small in size and displayed numerical reductions of immunoreactive tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) fibers and substance P (SP) neurons in comparison with those in the contralateral one; in the substantia nigra, TH neurons and SP fibers were less numerous on the deafferented side. There were no remarkable differences in the distribution of TH neurons in the hypothalamus. In view of these sequential histogenetic alterations, it can be assumed that the olfactory inputs play a key role in the telencephalic morphogenesis.
