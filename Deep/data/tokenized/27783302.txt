The peculiarities in expression of transport proteins and the proteins implicated in the control of glycolysis by the cellular components of neurovascular units were examined in animals of different age under normal conditions and after modeled perinatal stress or hypoxic brain injury. In both cases, the specialties in expression of transport proteins in ontogenesis were revealed. The perinatal hypoxic brain injury resulted in up-regulation of MCT1, MCT4, and GLUT4 expression in endotheliocytes of hippocampal microvessels accompanied by transient elevation of HIF-1alpha and GSK3 expression.
