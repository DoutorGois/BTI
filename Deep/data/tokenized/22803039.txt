Administration of anticonvulsant sodium valproate alleviated audiogenic seizures in Krushinskii-Molodkina rats, which was accompanied by a decrease in cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein MAP2 in the hippocampus ex vivo. In contrast, audiogenic kindling resulted in a marked increase in MAP2 phosphorylation at cAMP-dependent protein kinase-specific sites. These changes in the state of MAP2 phosphorylation providing restructuring of dendrites in response to specific influences modulate neuronal activity and are the important mechanisms of neuronal plasticity.
