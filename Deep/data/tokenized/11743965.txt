We studied the distribution of the calcium binding proteins calretinin and calbindin in the hippocampal formation of the rat brain by means of double-label immunofluorescence - confocal laser scanning microscopy. Colocalization of calretinin and calbindin occurred mostly in large neurons located in the alveus and stratum oriens of field CA1. Some double-labeled cells were observed in the transition area between field CA1 and the subiculum. Finally, double-labeled cells were present in the deep layer of the ventral subiculum. The cells in field CA1 co-expressing both proteins resemble neurons which in neurophysiological experiments by others have been identified as O-LM cells, and we believe that these co-expressing cells should be considered a distinct subpopulation of the calretinin and calbindin populations of GABAergic hippocampal interneurons.
