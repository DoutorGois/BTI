Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors before tetanic stimulation blocks long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This NMDA-mediated inhibition of LTP can be reversed by the nitric oxide (NO) inhibitors L-NG-monomethyl-arginine or hemoglobin and mimicked by sodium nitroprusside. These results indicate that the timing of NO release relative to high-frequency activation of CA1 synapses may be an important determinant of LTP generation and suggest that NO may play a positive or negative modulatory role in LTP depending on prior events at the tetanized synapse and the ambient concentration of excitatory amino acids.
