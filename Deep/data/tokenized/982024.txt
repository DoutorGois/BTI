Granule cells of the rat dentate gyrus which are denervated by unilateral destruction of the entorhinal cortex are reinnervated in part by proliferation of surviving pathways from the contralateral entorhinal cortex. The cells of origin of these lesion-induced projections were identified by retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase and were the same cell type which normally project to the ipsilateral dentate gyrus
