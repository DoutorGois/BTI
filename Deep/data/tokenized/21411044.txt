Teneurin C-terminal associated peptide (TCAP)-1 is a member of a novel family of neuropeptides that has been highly conserved throughout evolution. TCAP-1 is expressed in the limbic system in areas such as the hippocampus and amygdala. In vitro, TCAP-1 increases cytoskeletal proteins in immortalized neurons and modulates neurite outgrowth in cultured primary hippocampal neurons. In vivo, TCAP-1 blocks stress-induced c-Fos in the hippocampus and amygdala, and modulates stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors. This suggests that TCAP-1 plays a role in the remodeling of limbic system networks to alter stress behaviors. Dendritic spines on the apical and basilar shafts of hippocampal neurons are sensitive to stress and many receive incoming excitatory synaptic connections. In this study, repeated daily injection of TCAP-1 for 10 days increased spine density in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus without affecting spine density in the amygdala. Further investigation of the CA3 region indicated that TCAP-1 did not affect the morphology of apical dendrites, but decreased branching in the basilar dendrites 90-130 mum away from the soma. Moreover, TCAP-1 treatment increased open arm time and decreased closed arm entries on the elevated plus maze, a test of anxiety-like behavior. These results suggest that TCAP-1 may be associated with anxiety-like behavior via regulation of dendritic morphology in the hippocampus, independent of amygdalar modification.
