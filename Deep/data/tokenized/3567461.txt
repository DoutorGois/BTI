Treatment of old rats, for two to three weeks, with pyrithioxin led to an increase in the levels of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) in the cortex and the striatum but not in the hippocampus. Pretreatment of old rats with pyrithioxin also increased the resting release and the K+ stimulated release of radioactive ACh from brain slices in vitro.
