The levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in three regions of rat brain were assayed in 62 rats. Bilateral common carotid artery ligation was done in 50 rats. Half an hour before ligation 26 rats were given 10 g/kg of Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae (RSM); 24 rats were given same volume of normal saline as controls. A sham operation was done in 12 rats. Half an hour (n = 30) and 3 hours (n = 32) after operation, the rats were quickly decapitated. VIP levels were assayed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and caudate nucleus. In salin-treated animals, VIP levels of cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus at 3 hour group were significantly decreased compared with the sham-operated group. No significant difference was found between RSM-treated and sham-operated groups. The preliminary results suggest that VIP may be involved in the pathophysiological procedures of cerebral ischemia and RSM may attenuate the dysfunction of VIP during cerebral ischemia.
