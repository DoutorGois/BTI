We describe a new technique for measuring specific in vitro binding of tritiated adrenal steroids on unfixed cryostat brain sections. The specific binding of [3H]corticosterone represents about 70% of the initial binding. Kinetic studies show that specific binding for [3H]corticosterone reaches equilibrium after 15 min incubation at room temperature. Scatchard analysis of [3H]corticosterone in vitro binding gives a linear plot with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) and a number of binding sites (Bmax) in the range of 10(-8) M and 100 fmol/mg protein, respectively. [3H]Dexamethasone binding under the same conditions gives a similar Kd and a Bmax of 55 fmol/mg protein. The order of potency for the relative binding affinity for [3H]corticosterone labeled sites is as follows: corticosterone greater than progesterone, dexamethasone, RU 38486 (a "pure" antiglucocorticoid), RU 26988 (a "pure" glucocorticoid), aldosterone greater than estradiol, testosterone. Anatomical studies reveal that sections at the level of the hippocampus bind more [3H]corticosterone and [3H]dexamethasone in vitro than more rostral sections taken at the level of the septum. Adrenalectomy increases the capacity of [3H]corticosterone to bind to these sites and perfusion of the brain to remove transcortin and other blood proteins does not modify [3H]corticosterone binding. We conclude that it is possible to measure in unfixed frozen brain sections glucocorticoid binding sites.
