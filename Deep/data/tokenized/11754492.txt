In previous studies, we have found that [(11)C]L-703,717, a positron-emitter labeled antagonist for the glycine-binding site of NMDA receptors, only localizes in rodent cerebellum under in vivo conditions. In order to understand the unusual cerebellar localization, we have examined the binding of [(11)C]L-703,717 to a cerebellar-specific NMDA receptor subtype consisting of GLuRepsilon3 subunit, by comparing its autoradiographic distributions between GluRepsilon3-deficient and wild-type mice. Ex vivo [(11)C]L-703,717 binding to wild-type mice showed a highly specific localization of radioactivity in the cerebellum, whereas that to the GluRepsilon3-deficient mice showed no specific localization of radioactivity in any of the brain regions. In contrast to the ex vivo binding, in vitro [(11)C]L-703,717 binding displayed a similar binding characteristic between GluRepsilon3-deficient and wild-type mice with highly specific localizations in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Therefore, the present study clearly demonstrated that [(11)C]L-703,717 preferentially binds to a cerebellar NMDA receptor subtype consisting of GluRepsilon3 subunit in vivo, but not in vitro.
