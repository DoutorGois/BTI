Individual mouse strains differ significantly in terms of behaviour, cognitive function and long-term potentiation. Hippocampal gene expression profiling of eight different mouse strains points towards strain-specific regulation of genes involved in neuronal information storage. Protein expression with regard to strain- dependent expression of structures related to neuronal information storage has not been investigated yet. Herein, a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) has been chosen to address this question by determining strain-dependent expression of proteins involved in neurotransmission and activity-induced actin remodelling in hippocampal tissue of five mouse strains. Of 31 spots representing 16 different gene products analysed and quantified, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein-alpha, actin-like protein 3, profilin and cofilin were expressed in a strain-dependent manner. By treating protein expression as a phenotype, we have shown significant genetic variation in brain protein expression. Further experiments in this direction may provide an indication of the genetic elements that contribute to the phenotypic differences between the selected strains through the expressional level of the translated protein. In view of this, we propose that proteomic analysis enabling to concomitantly survey the expression of a large number of proteins could serve as a valuable tool for genetic and physiological studies of central nervous system function.
