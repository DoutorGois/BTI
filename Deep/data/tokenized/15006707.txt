Editing and alternative splicing of mRNA are posttranscriptional steps probably involved in pathophysiological aspects of epilepsy. The present study analyses the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR2 with respect to the expression of (i) editing at the R/G site and (ii) flip-flop cassettes. Nervous tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy was analysed by RT-PCR followed by restriction enzyme assays. Human autoptic tissue served as control. R/G editing status: the relative amount of edited RNA was significantly increased in the hippocampal tissue, whereas no changes were found in neocortical tissues. Flip-flop expression: no significant alterations were found in relative abundance of spliced variants containing the flip exon. The increased editing at the R/G site in the hippocampal tissue of epilepsy patients may enhance responses to glutamate, resulting in a synapse operating at an increased gain.
