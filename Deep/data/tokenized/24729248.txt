Cardiac arrest and resuscitation produces delayed mortality and hippocampal neuronal death in rats. Hypoxic preconditioning has been to shown to protect the brain from ischemic insults. We have previously reported that with chronic hypobaric hypoxia, the accumulation of hypoxic-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) and its target genes was increased for the first several days of hypoxic exposure, and returned to baseline level by 3 weeks when angiogenesis is completed. In this study, we investigated the effect of short-term (3 days) and long-term (21 days) hypoxic preconditioning on recovery from cardiac arrest and resuscitation in rats. Our data showed that the overall survival rate was considerably improved in the short-term hypoxic preconditioning group compared to the non-preconditioned controls (86 %, 6/7 vs. 54 %, 7/13); however, the survival rate in the long-term hypoxic preconditioning group was decreased. Our data suggest that hypoxic preconditioning provides protection after cardiac arrest and resuscitation more likely through increased accumulation of HIF-1alpha and its target genes rather than through successful vascular adaptation as a result of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.
