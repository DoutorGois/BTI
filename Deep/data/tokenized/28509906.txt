Schizophrenia (SZ) is considered to be a multifactorial brain disorder with defects involving many biochemical pathways. Patients with SZ show variable responses to current pharmacological treatments of SZ because of the heterogeneity of this disorder. Stress has a significant role in the pathophysiological pathways and therapeutic responses of SZ. Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) can modulate the stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and exert therapeutic effects on stress by targeting the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. To evaluate the effects of AAPDs (such as clozapine, risperidone and aripiprazole) on stress, we compared neurochemical profile variations in the PFC and hippocampus between rat models of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) for HPA axis activation and of long-term dexamethasone exposure (LTDE) for HPA axis inhibition, using an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)-based metabolomic approach and a multicriteria assessment. We identified a number of stress-induced biomarkers comprising creatine, choline, inosine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, allantoic acid, lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), corticosterone and progesterone. Specifically, pathway enrichment and correlation analyses suggested that stress induces oxidative damage by disturbing the creatine-phosphocreatine circuit and purine pathway, leading to excessive membrane breakdown. Moreover, our data suggested that the AAPDs tested partially restore stress-induced deficits by increasing the levels of creatine, progesterone and PEs. Thus, the present findings provide a theoretical basis for the hypothesis that a combined therapy using adenosine triphosphate fuel, antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids as supplements may have synergistic effects on the therapeutic outcome following AAPD treatment.
