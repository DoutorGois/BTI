To investigate the relationship between regional hippocampal volume and memory in healthy elderly, 147 community-based volunteers, aged 55-83years, were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging, the Groton Maze Learning Test, Visual Reproduction and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Hippocampal volumes were determined by interactive volumetry. We found greater age-related reduction in the volume of the hippocampal head relative to the tail. Right hippocampal tail volume correlated with spatial memory on the Groton Maze Learning Test while left hippocampal body volume was associated with delayed verbal memory. These associations were independent of age, sex, education and speed of processing and support the notion of functional differentiation along the long axis of the hippocampus.
