The morphological and cytoarchitectonic organization of the human hippocamp is not limited to the classic structure in the shape of a horn with an upward curve. Behind and in front of it, the cytoarchitectonics and even topography change and become more complex. An examination of the brain from 17 individuals (22 hemispheres) has revealed very considerable individual spatial differences including cytoarchitectonic ones. Measurement of the hippocampal volume has shown that the difference between the opposite extreme variants reaches a three-fold value. The absence of any dependence between the above changes and the brain size suggests their correlation with the functional specificity of the hippocamp in different individuals.
