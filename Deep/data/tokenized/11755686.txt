The involvement of dysfunctional teeth in senile hippocampal activity was evaluated by examining, in aged SAMP8 mice, the effect of cutting off the upper molars (molarless condition) on hippocampal induction of the protein product, Fos, of the immediate early gene, c-fos, and on spatial performance in a water maze. The molarless condition caused a reduction in the number of Fos-positive cells in the hippocampal CA1 region, in which Fos immunoreactivity was localized in the cell nuclei. This effect was more pronounced the longer the molarless condition persisted. The suppression of both learning ability and Fos induction in the CA1 induced by the molarless condition was considerably reduced by restoring the lost molars with artificial crowns. Taken together with the plethora of research showing a relationship between stress, aging and hippocampal function and our past findings [Brain Res. 1999; 826: 148-53; Behav. Brain Res. 2000;108: 145-55; Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36:283-95], the present results suggest the detrimental effects of a reduction in chewing on hippocampal processing in aged SAMP8 mice that would be linked with stress induced by the molarless condition.
