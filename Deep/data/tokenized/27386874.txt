Recently, it has been suggested that molecular hydrogen (H2) can selectively reduce the levels of hydroxyl radicals (.OH), and ameliorate oxidative and inflammatory injuries to organs in global cerebral ischemia reperfusion models. Global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) can induce a sudden activation of inflammatory cytokines and later influence the systemic immunoreactivity which may contribute to a worse outcome. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in several pathological aspects of cerebral I/R. In addition, miRNA took part in the processes of cellular response to hypoxia. Since the expression of a specific set of miRNA called "hypoxamirs" is upregulated by hypoxia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the effect of HRS on I/R inducing cerebral damage, Tregs, and specific miRNA. Our results showed that rats undergone global cerebral I/R and treated with HRS have milder injury than I/R animals without HRS treatment. miR-210 expression in the hippocampus of the I/R group at 6, 24 and 96 h after reperfusion was significantly increased at each time point, while its expression in the group treated with HRS was significantly decreased. In addition, Tregs number in group I/R was decreased at each time points, while its number in the group treated with HRS was increased at 24 and 96 h after reperfusion. We focus on the relationship among Tregs, TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha and NF-kappaB at 24 h, and we found that there is a high correlation among them. Therefore, our results indicated that the brain resuscitation mechanism in the HRS-treated rats may be related with the effect of upregulating the number of Treg cells.
