The ischemic damage in the hippocampal CA1 region following transient forebrain ischemia, delayed neuronal death, is a typical apoptotic response, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We have reported that mild hyperthermia (38 degrees C) accelerates DNA fragmentation of the gerbil CA1 pyramidal neurons following transient forebrain ischemia. Recently, we reported that galectin-3, a beta-galactosidase-binding lectin, is spatio-temporally expressed only by activated microglial cells located within CA1 region following transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils. Furthermore, expression of galectin-3 and Iba-1 (a specific microglial cell marker) are strongly reduced by hypothermia during ischemic insult. To further elucidate the effect of hyperthermia on the expression of galectin-3 by micloglia in delayed neuronal death, we examined immunohistochemical expression of galectin-3 and Iba-1, in situ terminal dUTP-biotin nick end labeling of DNA fragmentation (for determination of cell death) and hematoxylin and eosin staining (for morphological observation). We observed that between 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C, there was a temperature-dependent enhancement of galectin-3 expression in microglial cells in the CA1 region following transient ischemia. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation, detected by TUNEL staining, was observed in CA1 region in normothermia. This TUNEL staining was enhanced by hyperthermia at 37.5 degrees C and 38 degrees C, but not at 39 degrees C. Ischemia-induced neuronal degeneration in CA1 region in gerbil hippocampus subjected to hyperthermia (37.5 degrees C, 38 degrees C and 39 degrees C) observed by HE staining is similar to that in normothermic gerbils. These findings imply that galectin-3 expression in microglia may influence the survival of CA1 pyramidal neurons in cases such as hyperthermia-related neuronal injury.
