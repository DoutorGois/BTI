The frequency and quality of brain abnormalities in panic disorder (PD) were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of electroencephalography (EEG) to detect PD patients with a high probability of morphologic brain abnormalities was also explored. Consecutive PD patients (n = 120) were screened with routine EEG examinations and were divided into the following subgroups on the basis of their EEG findings: patients with non-epileptic EEG abnormalities (EEG-A group, n = 28), matched patients with normal EEG results (EEG-N group, n = 28) and matched healthy controls (n = 28). PD patients showed a higher than expected rate of non-epileptic EEG abnormalities (29.2%; 35 of 120). EEG screening was effective in identifying patients with a high probability of morphologic brain abnormalities. MRI abnormalities were found in 60.7% of the EEG-A patients, 17.9% of the EEG-N patients, and only 3.6% of the controls. A high frequency of septo-hippocampal abnormalities was found. Further research should focus on attempts to subtype PD on the basis of neuroanatomic and functional brain abnormalities.
