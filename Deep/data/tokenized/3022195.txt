The afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows repetitive stimulation was recorded intracellularly from CA1 pyramidal neurons in the guinea pig hippocampal slice preparation. Although the late AHP could be blocked by histamine (1-10 microM), forskolin (10 microM) and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (100 and 500 microM), neither prostaglandins D2, E1 and F2 alpha (0.5 microM) nor vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (0.5 microM) had any effect on the AHP, membrane potential, membrane resistance or action potential properties.
