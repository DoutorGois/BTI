The present study focuses on the myelination of rat septohippocampal fibres that are known to originate from GABAergic parvalbumin-containing, fast-firing, fast-conducting neurons and from cholinergic slow-firing, slow-conducting neurons. With the combined immunofluorescence for parvalbumin/myelin basic protein and choline acetyltransferase/myelin basic protein it was shown that the vast majority of parvalbumin-containing fibres are myelinated, but the choline acetyltransferase-containing fibres are not. Accordingly, our results confirm the expectation that conduction velocities and presence or absence of myelin sheaths are also correlated in the septohippocampal pathway.
