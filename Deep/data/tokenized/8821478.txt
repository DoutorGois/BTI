Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is widely distributed in the mammalian brain and is involved in numerous functions including the control of feeding, growth and reproduction. Therefore, NPY may be an important peptide to study in agricultural species. This study describes the immunohistochemical localization of NPY throughout prepubertal development in the Meishan pig, a Chinese breed known for its superior reproductive characteristics. Brains of animals from gestational day (g) 30 through postnatal day (pn) 50 (duration of pregnancy averaged 114 days) were processed using a standard immunohistochemical technique utilizing a commercially available rabbit anti-porcine NPY antibody. Neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-IR) in cell bodies and fibers is evident in many areas of the brain at g30, including the basal telencephalon, hypothalamus, mesencephalon, pons, and medulla. Throughout prenatal development, cell bodies containing NPY-IR generally increase in number and distribution in the brain. During postnatal development the number of cell bodies displaying NPY-IR decreases. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, shows a dramatic reduction in the number of immunoreactive cell bodies between pn1 (day of birth) and pn20, just before weaning. The distribution of NPY-IR in fibers becomes more widespread throughout gestational development, showing a pattern by g110 that was characteristic of postnatal ages. The intensity of NPY-IR in fibers also increases throughout gestation. Some additional increases in immunoreactivity occur postnatally, especially in the periventricular hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Other brain areas like the caudate nucleus and putamen show decreases in immunoreactivity postnatally. The distribution of NPY-IR in cell bodies and fibers is similar to that seen in other species, including the rat, and supports the hypothesis that NPY participates in controlling feeding, growth and reproduction in the pig.
