The persistence of neurogenesis and structural plasticity of the nervous tissue was believed until recently to be restricted to lower vertebrates and songbirds. Nevertheless, it has now been ascertained that these phenomena can occur in the adult mammalian nervous system, at least in three distinct sites: the olfactory neuroepithelium of the nasal mucosa and two brain regions, namely, the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the olfactory bulb. The presented review addresses the nature, distribution and regulation of neural stem cells and the prospect for using these cells in therapeutic strategies of the damaged CNS reparation.
