High density multielectrode array recordings with CMOS-MEAs allow to monitor cell culture activity with unprecedent details respect to previous recording techniques. This is clarifying how network activity develops and is motivating the development of novel data analysis tools. Here, in order to advance in the exploitation of the richness of these large-scale array recordings, we introduce a principal component analysis approach that aims at improving on existing methodologies to describe neural activity events within large networks.
