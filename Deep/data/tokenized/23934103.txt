The conclusion of a series of recent reports highlights the significant neurotoxic effects that rare earth elements, such as lanthanum (La), can have during neurodevelopment. These findings are, herein, combined and presented using a simplified schematic overview that provides a putative solution to the riddle of La-induced cognitive impairment. Our commentary also highlights potential targets for further investigations into the mechanisms which underpin La-induced neurotoxicity, with a focus on the crucial role of the hippocampus. Within this context, a central role for the cyclic-adenosine monophosphate signalling pathway is proposed.
