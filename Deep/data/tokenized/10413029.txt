Ubiquitin, an essential protein in nonlysosomal proteolytic system, is expressed after metabolic stress to the cell. The authors investigated stress response of ubiquitin in the hippocampus of the Mongolian gerbil after forebrain ischemia. The level of hippocampal ubiquitin was compared with that under ischemic tolerance induced by ischemic preconditioning. The authors also studied ubiquitin gene expression using in situ hybridization method. Transient ischemia resulted in consumption of free ubiquitin and an increase of multiubiquitin chains. These changes were transient in the hippocampus outside of the CA1 region where neurons survived, whereas it was persistent in the CA1 region where neurons were destined to die after ischemia. Under tolerant condition, subsequent ischemia provoked rapid recovery and further increase of free ubiquitin. The signal of ubiquitin messenger ribonucleic acid was continuously detected after ischemia, not only under tolerant conditions, but without tolerance induced by preconditioning. Thus, ubiquitin stress response takes place, at least at a transcriptional level, in dying CA1 neurons. Under tolerant conditions, however, subsequent ischemia in the CA1 region induces the stress response of ubiquitin up to the translational level, leading to the rapid restoration of protein synthesis and to eventual neuronal survival.
