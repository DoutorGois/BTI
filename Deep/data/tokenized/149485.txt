Experiments on rabbits demonstrated that local electrocoagulation of the dorsal hyppocampus portions by means of the implanted electrodes caused reduction of the complementary and lysozyme activity of the blood serum, inhibited the development of Arthus' skin allergic-reaction, decreased the intensity of systemic anaphylaxis to the blood serum antigens, this being accompanied by a relative fall of the precipitating antibodies titres and a reduction of the vagus response of the heart to adrenaline.
