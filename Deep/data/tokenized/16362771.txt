The hippocampus has become one of the most extensively studied areas of the mammalian brain, and its proper function is of utmost importance, particularly for learning and memory. The hippocampus is the most susceptible brain region for damage, and its impaired function has been documented in many human brain diseases, e.g. hypoxia, ischemia, and epilepsy regardless of the age of the affected patients. In addition to experimental in vivo models of these disorders, the investigation of basic anatomical, physiological, and molecular aspects requires an adequate experimental in vitro model, which should meet the requirements for well-preserved representation of various cell types, and functional information processing properties in the hippocampus. In this review, the characteristics of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHCs) together with the main differences between the in vivo and in vitro preparations are first briefly outlined. Thereafter, the use of OHCs in studies focusing on neuron cell death and synaptic plasticity is discussed.
