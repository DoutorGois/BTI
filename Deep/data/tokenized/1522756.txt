The effects of adenosinergic antagonists caffeine and DPCPX, and of the adenosinergic agonists L-PIA, CPA and CGS 21680 were investigated on fully and partially reversible hypoxia-induced electrophysiological changes in rat hippocampal slices. The influence of a high potassium solution and of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist dizocilpine (MK 801) was also tested. The latency to obtain a 50% decrease in the amplitude of the CA1 population spike (CA1 PS) during a short- (5-10 min) lasting hypoxic period was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) by slice perfusion with caffeine (50 microM), DPCPX (0.2 microM), and by increasing (from 3 to 4 mM) the potassium concentration in the medium bathing the hippocampal slices. The latency was significantly decreased (P less than 0.01) by slice perfusion with L-PIA (0.2 microM) and CPA (0.05 microM). It was not significantly modified by CGS 21680 (5 microM). The incidence of reappearance of the CA1 PS during reoxygenation after long- (45 min) lasting hypoxia was significantly increased (P less than 0.05) by slice perfusion with MK 801 (50 microM), while it was not significantly affected by slice perfusion with caffeine (50 microM) or DPCPX (0.2 microM) or L-PIA (0.2 microM) or CPA (0.05 microM) or CGS 21680 (5 microM). The results indicate a prevalent involvement of the A1 adenosine receptors in the early mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced reversible changes. Adenosine seems to have a limited role in the late mechanisms occurring after a long-lasting hypoxic period.
