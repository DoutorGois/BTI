Analysis of the connectivity between different neuronal cell types is dependent on an appreciation of their dendritic and axonal arborizations. A detailed study of the dendrites and axons of GABAergic neurons has been thwarted by the lack of a suitable technique for enhancing GABA immunoreactivity. This article describes a procedure using tetanus toxin which, when applied to organotypic hippocampal cultures, considerably enhances the immunoreactivity in the dendrites and axons of the GABA- and somatostatin-containing neurons and clearly demonstrates the co-localization of GABA and somatostatin immunoreactivities in the same neuron. Tetanus toxin was applied to the culture medium on Day 14 for a 24-hr period and the cultures were fixed at the end of Day 18. Tetanus toxin-treated cultures (n = 30) or untreated cultures (n = 40) were incubated for either GABA or somatostatin immunoreactivity. Tetanus toxin-treated cultures used for co-localization studies (n = 20) were incubated for both GABA and somatostatin immunoreactivity.
