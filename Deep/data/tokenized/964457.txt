Offspring from pregnant rats injected with 4mg/kg body weight colchicine on Embryonic Days 18, 19, and 20 were found to have isocortical and hippocampal structures greatly reduced in mass when examined at birth. Cells with pyknotic nuclei were found in Layers 5, 4, and 3 of the cerebral isocortex, the habenula, and anterior medial nuclei of the thalamus. Brains taken at Postnatal Days 22 and 132 were reduced in overall size, and had a 20-30% reduction of cells at the vertex of the neocortex with up to 50% reduction in the thickness of the corpus callosum. A decrease in activity, an increase in fearfulness and/or decreased tendency to explore, reduced error scores on the Hebb-Williams maze, poor performance on the Maier elevated maze, and a lessened sensitivity to sound-induced seizures were correlated with these anatomical changes.
