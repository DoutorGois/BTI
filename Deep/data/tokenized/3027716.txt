The intraventricular injection of 2-deoxy-D-galactose led to a dose- and time-dependent decrease in the fucosylation of hippocampal glycoproteins in rats whereas the incorporation of 3H-N-acetyl-glucosamine was not influenced. This effect is not related to an interference with fucose activating or transferring enzymes but can be abolished by an application of D-galactose. Thus, it seems likely that also in brain tissue a deoxy-galactose induced decrease in the fucosylation is due to a hindering of a glycosidic linkage of fucose to the deoxy-sugar incorporated into glycoprotein chains. As a consequence of an intrahippocampal injection of the deoxy-sugar the retention performance of the animals in a foot-shock motivated brightness discrimination task was considerably impaired. But deoxy-galactose is effective only when administered before and immediately after training whereas either a pre- or a post-training injection did not influence the retention performance of the rats. Thus, an effective metabolic inhibition of the glycoprotein completion by the deoxy-sugar starting at the time of training seems to be crucial to interfere with such morphofunctional alterations in the neuronal network underlying the formation of a memory trace.
