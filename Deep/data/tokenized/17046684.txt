What controls the number of AMPA receptors at excitatory synapses? MAGUKs are known to play a critical role in this process, but which ones are involved and when has been contentious. In this issue of Neuron, Elias et al. have elucidated the roles of three MAGUKs, PSD-95, PSD-93, and SAP-102, in the targeting of AMPA receptors to synapses in hippocampal neurons.
