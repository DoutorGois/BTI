OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of S100-beta protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in hippocampal astrocytes of rats with Alzheimer disease (AD) model rats, and observe the effect of butylphthalide on their expression. METHODS: Sixty male adult rats were randomized equally into model group, butylphthalide group, and control group, and in the former two groups, AD models were established by injecting beta-amyloid protein 1-40 into the hippocampus. Sixty days later, the rats were sacrificed and the bilateral hippocampuses were taken for immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The number of cells positive for S100 and GFAP in the hippocampus in butylphthalide group were significantly higher than that in the control group (P/0.01), but lower than that in the model group (P/0.05). CONCLUSION: The expression of S100 protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein increased significantly in the hippocampal astrocytes of rats with AD, and butylphthalide can inhibit the increase of their expression.
