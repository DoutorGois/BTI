Miller et al. (this issue of Neuron) report that deletion of the 3'UTR of alpha-CaMKII mRNA prevents dendritic delivery of the mRNA in transgenic mice and thus local synthesis of alpha-CaMKII protein in dendrites. 3'UTR mutant mice exhibit decreases in alpha-CaMKII protein in postsynaptic densities, and deficits in late phase LTP and in memory consolidation.
