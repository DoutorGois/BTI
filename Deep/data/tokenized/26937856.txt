Nowadays, it is assumed that therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants depends, at least partly, on their anti-inflammatory properties. The present study investigated for the first time the effect of 21-day oral administration of desipramine on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-1beta concentration in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, hippocampus and plasma of rats, and on the LPS-induced IL-1beta mRNA level in the olfactory bulb. Desipramine (15mg/kg/day) reduced significantly the LPS (250 mug/kg i.p.)-induced IL-1beta concentration in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and in plasma, and diminished the LPS effect on IL-1beta mRNA in the olfactory bulb. Plasma concentration of desipramine was comparable to its therapeutic range. By using the alpha1/alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin and the unspecific beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol given prior to LPS, we found that the effect of desipramine on LPS-induced IL-1beta production was partially mediated by both adrenoceptors in the olfactory bulb and plasma, and that beta-adrenoceptors contributed also to its effect on the stimulated IL-1beta concentration in the hypothalamus. The effect of LPS on the cerebral IL-1beta levels was, in part, mediated by beta-adrenoceptors and, in a region-specific manner, by alpha1/alpha2-adrenoceptors. The findings provide evidence for central and peripheral anti-inflammatory activity of desipramine and confirm the impact of the noradrenergic system on IL-1beta production induced by an immunostimulatory challenge.
