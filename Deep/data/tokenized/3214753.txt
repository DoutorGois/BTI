Chronic administration of caffeine (75 mg/kg/day) to rats for 12 days increased [3H]R-PIA binding in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum and [3H]NECA binding to high affinity receptor sites in the striatum. The results indicate that both adenosine A1 and A2 receptor subtypes possess mechanisms of adaptation to chronic caffeine treatment. In addition, adenosine A1 receptor binding shows heterogenous neuroanatomical pattern indicating that the A1 response to caffeine treatment presents regional variation in the rat brain.
