Chronic in vivo or in vitro application of GABA(A) receptor agonists alters GABA(A) receptor peptide expression and function. Furthermore, chronic in vitro application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists and antagonists alters GABA(A) receptor function and mRNA expression. However, it is unknown if chronic in vivo blockade of NMDA receptors alters GABA(A) receptor function and peptide expression in brain. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically administered the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (0.40 mg/kg, twice daily) for 14 days. Chronic blockade of NMDA receptors significantly increased hippocampal GABA(A) receptor alpha4 and gamma2 subunit expression while significantly decreasing hippocampal GABA(A) receptor alpha2 and beta2/3 subunit expression. Hippocampal GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit peptide expression was not altered. In contrast, no significant alterations in GABA(A) receptor subunit expression were found in cerebral cortex. Chronic MK-801 administration also significantly decreased GABA(A) receptor-mediated hippocampal Cl- uptake, whereas no change was found in GABA(A) receptor-mediated cerebral cortical Cl- uptake. Finally, chronic MK-801 administration did not alter NMDA receptor NR1, NR2A, or NR2B subunit peptide expression in either the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus. These data demonstrate heterogeneous regulation of GABA(A) receptors by glutamatergic activity in rat hippocampus but not cerebral cortex, suggesting a new mechanism of GABA(A) receptor regulation in brain.
