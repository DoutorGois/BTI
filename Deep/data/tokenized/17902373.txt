Experiments were carried out on 24 month (mail, femail) old Wistar rats. It was shown that applications of 25% KC1 for 30 min on the frontal sections of the both cerebral hemispheres accompanied by a decrease in electrical activity of the cortical-subcortical structures, inhibition of the vegetative functions (heart rate) and emotional reactions of the different direction (positive, negative). The degree of manifestation and the character of the changes of the investigated parameters depended on the time of the reversible inhibition of the neocortex and on the age of animals. In aging animals a gradual type of changes prevailed in the thresholds of reactions of avoidances, which practically did not occur in young rats. The experiments showed that in 24 month old rats neocortex maintained general physiological and emotional tones of aging organism.
