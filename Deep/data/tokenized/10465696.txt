The effect of cocaine on brain regional metabolism of L-arginine to nitric oxide (NO) has been studied in rat by measuring the level of citrulline, the co-product of NO synthesis, using a HPLC based methodology. A single i.p. administration of 1 mg/kg cocaine, and a daily treatment for up to 5 consecutive days, failed to affect significantly citrulline content in the striatum, hippocampus and cortex. By contrast, in these regions of the brain a single or 5-day repeated higher dose of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a significant increase in the co-product of NO synthesis and this has been abolished in a stereoselective fashion by L-NAME (10 mg/kg i.p. given 30 min before). Under cocaine high dose treatment, 1 h acoustic stimulation, which per se resulted ineffective, enhanced stimulant-induced increases in citrulline content seen in the striatum and abolished the increase of this amino acid observed in the hippocampus and cortex both after single or 5-day repeated injection of cocaine. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that cocaine stimulates the conversion of L-arginine to NO in the brain of rat and this is affected by concomitant exposure to acoustic stimulation.
