Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) have been used in various medical and industrial areas. However, the impacts of these nanoparticles on neuroinflammation in the brain are poorly understood. In this study, mice were exposed to 2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg body weight TiO2 NPs for 90 consecutive days, and the TLRs/TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB signaling pathway associated with the hippocampal neuroinflammation was investigated. Our findings showed titanium accumulation in the hippocampus, neuroinflammation and impairment of spatial memory in mice following exposure to TiO2 NPs. Furthermore, TiO2 NPs significantly activated the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nucleic IkappaB kinase, NF-kappaB-inducible kinase, nucleic factor-kappaB, NF-kappaB2(p52), RelA(p65), and significantly suppressed the expression of IkappaB and interleukin-2. These findings suggest that neuroinflammation may be involved in TiO2 NP-induced alterations of cytokine expression in mouse hippocampus. Therefore, more attention should be focused on the application of TiO2 NPs in the food industry and their long-term exposure effects, especially in the human central nervous system.
