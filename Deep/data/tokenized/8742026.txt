Differential responses between CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) and granule cells (GCs) to transient ischemic insults (oxygen and glucose deprivation, Hypo center dot G(-)) were studied in rat hippocampal slices using simultaneous recordings of membrane potentials and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i). The average resting membrane potentials before Hypo center dot G(-) were significantly different between PCs (-66.5 +/- 1.5 mV) and GCs (-78.5 +/- 2.0 mV). In PCs, Hypo center dot G(-) produced an initial hyperpolarization and a subsequent rapid and large depolarization. In contrast, in GCs, Hypo center dot G(-) produced a gradual depolarization with an initial slight hyperpolarization. [Ca2+]i increased corresponding to the depolarization. The [Ca2+]i levels during Hypo center dot G(-) and after reoxygenation were significantly higher in the CA1 than in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that PCs are more susceptible to Hypo center dot G(-) than GCs, as judged by the speed of depolarization and the elevation in [Ca2+]i.
