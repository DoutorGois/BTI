There is not yet a complete understanding of the functional interactions among various septal nuclei which regulate hippocampal function. Nevertheless, much has been learned histologically and biochemically about the major connections of the distinct areas of the septal complex and the chemical character of some of these pathways. The cholinergic septal-hippocampal pathway serves as a well defined link between these two important structures of the limbic system. Acetylcholine turnover rates in the hippocampus have been shown to increase or decrease proportionally to the activity of the cholinergic neurons originating in the septum. Moreover, these turnover rates have been shown to be modulated by intraseptal injections of agonists or antagonists of various neurotransmitters or neuromodulators which are stored in various cell groups located in the septum. By coupling this biochemical approach with techniques to study the receptor organization, greater detail concerning the transmitter and cotransmitter interactions among the various neuromodulators can be obtained.
