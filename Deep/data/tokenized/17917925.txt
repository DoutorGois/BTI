When exposed to nonlethal heat stress (i.e., heat shock preconditioning), HSP72 expression increased in the mammalian brain. HSP72 enhance the viability of neurons and decrease TUNEL-positive neurons under several kinds of stress (e.g., ischemic). Chronic psychological stress is a kind of stress that could cause hippocampal neuron apoptosis. But whether overexpression of HSP72 can decrease TUNEL-positive hippocampal neurons caused by chronic psychological stress is unclear. To investigate the possible protective role of HSP72 in decreasing chronic psychological stress-induced hippocampal neuron apoptosis, this study analyzed HSP72 expression, apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus of mice. Adult mice were divided into four groups unstressed group; chronic psychological stress group; heat shock stress group; heat shock preconditioning plus psychological stress group; receiving no experimental stress, chronic psychological stress, heat shock stress, heat shock preconditioning plus psychological stress separately. Mice were killed after one month, two months, or three months of stress. A three-way ANOVA (psychological stress x heat shock stress x time) revealed a significant effect of heat shock stress in increasing HSP72 expression, decreasing neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus CA3 region caused by chronic psychological stress, and showed that HSP72 protected hippocampus CA3 neurons from chronic psychological stress.
