The influence of ethyl alcohol on the after-discharges provoked by electrical stimulation of dorsal hippocampus in rabbits was studied. The after-discharges were registered from frontal cortex reticular mesencephalic substance and contralateral hippocampus. The hippocampus was stimulated seven times every 30 min. in two sessions performed in a 7 days' interval. In the second session ethanol in doses 0.8 g/kg i.v. and 0.4 g/kg p. o. and i. v. was administered. Ethanol administered intravenously in a small dose increase, whereas in a larger dose prevented the increase of after-discharge duration during the session. The influence of ethanol on after-discharges correlated with its initial blood concentration.
