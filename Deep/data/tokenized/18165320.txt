Members of the SLC4 bicarbonate transporter family are involved in solute transport and pH homeostasis. Here we report that disrupting the Slc4a10 gene, which encodes the Na(+)-coupled Cl(-)-HCO(3)(-) exchanger Slc4a10 (NCBE), drastically reduces brain ventricle volume and protects against fatal epileptic seizures in mice. In choroid plexus epithelial cells, Slc4a10 localizes to the basolateral membrane. These cells displayed a diminished recovery from an acid load in KO mice. Slc4a10 also was expressed in neurons. Within the hippocampus, the Slc4a10 protein was abundant in CA3 pyramidal cells. In the CA3 area, propionate-induced intracellular acidification and attenuation of 4-aminopyridine-induced network activity were prolonged in KO mice. Our data indicate that Slc4a10 is involved in the control of neuronal pH and excitability and may contribute to the secretion of cerebrospinal fluid. Hence, Slc4a10 is a promising pharmacological target for the therapy of epilepsy or elevated intracranial pressure.
