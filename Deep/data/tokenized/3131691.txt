The effect of restraint stress on synthesis of central norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) was studied in adult and old rats. The rate of in vivo synthesis of the two catecholamines was determined in hippocampus (a prevalently noradrenergic area) and in striatum (a prevalently dopaminergic area) by measuring the accumulation of DOPA for 60 min after decarboxylase inhibition. NE synthesis was stimulated by stress in the first 30 min, after which the accumulation of DOPA declined. The stimulation was much greater in old rats. In striatum, endogenous DOPA concentration was significantly lower in old rats. Stress significantly enhanced DOPA accumulation in the first 30 min in both age groups but after this interval accumulation continued linearly only in young rats. These results indicate that in aged rats the response to stress of some noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems may be altered in opposite directions.
