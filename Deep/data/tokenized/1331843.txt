The effects of spermine, spermidine and putrescine on the binding of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex were examined in the hippocampus and frontal cortex membranes of the rat. The results demonstrated modulatory effects of polyamines on the binding of diazepam and flunitrazepam but not on that of GABA, muscimol and Ro 15-1788. When membranes were prepared without detergent, the polyamines enhanced the binding of diazepam. However, while the binding capacity increased after homogenization in the presence of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, the polyamines did not enhance the binding but inhibited the binding of diazepam and flunitrazepam at greater concentrations. Considered together with other studies, the present findings indicate that polyamines can modulate the binding characteristics of several different neurotransmitter receptor-ionophore complexes.
