Unitary synaptic currents in hippocampus show small variability. Experimental evidence suggests that the neuron is endowed with mechanisms to reduce location-dependent differences in amplitude and time course of synaptic events, contributing to small variability. These mechanisms may allow the neuron to count individual quanta and thereby linearize integration of unitary events.
