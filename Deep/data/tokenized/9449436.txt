The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine, but not the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol or atenolol, suppressed tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of population spikes in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. When scopolamine was coapplied with propranolol or atenolol, a synergistic effect in preventing LTP generation was observed. On the other hand, the coapplication of scopolamine and atenolol failed to affect tetanus-induced LTP of field EPSP. These findings suggest that cooperative mechanisms via muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptor activation might contribute to LTP induction in terms of the EPSP-spike potentiation, i.e., an increase in the excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells after tetanic stimulation, but are independent of the tetanus-evoked potentiation of a synaptic component.
