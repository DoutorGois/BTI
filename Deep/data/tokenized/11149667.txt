Postembedding immunocytochemistry was used to localize aspartate, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamine in hippocampus and striatum during normo- and hypoglycemia in rat. In both brain regions, hypoglycemia caused aspartatelike immunoreactivity to increase. In hippocampus, this increase was evident particularly in the terminals of known excitatory afferents-in GABA-ergic neurons and myelinated axons. Aspartate was enriched along with glutamate in nerve terminals forming asymmetric synapses on spines and with GABA in terminals forming symmetric synapses on granule and pyramidal cell bodies. In both types of terminal, aspartate was associated with clusters of synaptic vesicles. Glutamate and glutamine immunolabeling were markedly reduced in all tissue elements in both brain regions, but less in the terminals than in the dendrosomatic compartments of excitatory neurons. In glial cells, glutamine labeling showed only slight attenuation. The level of GABA immunolabeling did not change significantly during hypoglycemia. The results support the view that glutamate and glutamine are used as energy substrates in hypoglycemia. Under these conditions both excitatory and inhibitory terminals are enriched with aspartate, which may be released from these nerve endings and thus contribute to the pattern of neuronal death characteristic of hypoglycemia.
