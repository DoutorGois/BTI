The growing interest in dendritic spines in recent years originates from both the realization that the spine is likely to be the site where long-term plastic changes in synaptic properties take place, and that imaging methods are available which allow, for the first time, the study of these changes in the living dendritic spine. This report briefly summarizes methodological and biological issues associated with the study of dendritic spines in living tissue. The combined use of electrical and imaging methods for the study of dendritic spines certainly will contribute to a better understanding of synaptic integration and plasticity.
