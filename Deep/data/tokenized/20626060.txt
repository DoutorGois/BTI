Uncaria rhynchophylla (Miq) Jack (UR) is a traditional Chinese herb and is used for the treatment of convulsive disorders, including epilepsy. Our previous study has shown that UR, as well as its major component rhynchophylline (RH), has an anticonvulsive effect and this effect is closely related to its scavenging activities of oxygen free radicals. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of (UR) on the expression of proteins using a proteomics analysis in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with kainic acid (KA)-induced epileptic seizures. We profiled the differentially expressed proteins on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) maps derived from the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rat brain tissue 24 hours after KA-induced epileptic seizures. The results indicated that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and cyclophilin A were under expressed in frontal cortex by an average of 0.19- and 0.23-fold, respectively. In the frontal cortex, MIF and cyclophilin A were significantly decreased in the KA group and these decreases were confirmed by the Western blots. However, in the hippocampus, only cyclophilin A was significantly decreased in the KA group. In addition, in real-time quantitative PCR (Q-PCR), MIF and cyclophilin A gene expressions were also significantly under expressed in the frontal cortex, and only the cyclophilin A gene was also significantly under expressed in the hippocampus in the KA group. These under expressions of MIF and cyclophilin A could be overcome by the treatment of UR and RH. In conclusion, the under expressions of MIF and cyclophilin A in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in KA-treated rats, which were overcome by both UR and UH treatment, suggesting that both MIF and cyclophilin A at least partly participate in the anticonvulsive effect of UR.
