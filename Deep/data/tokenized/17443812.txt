Evidence is accumulating that early emotional experience interferes with the development of the limbic system, which is involved in perception and regulation of emotional behaviors as well as in learning and memory formation. Limbic brain regions, as well as hypothalamic regions and other, nonlimbic areas contain specific neuron subpopulations, which express and release corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). Since these neurons serve to connect limbic function to endocrine, stress-related responses, we proposed that stressful experience during early postnatal brain development should interfere with the development of CRF-containing neurons, particularly in brain regions essential for emotional regulation. Applying neonatal separation stress (daily 1 h separation from the parents and litter mates) as stressor, the number of immunocytochemically identified CRF-expressing neurons/fibers was quantified in the amygdala, hippocampus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, piriform cortex, and the somatosensory cortex of 3-week-old stressed and nonstressed Octodon degus, a semi-precocial rodent. Compared to controls neonatally stressed animals showed significantly lower levels of CRF-positive fibers (-60%) in the central amygdala, significantly less CRF-positive neurons in the dentate gyrus (-28%) and the CA1 region (-29%) and significantly lower CRF cell densities in the somatosensory cortex (-26%). On the other hand, we found significantly higher numbers of CRF-immunoreactive neurons in the basolateral amygdaloid complex (+192%) of stressed animals compared to nonstressed controls. No differences in CRF-immunoreactive cell densities were detected in the other regions. Additional behavioral analysis revealed significantly elevated exploratory behavior (+34%) in stressed animals compared to controls, which might indicate reduced anxiety in the stressed animals.
