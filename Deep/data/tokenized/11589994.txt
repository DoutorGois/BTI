Driver (sham-operated) and tester (ischemic) hippocampal cDNAs were subtracted, and the resulting ischemia-induced upregulated gene expression was verified by northern analysis. cDNAs isolated corresponded to (1) genes known to be upregulated following ischemia, (hsc70, hsp90, hsp105 and trkB) and (2) a gene not previously implicated with cerebral ischemia, sodium calcium exchanger (ncx). Furthermore, upregulation of these genes was demonstrated following preconditioning transient global ischemia.
