The decrease of sphingomyelin in synaptosomes of brain hepatocytes, erythrocytes and the increase of lysophosphatidylcholine in hepatocytes and erythrocytes were found in rats with high seizure susceptibility. Activities of acetylcholinesterase and Mg(2+)- and Ca(2+)-ATPase were not changed. Permeability of erythrocyte membranes to K+ increased. The importance of obtained changes in phospholipid composition of membranes for their structural and functional state is discussed.
