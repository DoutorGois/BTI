Firing patterns of single neurons in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, midbrain reticular system, and hippocampus of awake, freely moving female rats were temporally correlated with exploratory sniffing and vibrissa twitching, feeding, lordosis, locomotion, and (or) arousal. These relationships were remarkably stable during continuous observations lasting many hours. During extended periods when certain of these movements were not performed, the correlated neurons showed no action potentials for minutes at a time. Electrical stimulation at certain recording sites elicited behavior patterns whose spontaneous occurrence was accompanied by neuronal activation. Self-stimulation was elicited from sites spontaneously activated during exploratory behavior.
