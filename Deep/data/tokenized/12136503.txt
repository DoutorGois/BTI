The authors review some of the advances that have been made in understanding the structural, biochemical, and functional neuroanatomy of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). First, the authors review the primary brain regions that had been hypothesized a priori, from the phenomenology and neurobiology of PTSD, to be implicated in the pathophysiology. Next, they review findings from neuroimaging studies of these brain regions in PTSD, and explain the various experimental methods and imaging technologies used in these studies. A broader perspective, including a discussion of additional brain areas that may be involved in PTSD, is synthesized. The authors conclude with a rationale and approach for studies testing sharply defined hypotheses and those using multidisciplinary strategies that integrate neuroimaging data with other cognitive, biologic, and genetic tools to study this complex disorder.
