The binding of [3H]nipecotic acid, a ligand for labelling GABA uptake sites in brain, was measured in left and right frontal cortex, polar temporal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala from control and schizophrenic postmortem brains. In schizophrenic brains, single concentration [3H]nipecotic acid binding was reduced bilaterally in amygdala and hippocampus and on the left side only in polar temporal cortex. These data suggest that GABA neurones are involved in the cerebral atrophy of schizophrenia and, in agreement with other studies, that this process is most pronounced in left temporal cortex.
