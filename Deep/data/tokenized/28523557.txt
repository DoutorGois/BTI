The brain is the most complex tissue in terms of cell types that it comprises, to the extent that it is still poorly understood. Single cell genome and transcriptome profiling allow to disentangle the neuronal heterogeneity, enabling the categorization of individual neurons into groups with similar molecular signatures. Herein, we unravel the current state of knowledge in single cell neurogenomics. We describe the molecular understanding of the cellular architecture of the mammalian nervous system in health and in disease; from the discovery of unrecognized cell types to the validation of known ones, applying these state-of-the-art technologies.
