Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the most prominent model to study neuronal plasticity. Previous studies using quantal analysis of an early stage of LTP in the CA1 hippocampal region (<1 h after induction) suggested increases in both the mean number of transmitter quanta released by each presynaptic pulse (m, quantal content) and postsynaptic effect of a single quantum (v, quantal size). When LTP was large, it was m that increased predominantly suggesting prevailing presynaptic contribution. However, LTP consists of several temporary phases with presumably different mechanisms. Here we recorded excitatory postsynaptic potentials from CA1 hippocampal slices before and up to 3.5 h after LTP induction. A new version of the noise deconvolution revealed significant increases in m with smaller and often not statistically significant changes in v. The changes in m were similar for both early (<1 h) and later (1-3 h) post-tetanic periods and correlated with LTP magnitude. The coefficient of variation of the response amplitude and the number of failures decreased during both early and late post-tetanic periods. The results suggest that both early (<0.5 h) and later LTP components (0.5-3 h) are maintained by presynaptic changes, which include increases in release probabilities and the number of effective release sites. In addition initially silent synapses can be converted into effective ones due to either pre- or postsynaptic rearrangements. If this occurs, our data indicate that the number and the efficacy of the receptors in the new transmission sites are approximately similar to those in the previously effective sites.
