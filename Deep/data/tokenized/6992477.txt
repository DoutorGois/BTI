Many experimental data point to a multioscillatory modulation of the CNS function. It covers coordinating stabilization of vital time structures, the zero frequency characteristics of neurones and receptors during expansion of their action range, the internal clock and central time counter. This involves triggering processes and sequential order of elementary and cognitive operations as well as the storage of information. The synaptic-connectionistic hypothesis is opposed by the oscillatory resonance theory, in which intracellular oscillators and those connected to the membrane being respondible for extrasynaptic changes in the transmission characteristics of the neurone.
