The characteristics of long-term potentiation (LTP) in Schaffer collaterals--CA1 system were compared in hippocampal slices from mice of control group and mice with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling, induced by daily i.p.-injection of 30 mg/kg of PTZ. The increase in LTP mean magnitude was found in the preparation from kindled mice. The enhancement of the paired-pulse potentiation was also shown in these slices. It is suggested that both the increase in LTP and paired-pulse potentiation are due to the depression of an inhibition in intrahippocampal synaptic systems.
