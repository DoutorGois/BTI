The effect of chronic aluminium administration (2 g/L/6 months) was investigated in the central nervous system (CNS) of old rats. The content of Al(3+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Mn(2+) was measured in prosencephalon + mesencephalon, pons-medulla, and cerebellum. The area occupied by the mossy fibers in the hippocampal CA3 zone was also measured. In Al-treated rats the contents of Al(3+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Mn(2+) were significantly increased in prosencephalon + mesencephalon and pons-medulla, while no change was observed in the cerebellum except a Cu(2+) decrease. The area occupied by the mossy fibers in the CA3 field was significantly increased (+32%) in Al-treated rats. Taken together, the present findings document that the aging CNS is particularly susceptible to aluminum toxic effects that may be responsible for a consistent rise in the cell load of oxidative stress. This may contribute, as an aggravating factor, to the development of neurodegenerative events, as observed in Alzheimer disease.
