Chronic activation of the stress response during pregnancy has been shown to be injurious to the development of the offspring. We have previously demonstrated that restraint prenatal stress inflicted during the last week of pregnancy in rats increased dopamine and glutamate receptors in forebrain areas of the adult offsprings. In this study, the same prenatal insult was employed to assess morphological changes in astrocytes and in the dendritic arborization in frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus of the adult rat brain. On postnatal day 90, brains were processed for immunocytochemistry using primary antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; the main cytoskeletal astroglial protein), S100B protein (an astroglial-derived neurotrophic factor), MAP-2 (a microtubule-associated protein present almost exclusively in dendrites), and synaptophysin (Syn; one major integral protein of the synaptic vesicles membrane). The results show a significant increase in the cell area of GFAP-immunoreactive (-IR) astrocytes, with high levels of S100B protein and a significant decrease in the relative area of MAP-2-IR neuronal processes in prenatally stressed adult rats. The expression of synaptophysin decreased in all areas studied. These results demonstrate that prenatal stress induces a long-lasting astroglial reaction and a reduced dendritic arborization, with synaptic loss in the brain of adult offspring. In addition to the neurochemical alterations previously reported, these morphological changes might be underlying the behavioral and learning impairment previously observed in prenatally stressed rats.
