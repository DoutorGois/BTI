Delayed neuronal death is produced at about the 4th day following global forebrain ischemia. This study investigates whether L-deprenyl, an irreversible and selective MAO-B inhibitor, reduces brain damage following global forebrain ischemia in adult gerbils. For this purpose, global forebrain ischemia was induced in adult gerbils by occlusion for 5 min of both common carotid arteries. L-Deprenyl, 10 mg/kg weight in saline (10 mg/ml) i.p., was administered 1 h after or 2 h before occlusion, followed by daily administration for 4 days. Treated animals were processed in parallel with ischemic animals receiving saline alone, and with sham-operated controls. Counts of viable neurons were made in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 region of the hippocampus at the 4th day after the ischemic episode. The number of viable neurons in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 was similar in animals treated with L-deprenyl or saline alone (Mann-Whitney U-test, alpha=0.05 two-tailed). The present results show that L-deprenyl does not prevent neuronal cell death following global forebrain ischemia in the adult gerbil when the administration of the drug is started shortly after or shortly before the ischemic episode.
