A large series of rabbit hippocampal Neo-Timm stained sections were manually aligned, digitized, and by a modified median filtration noise reduced and reconstructed into a three-dimensional object. From the presented simulated grey tone cuts of this object, the reader may assemble a rabbit hippocampal model, that spatially illustrates its anatomy.
