OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of calcium on learning and memory ability of rats exposed to low level lead before and after birth. METHODS: Wistar dam rats were randomly divided into normal group, lead-contaminated group and lead with Ca group. Corresponding food and water were given to pregnant rats from d 15 of gestation and to young rats till 7 w after birth. The weight of brain and hippocampus, blood lead content, serum calcium content, learning and memory ability of young rats were tested. RESULT: The blood lead concentrations: lead-contaminated group was the highest, lead with Ca group the second and normal group the lowest. Serum calcium concentrations: normal group and lead with Ca group were both higher than lead contaminated group. Ability of learning and memory: lead with Ca group was better than lead-contaminated group, but poorer than normal group. No differences were found upon the weight of brain and hippocampus in all groups. CONCLUSION: A minilaparotomy approach for curative resection of rectal cancer may be an ideal alternative approach to conventional laparotomy.
