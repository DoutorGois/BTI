The administration of paroxetine (0.5-8 mg/kg), a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, induced a dose-dependent reduction of exploratory activity of rats in the motility test. In the elevated plus-maze paroxetine was less effective, only 8 mg/kg of paroxetine decreased the exploratory behaviour of rats. The doses of paroxetine (2-8 mg/kg) reducing the exploratory activity in the motility test increased the density of CCK receptors in the frontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus. The treatment of rats with the CCK(B) receptor antagonist LY288,513 (0.01-1 mg/kg) did not change the exploratory activity. However, the reduction of exploratory activity induced by the low dose of paroxetine (2 mg/kg), but not by the higher dose (8 mg/kg), was dose-dependently reversed by the administration of LY288,513. Moreover, LY288,513 did not affect the anti-exploratory action of paroxetine (8 mg/kg) in the elevated plus-maze. Diazepam at doses (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) not suppressing the locomotor activity did not change the anti-exploratory action of paroxetine in the motility test. It is likely that the anti-exploratory action of a low dose of paroxetine (2 mg/kg) is not related to the increase in anxiety, but rather to the reduction of exploratory drive. Evidence exists that this effect of paroxetine is mediated via the activation of CCK-ergic transmission.
