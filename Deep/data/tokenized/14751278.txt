Early stages of memory formation in filial imprinting were studied in domestic chicks. Chicks trained for 15 min showed strong imprinting, demonstrated by a strong preference for their training stimulus, and the time course of this preference over 2 days after training was similar to that of chicks trained for 60 min. The chicks therefore learned characteristics of the training stimulus very early during training. The intermediate and medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) is a part of the chick forebrain that is crucial for imprinting. Previous experiments have shown a learning-specific increase in Fos-like immunoreactivity, used as a marker of neuronal activity, in the IMHV after training for 60 min. The time course of Fos expression in the IMHV was measured after training for 15 min and 60 min. The same pattern of expression was found for both training times, showing a peak 120 min after the start of training. The time course of expression was stimulus-dependent. Fos expression in the IMHV, but not the hippocampus, was significantly correlated with strength of imprinting. It is concluded that the learning-specific change in Fos expression in the IMHV is associated with very early components of memory formation.
