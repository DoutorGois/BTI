The ovarian hormone 17beta-estradiol (E2) exerts profound neuroprotective actions against ischemia-induced brain damage in rodent models of global and focal ischemia. This review focuses on the neuroprotective efficacy of post-ischemic administration of E2 and non-feminizing estrogen analogs in the aging brain, with an emphasis on studies in animals subjected to a long-term loss of circulating E2. Clinical findings from the Women's Health Initiative study as well as data from animal studies that used long-term, physiological levels of E2 treatment are discussed in this context. We summarize major published findings that highlight the effective doses and timing of E2 treatment relative to onset of ischemia. We then discuss recent findings from our laboratory showing that under some conditions the aging hippocampus remains responsive to E2 and some neuroprotective non-feminizing estrogen analogs even after prolonged periods of hormone withdrawal. Possible membrane-initiated signaling mechanisms that may underlie the neuroprotective actions of acutely administered E2 are also discussed. Based on these findings, we suggest that post-ischemic treatment with high doses of E2 or certain non-feminizing estrogen analogs may have great therapeutic potential for treatment of brain damage and neurodegeneration associated with ischemia.
