Abnormalities in resting state connectivity in schizophrenia (SZ) are now well established, but the biological substrates of these functional alterations remain to be elucidated. We performed a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy study in 22 unmedicated patients with SZ and 22 matched healthy controls (HCs) to evaluate resting state functional connectivity of the hippocampus and Glx/Cr (a combined glutamate + glutamine peak normalized to creatine) in the hippocampus and investigate functional and neurometabolic abnormalities and examine the relationship between these. Functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and bilateral precuneus was significantly decreased in unmedicated patients with SZ when compared to HCs [t(4.22), cluster extent (kE) = 751, PFDRcorr = 0.001, Montreal Neurological Institute coordinates: x = -4, y = -56, z = 44]. Glx/Cr in the hippocampus was significantly elevated in SZ (HC: mean = 0.60+/-0.10 SZ: 0.67+/-0.10; F = 5.742; P = 0.02), but was not correlated with functional connectivity deficits (P > 0.05). In this study, we found hippocampal resting state functional connectivity deficits to the precuneus in unmedicated patients with SZ and an increase of Glx/Cr in the hippocampus, but did not observe a direct relationship between these abnormalities. However, our findings do not exclude the possibility of a shared underlying pathology, which warrants further investigation.
