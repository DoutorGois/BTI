Activity-dependent alterations in the strength of an individual glutamatergic synapse are often accompanied by changes in the size and shape of the postsynaptic terminal. Two studies in this issue of Neuron, Meyer et al. (2014) and Bosch et al. (2014), shed new light on the mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying structural long-term potentiation.
