The depression of excitatory synaptic transmission by hypoxia in area CA1 of the hippocampus is largely dependent upon the activation of adenosine A(1) receptors on presynaptic glutamatergic terminals. As well as adenosine, norepinephrine levels increase in the hypoxic/ischemic hippocampus. We sought to determine the influence of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor (AR) activation on the hypoxic depression of synaptic transmission utilizing electrophysiological, pharmacological and adenosine sensor techniques. Norepinephrine depressed synaptic transmission and significantly accelerated the hypoxic depression of synaptic transmission. The alpha-AR agonist 6-fluoronorepinephrine mimicked both of these effects whilst the alpha(2)-AR antagonist yohimbine, but not the alpha(1)-AR antagonist urapidil, prevented the actions of 6-fluoronorepinephrine. In contrast, the beta-AR agonist isoproterenol enhanced synaptic transmission and only accelerated the hypoxic depression of transmission in hypoxia-conditioned slices in which the hypoxic release of adenosine is reduced. The effects of isoproterenol were blocked by the non-selective beta-AR antagonist propranolol and the selective beta(1)-AR antagonist betaxolol. Using an enzyme-based adenosine sensor we observed that the application of the beta-AR agonist resulted in increased extracellular adenosine during repeated hypoxia. Our results suggest that alpha(2)-AR activation facilitates the hypoxic depression of synaptic transmission probably via the known alpha(2)-AR-mediated inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels whereas beta(1)-AR activation does so via increased extracellular adenosine and greater activation of inhibitory adenosine A(1) receptors.
