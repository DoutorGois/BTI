Diarylheptanoids have been the center of the intensive research efforts for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aimed to determine the effect of the standardized extract of B. platyphylla bark and its major diarylheptanoids in scopolamine-induced amnesic mice through cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activation. Oral administration of the standardized extract of B. platyphylla bark (100mg/kg body weight), aceroside VIII (1mg/kg body weight) and platyphylloside (1 or 2mg/kg body weight) significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced amnesia in passive avoidance test. CREB phosphorylation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the cortex and hippocampus of the scopolamine-treated mice were markedly increased by the treatment of the standardized extract of B. platyphylla bark and platyphylloside. The standardized extract of B. platyphylla bark and its major diarylheptanoids also significantly protected HT22 cells against neurotoxicity induced by glutamate insult. The standardized extract of B. platyphylla bark and platyphylloside may ameliorate memory deficits by activating the CREB-BDNF pathway and prevent a neurodegeneration by inhibiting neuronal cell death.
