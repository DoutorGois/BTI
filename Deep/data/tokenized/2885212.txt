Dendritic depolarization, which seems to be involved in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), was elicited by localized glutamate application. When paired to low frequency synaptic activation in the same area, the subsequent changes had features in common with LTP, expressed as an increased probability of firing and shorter spike latency. The EPSP was not significantly increased.
