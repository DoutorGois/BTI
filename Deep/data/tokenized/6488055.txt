The postnatal development of short-term potentiation (STP) and long-term potentiation (LTP) was examined in the neocortex and dentate gyrus of rats aged 7 days to adult. STP and LTP of the transcallosal response in the neocortex could not be demonstrated until the third postnatal week. STP and LTP of the perforant path-dentate response could not be demonstrated until the second postnatal week. In both cases, STP appeared several days before LTP. Structural and neurochemical correlates of STP/LTP development, and their implications for possible STP/LTP mechanisms, are discussed.
