Brain neurochemistry and cognition performance are thought to decline with age. Accumulating data indicate that similar events occur after prolonged methamphetamine (MA) exposure. Using the rat as a model, the present study was designed to uncover common alteration patterns in brain neurochemistry and memory performance between aging and prolonged MA exposure. To this end, animals were treated with a chronic binge MA administration paradigm (20mg/kg/day from postnatal day 91 to 100). Three-age control groups received isovolumetric saline treatment and were tested at the MA age-matched period, and at 12 and 20 months. We observed that both MA and aged animals presented a long, but not short, time impairment in novelty preference and an increased anxiety-like behavior. Neurochemical analysis indicated similar MA- and age-related impairments in dopamine, serotonin and metabolites in the striatum, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Thus, the present data illustrate that MA may be used to mimic age-related effects on neurotransmitter systems and advocate MA treatment as a feasible animal model to study neuronal processes associated with aging.
