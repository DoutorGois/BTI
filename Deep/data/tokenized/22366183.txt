The adult brain responds to diverse pathologies such as stroke with increased generation of neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. However, only little is known regarding the functional integration of newborn neurons into pre-existing neuronal circuits. In this study, we investigated whether newborn neurons generated after experimental stroke are recruited for different behavioral tasks. Adult mice received photochemical cortical infarcts in the sensorimotor cortex and proliferating cells were labeled using the proliferation marker, bromodeoxyuridine. Eight weeks after stroke induction, the animals were trained to perform either a spatiotemporal task or a sensorimotor task. Immediate early gene expression (c-fos, Zif268) in newborn neurons was analyzed directly after the last session. Using this approach, we demonstrate that post-stroke generated neurons are recruited within the hippocampal networks. The sensorimotor task activates significantly more newborn neurons compared to the spatiotemporal task. Further experiments employing the two well-established stimulators of neurogenesis, enriched environment and voluntary wheel running, both significantly increase post-stroke neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus but do not affect the percentage of recruited neurons compared to controls. Significantly, the spatiotemporal task leads to a higher portion of activated newborn neurons in the granule cell layer, suggesting a specific spatial activation pattern of new neurons in the dentate gyrus.
