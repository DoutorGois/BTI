The intrahippocampal injection of two agonists of excitatory aminoacid (EAA) receptors elicited neuronal damages localized in CA1 and dentate gyrus for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) (20 nmol) and extended to the various hippocampal areas, except dentate gyrus for kainic acid (KA) (2.5 nmol). The pretreatment of the animals with N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP) (20 mg/kg), a noncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist, prevented the neuronal injury induced by NMDA and KA in CA1. The distribution of neuronal damages and of TCP-protected areas closely correlated to that of EEA-receptors and of TCP binding sites in the hippocampus.
