OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the new Traditional Chinese Compound Shenwu Capsule on the damage of lymphocyte DNA and lipid peroxidation in peripheral blood of rats induced by beta-amyloid injection. METHOD: The animal model was made by injection of beta-amyloid25-35 into hippocampus of rats. DNA damage of lymphocytes was measured by the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) combined with the laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was determined by TBA assay. RESULT: Shenwu Capsule decreased the rate of the comet-like cell, comet-like cell lengh (TCL), and tail moment (TM) of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of model rats. Shenwu Capsule also declined the MDA content in serum of Abeta model rats. CONCLUSION: Shenwu Capsule has protective effect on peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA.
