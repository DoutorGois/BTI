Anterogradely labeled terminals were found densely in field CA1, but not in any other field, of the hippocampal formation following injections of horseradish peroxidase into the ventral TE area of the inferotemporal cortex, whereas no label was seen in any field of the hippocampal formation following injections into the dorsal TE area. The labeled terminals were distributed mainly in a medial part of the stratum moleculare of field CA1 throughout its rostrocaudal extent. The present finding provides the first demonstration of direct projections from the inferotemporal cortex to the hippocampal formation.
