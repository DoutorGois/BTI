Proteomic differences in the hippocampus of stress-resistant and stress-sensitive rats were detected on the model of emotional stress. Differential expression of some proteins was detected in animals with different behavioral activity initially and after experimental stress exposure. Specific involvement of the hippocampus in the realization of stress response in animals with different sensitivity to emotional stress was demonstrated.
