Hippocampal slices were labelled with [3H]glutamate. Evoked release, which was calcium-dependent and inhibited by tetrodotoxin, could be reduced concentration-dependently by L-PIA. The effect of L-PIA was blocked by 10 microM 8-phenyltheophylline. The results indicate that there are adenosine receptors modulating the efflux of glutamate in field stimulated hippocampal slices.
