The expression of aldolase C and aldolase A mRNA was assessed by Northern blot hybridization using RNAs purified from cultured rat and mouse brain neurons and astroglial cells. Neurons were found to contain about 4-fold more aldolase C mRNA and about twice as much aldolase A mRNA than astroglia. Analysis of the cellular localization of aldolase C mRNA by in situ hybridization to brain slices showed a predominantly neuronal labeling with an irregular distribution. A strong signal was observed in Purkinje cell somata and a weaker signal in subpopulations of neurons in cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamic nuclei and primary olfactory cortex.
