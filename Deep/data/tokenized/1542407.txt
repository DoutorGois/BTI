We examined the distribution of synapsin I in the gerbil brain and investigated ischemic damage of presynaptic terminals immunohistochemically by using this protein as a marker protein of synaptic vesicles. The reaction for synapsin I in normal gerbil brain is exclusively localized in the neuropil, and other brain structures such as neuronal soma, dendrites, axon bundles, glia and endothelial cells exhibited little immunoreactivity. In a reproducible gerbil model of unilateral cerebral ischemia, ischemic loss of synapsin I immunoreactivity in the affected hemisphere was confined to the area exhibiting overt infarction, where the breakdown of this protein was also confirmed by the immunoblot analysis, and noted much later than that of microtubule-associated protein 2 immunoreactivity, which was demonstrated in neuronal soma and dendrites. In the non-affected hemisphere, selective damage of presynaptic terminals due to Wallerian degeneration and subsequently occurring resynaptogenesis at the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were clearly demonstrated as a loss and recovery of immunoreaction for synapsin I, respectively. In a gerbil model of bilateral cerebral ischemia, immunoreaction for synapsin I was persistently preserved after seven days to two months recirculation following a brief period of global forebrain ischemia in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, where delayed neuronal death was consistently observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
