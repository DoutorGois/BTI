Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), initially identified as mitogens with prominent angiogenic properties, is now recognized as multifunctional growth factors with notable actions on neuronal cells. bFGF promotes the survival and neurite growth of brain neurons in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it functions as a neurotrophic factor. This effect of bFGF could be beneficial for improving the survival of grafted neurons in transplantation. Furthermore, bFGF acutely modulates synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, suggesting that it has a role like a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. In this article, we make a brief review of multiple biological activities of bFGF for brain neurons and discuss its potential usefulness for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
