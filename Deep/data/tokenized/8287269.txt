Nucleus paragigantocellularis stimulation potentiates the medial perforant path population spike in the dentate gyrus via beta-receptor activation. In this study, the same paragigantocellularis stimulation preceding lateral olfactory tract pulses depressed the lateral perforant path mediated synaptic potential in dentate gyrus. Depression of the lateral olfactory tract input was blocked by a beta-antagonist. These in vivo results confirm in vitro reports that norepinephrine induces potentiation of medial perforant path input and depression of lateral perforant path input to dentate gyrus.
