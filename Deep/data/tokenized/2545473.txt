1. The effects of carbachol, monoamines and K+ upon the rate of inositol phospholipid breakdown in pig brain miniprisms have been investigated. 2. In the striatum, carbachol (EC50 approx. 1 microM) and noradrenaline (EC50 approx. 25 microM) stimulated inositol phospholipid breakdown, whereas 5-hydroxytryptamine (1-1000 microM) was without effect. 3. The rate of inositol phospholipid breakdown was increased by raising the assay [K+] to greater than or equal to 40 mM. In the hippocampus and hypothalamus, a synergistic effect between K+ and carbachol was noted, whereas in the striatum, the effects were additive. 4. In striatal and hippocampal miniprisms, dopamine also increased inositol phospholipid breakdown, albeit only at high (greater than or equal to 1 mM) concentrations. Dopamine (1 mM) reduced the stimulation produced by noradrenaline (1 mM), suggesting that the effect of dopamine is due to a weak noradrenergic action of this catecholamine.
