Singlet oxygen has been detected in single nerve cells by its weak 1270 nm phosphorescence (a1deltag --> X3sigmag-) upon irradiation of a photosensitizer incorporated in the cell. Thus, one can now consider the application of direct optical imaging techniques to mechanistic studies of singlet oxygen at the single-cell level.
