The effects of several gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic drugs on sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) were investigated in the hippocampus. HACU was measured in vitro after in vivo administration of the drug to mice. HACU was inhibited by those drugs that enhance GABA transmission. The convulsant 3-mercaptopropionic acid, which decreases GABA levels, stimulated HACU. From these results and previous findings, it appears that GABA mediates a tonic inhibitory effect on the septal-hippocampal cholinergic system.
