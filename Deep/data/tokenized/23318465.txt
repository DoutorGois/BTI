OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether IL-1beta treatment affects F-actin in hippocampal neurons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary culture of hippocampal neurons were prepared from rat embryos, and the effect of different concentrations of IL-1beta on the cell phenotype was investigated. Cell viability was monitored by CCK-8 activity analysis. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to analyze protein levels and morphological changes in cells treated with IL-1beta. RESULTS: IL-1beta increased viability at low doses and these increases were severely blunted at higher concentrations. Similarly, the expression of F-actin was increased at low concentrations and decreased at high concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1beta has a critical role in regulating hippocampal neuron viability by stimulating F-actin expression. These data suggest that IL-1beta secretion at low doses is beneficial for the expression of F-actin, which can improve the survival of hippocampal neurons during stress. However,these effect were severely blunted at higher concentrations.
