Intracortical microelectrodes play a prominent role in the operation of neural interfacing systems. They provide an interface for recording neural activities and modulating their behavior through electric stimulation. The performance of such systems is thus directly meliorated by advances in electrode technology. We present a new architecture for intracortical electrodes designed to increase the number of recording/stimulation channels for a given set of shank dimensions. The architecture was implemented on silicon using microfabrication process and fabricated 3-mm-long electrode shanks with six relatively large (110 mum x110 mum) pads in each shank for electrographic signal recording to detect important precursors with potential clinical relevance and electrical stimulation to correct neural behavior with low-power dissipation in an implantable device. Moreover, an electrode mechanical design was developed to increase its stiffness and reduce shank deflection to improve spatial accuracy during an electrode implantation. Furthermore, the pads were post-processed using pulsated low current electroplating and reduced their impedances by approximately 30 times compared to the traditionally fabricated pads. The paper also presents microfabrication process, electrodes characterization, comparison to the commercial equivalents, and in vitro and in vivo validations.
