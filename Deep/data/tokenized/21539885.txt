Mice were subcutaneously injected with d-galactose (D-gal, 150 mg/kg per day) for 6 weeks and were administered high molecular weight persimmon condensed tannin (HMWPT) simultaneously. After 6 weeks of treatment, the animal behavior was observed in the open field test and water maze test, and the morphology of hippocampus and skin were checked. Meanwhile, the activities of antioxidant enzymes, the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidants, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) were evaluated. The results indicated that HMWPT markedly inhibited the d-gal induced learning and memory impairment in both open field test and Morris water maze. Biochemical examination revealed that HMWPT significantly increased the decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), elevated the lowered total anti-oxidation capability (T-AOC), glutathione (GSH) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) contents (p<0.01 or p<0.05), and decreased the raised monoamine oxidase (MAO), total cholinesterase (TChE) activities and MDA level (p<0.01) in serum, liver or brain of aging mice induced by d-gal in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, HMWPT significantly and (p<0.01) attenuated the d-gal induced number decrease, neuronal degeneration and karyopycnosis in cells in the hippocampus and decrease of thickness of skin epidermis and dermis.
