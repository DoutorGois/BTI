RATIONALE: The progesterone metabolite 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) is an important modulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and stress-induced corticosterone response. Typically, 3alpha,5alpha-THP levels are increased in response to acute stress, which may then reduce corticosterone release from the adrenals. Early postnatal stimulation is a developmental stressor that can produce pervasive endocrine effects. OBJECTIVES: The present studies investigated the effects of early postnatal stimulation on plasma progestin and corticosterone levels and hippocampal progestin levels of rats. METHODS: On postnatal days 9 and 10, rats were either left in their home cage undisturbed or injected intraperitoneally as a means of early stimulation (ES). Tissues were collected on either postnatal day 10 (6 h after last handling experience) or adulthood. Plasma corticosterone, progesterone, and 3alpha,5alpha-THP and hippocampal progesterone and 3alpha,5alpha-THP were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: On postnatal day 10, plasma, but not hippocampal, levels of progesterone and 3alpha,5alpha-THP were significantly lower among rats exposed to ES than control rats. These effects occurred concomitant with a tendency for plasma corticosterone to be higher among ES compared to control rats. In adulthood, hippocampal 3alpha,5alpha-THP was significantly lower among ES vs control rats. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that ES may influence immediate secretion of 3alpha,5alpha-THP and corticosterone and have pervasive effects in adulthood on the biosynthesis and/or metabolism of progestins in the hippocampus.
