We investigated the effect of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) on the prevention of the delayed neuronal death in rats subjected to transient and brief forebrain ischemia. As the results, SAMe dose-dependently protected the hippocampal CA1 neurons from degeneration and necrosis, whose effect was suppressed by simultaneous administration of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, a potent inhibitor in transmethylation. No protective effect was observed in CDP-choline, phosphatidylcholine and L-methionine. Therefore, it is necessary for the prevention of the delayed neuronal death to enhance cerebral SAMe level and to activate transmethylation using SAMe as a methyl donor in postischemic brain.
