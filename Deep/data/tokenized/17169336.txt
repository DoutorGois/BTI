To test whether the increased intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) is responsible for the enhanced glutamate toxicity, antisense oligonucleotide of ClP55, a Cl- -ATPase/pump associated protein, was transfected in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Neuronal [Cl-]i in the antisense oligonucleotide-transfected culture increased to a level 3- to 4-fold higher than that in control. Glutamate exposure (10 microM, 10 min) increased neuronal apoptosis and decreased Akt-pS473 level in the antisense oligonucleotide-transfected neurons, but not in control or sense oligonucleotide-transfected ones, suggesting the responsibility of elevated [Cl-]i in the enhancement of glutamate neurotoxicity.
