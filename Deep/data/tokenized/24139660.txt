At the beginning of the 1990s, as part of work being done for a master's degree thesis in physics, an important observation of hippocampal degeneration in Alzheimer's disease was made in Pavia. However this result was never published in a full scientific paper. This case gives an idea of how an isolated observation can, in the right setting, develop into a real scientific achievement.
