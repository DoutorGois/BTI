Young homing pigeons were subjected to hippocampal lesion before being placed in their permanent loft to examine what effect such treatment may have on the development of their navigational map, which supports homing from distant unfamiliar locations. When later released from 3 distant unfamiliar locations, the hippocampal-lesioned pigeons were impaired in taking up a homeward bearing. The results identify a deficit in the acquisition of navigational ability after hippocampal ablation in homing pigeons. The results strongly suggest a deficit in navigational map acquisition, but alternative interpretations cannot be excluded. The findings offer the first insight into the central neural structures involved in the acquisition of the pigeon navigational map. Further, the results identify the hippocampus as a structure critical for the regulation of navigational behavior that manifests itself in a natural setting.
