The accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in the brain of Alzheimer disease patients is associated to cognitive deficit, increased oxidative stress, and alterations in the circadian rhythms. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Neurogranin (RC3), play an important role in the synaptic plasticity underlying memory and learning. Previously, we observed BDNF and RC3 expression follow a daily rhythmic pattern in the hippocampus of young rats. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of aggregated Abeta peptide (1-42) on temporal patterns of ApoE protein, Bdnf and Rc3 mRNA, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, in the rat hippocampus. We observed an i.c.v. injection of Abeta aggregates phase shifts daily BDNF and RC3 expression as well as LPO and decreased the mesor of GSH rhythms. ApoE protein levels vary rhythmically throughout the day. ApoE levels increase at ZT 03:39+/-00:22 in the hippocampus of control rats and at ZT 06:30+/-00:28 in the treated animals. Thus, elevated levels of Abeta aggregates, characteristic of AD, altered temporal patterns of cognition related-factors, probably, as a consequence of changes in the daily variation of ApoE-mediated Abeta aggregates clearance as well as in the 24h rhythms of the cellular redox state.
