Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to its cell surface receptor TrkB to regulate differentiation, development, synaptic plasticity, and functional maintenance of neuronal cells. Binding of BDNF triggers TrkB dimerization and autophosphorylation, which provides docking sites for adaptor proteins to recruit and activate downstream signaling molecules. The molecular mechanisms underlying BDNF-TrkB endocytic trafficking crucial for spatiotemporal control of signaling pathways remain to be elucidated. Here we show that retrolinkin, a transmembrane protein, interacts with endophilin A1 and mediates BDNF-activated TrkB (pTrk) trafficking and signaling in CNS neurons. We find that activated TrkB colocalizes and interacts with the early endosome marker APPL1. Both retrolinkin and endophilin A1 are required for BDNF-induced dendrite development and acute extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation from early endosomes. Suppression of retrolinkin expression not only blocks BDNF-triggered TrkB internalization, but also prevents recruitment of endophilin A1 to pTrk vesicles trafficking through APPL1-positive endosomes. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for BDNF-TrkB to regulate signaling both in time and space through a specific membrane trafficking pathway.
