In the brain, tachykinins acting via the three cloned neurokinin (NK) receptors are implicated in stress-related affective disorders. Hemokinin-1 is a novel tachykinin that reportedly prefers NK1 to NK2 or NK3 receptors. Although NK1 and NK3 receptors are abundantly expressed in the brain, NK2-receptor-mediated electrophysiological effects have rarely been described as NK2 receptors are expressed only in a few brain regions such as the nucleus of the medial septum/diagonal band. Medial septal/diagonal band neurons that control hippocampal mnemonic functions also colocalize NK1 and NK3 receptors. Functionally, intraseptal activation of all three NK receptors increases hippocampal acetylcholine release and NK2 receptors have specifically been implicated in stress-induced hippocampal acetylcholine release. Electrophysiological studies on the effects of NKs on septohippocampal cholinergic neurons are lacking and electrophysiological effects of hemokinin-1 have thus far not been reported in brain neurons. In the present study we examined the electrophysiological and pharmacological effects of multiple NKs on fluorescently tagged septohippocampal cholinergic neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a rat brain slice preparation. We demonstrate that a vast majority of septohippocampal cholinergic cells are activated by NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptor agonists as well as by hemokinin-1 via direct post-synaptic mechanisms. Pharmacologically, hemokinin-1 recruits not only NK1 but also NK2 and NK3 receptors to activate septohippocampal cholinergic neurons that are the primary source of acetylcholine for the hippocampus.
