A comparative study of the influence of kynurenic acid (KYNA), L-kynurenine (KYN) and ethylimidazole-4-5-dicarboxylic acid (IEM-1442) on neuro-destructive effect of quinolinic acid (QUIN) in hippocampal cell cultures of mouse embryos and on convulsive action of QUIN after its injection into the brain ventricles of adult mice was performed. In presence of KYNA the neuronal destruction in vitro didn't occur under QUIN exposure, while in situ KYNA had no effect on convulsive action of QUIN. On the other hand, KYN and IEM-1442 didn't block the neurodegenerative action of QUIN in vitro, whereas in situ these compounds showed the anticonvulsant, effect. The results obtained suppose, that some anticonvulsants, preventing convulsive effects of QUIN, are not antagonists of the receptors, which mediate its neurodegenerative action.
