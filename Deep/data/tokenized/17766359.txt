Cognitive dysfunction may result from abnormality of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Although various forms of synaptic plasticity in learning that rely on altering of glutamate receptors have been considered, the evidence is insufficient from an informatics view. Dynamics could reflect neuroinformatics encoding, including temporal pattern encoding, spatial pattern encoding, and energy distribution. Discovering informatics encoding is fundamental and crucial to understanding the working principle of the neural system. In this article, we analyzed the dynamic characteristics of response activities during learning training in cultured hippocampal networks under normal and abnormal conditions of ionotropic glutamate receptors, respectively. The rate, which is one of the temporal configurations, was decreased markedly by inhibition of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Moreover, the energy distribution in different characteristic frequencies was changed markedly by inhibition of AMPA receptors. Spatial configurations, including regularization, correlation, and synchrony, were changed significantly by inhibition of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. These results suggest that temporal pattern encoding and energy distribution of response activities in cultured hippocampal neuronal networks during learning training are modulated by AMPA receptors, whereas spatial pattern encoding of response activities is modulated by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors.
