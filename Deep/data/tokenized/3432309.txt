Effects of injection of drugs into the septum on pentobarbital anesthesia were investigated in the rat. Intraseptal microinjection of bicuculline (5 micrograms), arecoline (2 micrograms), and phenylephrine (5 micrograms) shortened, MK-212 (5 micrograms) prolonged, and atropine (2 micrograms) had no significant effect on the duration of pentobarbital-induced loss of righting reflex. Bicuculline and arecoline increased and MK-212 reduced hippocampal cholinergic activity as measured by change in hippocampal sodium-dependent high-affinity choline uptake after intraseptal drug injection. It is concluded that activation of the septal-hippocampal cholinergic pathway might be an important neuromechanism for recovery from pentobarbital-narcosis.
