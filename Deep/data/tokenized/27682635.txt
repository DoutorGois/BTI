Methylphenidate (MPH) is a stimulatory agent in brain with unknown long-term consequences. In this study, MPH-induced neurodegeneration in adult rat brain was assessed. Rats were acutely treated with different doses of MPH. Open Field Test was used to investigate anxiety and depression levels. Inflammatory factors and anti-oxidant activity were also evaluated in isolated hippocampus and cerebral cortex. MPH treated groups (10 and 20 mg/kg) demonstrated anxiety and depression like behavior in OFT. MPH significantly increased lipid peroxidation, GSSG level, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha in isolated tissues. In addition, MPH at the same doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) reduced GSH, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity significantly in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In conclusion, acute administration of high doses of MPH can cause oxidative and inflammatory changes in brain cells and induce neurodegeneration in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of adult rats.
