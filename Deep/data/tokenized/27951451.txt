Schizophrenia is characterized by behavioral symptoms, brain function impairments and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. Dysregulation of immune responses and oxidative imbalance underpins this mental disorder. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CP) alone or combined with the natural antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on changes in the hippocampal average spectral power induced by ketamine (KET). Three days after stereotactic implantation of electrodes, male Wistar rats were divided into groups treated for 10 days with saline (control) or KET (10 mg/kg, IP). CP (1 or 5 mg/kg, IP) alone or combined with ALA (100 mg/kg, P.O.) was administered 30 min before KET or saline. Hippocampal EEG recordings were taken on the 1st, 5th and 10th days of treatment immediately after the last drug administration. KET significantly increased average spectral power of delta and gamma-high bands on the 5th and 10th days of treatment when compared to control. Gamma low-band significantly increased on the 1st, 5th and 10th days when compared to control group. This effect of KET was prevented by CP alone or combined with ALA. Indeed, the combination of ALA 100 + CP1 potentiated the inhibitory effects of CP1 on gamma low-band oscillations. In conclusion, our results showed that KET presents excitatory and time-dependent effects on hippocampal EEG bands activity. KET excitatory effects on EEG were prevented by CP alone and in some situations potentiated by its combination with ALA.
