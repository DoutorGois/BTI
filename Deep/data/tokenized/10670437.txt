Brain-derived neurotrophic factor contributes profoundly to modulate activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in adult brain areas such as the hippocampus, but the mechanisms underlying this important role still remain unclear. Recently, we have shown that two serine/threonine kinases, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-2 and casein kinase-2, are capable of mediating brain-derived neurotrophic factor responses in adult rat hippocampus. In the present study, using hippocampal slices from adult rat, we show that phospholipase C-regulated calcium signals couple the brain-derived neurotrophic factor receptor to two distinct pathways: a pathway in which calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-2 stimulates a signalling module involving the p38 subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases and its downstream target, usually named mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2; and a pathway in which the extracellular signal-regulated kinase subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases activates casein kinase-2. Our results suggest that: (i) extracellular signal-regulated kinase is activated by B-Raf in response to a calcium-sensitive adenylate cyclase; and (ii) extracellular signal-regulated kinase activates casein kinase-2 via a protein phosphatase(s) that may be of the PP1 and/or PP2A type. Interestingly, we also show that neurotrophin-induced activation of the two signalling cascades promotes a sustained activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and casein kinase-2 in slices. Considering the ability of these two kinases to be persistently activated, and that most of the protein kinases which lie in these pathways are believed to be important for multiple events underlying neuronal plasticity, it is suggested that the mechanisms described here might contribute both to rapid synaptic changes through local effects and to long-lasting synaptic responses through new gene transcription in the hippocampus.
