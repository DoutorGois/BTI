The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of experimental uremia elicited in Wistar rats by 5/6 kidney resection on the leu-enkephalin level in hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and adrenal glands. We found, that in uremic rats leu-enkephalin levels decreased in striatum and in adrenal glands. The level of leu-enkephalin in adrenal glands was directly related to plasma creatinine. The weight of uremic rats was significantly lower than that of control rats.
