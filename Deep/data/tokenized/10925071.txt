Our previous work indicates that deltamethrin induces degeneration and apoptosis in rat brain at 24 and 48 h after treatment. To determine whether molecular characteristics of apoptosis is involved in neurodegeneration in rat brain after deltamethrin treatment, we investigated the effects of deltamethrin on the mRNA expression of p53 and bax and their correlation with deltamethrin-induced apoptotic cell death in rat brain. Hematoxylin-eosin and cresyl violet staining revealed numerous degenerative cells in cortex and hippocampus at 5 and 24 h after deltamethrin treatment. Apoptotic cells were detected in cortex and hippocampus of treated rats at 24 h by in situ end labeling, whereas no apoptotic cells were observed in the same brain regions at 5 h after treatment. By using in situ hybridization, it was demonstrated that the increase of p53 and bax mRNA levels appeared at 5 and also at 24 h after treatment. The alterations in mRNA expression of p53 and bax preceded the occurrence of delayed apoptotic cell death in the same brain regions after deltamethrin treatment. These results indicate that (1) deltamethrin induces delayed apoptotic cell death, which may play an important role in deltamethrin-elicited neurodegeneration; (2) deltamethrin leads to the persistent increase of p53 and bax mRNA levels, which may contribute to delayed apoptosis in rat brain following deltamethrin treatment.
