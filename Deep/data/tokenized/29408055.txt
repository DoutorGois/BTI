Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely prescribed drug for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Findings in the literature suggest that the effects of MPH on memory may result from increased extracellular levels of norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). Here, we report that the systemic administration of MPH before the acquisition phase in a social discrimination task impaired the retrieval of the social recognition memory (SRM), but made it state-dependent: another administration of MPH before the retention test recovered the SRM. We observed that the induction of state dependency by MPH relies on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), but not on the CA1 region of the hippocampus (CA1). Also, the inhibitors of NE and DA, nisoxetine and GBR12909, respectively, restored the SRM when infused into the vmPFC. Only the GBR12909 was able to restore the SRM in the CA1, whereas nisoxetine could not restore and even caused an impairment on memory retrieval when infused alone before the retention test. The data suggest that the state-dependence of SRM induced by MPH depends on an influence of both catecholamines on the vmPFC, while NE inhibits the retrieval of SRM on the hippocampus.
