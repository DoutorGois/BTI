Many hippocampal neurons (place cells) appear to represent a particular location within an environment (their place field). This property would appear to be central to hippocampal involvement in navigation based on spatial memory. Although a navigationally useful representation might also include information about distal goals, having a place field and being able to represent a distal goal would appear to be mutually exclusive place cell properties. Our simulations demonstrate, however, that information about goal direction can be simply derived from the changes in place field density that occur when place fields shift location in a goal-directed manner. Previous reports that place fields respond dynamically to shifts in goal location may, therefore, represent the operation of such a system.
