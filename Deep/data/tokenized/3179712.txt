Neuronal loss and dendritic pathology are often observed in humans and animals after long-term ethanol ingestion. It is not known, however, if surviving but damaged neurons can recover normal structure during ethanol abstinence. We quantified dendritic spine density in two neuronal populations in rat hippocampus to investigate whether reversibility from the cellular neurotoxic sequelae of chronic ethanol exposure was possible. Male Long-Evans rats were maintained for 20 weeks on an ethanol-containing liquid diet. Controls were pair-fed a liquid diet with sucrose substituted isocalorically for ethanol. One-half of each group was sacrificed at the end of the 20-week treatment and one-half was given a 20-week ethanol-free recovery period period to sacrifice. Analysis of rapid Golgi material revealed a decreased spine density in CA1 pyramidal cells that increased to control level during abstinence, and an increased spine density in dentate gyrus granule cells that was reduced toward control level during abstinence. Thus, despite the fact that chronic ethanol exposure produced differential initial effects, the return toward normal spine density in each region is consistent with the concept of neuronal recovery and reorganization during abstinence from ethanol.
