The regional distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 receptors in the primate brain was studied by semi-quantitative autoradiographic analysis of tritiated ligand binding. Areas showing the highest density of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 receptors (greater than 200 fmol [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine bound per mg tissue), included the cerebral cortex (laminae I-II), claustrum, posterior cell group of the basal nucleus of Meynert, the infracommissural part of the globus pallidus, cortical amygdaloid nucleus, hippocampal formation (CA1-subiculum region, the anterior CA2, CA3 and CA4 regions and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus), thalamic nuclei (parafascicular, parataenial, paraventricular and superior central lateral nuclei), substantia nigra pars reticulata, dorsal raphe nucleus and choroid plexus. The distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1 receptors is compared to the distribution of both 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors and terminal fields of serotonergic projections as previously described in subprimates.
