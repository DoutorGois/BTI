We used a sensitive silver degeneration staining method to study the effects of insertion of microdialysis probes in rat dorsal hippocampus and neocortex. Nine animals were sacrificed 24 h, 3 days or 7 days after implantation of dialysis tubing. Although mild neuronal cell death and small petechial hemorrhages were seen in close proximity to the implantation site, the striking finding was the presence of degenerating axons both adjacent to the implantation site and in remote sites such as the corpus callosum and contralateral hippocampus. The observed changes could alter brain function near or remote from the implantation site and should be considered in analysis of dialysis experiments.
