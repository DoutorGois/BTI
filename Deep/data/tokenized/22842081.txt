Caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to either decrease or prevent the progression of several age-related pathologies. In previous work, we demonstrated that CR modulates astrocyte functions, suggesting that CR may exert neuroglial modulation. Here, we investigated the effects of CR on hippocampal (Hc) and cortical (Cx) oxidative stress parameters of male Wistar rats. Our results showed that CR-fed rats had 17% less body weight gain after 12 weeks of treatment. CR improved locomotion performance, increased glutathione levels and decreased glutathione peroxidase activity and the production of reactive oxygen species. However, no changes were observed in lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide content and catalase activity. Single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) revealed a reduction in the extent of basal DNA damage upon CR. Our data suggest that dietary CR could induce both hippocampal and cortical modulation resulting in metabolic changes and as a consequence, significant improvement of cellular defense-associated parameters.
