Neurotransmission mediated by acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) plays an important role in learning and memory functions in the hippocampus. Impairment of the cholinergic system contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD), indicating the importance of AChRs as drug targets for AD. To improve the success rates for AD drug development, human cell models that mimic the target brain region are important. Therefore, we characterized the functional expression of nicotinic and muscarinic AChRs (nAChRs and mAChRs, respectively) in human hippocampal neurons differentiated from hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells (HIP-009 cells). Intracellular calcium flux in 4-week differentiated HIP-009 cells demonstrated that the cells responded to acetylcholine, nicotine, and muscarine in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 13.4 +/- 0.5, 6.0 +/- 0.4, and 35.0 +/- 2.5 microM, respectively). In addition, assays using subtype-selective compounds revealed that major AD therapeutic target AChR subtypes-alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nAChRs, as well as M1 and M3 mAChRs-were expressed in the cells. Furthermore, neuronal network analysis demonstrated that potentiation of M3 mAChRs inhibits the spontaneous firing of HIP-009 neurons. These results indicate that HIP-009 cells are physiologically relevant for AD drug screening and hence are loadstars for the establishment of in vitro AD models.
