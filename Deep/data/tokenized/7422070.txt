The effect of castration and adrenalectomy was studied on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) concentrations in various brain and peripheral structures of male rats. Castration has no effect on any of the structures studied, whereas 4 weeks adrenalectomy (ADX) decreases VIP concentrations in the hippocampus and increases them in the adenohypophysis, two structures known to contain large amounts of glucocorticoid receptors. Corticosterone administration restores VIP levels to control values only in the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, dexamethasone counteracts both the decrease and the increase of VIP concentrations obtained after ADX in the hippocampus and in the adenohypophysis respectively. The present results suggest that corticosteroids can be involved in the regulation of VIP actions both in the brain and in the adenohypophysis.
