Suramin, which has been used for more than 50 years as an anthelmintic in humans, has recently been shown to inhibit P2 purinoceptors in the CNS and to block glutamate-evoked excitatory potentials in hippocampus. We now report that suramin inhibits (IC50 approximately 100 microM) the binding of [3H]CGP 39653, a ligand specific for NMDA-type glutamate receptors in brain. Consequently, suramin at concentrations used sometimes in physiological experiments may act as both P2x and NMDA antagonist. Since both NMDA receptors and P2x-subtype of purinoceptors form Ca(2+)-selective channels, suramin may block Ca2+ entry into neurones depolarized by either ATP, L-glutamate or any other neurotransmitter or drug acting via P2x or NMDA receptors.
