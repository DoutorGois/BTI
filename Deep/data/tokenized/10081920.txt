Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques, neuritic degenerations, disturbed glutamatergic neurotransmission and a peculiar inflammatory response. Diffuse plaques develop into neuritic plaques when neurites undergo degeneration in the plaque area. Hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins is a major step in neuritic pathology. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been found in diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques in AD. Therefore the question arises whether IL-6 is involved in the transformation of diffuse into neuritic plaques by affecting tau phosphorylation. We investigated the influence of glutamate and IL-6 on tau phosphorylation in cultured primary rat hippocampal neurons. Glutamate but not IL-6 induced a dephosphorylation of tau. Furthermore IL-6 did not influence the glutamate-induced dephoshorylation of tau. We conclude that the role of IL-6 in AD is not related to the phosphorylation of tau.
