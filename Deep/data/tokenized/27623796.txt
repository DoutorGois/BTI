OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of memory-related antioxidant genes and miRNAs under simulated weightlessness and the regulation of mechano growth factor (MGF) E domain, the peptide preventing nerve damage. RESULTS: Igf-iea and mgf mRNA levels, expression of antioxidant genes sod1 and sod2 and levels of miR-134 and miR-125b-3p increased in rat hippocampus after 14 days tail suspension to simulate weightlessness which was inhibited with intramuscular injection of E domain peptide. Therefore, administration of MGF E domain peptide could reverse increased expressions of memory-related igf-iea, mgf, sod1, sod2, miR-134 and miR-125b-3p in rat hippocampus under simulated weightlessness. CONCLUSIONS: MGF may regulate the redox state and miRNA-targeted NR-CREB signaling, and intramuscular injection may be the alternative administration because of its safety, convenience and ability to pass through the blood brain barrier.
