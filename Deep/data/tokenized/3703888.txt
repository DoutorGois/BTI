Male mice of the BALB/c strain were given a solution of 12% v/v ethanol as their only source of fluid for 7 months. Memory performance was tested after ethanol was omitted from the diet for 3 to 9 weeks, and was compared with performance of control animals (no ethanol) which had been pair-fed or had received tap water. The spontaneous alternation task that was used consisted of two forced trials (acquisition) followed, at varying intervals ranging from 30 sec to 6 hr, by a free test trial (retention). Experimental subjects exhibited an accelerated rate of decay of spontaneous alternation, reaching chance level at 6 hours. All animals were then tested at this 6-hour interval following injections of either physostigmine or neostigmine that were given before both acquisition and retention (0.05 mg/kg IP). Results showed that physostigmine, but not neostigmine, dramatically improved performance of alcohol-treated subjects. Parallel neurochemical analysis showed that chronic ethanol treatment induced a slight (12%) but significant decrease in hippocampal sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake. Though these findings suggest that the observed memory deficits (i.e., an accelerated rate of forgetting) might be related to a cholinergic dysfunction, alternative explanations are also proposed.
