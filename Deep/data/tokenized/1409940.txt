Early Pb exposure is known to disrupt the development of the hippocampus and result in deficits in learning and memory capacities and altered seizure susceptibility. The excitatory amino acid, NMDA, is found in high concentrations in the hippocampus and has been implicated in learning and memory functions and seizure activity. Rat pups nursed mothers exposed to high (4%), moderate (0.4%), or low (0.05%) levels of PbCO3 in their diet, or a Na2CO3 control diet from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P25. Rat pups were injected with varying doses of NMDA on P15 or P25. Control animals showed a characteristic slowly developing response to NMDA, usually including tail twitches and wet dog shakes at approximately 10 and 40 mg/kg at P15 and P25, respectively, with status epilepticus and death occurring at 40 and 80 mg/kg. Lead-exposed animals displayed an altered sensitivity to NMDA, with high and medium Pb animals showing the onset of behavioral signs and death at lower NMDA doses, the degree of which being dependent on the level of Pb exposure. Low Pb-exposed animals showed a more variable and attenuated response to NMDA. The data are discussed in terms of the possible mechanisms of Pb neurotoxicity.
