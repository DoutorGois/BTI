AIM OF THE STUDY: The cognitive-enhancing and antioxidant activities of KD-501, a standardized extract of the roots of Scrophularia buergeriana Miquel (Scrophulariceae) were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KD-501 was orally administered to amnesic mice induced by scopolamine and we performed passive avoidance and the Morris water maze tests. To elucidate the mechanism of cognitive-enhancing activity, the effects of KD-501 on the activities of acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes within the cortex and hippocampus of mice were evaluated. RESULTS: Acute and prolonged oral administration of KD-501 significantly ameliorated scopolamine-induced amnesia in passive avoidance test. In the Morris water maze test, acute and prolonged administration of KD-501 improved the impairment of spatial memory induced by scopolamine indicated by the formation of reference and working memories. The activity of acetylcholinesterase was significantly inhibited by KD-501 within the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, the reduced activities or contents of glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced GSH within the cortex and hippocampus caused by scopolamine were elevated by the treatment of KD-501. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, it could be postulated that KD-501 may exert its potent cognitive-enhancing activity through both anti-acetylcholinesterase and antioxidative actions.
