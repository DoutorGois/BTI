GABABRs have a well-established role in controlling neuronal excitability and presynaptic neurotransmitter release. We examined the role of GABABR activity in modulating the number and lateral diffusion of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses. Changes in diffusion of GABAARs at synapses were observed when subunit heterogeneity was taken into account. While alpha1-GABAARs were unaffected, alpha2- and alpha5-GABAARs showed inverse changes in enrichment and diffusion. The intracellular TM3-4 loop of alpha2 was sufficient to observe the changes in diffusion by GABABR activity, whereas the loop of alpha5 was not. The opposing effect on alpha2- and alpha5-GABAARs was caused by a competition between GABAARs for binding slots at synapses. Receptor immobilization by cross-linking revealed that alpha5-GABAAR trapping at synapses is regulated by modulation of alpha2-GABAAR mobility. Finally, PKC activity was determined to be part of the signaling pathway through which GABABR activity modulates alpha2-GABAAR diffusion at synapses. These results outline a novel mechanism for tuning inhibitory transmission in a subunit-specific manner, and for the first time describe competition between GABAARs with different subunit compositions for binding slots at synapses.
