The projection from the ventral tegmental area of Tsai (VTA-A10) to the hippocampal formation was investigated in the rat by means of the Fink-Heimer technique, after VTA destruction by electrolytic lesion or local injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 1 micrograms/0.5 microliters). Degenerated fibers are prevalently present in the ventral subiculum and CA1 field. These areas match with the area projecting towards the nucleus accumbens. Thus the dopaminergic meso-cortico-limbic pathway could modulate the HF-striatal projection which represents a link between the limbic and central motor systems.
