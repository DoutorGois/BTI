In this study we investigated the effects of nefiracetam (DM-9384) on local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) and local cerebral glucose utilization (LCMR(glc)) in the chronic phase after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats. Nefiracetam (10 mg/kg) was administered orally once a day for 2 weeks from day 15 after MCA occlusion. On day 28 after MCA occlusion, LCBF and LCMR(glc) were measured by an autoradiographic image-processing method. In MCA-occluded rats, LCBF and LCMR(glc) in the ischemic side of seven regions including the frontal cortex were significant decreased compared with those of the nonischemic side. Nefiracetam significantly improved the impairment of LCBF in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, caudate putamen, ventral thalamus, amygdaloid nucleus and hippocampus. It also improved the decrease of LCMR(glc) in the frontal cortex, ventral thalamus and hippocampus. These results suggested that nefiracetam has ameliorating effects on chronic disorders of LCBF and LCMR(glc) induced by MCA occlusion.
