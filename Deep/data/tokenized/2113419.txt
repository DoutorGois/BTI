Studies utilizing microinjections of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) were performed to determine potentially sensitive limbic brain sites to the ulcerogenic effect of TRH. Administration of TRH into the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) produced a high (80%) incidence of gastric lesions and also significantly stimulated acid secretion. Microinjections of TRH into other brain sites including superior colliculus, medial septum, substantia nigra and the hippocampus (CA1 area) were ineffective. Intra-CEA TRH-induced gastric lesions and acid secretion were prevented by vagotomy. These results indicate that the amygdala is of importance for mediating the ulcerogenic effect of brain TRH through peripheral vagal pathways.
