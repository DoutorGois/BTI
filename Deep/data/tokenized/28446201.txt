BACKGROUND: Antiaris toxicaria has previously shown anticonvulsant activity in acute animal models of epilepsy. The aqueous extract (AAE) was further investigated for activity in kindling with pentylenetetrazole and administration of pilocarpine and kainic acid which mimic temporal lobe epilepsy in various animal species. RESULTS: ICR mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were pre-treated with AAE (200-800 mg kg(-1)) and convulsive episodes induced using pentylenetetrazole, pilocarpine and kainic acid. The potential of AAE to prevent or delay onset and alter duration of seizures were measured. In addition, damage to hippocampal cells was assessed in kainic acid-induced status epilepticus test. 800 mg kg(-1) of the extract suppressed the kindled seizure significantly (P < 0.05) as did diazepam. AAE also produced significant effect (P < 0.01) on latency to first myoclonic jerks and on total duration of seizures. The latency to onset of wet dog shakes was increased significantly (P < 0.05) by AAE on kainic acid administration. Carbamazepine and Nifedipine (30 mg kg(-1)) also delayed the onset. Histopathological examination of brain sections showed no protective effect on hippocampal cells by AAE and nifedipine. Carbamazepine offered better preservation of hippocampal cells in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 regions. CONCLUSION: Antiaris toxicaria may be effective in controlling temporal lobe seizures in rodents.
