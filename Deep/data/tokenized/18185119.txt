To determine whether spontaneous local field potential (LFP) activities in the rat medial prefrontal cortex influence the responses evoked by hippocampal stimulation, we investigated the relationship between the evoked responses and the LFP powers immediately before the stimulation using anesthetized rats. We demonstrated that the degrees of evoked response showed significant inverse correlations with the prefrontal LFP powers in a specific frequency band (including the gamma band) immediately before the stimulation. The results indicate that the specific frequency band activities in the prefrontal LFPs may be involved in prefrontal responsiveness. Spontaneous LFP activities may have a role in information processing in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway.
