Nerve growth factor (NGF) gene expression in central nervous system (CNS) glia appears to be associated with active glial growth. To study the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the effects of a number of growth-related factors on NGF mRNA expression in glial cultures. Our results suggest that glial membrane interaction, as a consequence of growth, actively inhibits NGF gene expression in CNS glia.
