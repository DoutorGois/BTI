To determine if reported reductions of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) induced by the tryciclic antidepressant clomipramine (CMI) (10 mg/kg) are due to a presynaptic action on serotonin (5-HT) terminals, 3-month-old Fischer-344 rats were given parachloroamphetamine (PCA), a serotonin neurotoxin. rCMRglc was measured 3 weeks later in 55 brain regions after the administration of saline or CMI using the quantitative autoradiographic [14C]2-deoxyglucose procedure. PCA alone increased rCMRglc in the visual cortex. CMI alone reduced rCMRglc in 18 (33%) of the studied regions, including telencephalic, diencephalic, limbic, and brain stem areas. In PCA-lesioned rats, metabolic responses to CMI (10 mg/kg) were greatly reduced, and significant rCMRglc decreases were observed only in 4 (7%) of the brain areas, including the hippocampus and raphe nuclei. Abolition by PCA of the metabolic responses to CMI confirms that CMI, at the dose studied, reduces rCMRglc via a presynaptic mechanism, likely the 5-HT reuptake sites.
