As a result of natural history studies, it has been hypothesized that food-storing birds may develop a special kind of memory to cope with the demand imposed by their food-storing behaviour (i.e. the ability to retrieve food from a wide variety of stores over varying amounts of time after storage). Recent studies on food-storing birds suggest that, at a relatively late stage in their development, the specific memories associated with food-storing behaviour can stimulate growth of the hippocampus, an area of the brain concerned with memory processing.
