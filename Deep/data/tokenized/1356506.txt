Changes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and level of mRNA of TH gene in PT and CBA/Lac mouse strains, which are contrast by ability to dominate in heterogenous populations, were investigated. It was established, that the activity of TH both in dominate PT and subordinate CBA/Lac mice in hypothalamus, hippocampus and brain stem elevated in one hour after forming of micropopulations. But the appearance of this increase was different: activation of TH in hypothalamus and brain stem of PT mice was stronger then one in CBA/Lac mice. Moreover, the beginning of the reaction in brain stem of PT mice was earlier then that of CBA/Lac mice. MRNA level of TH gene in hypothalamus and brain stem in one hour was elevated only in PT mice for 50% and 200%, respectively. No changing in expression TH gene was found in hippocampus. In conclusion, it was suggested that the activation of catecholamine biosynthesis under social stress in hypothalamus and brain stem of male mice was due to the TH activation and increase of its gene expression.
