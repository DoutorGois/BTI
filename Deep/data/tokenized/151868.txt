Rat brains have been studied after treatment with oral doses of 50 mg imipramine/day for 3 and 6 months. 20 brains have been studied histologically, 3 brains electronmicroscopically, 6 brains histochemically as well as 34 controll brains. On the light microscopic level no pathologic changes of intravital origin have been revealed. The hyperchromatic changes of neurons were of the same character and degree and showed the same topic distribution in the experimental and in the control group. They should be regarded as postmortem artifacts. The pyramidal cells of hippocampus field h3, the Purkinje cells and the Golgi epithelial cells have been examined by electron microscopy. Besides a possible slight induction of lysosomes no alterations could be found. The histochemical studies (succinate dehydrogenase, ATPase, AMPase, acid phosphatase, PAS, methylgreenpyronin) revealed no differences between the experimental and the control group.
