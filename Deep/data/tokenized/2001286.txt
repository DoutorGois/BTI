The Drosophila learning mutant, rutabaga, is deficient in the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase, and studies of associative learning in Aplysia have implicated this enzyme in neuroplasticity. Therefore, the distribution of mRNA encoding the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase in rat brain was examined by in situ hybridization. mRNA for this enzyme is expressed in specific areas of brain that have been implicated in learning and memory, including the neocortex, the hippocampus, and the olfactory system. The presence of mRNA for this enzyme in the pyramidal and granule cells of the hippocampal formation provides evidence that it is found in neurons. These data are consistent with the proposal that the calmodulin-sensitive adenylate cyclase plays an important role in learning and memory.
