AIMS: Reactive sulfur species, including hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and its oxydates, have been raised as novel redox signaling molecules. The present study aimed at examining whether endogenous sulfhydration signal is required for long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for memory. RESULTS: In this study, we found that increased synaptic activity triggered sulfide generation and protein sulfhydration. Activity-triggered sulfide production was essential for N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTP via maintaining the availability of d-serine, a primary coagonist for synaptic NMDARs. Genetic knockdown of cystathionine beta-synthase, not cystathionine gamma-lyase, impaired LTP. H2S increased NMDAR-dependent LTP via sulfhydration and disinhibition of serine racemase (SR), a main synthetase of d-serine. We found that polysulfides also increased NMDAR-dependent LTP and NMDAR activity. In aged rats, the level of H2S and SR sulfhydration decreased significantly. Exogenous supplement of H2S restored the sulfhydration of SR, followed by the improvement of age-related deficits in LTP. Furthermore, boost of H2S signal in vivo improves hippocampus-dependent memory. Innovation and Conclusion: Our results provide a direct evidence for the biological significance of endogenous sulfhydration signal in synaptic plasticity. Exogenous supplement of H2S could be considered as the new therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurocognitive dysfunction after aging. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 27, 398-414.
