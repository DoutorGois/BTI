Methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) is a mitotic inhibitor that has been used to selectively destroy neuroblasts at specific times during gestation. The administration of MAM results in a dose-dependent microencephaly. Following MAM treatment at 15 days of gestation, we have noted an increase in the level of SS immunoreactivity in the neocortex, as determined by radioimmunoassay. Northern blot analysis for preproSS mRNA revealed an increase in MAM-treated cortex. The cellular distribution of SS has been determined using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. There was a 30% increase in the density of SS-immunoreactive neurons in the cortex of the MAM-treated animals. These data suggest that SS neurons in the cortex are spared following MAM treatment at GD 15.
