Trichosporon asahii is an opportunistic yeastlike fungus that colonizes the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and human skin. Although it is an important cause of disseminated infections by non-Candida species, there are a few reports related to its virulence factors and their possible role in in vivo pathogenicity. We developed a murine model of disseminated trichosporonosis in immunocompetent mice for the evaluation of the in vivo pathogenicity of 6 T. asahii isolates with different in vitro virulence factor profiles. Tissue fungal burden was determined on days 1, 3, 7, 15, and 25 post-challenge. Overall, the largest fungal load was detected in the kidney on the 5 experimental days, while brain, spleen, and liver displayed a comparatively low fungal count. We observed a fungal burden decrease in most experimental groups from day 15. Histological analysis showed the presence of T. asahii in tissue and a generalized inflammatory infiltrate of polymorphonuclear cells in the kidney, liver, red pulp of the spleen, and the hippocampus. Even though our isolates showed different in vitro virulence factors profiles, we did not detect relevant differences when assayed in vivo, except for a higher persistence of a protease- and biofilm-producing strain in kidney, liver, and brain.
