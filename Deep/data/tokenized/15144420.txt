PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f) quinoxaline-2,3-dione) and topiramate (TPM) given after hypoxia-induced seizures in preventing the delayed effect of hypoxia on subsequent susceptibility to seizures and neuronal injury. METHODS: We used "two-hit" rodent seizure model to study the long-term effect of perinatal hypoxia on later kainate (KA) seizure-induced neuronal damage and investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a postseizure treatment protocol in reversing the conditioning effect of early-life seizures. RESULTS: Hypoxia at P10 induces seizures without cell death but causes an increase in susceptibility to second seizures induced by KA as early as 96 h after hypoxia, and this lowered seizure threshold persists to adulthood. Furthermore, perinatal hypoxia increases KA-induced neuronal injury at postnatal day (P)21 and 28/30. Repeated doses of NBQX (20 mg/kg) or TPM (30 mg/kg) given for 48 h after hypoxia-induced seizures prevent the increase in susceptibility to KA seizure-induced hippocampal neuronal injury at P28/30. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor blockade after hypoxia prevents the priming effect of perinatal hypoxia-induced seizures and that this protection occurs independent of its anticonvulsant action.
