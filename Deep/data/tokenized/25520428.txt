Partial recovery from brain injury due to trauma, hypoxia, or stroke, is ubiquitous and occurs largely through unknown mechanisms. It is now well accepted that injury enhances proliferation of quiescent stem and progenitor cells in specialized niches within the brain. However, whether this injury-induced neurogenesis contributes to recovery after brain injury remains controversial. Recent evidence suggests that hippocampal neural stem/precursor cell activation and subsequent neurogenesis are responsible for at least some aspects of spontaneous recovery following brain injury from a variety of causes. However, other aspects of injury-induced neurogenesis, including its contribution to adverse sequelae such as seizures, are still being investigated. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and how it relates to injury and explain how current mouse technology is allowing for better understanding of whether manipulating this natural process might eventually help inform therapy following brain injury.
