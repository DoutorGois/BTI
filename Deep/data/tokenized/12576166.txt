PURPOSE: We carried out a pilot study of quantitative volumetric MRI of the amygdala in patients undergoing surgery for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. We wished to explore whether amygdala volume correlated with pre-operative clinical variables and post-operative outcome. METHODS: Ten patients had detailed volumetric measurements of their amygdala and hippocampus according to operationalised anatomical criteria from an optimised MRI imaging sequence. A ratio of volumes from the unoperated to operated side was calculated. Surgical specimens were examined histologically for astrocytosis. RESULTS: The volumes of the amygdala and hippocampus on the operated side were significantly smaller than on the unoperated side. More severe astrocytosis appeared to go along with smaller volume ratios but the relationship was not significant. There were few significant correlations between volumes measures and clinical or outcome variables. CONCLUSION: Reductions in amygdala volume in the to-be-operated temporal lobe in patients with medically intractable epilepsy can be reliably detected using volumetric MRI. Accurate amygdala volume measures do not appear to exert a significant effect on clinical presentation and outcome in the presence of hippocampal volumes reductions, but may be useful in confirming bilateral pathology. Larger studies examining clinico-pathological correlations are recommended.
