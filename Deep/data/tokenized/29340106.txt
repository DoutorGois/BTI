We tested the hypothesis that high-fat diet consumption during pregnancy, lactation, and/or post weaning, altered the expression of molecular mediators involved in hippocampal synaptic efficacy and impaired spatial learning and memory in adulthood. The beneficial effect of resveratrol was assessed. Dams were fed a rat chow diet or a high-fat diet before mating, during pregnancy, and throughout lactation. Offspring were weaned onto either a rat chow or a high-fat diet. Four experimental groups were generated, namely CC, HC, CH, and HH (maternal chow diet or high-fat diet; postnatal chow diet or high-fat diet). A fifth group fed with HH plus resveratrol (HHR) was generated. Morris water maze test was used to evaluate spatial learning and memory. Blood pressure and IPGTT was measured to assess insulin resistance. Dorsal hippocampal expression of certain biochemical molecules, including sirtuin 1, ERK, PPARgamma, adiponectin, and BDNF were measured. Rats in HH group showed impaired spatial memory, which was partly restored by the administration of resveratrol. Rats in HH group also showed impaired glucose tolerance and increased blood pressure, all of which was rescued by resveratrol administration. Additionally, SIRT1, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-PPARgamma, adiponectin and BDNF were all dysregulated in rats placed in HH group; administration of resveratrol restored the expression and regulation of these molecules. Overall, our results suggest that maternal high-fat diet during pregnancy and/or lactation sensitizes the offspring to the adverse effects of a subsequent high-fat diet on hippocampal function; however, administration of resveratrol is demonstrated to be beneficial in rescuing these effects.
