The effect of combination of imipramine or amitriptyline acute or chronic treatment with ethanol on EEG was studied in rabbits with electrodes chronically implanted into the frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus and midbrain reticular formation. In addition, to study the effect of the treatment on development of tolerance to ethanol, a group of rabbits receiving ethanol with antidepressants was additionally injected iv with ethanol once a week. Single doses of both the antidepressants did not alter the effect of acute administration of ethanol on EEG, but imipramine and amitriptyline potentiated the ethanol-induced changes in the EEG recorded from the midbrain reticular formation in rabbits receiving ethanol chronically and in the period of abstinene. The antidepressants did not change the development of tolerance to ethanol.
