Trimethyltin (TMT), an organotin with potent neurotoxic effects by selectively damaging to hippocampus, is used as a tool for creating an experimental model of neurodegeneration. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of magnolol, a natural biphenolic compound, on TMT-induced neurodegeneration and glial activation in vitro and in vivo. In HT22 murine neuroblastoma cells, TMT induced necrotic/apoptotic cell death and oxidative stress, including intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), protein carbonylation, induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and activation of all mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) family proteins. However, magnolol treatment significantly suppressed neuronal cell death by inhibiting TMT-mediated ROS generation and activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs. In BV-2 microglial cells, magnolol efficiently attenuated TMT-induced microglial activation via suppression of ROS generation and activation of JNK, p38 MAPKs, and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling. In an in vivo mouse study, TMT induced massive neuronal damage and enhanced oxidative stress at day 2. We also observed a concomitant increase in glial cells and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression on the same day. These features of TMT toxicity were reversed by treatment of magnolol. We observed that p-JNK and p-p38 MAPK levels were increased in the mouse hippocampus at day 1 after TMT treatment and that magnolol blocked TMT-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation. Magnolol administration prevented TMT-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration and glial activation, possibly through the regulation of TMT-mediated ROS generation and MAPK activation.
