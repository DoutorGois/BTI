1. Hippocampal frequency potentiation, a form of short-term potentiation of hippocampal electrical synaptic potentials that is related to mnemonic and learning processes, is typically damped in aged rats and in certain rat strains with impaired place learning performance. 2. In vitro induction of hippocampal dentate frequency potentiation has been found decreased in striatally-lesioned rats with impaired place learning performance in water maze test. 3. The results demonstrate that also in brain-lesioned rats the poor performances in place learning of the animals are associated with a selective dentate frequency potentiation impairment. Thus in vitro induction of dentate frequency potentiation might be regarded as a model to detect the electrophysiological counterpart of the cognitive impairment in rats with altered place learning.
