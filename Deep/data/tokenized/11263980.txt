The Frizzled-type cysteine-rich domain (CRD) is a binding motif for soluble-type glycoprotein WNTs, which play key roles in embryogenesis and carcinogenesis. Here, we have cloned and characterized a novel gene MFRP, encoding a type II transmembrane protein with CRD. In addition to CRD, two tandem-repeats containing the Cubilin domain approximately the MFRP domain were present in the extracellular region of MFRP. Although MFRP was homologous to Corin, FZDs, and SFRPs in CRD, amino-acid identities between CRD in MFRP and CRDs in these molecules were less than 40%. The MFRP gene on 11q23 consisted of at least 13 exons. The 4.0-kb MFRP was not detected by Northern blot analysis in normal tissues other than adult and fetal brain. The MFRP mRNA was undetectable in seven gastric cancer cell lines, seven brain tumor cell lines, and other eight tumor cell lines. Regional distribution of the MFRP mRNA in human brain was further investigated, and MFRP was found to be expressed strongly in medulla oblongata, and weakly in hippocampus and corpus callosum. Thus, MFRP with CRD might play key roles in medulla oblongata as a regulator of the WNT signaling pathway.
