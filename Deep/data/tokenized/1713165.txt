Slices of rat hippocampus, preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline [(3H]NA), were superfused continuously and stimulated by addition of 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP; 100 microM) for 10 min to the superfusion medium. An overflow of 3H evoked by 3,4-DAP (representing [3H]NA release) was measurable not only in the presence but also in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Both the protein kinase C (PKC) activator 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (4 beta-PDB) and the PKC inhibitor polymyxin B, affected mainly the evoked release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in a facilitatory or inhibitory manner, respectively. Moreover, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, both the 3,4-DAP-evoked [3H]NA release and the facilitatory effect of 4 beta-PDB were abolished in the presence of tetrodotoxin or in the absence of Na+ in the superfusion medium. Ruthenium red, a blocker of mitochondrial Ca2+ reuptake, potently increased 3,4-DAP-evoked [3H]NA release in Ca(2+)-free EGTA-containing medium. The facilitatory effects of ruthenium red and 4 beta-PDB were additive. From these and earlier observations we conclude (1) that the mechanism of 3,4-DAP-evoked [3H]NA release involves both Ca2+ influx into the nerve terminals and mobilization of intraneuronal Ca2+ pools. Most probably Ca2+ release from cytoplasmic Ca2+ stores (e.g. endoplasmic reticular pools or mitochondria) is induced by Na+ ions entering the nerve endings during 3,4-DAP-evoked repetitive action potentials. (2) The facilitatory effect of phorbol ester on 3,4-DAP-evoked NA release appears to be mediated not by changes in Ca2+ influx, but by enhancement of intraneuronal events distal to Na+ ion entry and increased intracellular Ca2+ availability.
