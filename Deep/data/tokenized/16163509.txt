Although estrogens possess neuroprotective and epileptogenic properties, the expression pattern of the estrogen receptor (ER) following status epilepticus (SE) remains unclear. We therefore examined the expression pattern of ER alpha in the adult rat hippocampus after SE. SE was induced in rats by kainic acid (KA; 12 mg/kg, i.p.). ER alpha expression was assessed by immunostaining and Western blotting at various times (24 h, and 7, 14, and 21 days) after SE onset. Immunohistochemistry disclosed ER alpha expression in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells of control rats, whereas, after SE, ER alpha-immunoreactive neurons decreased in number due to neuronal death in the CA1 from days 7 to 21. On the other hand, ER alpha-immunoreactive cells with astrocytic morphology were observed in the CA1 beginning on day 7 after SE. This immunoreactivity increased in proportion to the hypertrophy of astrocytes up to day 21. Western blotting revealed a significant decrease in ER alpha expression on day 7 after SE in comparison with control level. However, ER alpha expression on days 14 and 21 were similar when comparing KA-treated and control rats. These results indicate that reactive astrocytes are important sites of estrogen action in the hippocampal CA1 after SE.
