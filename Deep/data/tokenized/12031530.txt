The present study evaluated whether environmental enrichment-related effects on the development of stereotyped behavior in deer mice were associated with alterations in neuronal metabolic activity. Deer mice were reared under either enriched or standard housing conditions for 60 days following weaning. All mice were then placed in automated photocell detectors and classified as either stereotypic or non-stereotypic. Neuronal metabolic activity was then assessed using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. The results demonstrated that environmental enrichment significantly increased neuronal metabolic activity in the motor cortex. Furthermore, non-stereotypic mice exhibited significantly more CO activity than stereotypic mice in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala. This latter effect was due to the enriched mice as evidenced by a significant interaction between housing condition and behavioral status in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and hippocampus. Thus, the observed increase in CO activity reflected increased neuronal metabolic activity in non-stereotypic enriched mice relative to stereotypic enriched mice. These results suggest that, in a developmental model of spontaneous stereotypy, the enrichment-related prevention of stereotyped behavior is associated with increased CO activity.
