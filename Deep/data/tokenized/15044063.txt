Recent studies have indicated that cerebral ischemia induces rapid serine phosphorylation of synaptic RAS-GTPase activating protein (SynGAP) by calcium/Camodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in rat hippocampus. To further illustrate the mechanisms underlying these processes, we examined the effects of transient (15 min) brain ischemia followed by reperfusion (0, 30 min, 6 h, 1, 3 days) on serine phosphorylation of SynGAP and interactions involving SynGAP, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and CaMKII in rat hippocampus. Transient brain ischemia was induced by the method of four-vessel occlusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. Serine phosphorylation of SynGAP increased immediately after brain ischemia and peaked at 30-min reperfusion, and the increase was maintained for 3 days. The association among SynGAP, PSD95 and CaMKII had a similar trend as serine phosphorylation of SynGAP. Intracrebroventricular infusion of PSD95 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide not only markedly decreased the protein levels of PSD95 but also attenuated the elevated serine phosphorylation of SynGAP and the associations among SynGAP, PSD95 and CaMKII induced by 30-min reperfusion following 15-min brain ischemia. The results suggest that the serine phosphorylation of SynGAP catalyzed by CaMKII is immediately increased and that PSD95 is critical for promoting SynGAP serine phosphorylation after transient brain ischemia.
