It has previously been demonstrated that Dp71, the most abundant dystrophin protein in the brain, is mainly localized in the postsynaptic densities. Here we show the localization of Dp71f, one of the splice variants of this protein, within the CA3 region of the hippocampus. Immunopositivity occurs in the postsynaptic density of small asymmetrical axospinous and axodendritic synapses, while it is absent in the postsynaptic densities of the axospinous synapses of the large mossy fiber terminals. Dp71f immunoreactivity was found to be attached to the membranes of the mossy fibers in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 area. In a certain population of thin myelinated axons the protein seems to be present within the axon proper. These data support the notion of a physiological role of Dp71f distinct from other dystrophin isoforms present in the central nervous system.
