Glucose deprivation produced neuronal degeneration of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice cultures. The effects of the adenosine agonist cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) and antagonist cyclopentylxanthine (CPX) on CA1 neuronal loss following hypoglycemia was examined using propidium iodide fluorescence as an indicator of cell death. The intensity of propidium iodide fluorescence in hippocampal area CA1 was quantified using Optimas image analysis software. Following 2 or 3 h of glucose deprivation, CPX significantly enhanced injury in the CA1 region while CHA provided significant protection. These results suggest that adenosine plays an important role in endogenous neuronal protection during hypoglycemic injury, and also supports a role for the use of adenosine agonists as neuroprotective agents.
