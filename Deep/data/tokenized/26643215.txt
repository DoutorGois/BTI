Acetylation of nucleosome histones results in relaxation of DNA and its availability for the transcriptional regulators, and is generally associated with the enhancement of gene expression. Although it is well known that activation of a variety of pro-adaptive genes represents a key event in the development of brain hypoxic/ischemic tolerance, the role of epigenetic mechanisms, in particular histone acetylation, in this process is still unexplored. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in acetylation of histones in vulnerable brain neurons using original well-standardized model of hypobaric hypoxia and preconditioning-induced tolerance of the brain. Using quantitative immunohistochemistry and Western blot, effects of severe injurious hypobaric hypoxia (SH, 180mm Hg, 3h) and neuroprotective preconditioning mode (three episodes of 360mm Hg for 2h spaced at 24h) on the levels of the acetylated proteins and acetylated H3 Lys24 (H3K24ac) in the neocortex and hippocampus of rats were studied. SH caused global repression of the acetylation processes in the neocortex (layers II-III, V) and hippocampus (CA1, CA3) by 3-24h, and this effect was prevented by the preconditioning. Moreover, hypoxic preconditioning remarkably increased the acetylation of H3K24 in response to SH in the brain areas examined. The preconditioning hypoxia without subsequent SH also stimulated acetylation processes in the neocortex and hippocampus. The moderately enhanced expression of the acetylated proteins in the preconditioned rats was maintained for 24h, whereas acetylation of H3K24 was intense but transient, peaked at 3h. The novel data obtained in the present study indicate that large activation of the acetylation processes, in particular acetylation of histones might be essential for the development of brain hypoxic tolerance.
