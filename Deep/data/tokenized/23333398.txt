Dynamic analysis of oxygen (O(2)) has been limited by the lack of a real-time, quantitative, and biocompatible sensor. To address these demands, we designed a ratiometric optode matrix consisting of the phosphorescence quenching dye platinum (II) octaethylporphine ketone (PtOEPK) and nanocystal quantum dots (NQDs), which when embedded within an inert polymer matrix allows long-term pre-designed excitation through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Depositing this matrix on various glass substrates allowed the development of a series of optical sensors able to measure interstitial oxygen concentration [O(2)] with several hundred millisecond temporal resolution in varying biological microdomains of active brain tissue.
