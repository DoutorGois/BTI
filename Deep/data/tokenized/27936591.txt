A novel systems therapeutics approach, involving simultaneous inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), has been validated as a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). First-in-class dual inhibitors bearing a sildenafil core have been very recently reported, and the lead molecule 7 has proven this strategy in AD animal models. Because scaffolds may play a critical role in primary activities and ADME-Tox profiling as well as on intellectual property, we have explored alternative scaffolds (vardenafil- and tadalafil-based cores) and evaluated their impact on critical parameters such as primary activities, permeability, toxicity, and in vivo (pharmacokinetics and functional response in hippocampus) to identify a potential alternative lead molecule bearing a different chemotype for in vivo testing.
