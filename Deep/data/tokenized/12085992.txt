The expression of Bis (also called Bag-3), a Bcl-2-binding protein, was investigated in the rat kainic acid (KA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in the expression levels of Bis protein in the hippocampus following the systemic administration of KA. Bis immunoreactivity increased preferentially in the CA1 and CA3 regions, as well as in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus. Experiments with double immunofluorescence revealed that, in KA-administered rats, the cells expressing Bis were GFAP-expressing reactive astrocytes. The increase in Bis immunoreactivity was accompanied by increased Bcl-2 in reactive astrocytes in the striatum radiatum, whereas Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in pyramidal neurons was not affected. These results of the co-expression of Bis and Bcl-2 in reactive astrocytes in this seizure model suggest that Bis might modulate the glial reaction under excitotoxic brain injury, probably by interacting with Bcl-2.
