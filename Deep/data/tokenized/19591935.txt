Dopamine and the endocannabinoids, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, interact at several levels in the brain, with the involvement of both cannabinoid CB(1) receptors and transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channels (which are alternative anandamide receptors). Using pharmacological, immunohistochemical and analytical approaches, we investigated the response of dopamine D(3) receptor null (D3R((-/-))) mice in models of epilepsy and anxiety, in relation to their brain endocannabinoid and endovanilloid tone. Compared to wild-type mice, D3R((-/-)) mice exhibited a delayed onset of clonic seizures, enhanced survival time, reduced mortality rate and more sensitivity to anticonvulsant effects of diazepam after intraperitoneal administration of picrotoxin (7 mg/kg), and a less anxious-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze test. D3R((-/-)) mice also exhibited different endocannabinoid and TRPV1, but not CB(1), levels in the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and striatum. Given the role played by CB(1) and TRPV1 in neuroprotection and anxiety, and based on data obtained here with pharmacological tools, we suggest that the alterations of endocannabinoid and endovanilloid tone found in D3R((-/-)) mice might account for part of their altered responses to excitotoxic and anxiogenic stimuli.
