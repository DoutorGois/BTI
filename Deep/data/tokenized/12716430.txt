One-week treatment with the benzodiazepine (BZ) flurazepam (FZP), results in anticonvulsant tolerance, associated with reduced GABAA receptor (GABAR) subunit protein and miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current (mIPSC) amplitude in CA1 neurons of rat hippocampus. Because protein kinase A (PKA) has been shown to modulate GABAR function in CA1 pyramidal cells, the present study assessed whether GABAR dysfunction is associated with changes in PKA activity. Two days after 1-week FZP treatment, there were significant decreases in basal (- 30%) and total (- 25%) PKA activity, and a 40% reduction in PKA RIIbeta protein in the insoluble fraction of CA1 hippocampus. The soluble component of CA1 showed a significant increase in basal (100%) but not total PKA activity. Whole-cell recording in vitro showed a 50% reduction in mIPSC amplitude in CA1 pyramidal cells, with altered sensitivity to PKA modulators. Neurons from FZP-treated rats responded to 8-bromo-cAMP with a significant increase (31%) in mIPSC amplitude. Likewise, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), an endogenous PKA activator, caused a significant 36% increase in mIPSC amplitude in FZP-treated cells. Neither agent had a significant effect on mIPSC amplitude in control cells. This study supports a role for PKA in GABAR dysfunction after chronic FZP treatment.
