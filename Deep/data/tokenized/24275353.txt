We investigated on the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes involved in the cholinergic control of in vivo hippocampal glutamate (GLU), aspartate (ASP) and inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) overflow. We also investigated on the possible contribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors subtypes present on astrocytes in the regulation of the three neurotransmitter amino acids overflow using hippocampal gliosomes and on the effects of beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-40 on the nicotinic control of amino acid neurotransmitter release. Nicotine was able to enhance the in vivo overflow of the three amino acids being more potent in stimulating GLU overflow. The alpha7 selective agonist PHA543613 induced an overflow very similar to that of nicotine. The alpha4beta2 selective agonist 5IA85380 was significantly less potent in inducing GLU overflow while the overflow of ASP and GABA were almost inconsistent. Abeta1-40 inhibited the neurotransmitter overflow stimulated by PHA543613 but not the one evoked by 5IA85380. In hippocampal gliosomes nicotine elicited selectively GLU overflow which was also evoked by 5IA85380 and by the alpha7 selective agonist choline. Nicotine- and choline-induced glutamate overflow in gliosomes was inhibited by Aalpha1-40. In conclusion nicotine administration in vivo elicits hippocampal GLU release mostly through alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors likely present both on neurons and astrocytes. Abeta inhibitory effect on the nicotinic-control of GLU release seems to depend primarily to the inhibition of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors functional responses.
