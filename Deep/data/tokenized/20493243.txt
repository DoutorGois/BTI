Step-down inhibitory avoidance is usually acquired in one single trial, which makes it ideal for studying processes initiated by training, uncontaminated by prior or further trials, rehearsals, or retrievals. Neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS-1) is a dopamine receptor interacting protein that has been associated with associative learning and memory. We evaluated whether inhibitory avoidance can alter NCS-1 levels in rat brain. We focused our analysis on the striatum, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Protein levels were measured using immunoblotting normalized by actin levels. Our results indicate that NCS-1 levels are not altered after step-down inhibitory avoidance in rat striatum, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. The link between protein interactions and the varied physiological roles of NCS-1 still remains to be fully established. Furthermore, other experiments are needed to shed more light on the role of NCS-1 and other mechanisms linked to signaling pathways related to inhibitory avoidance task.
