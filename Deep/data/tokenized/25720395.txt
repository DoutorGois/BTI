Causes of initiation and progression of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) are likely multiple and include impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics. We analyzed RNA expression levels of multiple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and biogenesis (mitobiogenesis) genes in unfixed hippocampal (WH) frozen sections (10 sAD; 9 CTL) and laser-captured hippocampal pyramidal neurons (PyNs, ~1000 neurons from each case) from 8 sAD and 7 CTL cases. Nuclear-encoded OXPHOS genes in WH were significantly increased in sAD, whereas in isolated sAD PyNs, these same genes were significantly decreased. Mitochondrial DNA-encoded genes were increased in sAD PyNs but showed a non-significant downward trend in sAD WH. Relationships among WH and PyN gene expression levels in sAD distributed in a different population compared to CTL. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed clustering of CTL but widespread heterogeneity of sAD samples. In sAD, mitochondrial bioenergetics at the gene expression level are depressed in vulnerable PyNs. PCA revealed that CTL samples clustered together, whereas sAD samples varied widely. From the perspective of OXPHOS bioenergetics, sAD is a heterogeneous syndrome and not likely due to a single abnormality. Increased stimulation of nuclear-encoded OXPHOS gene expression in PyNs is a rational therapeutic approach for most but not all cases of sAD.
