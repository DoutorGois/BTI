Damage observed in the hippocampus of the adult spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) resembles the neuropathology of mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension, supporting a similar endocrine dysfunction in both entities. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that increased expression of the hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in SHR animals is associated with a prevalent expression of pro-inflammatory over anti-inflammatory factors. Accordingly, in the hippocampus, we measured mRNA expression and immunoreactivity of the MR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction and histochemistry. We also measured serum-glucocorticoid-activated kinase 1 (Sgk1 mRNA), the number and phenotype of Iba1+ microglia, as well as mRNA expression levels of the pro-inflammatory factors cyclo-oxygenase 2 (Cox2), Nlrp3 inflammasome and tumour necrosis factor alpha (Tnfalpha). Expression of anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor (Tgf)beta mRNA and the NADPH-diaphorase activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were also determined. The results showed that, in the hippocampus of SHR rats, expression of MR and the number of immunoreactive MR/GR co-expressing cells were increased compared to Wistar-Kyoto control animals. Expression of Sgk1, Cox2, Nlrp3 and the number of ramified glia cells positive for Iba1+ were also increased, whereas Tgfbeta mRNA expression and the NADPH-diaphorase activity of NOS were decreased. We propose that, in the SHR hippocampus, increased MR expression causes a bias towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype characteristic for hypertensive encephalopathy.
