Intracellular peroxidase injections were made on CA3 pyramidal neurons from slices obtained from 3-60 day old control and experimental rats. Experimental rats had been irradiated at birth with gamma-rays to destroy the granule cells of the fascia dentata. Neonatal gamma-ray irradiation induced a clear cut reduction of the total number of granule cells (80% decrease at P60) and mossy fibers as revealed by Nissl and Timm stains. The number of branching points and segments, total dendritic length, and density of dendritic spines in the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens on CA3 pyramidal cells were not significantly different between control and irradiated rats. To quantify the development of thorny excrescences we measured the number and total area of the thorny excrescences per neuron at different stages of development. gamma-Ray irradiation induced a reduction in the number and total area of thorny excrescences. This effect was readily apparent by postnatal day (P) 12, and a reduction of 70% in the total area was observed at P30. In conclusion, gamma-ray irradiation destroys the majority of granule cells and induces a reduction in the development of thorny excrescences. Our data strongly suggest that this effect is directly caused by the lack of mossy fibers rather than by the irradiation itself since other parameters (i.e., the number of segments and branching points, density of non-mossy spines, and total dendritic length) were not affected. Therefore, we suggest that mossy fibers play an inductive role in the formation of thorny excrescences.
