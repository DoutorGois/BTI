Experiments have been made on adult, 16-20 and 6-10 day old rabbits with electrodes chronically implanted into the left and right dorsal hippocamp. Solutions of arecoline (M-cholinomimetic) and nicotine (N-cholinomimetic) were administered into the penicillin epileptogenic focus of the hippocamp. Large doses of arecoline (10 mg) and nicotine (0.5 mg) did not affect the epileptiform discharges in the EEG, but inhibited the fits in adult and 16-20 day old rabbits...
