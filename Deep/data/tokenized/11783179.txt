OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Caoguo Zhimu decoction (CGZMD) on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor gene expression of epileptic model on rat brain. METHODS: Adopting the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling model to observe the NMDAR1 mRNA gene expression by situs hybridization. RESULTS: After 28 days of CGZMD treatment, the NMDAR1 mRNA gene expression on CA1, CA2, CA3 part of rat hippocampus reduced obviously, the comparison between experimental group and the model control group showed significant difference (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CGZMD decreased NMDAR1 mRNA gene expression, it may be caused the NMDA receptor decline, hence revealed its anti-epileptic effect.
