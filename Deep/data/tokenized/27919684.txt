MicroRNA-27a (miR-27a) has been reported to be a brain-specific miRNA and aberrantly expressed in the brain suffered from traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study is designed to investigate the potential role and molecular mechanism of miR-27a in the pathogenesis of TBI. The level of miR-27a in brain was manipulated by intracerebroventricular injection of lentiviral-encoding miR-27a before TBI induction. Real-time PCR was used to detected miR-27a and Forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) levels in the hippocampus. Then, we evaluated the impact of miR-27a overexpression on neurological function, brain edema, lesion volume and neuronal autophagy after TBI. The blinding of miR-27a to the 3'UTR of FoxO3a mRNA and its effects on FoxO3a translation were analyzed by luciferase reporter assay and Western blot. The downregulation of miR-27a and the increase in FoxO3a level were observed in the hippocampus post-TBI. Overexpression of miR-27a significantly attenuated neurological deficits and brain injury, especially suppressed autophagic activation after TBI. Furthermore, we identified that miR-27a directly targeted the FoxO3a 3'UTR region to reduced FoxO3a protein expression. Knockdown of FoxO3a significantly reversed high levels of autophagy-related genes induced by TBI. Taken together, Overexpression of miR-27a may protect against brain injury via suppressing FoxO3a-mediated neuronal autophagy following TBI.
