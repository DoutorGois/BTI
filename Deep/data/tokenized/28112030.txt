Background Small punctuate lesions in the hippocampus on diffusion-weighted images are a typical finding in transient global amnesia. Consequently, it has been suggested that diffusion-weighted images findings might corroborate the diagnosis of transient global amnesia. However, isolated punctuate hippocampal infarction might be a differential diagnosis of transient global amnesia. Aim Evaluation of isolated punctuate hippocampal infarction frequency and comparison of its clinical presentation and MRI findings to transient global amnesia. Methods From an MRI database, we identified 10 patients with isolated punctuate hippocampal infarction and compared these to 12 patients with transient global amnesia with diffusion-weighted images lesion with regard to clinical symptoms and MRI findings. Results Disorientation and memory deficits were more common in transient global amnesia patients, whereas dysphasia/aphasia and vertigo were more common in hippocampal infarction patients. MRI findings in isolated punctuate hippocampal infarction and transient global amnesia did not differ significantly, neither regarding the affected hemisphere, lesion distribution, size, nor relative ADC values. Conclusions Differentiation of isolated punctuate hippocampal infarction and transient global amnesia based on neuroimaging findings is not possible. Thus, in the case of isolated punctuate hippocampal diffusion-weighted images lesions the final diagnosis of hippocampal infarction or transient global amnesia should be based on the clinical presentation.
