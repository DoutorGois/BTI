Distribution of norbin protein in rats was characterized by immunohistochemical study. It was distributed not only in whole brain but also in peripheral nervous system. The protein was localized in the somata, except for nuclei, and dendrites of neurons. Subcellular fractionation revealed that norbin is a cytosolic protein. Prominent distribution was observed in dendrites of dendritic outgrowth in Purkinje cells. Norbin should play a role in somatodendritic functions of neurons.
