Using silver as an impregnating medium and controlling the staining process by physical development, a specific and reliable staining of high contrast can be achieved. These properties represent important prerequisites for automatic and quantitative television image analysis. Specificity depends on appropriate pretreatment. Television image analysis cannot only be used for object analysis, but also to quantify reliability and dependency of contrast on developmental conditions, as demonstrated for stained myelin.
