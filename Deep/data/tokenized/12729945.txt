Prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response is a behavioural tool applied to assess sensorimotor gating processes in humans and rats. Schizophrenic patients show deficits in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. The animal model of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, as purported in earlier reports and the present study, is based on the assumption that damage to brain structures early in life (on day 7) disrupts brain maturation of structures connected to the damaged areas, measurable by behavioural changes, whereas similar damage later in life (on day 21) does not result in these behavioural changes. Locomotor activity, the acoustic startle response and its prepulse inhibition were investigated in adult rats lesioned in the amygdala or ventral hippocampus on day 7 or 21 of life. The acoustic startle response was increased in animals lesioned in the amygdala on day 7 or 21 of life, but not in animals lesioned in the ventral hippocampus. Prepulse inhibition was impaired and locomotor activity enhanced in animals lesioned in the amygdala or ventral hippocampus on day 7, but not in animals lesioned in these structures on day 21 of life. The results on the acoustic startle response are suggestive of amygdaloid influences on modulation of the acoustic startle response. The effects of early postnatal lesions on prepulse inhibition and locomotor activity are in support of the animal model of neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia.
