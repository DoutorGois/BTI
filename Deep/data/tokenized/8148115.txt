In this study we investigated the central effects of adinazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, by means of neurophysiological techniques (electroencephalogram, EEG, and quantified analysis of EEG, QEEG). The drug has been administered at the doses of 0.1-1-10 mg/kg i.v. The evaluation of the data obtained by QEEG has demonstrated that this substance acts on the central nervous system. Particularly we observed that the drug at the middle and high doses caused an increase of the "slow waves sleep" EEG pattern. This preclinical study has shown that adinazolam possesses a neuropharmacological profile similar to that of atypical antidepressive and/or anxiolytic drugs.
