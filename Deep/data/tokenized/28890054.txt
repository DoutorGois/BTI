The brain oscillations may play a critical role in synchronizing neuronal assemblies in order to establish appropriate sensory-motor integration. In fact, studies have demonstrated phase-amplitude coupling of distinct oscillatory rhythms during cognitive processes. Here we investigated whether olfacto-hippocampal coupling occurs when mice are detecting familiar odors located in a spatially restricted area of a new context. The spatial olfactory task (SOT) was designed to expose mice to a new environment in which only one quadrant (target) contains odors provided by its own home-cage bedding. As predicted, mice showed a significant higher exploration preference to the target quadrant; which was impaired by olfactory epithelium lesion (ZnSO4). Furthermore, mice were able to discriminate odors from a different cage and avoided the quadrant with predator odor 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), reinforcing the specificity of the SOT. The local field potential (LFP) analysis of non-lesioned mice revealed higher gamma activity (35-100Hz) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and a significant theta phase/gamma amplitude coupling between MOB and dorsal hippocampus, only during exploration of home-cage odors (i.e. in the target quadrant). Our results suggest that exploration of familiar odors in a new context involves dynamic coupling between the olfactory bulb and dorsal hippocampus.
