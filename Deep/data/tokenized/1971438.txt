Somatostatin (SOM) synthesis and release were studied with radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemical techniques in rat fetal hippocampal neurons maintained in monolayer tissue culture. SOM immunoreactivity increased from undetectable to over 4,000 pg/ml in media and over 2,500 pg/culture in neurons by 3 to 5 weeks. After 3 weeks, approximately 11% of the neurons stained for SOM. Gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) immunoreactivity was present in hippocampal neurons from 1 day to 5 weeks with 40-50% of the neurons staining for GABA by 5 weeks in vitro. Costaining neurons for SOM and GABA revealed that 63% which were positive for SOM also stained for GABA.
