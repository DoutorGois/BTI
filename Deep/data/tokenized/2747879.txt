The aim of our work was to study the involvement, in the process of learning, of synapses between the perforant path and granular cells of the hippocampal dentate fascia for formation of a conditioned reflex (CR) of active avoidance elaborated in response to electrostimulation of the perforant path. To achieve this we used the property of the neurotoxin colchicine at a certain concentration of eliminating selectively the fascia cells. One month after colchicine injection we observed destruction of granular cells, disappearance of the dentate fascia focally evoked potentials, and considerable deterioration in the elaboration of active avoidance CR. Administration of saline solution in control experiments did not bring about such changes. The results obtained show the important role of the entorhinal input into the hippocampus in the learning model used.
