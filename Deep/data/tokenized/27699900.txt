Norepinephrine, is involved in the enhancement of learning and memory formation by regulating synaptic mechanisms through its ability to activate pre- and post-synaptic adrenergic receptors. Here we show that beta-agonists of norepinephrine facilitate the induction of both associational LTP and sharp wave ripples (SPW-Rs) in acute slices of rat hippocampus in area CA3. Surprisingly, this facilitating effect persists when slices are only pretreated with beta-receptor agonists followed by wash out and application of the unspecific beta-adrenoreceptor (betaAR) antagonist propranolol. During application of betaAR agonists repeated stimulation resulted in facilitated induction of SPW-Rs. Since SPW-Rs are thought to be involved in memory replay we studied the effects of betaAR-agonists on spontaneous SPW-Rs in murine hippocampus and found that amplitude and incidence of SPW-Rs increased. These effects involve cyclic-AMP and the activation of protein kinase A and suggest a supportive role in memory consolidation. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
