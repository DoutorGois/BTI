This chapter examines the successes and (at least for now) failures of reductionist approaches in dealing with the problem of learning and memory. Beginning with the work of Pavlov on classical conditioning and the theoretical work of Hebb, the paper traces the contributions made by studies on Aplysia, Drosophila and long-term potentiation in the mammalian hippocampus.
