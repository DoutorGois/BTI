Semaphorins and their receptors plexins are implicated in various processes in the nervous system, but how B-plexins regulate the growth of dendrites remains poorly characterized. We had previously observed that Plexin-B1 and B3 interact with microtubule end-binding proteins (EBs) that are central adapters at growing microtubule tips, and this interaction is involved in neurite growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that plexins regulate microtubule dynamics and through that also dendritogenesis. The role of all three B-plexins was systematically examined in these processes. B-plexins and their ligand Semaphorin-4D influence the dynamics of microtubule tips both EB-dependently and independendently. EB3 as well as Plexin-B1, B2 and B3 turned out to have a significant role in the development of dendritic arbor of rat hippocampal neurons. Our results clearly indicate that semaphorin-plexin-EB pathway is one molecular mechanism how extracellular guidance cues are translated into intracellular mechanics. Taken together, Semaphorin-4D and B-plexins modulate the dynamic behavior of microtubule tips, and are therefore important in neurite growth.
