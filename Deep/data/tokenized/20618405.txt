Most of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the cerebral cortex originate from restricted regions of the ventral telencephalon known as the caudal and medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and from the preoptic area. It is well established that dysfunction of GABAergic interneurons can lead to epilepsy. During the last decade new approaches to prevent, reduce, or reverse the epileptic condition have been studied, including cell-based therapy from different sources. Recent studies have shown that transplanted neuronal precursor cells derived from MGE have the ability to migrate, differentiate into inhibitory GABAergic interneurons, and integrate into cortical and hippocampal networks, modifying the inhibitory tone in the host brain. Therefore, transplantation of neuronal precursors derived from MGE into the postnatal central nervous system (CNS) could modify the neuronal circuitry in neurologic diseases in which inhibitory synaptic function is altered, such as in epilepsy. Here, we evaluated the seizure susceptibility of mice transplanted with MGE-derived cells in the maximum electroconvulsive shock (MES) model and we review some data from different studies using GABAergic precursor or GABA-releasing cell grafts in animal models of seizure and epilepsy.
