Endotoxin tolerance is induced by exposure to a repeated LPS challenge. Stress can exacerbate LPS-induced inflammation in the mouse hippocampus. However, the effects of stress on endotoxin tolerance have not been elucidated. The present experiments were designed to assess whether tolerance could be induced in the hippocampus by intraperitoneal injection of LPS at a dose of 250mug/kg for 7days, to investigate the effects of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) on LPS-induced tolerance, and to assess underlying mechanisms in male Kunming mice. The levels of IL-1beta in the hippocampus increased to a plateau after 4days of LPS injection. When the CUS protocol was performed with concurrent LPS injections for 7days, body weight decreased, and IL-1beta expression in the hippocampus increased simultaneously. The expression of TLR4-MyD88-NF-kappaB signaling molecules and their negative regulators (PI3K, Akt) were also analyzed on day 7 after the last injection. The mRNA expression of TLR4 and MyD88 and the protein levels of TLR4 and NF-kappaBp65 were significantly increased, but the protein levels of PI3K and p-Akt were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of the mice. In conclusion, our findings show that endotoxin tolerance in the hippocampus was induced after four days of peripheral LPS challenge at a dose of 250mug/kg per day, and CUS abrogated this effect. CUS abolished endotoxin tolerance by reducing PI3K-mediated inhibition of TLR4-MyD88-NF-kappaB signaling pathways.
