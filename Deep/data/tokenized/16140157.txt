The spatial orientation of intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) children versus age-matched controls was examined using two spatial tests. The first test was the radial arm maze (RAM), a navigational test frequently used in animal models. The second test was a subtest from the Kaufman assessment battery for children (K-ABC). The IUGR group comprised 28 children aged 6 years. The control group comprised 29 appropriate-for-gestational age children. The performance of the IUGR children was significantly inferior to controls in both tests. In the RAM test, the ratio between the correct entrances to the total entrances was significantly lower in the IUGR group than in the control group (P<0.001). In the K-ABC, the IUGR group could not perform as well as control children (P<0.001). These results suggest that spatial orientation in IUGR children is inferior to their age-matched controls, possibly contributing to their potential learning difficulties. The present results also suggest that the RAM can be potentially used to test spatial orientation of children at-risk.
