The Drosophila neurodegeneration gene swiss-cheese encodes a neuronal protein apparently involved in glia-neuron interaction and is homologous to human NTE, the molecular target of organophosphate-induced neuropathy. The isolated Msws/NTE gene is 96% identical to NTE. During development the Msws transcript is expressed in the embryonic respiratory system, different epithelial structures and strongly in the spinal ganglia. Postnatally, Msws mRNA is expressed in all brain areas, with an increasingly restrictive pattern. In adult mice expression is most prominent in Purkinje cells, granule cells and pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and some large neurons in the medulla oblongata, nucleus dentatus and pons.
