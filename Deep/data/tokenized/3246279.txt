In the presence of corticosterone, noradrenaline exerted a more obvious effect both on phasic and tonic components of portal vein constriction in hypertensive rats than in normotensive ones. The potentiation sharply increased the sensitivity of vessels to the transmitter. Stress induced a higher increase in corticosterone and BP in hypertensive rats as compared with normotensive ones. The some was true for sympatho-adrenal system of the animals. The receptor binding of corticosterone increased in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum in hypertensive rats. The data obtained are discussed from the standpoint of the participation of adrenal hormones in development of the hypertension.
