Degeneration of myelinated axonal connections is generally held to provide a strong stimulus for microglial expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen. The present study demonstrates that strong microglial reactions also are induced by axonal and terminal degeneration of the unmyelinated hippocampal mossy fibres. After destruction of dentate granule cells by focal injections of colchicine (or transection of the mossy fibres) in adult rats, immunocytochemical analysis of the mossy fibre terminal fields in the dentate hilus and regio inferior of hippocampus proper (CA3) revealed profound changes in microglial cells with increased expression of the complement receptor type 3 and induction of MHC class I antigen, leukocyte common antigen, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 and MHC class II antigen. The microglial reaction, first detectable 4 days after the lesion, became maximal during the third postlesional week, and had almost vanished 6 weeks after the lesion. From recent studies we know that anterograde degeneration of myelinated Schaffer-collaterals from CA3 to regio superior of hippocampus proper and myelinated entorhinal perforant path fibres to fascia dentata is accompanied by microglial expression of MHC class I antigen, but not class II. Together with the present findings, this demonstrates that myelin debris is neither necessary nor sufficient to induce expression of microglial MHC class II antigen within the hippocampus.
