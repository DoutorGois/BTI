In CA1 area and the hilus of the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus, drastic reduction of NeuN, calbindin, calretinin, or parvalbumin immunopositive neurons was shown at 3, 7 and 60 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. In gliotic CA1 area at 60 days, few dendritic branches of calcium binding protein immunopositive neurons could be found suggesting reorganization of the afferents of surviving calcium binding protein immunopositive neurons. Calbindin, calretinin, or parvalbumin and 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) double labeling showed that calcium binding protein immunopositive neurons in gliotic CA1 area at 60 days were surviving instead of newly generated neurons. Iontophoretic injection of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the medial septum and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca or the lateral entorhinal cortex showed contacts between Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin immunopositive en passant and terminal boutons and surviving calcium binding protein immunopositive neurons in the hippocampus. The presence in the gliotic hippocampus of enlarged and/or aggregated bouton-like structures 60 days after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus is indicative for the reorganization of connections between the hippocampal afferents and surviving hippocampal neurons. This reconstruction could be a factor in the ongoing epileptic activity in this model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.
