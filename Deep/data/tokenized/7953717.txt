A neuronal cell line, HT-22, is sensitive to glutamate cytotoxicity via a non-receptor mediated oxidative pathway. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, blocks this glutamate-induced cell death. Down-regulation of protein kinase C eliminates the protection against glutamate cytotoxicity afforded by TPA. The data suggest that protein kinase C activation blocks an early step in the cytotoxic pathway.
