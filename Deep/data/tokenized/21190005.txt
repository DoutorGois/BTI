Stress has long been known to be a causative factor of various disease states. In this study, we investigated the effects of repeated restraint stress on platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), a very important mediator in inflammation, immunoreactivity and protein levels as well as neuronal damage, in the gerbil hippocampus after 5 minutes of transient cerebral ischemia. Transient ischemia-induced neuronal death was shown in CA1 pyramidal cells 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. However, repeated restraint stress protected neuronal death induced by ischemic damage. In the ischemia-group, PECAM-1 immunoreactivity and its protein levels were significantly increased in all the hippocampal subregions 4 days after ischemia/reperfusion. However, PECAM-1 immunoreactivity and its protein levels did not change significantly in the hippocampus of the stress-ischemia-group compared to the sham-groups. These results indicate that repeated restraint stress protects neuronal damage induced by transient cerebral ischemia, and this may be associated with maintenance of PECAM-1levels.
