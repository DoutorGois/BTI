Cholinergic and GABAergic innervation of the hippocampus plays an important role in human memory function and rat spatial navigation. Drugs which block acetylcholine receptors or enhance GABA receptor activation cause striking impairments in the encoding of new information. Lesions of the cholinergic innervation of the hippocampus reduce the amplitude of hippocampal theta rhythm and cause impairments in spatial navigation tasks, including the Morris water maze, eight-arm radial maze, spatial reversal and delayed alternation. Here, we review previous work on the role of cholinergic modulation in memory function, and we present a new model of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex describing the interaction of these regions for goal-directed spatial navigation in behavioral tasks. These mechanisms require separate functional phases for: (1) encoding of pathways without interference from retrieval, and (2) retrieval of pathways for guiding selection of the next movement. We present analysis exploring how phasic changes in physiological variables during hippocampal theta rhythm could provide these different phases and enhance spatial navigation function.
