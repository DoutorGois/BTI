(S)-N-[1-(4-Cyclopropylmethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[1,4]oxazin-6-yl)-ethyl]-3-(2-f luoro-phenyl)-acrylamide ((S)-2) was identified as a potent and efficacious KCNQ2 opener. This compound demonstrated significant activity in reducing neuronal hyperexcitability in rat hippocampal slices, and the inhibition mediated by (S)-2 was reversed by the KCNQ blocker linopirdine.
