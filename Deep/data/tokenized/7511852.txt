The dynamics of presynaptic transmitter release are often matched to the physiological properties and functions of the postsynaptic cell. In organisms ranging from cats to crickets, evidence suggests that retrograde signaling is essential for matching these presynaptic release properties to individual postsynaptic partners. Retrograde interactions appear to control the development of presynaptic, short-term facilitation and homosynaptic depression through local, retrograde signaling at the synapse.
