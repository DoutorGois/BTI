The effects of arachidonic acid and its lipoxygenase metabolites, the hepoxilins, were investigated in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons in vitro by intracellular electrophysiological recordings. Both arachidonic acid and the hepoxilins cause a hyperpolarization which is sometimes followed by a later depolarization, augment the postspike train long-lasting afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and increase orthodromic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). These data show that this arachidonic acid metabolic pathway has significant actions on mammalian central neurons, and may represent an important mechanism of neuromodulation.
