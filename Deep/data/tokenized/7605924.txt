The neuroprotective effect of nerve growth factor (NGF) on the pyramidal cells in the vulnerable CA1-CA2 sectors of the hippocampus was investigated in a rat model of transient forebrain ischemia. A genetically modified fibroblast line that secretes high levels of NGF was implanted 7 days before induction of ischemia between the hippocampal CA1-CA2 subfields in the right hemisphere. Rats were then subjected to 10 min of cerebral ischemia in a four vessel occlusion model. Morphological changes in the CA1 and CA2 subfields were evaluated 7 days after ischemia. Animals in the NGF-protected group had significantly higher numbers of normal appearing neurons in the right CA1 and CA2 regions, compared with their non-implanted left hemispheres, to non-implanted animals or to animals implanted with non-modified cells. The data confirmed that NGF can protect CA1-CA2 hippocampal neurons from ischemic damage by implantation of genetically engineered cells producing NGF.
