The Naples high-excitability (NHE) rats are thought to model the mesocortical variant of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The aim of this study was to investigate forebrain level of L-glutamate, L-aspartate and D-aspartate, in NHE vs. Naples random bred (NRB) control rats. Thus, prepuberal NHE and NRB rats were daily handled in the 5th and 6th week of postnatal life. Then rats were exposed to two spatial novelties i.e. a Lat and a Olton maze for 10 min. Amino acids were detected by HPLC in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum (STR), hippocampus (HPC) and hypothalamus (HYP). Results indicate that all amino acids were higher in NHE than in NRB rats. This, in turn, may explain the behavioural hyperactivity and attention deficit of this animal model of ADHD.
