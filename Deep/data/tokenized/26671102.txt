Glutaric aciduria type I (GA I) is biochemically characterized by accumulation of glutaric and 3-hydroxyglutaric acids in body fluids and tissues, particularly in the brain. Affected patients show progressive cortical leukoencephalopathy and chronic degeneration of the basal ganglia whose pathogenesis is still unclear. In the present work we investigated parameters of bioenergetics and redox homeostasis in various cerebral structures (cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus) and heart of adult wild type (Gcdh(+/+)) and glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficient knockout (Gcdh(-/-)) mice fed a baseline chow. Oxidative stress parameters were also measured after acute lysine overload. Finally, mRNA expression of NMDA subunits and GLT1 transporter was determined in cerebral cortex and striatum of these animals fed a baseline or high lysine (4.7%) chow. No significant alterations of bioenergetics or redox status were observed in these mice. In contrast, mRNA expression of the NR2B glutamate receptor subunit and of the GLT1 glutamate transporter was higher in cerebral cortex of Gcdh(-/-) mice. Furthermore, NR2B expression was markedly elevated in striatum of Gcdh(-/-) animals receiving chronic Lys overload. These data indicate higher susceptibility of Gcdh(-/-) mice to excitotoxic damage, implying that this pathomechanism may contribute to the cortical and striatum alterations observed in GA I patients.
