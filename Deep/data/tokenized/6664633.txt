Choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in the hippocampus originates almost exclusively in axons from neurons located in the medial septum. In the rat, the development of CAT in the hippocampus takes place during the first 3 weeks after birth. The development of CAT was studied in organotypic cultures of fetal rat septum and early postnatal rat hippocampus. In some septal explants, enzyme activity increased up to 10-fold during the first 3-4 weeks in vitro. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry showed the presence of AChE-positive cells and fibers in many explants. Thus it appears that septal cholinergic neurons develop CAT and AChE activity even without making contact with their target cells. However, the development of CAT was accelerated by the presence of hippocampal tissue. No CAT activity was found in the hippocampal cultures, confirming that there are few, if any, intrinsic cholinergic cell bodies in the hippocampus.
