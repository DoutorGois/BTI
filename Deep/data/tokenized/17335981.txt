Adenylyl cyclases (ACs) convert ATP to cAMP and therefore, subserve multiple regulatory functions in the nervous system. AC1 and AC8 are the only cyclases stimulated by calcium and calmodulin, making them uniquely poised to regulate neuronal development and neuronal processes such as learning and memory. Here, we detail the production and application of a novel antibody against mouse AC1. Along with AC8 immunohistochemistry, these data reveal distinct and partially overlapping patterns of protein expression in brain during murine development and adulthood. AC1 protein increased in abundance in the neonatal hippocampus from postnatal days 7-14. By adulthood, abundant AC1 protein expression was observed in the mossy fiber tract in the hippocampus and the molecular layer in the cerebellum, with diffuse expression in the cortex and thalamus. AC8 protein levels were abundant during development, with diffuse and increasing expression in the hippocampus that intensified in the CA1/CA2 region by adulthood. AC8 expression was weak in the cerebellum at postnatal day 7 and decreased further by postnatal day 14. Analysis of synaptosome fractions from the adult brain demonstrated robust expression of AC1 in the postsynaptic density and extrasynaptic regions, while expression of AC8 was observed in the presynaptic active zone and extrasynaptic fractions. These findings were confirmed with localization of AC1 and/or AC8 with PSD-95, tau, synaptophysin and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) expression throughout the brain. Together, these data provide insight into the functional roles of AC1 and AC8 in mice as reflected by their distinct localization in cellular and subcellular compartments.
