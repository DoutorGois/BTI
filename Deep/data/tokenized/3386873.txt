Simultaneous measurements of cellular responses and extracellular field potentials as well as extracellular Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]0) were performed in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer during paired pulse stimulation of the lateral perforant path at resting [Ca2+]o and during washout of calcium. At resting [Ca2+]o the second response to a paired stimulus was smaller than the first response. This frequency habituation reversed into frequency potentiation (second response larger than the first one) during lowering of [Ca2+]o at about the same time when a late presumed inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) was abolished. This suggests that a slow inhibition can account for part of frequency habituation in the dentate gyrus.
