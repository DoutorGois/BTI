Both amplitude and phase of rhythmic slow-wave electroencephalographic activity are physiological correlates of learning and memory in rodents. In humans, oscillatory amplitude has been shown to correlate with memory; however, the role of oscillatory phase in human memory is unknown. We recorded intracranial electroencephalogram from human cortical and hippocampal areas while subjects performed a short-term recognition memory task. On each trial, a series of four list items was presented followed by a memory probe. We found agreement across trials of the phase of oscillations in the 7- to 16-Hz range after randomly timed stimulus events, evidence that these events either caused a phase shift in the underlying oscillation or initiated a new oscillation. Phase locking in this frequency range was not generally associated with increased poststimulus power, suggesting that stimulus events reset the phase of ongoing oscillations. Different stimulus classes selectively modulated this phase reset effect, with topographically distinct sets of recording sites exhibiting preferential reset to either probe items or to list items. These findings implicate the reset of brain oscillations in human working memory.
