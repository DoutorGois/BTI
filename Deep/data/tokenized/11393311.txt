A study was conducted to analyze the regional distribution of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, and Zn contents in brain tissues after animals were given liquor of brick tea that contained a high Al content. In 25 normal adult male mice given either water or 0.9% NaCl for 1 mo or 2 mo, the metal concentrations in the serum, liver, frontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brain stem were comparable (p > 0.05). When the drinking water was replaced by a 1% brick tea liquor, which contained a high Al content, serum Al concentration was increased significantly 1 mo after the onset of the experiment and remained high at the end of the second month. The level of Al was also elevated in both the cortex and hippocampus at 1 mo after replacing tea for drinking water. In addition to Al, there were a significant increase in hippocampal Zn and a decrease in Cu contents. There was no change in tissue Mg or Fe contents, but there was a significant increase in Ca content in every brain region studied. It was suggested that the increase in Ca might be the result of the effect of other components in tea. Unlike the brain, there was no change in the concentration of any of the metals, including Al, in the liver, which further demonstrated that the changes observed in the brain was specific. The results of the present study confirmed that Al, when given orally in the form of tea, could be absorbed into the bloodstream. The absorbed Al could accumulate in selected brain regions. The presence of Al might also change the tissue content of endogenous trace metals.
