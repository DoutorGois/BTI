The purpose of this study is to test the sensitivity of the volumetric analysis compared to the visual analysis of the hippocampal formations of a group of 153 patients with clinical diagnosis of temporal lobe epilepsy and candidates to temporal lobectomy, evaluated by magnetic resonance (MR), using a 0.5 Tesla machine and inversion-recovery T1-weighted images and 5 mm coronal slices. There was agreement between the prospective visual analysis and another retrospective visual analysis carried out by two independent observers (C = 0.748 and C = 0.720). There was also agreement between the retrospective analysis of the two investigators (C = 0.733). There was genuine agreement (C = 0.788) between the results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses carried out prospectively. Volume measurements showed a nonsignificant tendency to lateralize more cases of clinically presumed hippocampal atrophy. Our results confirm the reliability of a qualitative visual analysis and indicate the utility of hippocampal volumetry as a supplementary, objective and quantitative measure of hippocampal sclerosis.
