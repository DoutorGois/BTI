Neuron regeneration peptides (NRPs) are small synthetic peptides that stimulate neural proliferation, migration, and differentiation with no apparent toxicity and high target specificity in CNS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of NRP2945 on seizure activity induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in rats. Using behavioural assessment and electrocorticographical recordings, the effects of different doses of NRP2945 (5-20 microg/kg) were tested on seizure attacks induced by PTZ injection. In addition, the effect of NRP2945 was evaluated on the production of dark neurons and expression of GABAA receptor alpha and beta subunits and GAD-65 in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex of the rat brain. Intraperitoneal injection of NRP2945 at 20 microg/kg prevented seizure attacks after PTZ injection. NRP2945 at doses of 5 and 10 microg/kg significantly decreased the total duration of seizure attacks and reduced the amplitude, duration and latency of epileptiform burst discharges induced by PTZ. In addition, the peptide significantly inhibited the production of dark neurons in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex of epileptic rats. NRP2945 also significantly increased the expression of GABAA receptor alpha and beta subunits and GAD-65 in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex compared with PTZ treated rats. This study indicates that NRP2945 is able to prevent the seizure attacks and neuronal injuries induced by PTZ, likely by stimulating GABAA and GAD-65 protein expression and/or protecting these components of GABAergic signalling from PTZ-induced alteration. Further studies are needed to elucidate the potential role of NRP2945 as an antiepileptic drug.
