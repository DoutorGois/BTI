Since its first discovery in 1998, it has become clear that the orexinergic system plays an important role in regulating a number of functions including food, sex, social connections, and most prominently reward-related behaviors. Orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus project extensively to other brain areas, two most important of which are the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens that are involved in reward processing. In this review, we have presented the work in our laboratory along with the work of others and have discussed the possible functions we can infer from the research. We discuss the anatomy of the orexinergic system and its components followed by a presentation of other connected brain areas. The second part of this review discusses observed results from the morphine conditioned place preference test that sheds light on the possible role of the involved areas in reward processing. The complex circuits involved in reward processing are only beginning to be understood and we need to deepen our understanding regarding the nature of the interactions between all brain areas involved.
