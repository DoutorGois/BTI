Neonatal handling has been shown to induce a short-term reduction in the binding properties of beta-adrenoceptors and in their primary biochemical responses in the young rat brain, which may account for the reduced responsiveness to stress observed in the handled rats. We have studied the persistence and duration of these changes in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus at successive stages of life in neonatally handled rats. Binding properties of the beta-adrenoceptors in handled animals were essentially similar to those of the control rats from 3 to 24 months of age. However, handling disturbed the efficacy of the beta-adrenoceptor intracellular signalling since the isoprenaline-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP was reduced in cerebral cortex at 1, 12 and 24 months; in cerebellum at 12 and 18 months; and in hippocampus at 3 and 12 months. This effect might be partially dependent on a regulatory action of handling on the adenylyl cyclase enzyme itself since both basal and forskolin-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP were persistently reduced. Therefore, postnatal handling can be considered as an effective intervention that modifies sensitivity to various hormonal and neurochemical signals; these changes may be involved over a long period of time in protection against an excessive response to stress. These results suggest that the long-lasting adaptation of the adenylyl cyclase transduction system, which affects the primary biochemical response of the beta-adrenoceptor, may participate in the effects of this manipulation.
