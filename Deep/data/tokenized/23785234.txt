OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and the neuronal nitric oxide synthase enzyme in dysregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme, and hence serotonin availability in chronic mild stress (CMS), an animal model of depression. METHODS: RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE GROUPS: two control and CMS-exposed for 6 weeks, and another three groups exposed to CMS and administered pentoxifylline 50 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally, 7-nitroindazole 40 mg/kg/day subcutaneously, or imipramine 20 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally for the previous 3 CMS weeks. Rats were assessed for neurochemical and immunohistochemical abnormalities. RESULTS: Pentoxifylline-, 7-nitroindazole-, and imipramine-treated rats showed amelioration of CMS-induced behavioral deficits that was accompanied by significant reduction in kynurenine/serotonin molar ratio and nitrates/nitrites in frontal cortex and hippocampus. In the pentoxifylline and 7-nitroindazole groups, serum TNF-alpha was reduced relative to the CMS group (18.54 +/- 0.85 and 19.16 +/- 1.54 vs 26.20 +/- 1.83 pg/mL, respectively; P < 0.05). Exposure to CMS increased TNF-alpha and IDO immunohistochemical staining scores in both hippocampus and midbrain raphe nuclei. 7-Nitroindazole and pentoxifylline significantly (P < 0.05) reduced TNF-alpha immunostaining in hippocampus and raphe nuclei, with significant (P < 0.01) reduction of IDO immunostaining in raphe nuclei. Likewise, imipramine reduced TNF-alpha immunostaining (P < 0.05) in hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Neuronal nitric oxide synthase and TNF-alpha may play a concerted role in modulating IDO enzyme activity in CMS-exposed rats and provide additional evidence for possible alternative approaches to switch the neurobiological processes in depression.
