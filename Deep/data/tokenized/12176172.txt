Glucocorticoid receptor activation inhibits granule cell proliferation in the hippocampus, but little is known about the role of mineralocorticoid receptors in this process. Here we administered aldosterone to adrenalectomized (ADX) rats, and monitored neurogenesis by BrdU immunohistochemistry. ADX significantly increased the number of BrdU-positive cells and aldosterone replacement further augmented BrdU-positivity. Our results indicate that aldosterone, most probably acting through mineralocorticoid receptors, may positively influence the proliferation and survival of newly-generated granule cells.
