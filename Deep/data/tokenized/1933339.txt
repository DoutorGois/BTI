The effect of central serotonergic stimulation on hippocampal and neocortical electrical activity and behavior was studied in freely moving rats by administering: (a) tranylcypromine followed by tryptophan, (b) fluoxetine followed by 5-hydroxytryptophan, or (c) p-chloroamphetamine alone. In all rats, scopolamine-resistant hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA), thought to be dependent on brain serotonin, maintained its normal relation to behavior, occurring in close correlation with Type 1 behaviors (postural changes, turning of the head, walking). This RSA was generally absent during stereotyped behavior (head weaving, forepaw treading, hindlimb splaying and tremor). Scopolamine-resistant neocortical low-voltage fast activity (LVFA), also though to be dependent on brain serotonin, was present during Type 1 behaviors and also during stereotyped behavior. Most rats that developed a full stereotyped behavior syndrome had behavioral and electrocortical seizures which were associated with a reduction in the amplitude of hippocampal activity. These seizures were suppressed by methysergide or benserazide. Metergoline (and methysergide to a lesser extent) suppressed the stereotypic behaviors of the serotonin syndrome, resulting in a striking increase in the locomotion caused by central serotonergic stimulation. Such locomotion was accompanied by RSA and LVFA. It was concluded that increased serotonergic activity in the CNS causes an increase in motor activity and a correlated increase in scopolamine-resistant hippocampal RSA and scopolamine-resistant neocortical LVFA and suggested that metergoline blocks serotonin receptors mediating stereotyped behaviors, thereby permitting the expression of serotonin-mediated locomotion.
