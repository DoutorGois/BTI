There has been growing interest in the differential role of medial temporal lobe structures in learning and memory. The goal of the present study was to clarify how lesions of hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala interfere with associative learning and memory. Thirty subjects with pharmacoresistant medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and temporal lobe removal were compared with 30 matched healthy control subjects. A set of neuropsychological test measures and an associative learning task requiring the learning and recall of objects and faces were administered. The lesions of hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, and fusiform gyrus of TLE subjects were determined by three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3-D MRI) volumetric assessment. The results indicate that TLE subjects with combined large hippocampal lesions, large parahippocampal gyrus (i.e., perirhinal/entorhinal) lesions, and large amygdala lesions learned and recalled the associative task significantly worse than control subjects or subjects with small lesions of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala. Regression analysis revealed that larger lesions of the parahippocampal gyrus (i.e., perirhinal/entorhinal cortices) were significantly related to increasing deficits on the task, and that hippocampal and amygdala lesion size did not significantly improve the prediction. Our results suggest that perirhinal and entorhinal cortices may contribute predominantly to the associative learning and recall of objects and faces.
