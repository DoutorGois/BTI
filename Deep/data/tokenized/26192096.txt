Sulfuretin, one of the major flavonoid glycosides found in the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin and heartwood of Rhus verniciflua, is a known anti-oxidant. We previously demonstrated that sulfuretin inhibits neuronal death via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanisms in human SH-SY5Y cells, although other relevant mechanisms of action of this compound remain largely uncharacterized. As part of our ongoing exploration of the pharmacological actions of sulfuretin, we studied the neuroprotective effects of sulfuretin against amyloid beta (Abeta)-induced neurotoxicity in human SH-SY5Y and primary hippocampal neuron cells and investigated the possible mechanisms involved. Specifically, we found in the present study that sulfuretin significantly attenuates the decrease in cell viability, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and accumulation of ROS associated with Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells. Furthermore, sulfuretin stimulated the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt. We demonstrated that sulfuretin induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an anti-oxidant response gene. Notably, we found that the neuroprotective effects of sulfuretin were diminished by an Nrf2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), as well as the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Taken together, these results indicated that sulfuretin protects neuronal cells from Abeta25-35-induced neurotoxicity through activation of Nrf/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Our results also indicate that sulfuretin-induced induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has preventive and/or therapeutic potential for the management of Alzheimer's disease.
