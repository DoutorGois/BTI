The immunohistochemical occurrence and localisation of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-4, and neurotrophin-3 is described in the human post-mortem hippocampal formation from subjects aged 23 weeks of gestation to 68 years. Labeled neuronal cell bodies and processes were detectable for each neurotrophin at all examined ages with age-related changes in their distribution pattern. As a general rule, a higher number of immunoreactive perikarya was found in subjects at pre- and perinatal ages than in adults. At variance with the other neurotrophins, the BDNF antiserum labelled also extensive nerve fibre systems, whose occurrence and distribution widened with age. The results obtained provide a morphological ground in support to the concept that the neurotrophins play a functional role in the human hippocampal circuitry throughout life.
