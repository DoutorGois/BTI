In adult rat hippocampal slices, (2S,1'R,2'R,3'R)-2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) did not affect the basal hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides but dramatically enhanced (EC50 value = 30 nM) the stimulation of [3H]inositol monophosphate (InsP) formation by quisqualate, without substantially affecting the stimulation produced by maximal concentrations of 1S,3R-amino-cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) or carbamylcholine. alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) was virtually devoid of activity on [3H]InsP formation, either in the absence or presence of DCG-IV. These results suggest that DCG-IV acts, directly or indirectly, as a positive modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the rat hippocampus.
