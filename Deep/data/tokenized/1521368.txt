1. The rat hippocampus 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-HSD) displays a different substrate specificity to that of other tissues. S1 nuclease analysis was used to determine whether the hippocampal messenger RNA is different from that found in other tissues. 2. S1 nuclease analysis using probes spanning the full length cDNA demonstrated that there were no differences in sequence between the hippocampal 11-HSD and the enzyme originally cloned from the liver. 3. These results suggest that there may be multiple 11-HSD isoforms in the hippocampus with different substrate specificities.
