Chronic administration of ethanol in animals leads to CNS tolerance and physical dependence. Subsequent withdrawal of ethanol causes hyperexcitability which is thought to be related to increased sensitivity of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate sensitivity to NMDA in ethanol-treated animals by detecting damage after intrahippocampal injection of NMDA. Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) specific activity was used as markers of cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons, respectively. Ethanol-dependent animals were more liable to die following intrahippocampal injection of either 120 or 240 nmol of NMDA. There was a significantly greater decrease in hippocampal GAD but not ChAT specific activity in the surviving animals. These data support the hypothesis that ethanol dependence is associated with increased sensitivity to NMDA which may be responsible for excitotoxic brain damage and death.
