The aim of the present work was to study human neural stem/progenitor cells (SPC) cultured in vitro and their potential to survive, migrate, and differentiate after transplantation into adult rat brain. SPC were extracted from the brains of nine-week human embryos and were cultured in selective medium for three weeks. Transplantation was with suspensions of cells or whole neurospheres; these were studied four weeks after transplantation into the hippocampus, striatum, and lateral ventricles of adult rats. Analysis of transplanted cells was based on various histological and immunohistological staining methods: bisbenzimide, bromodeoxyuridine, and antibodies to human nuclei, vimentin, beta-tubulin, neurofilaments, and glial fibrillar acidic protein, which allowed us to make independent assessments of their state and differentiation. Transplanted SPC from human brains survived well for one month in all areas of adult rat brain without immunosuppression. Cells from suspension transplants migrated intensely and differentiated into neurons and gliocytes. At the same time, transplants of whole neurospheres showed limited or no migration because of the development of a glial barrier.
