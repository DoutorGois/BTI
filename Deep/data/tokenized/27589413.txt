Epilepsy is a disorder that affects 1-2% of the population and a significant percentage of these patients do not respond to anticonvulsant drugs available in the market suggesting the need to investigate new pharmacological treatments. Several studies have shown that inflammation occurs during epileptogenesis and may contribute to the development and progression of epilepsy, demonstrating increased levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins in animal models and human patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory diclofenac sodium on the severity of seizures and levels of pro-inflammatory interleukins in animals with kindling model induced by PTZ. The kindling model was induced by injections of subconvulsant doses of PTZ (20mg/kg) in alternated days for 15days of treatment. The animals were divided into four groups: control group given saline, group treated with diazepam (2mg/kg) and groups treated with diclofenac sodium (5 and 10mg/kg). After treatment the open field tests was conducted. The severity of seizures was evaluated by the Racine scale. We evaluated the levels of IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the blood, hippocampus and cortex of animals. The treatment with diclofenac sodium, in the PTZ induced kindling model, decreased severity of seizures and interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus of animals treated with doses of 5 and 10mg/kg. New studies are needed to investigate a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of epilepsy with this anti-inflammatory non-steroidal drug.
