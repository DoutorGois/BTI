The metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) is involved in several forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. DHPG application can induce slow-onset potentiation, a form of long-term potentiation (LTP), in the dentate gyrus and in the CA1 region in vivo. The induction of LTP correlates with increased expression levels of neuronal calcium sensor (NCS), considered as key elements for plasticity. In this study we investigated mGluR- and time-dependent changes in the expression of two different NCS proteins. Following DHPG application in vivo NCS-1 and VILIP-1 expression increased, with significant levels reached after 8 and 24h. The effect was attenuated by treatment with the group I mGluR specific antagonist S-4-carboxyphenylglycine. The immediate early gene (IEG) arg3.1/arc showed highest expression levels 2h after DHPG-treatment. Therefore, mGluRs at concentrations which induce synaptic plasticity regulate the expression of IEGs and NCS proteins in different time frames and thus contribute to late phases of synaptic plasticity.
