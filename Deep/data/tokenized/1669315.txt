Intragranular and supragranular mossy fibers arise from granule cells and are present in the dentate gyrus of hippocampi from kindled and epileptic animals. The intragranular fibers often appear as fibers perpendicular to the long axis of the granule cell layer at periodic intervals. Rats and gerbils were analyzed to determine whether such mossy fibers are also associated with nongranule cells (including the basket cells), which send their apical dendrites through this layer with a periodicity similar to that of mossy fibers. The results for rats and both epileptic and nonepileptic gerbils show that many intragranular mossy fibers are apposed to the surfaces of the somata and apical dendrites of basket cells where they form asymmetric synapses. This plexus of mossy fiber axons appears to follow the dendrites of these neurons into the inner molecular layer. Based on previous data indicating that basket cells are GABAergic inhibitory neurons, the present findings in normal rats and both types of gerbils suggest that intragranular and supragranular mossy fibers provide additional circuitry for feedback inhibition to granule cells. It is possible that under pathological conditions, such as denervation or kindling, these fibers sprout and form synapses with granule cells.
