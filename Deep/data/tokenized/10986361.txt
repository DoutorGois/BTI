Learning and memory are often correlated with cellular changes within the hippocampus, and drugs or environmental factors which affect learning and memory will thus often induce observable morphological changes in this structure. Like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) itself, many synthetic cannabinoids such as the CB-1 receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 will induce learning and memory changes. In the current study, we investigate whether or not these changes could be related to structural changes within the hippocampus. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected twice daily (12:00 and 0:00 h) subcutaneously with WIN 55,212-2 (2.0 mg/kg) in DMSO or DMSO for 21 days. On day 22, animals were perfused and stained immunochemically for the dendritic marker MAP-2, or with cresyl violet. Morphometric analysis showed dendritic rearrangement with increased staining of MAP-2 in CA3 and the lower blade of the dentate gyrus. However, a loss of staining was observed in CA1. Counting of cresyl violet stained sections showed an apparent increase in granule cell number in the lower blade of the dentate gyrus. This work shows the potential for cannabinoids to influence hippocampal morphology. The pattern of changes may be similar to that seen after ischemic or toxic damage, but may be opposite to changes seen in stress.
