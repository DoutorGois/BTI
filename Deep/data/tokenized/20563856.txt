To investigate the effects of sevoflurane on cognitive function in old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in CA1 region of hippocampus. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats of 12 months old were randomly divided into five groups: the normal control group; 1.5% sevoflurane I group (be tested after received 1.5% sevoflurane for 1 day); 1.5% sevoflurane II group (be tested after received 1.5% sevoflurane for 7 day); 3.0% sevoflurane I group (be tested after received 3.0% sevoflurane for 1 day) and 3.0% sevoflurane II group (be tested after received 3.0% sevoflurane for 7 day). All SD rats were received 1.5 or 3.0% sevoflurane in a special glass anesthesia box for 2 h respectively, except for the normal control group. Y-maze was used to test the ability of learning and memory after being received sevoflurane for 1 or 7 days at the same moment portion. The altered expression level of IGF-1 in the hippocampus was tested to compare its transcripts by RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that 3% sevoflurane induced the decline of cognitive function and significantly deceased the IGF-1 expression at mRNA levels at 1 day in the 3.0% sevoflurane I group when compared with the normal control group. However, there were no significant difference among the other groups when compared with normal control group. Therefore, administration of sevoflurane might temporally affect the ability of cognitive function of rats through suppressing the IGF-1 expression at mRNA levels in hippocampus.
