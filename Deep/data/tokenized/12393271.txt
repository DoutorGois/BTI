As rats age, a subgroup will show spatial memory impairments, along with decreased corticosteroid receptors (MR and/or GR) in the hippocampus and a hyperactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In previous work, we have shown that amitriptyline treatment increases hippocampal MR mRNA and improves spatial memory in young rats but had no effect in aged rats. Here, we examine the effect of 1-month treatment with the selective 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) on hippocampal corticosteroid receptor mRNA and spatial memory in young 4-month-old and aged 24-month-old rats. Aged rats were impaired in spatial memory compared to young controls. MR mRNA expression was reduced with ageing in all hippocampal subfields except CA4 (35% decrease in dentate gyrus (DG) and CA2, P<0.05) and GR mRNA was decreased selectively in CA1 (17% decrease, P<0.05). Fluoxetine treatment increased GR mRNA in the hippocampus of young rats (24 and 46% increase in DG and CA3, respectively, P<0.01) but had no effect on hippocampal MR mRNA expression. In contrast, in aged rats, fluoxetine treatment increased hippocampal MR mRNA selectively in CA2 (43% increase, P<0.05), but had no effect on hippocampal GR mRNA. Fluoxetine treatment did not alter watermaze performance in either young or aged rats. It appears that increased hippocampal MR (at least in the CA2 region) which may underlie the enhancement in memory processing in young rats, is insufficient to improve memory in already cognitively impaired aged rats.
