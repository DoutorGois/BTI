The study was undertaken to examine the effect of nimodipine, calcium channels blocker, on the morphological alterations induced by quinolinic acid (QUIN). The experiment was performed on 21-day-old organotypic rat hippocampal cultures. Nimodipine was applied to the nutrient medium simultaneously with QUIN (both at 100 microM). Ultrastructural changes were evaluated 24 h, 5 and 7 days after the exposure to tested agent. It was shown that nimodipine induced distinct cytoprotective effect, especially considering the development of late neurotoxic injury produced by QUIN. However, the protection was not complete, indicating the participation of the other factors in the pathomechanism underlying structural damage produced by QUIN.
