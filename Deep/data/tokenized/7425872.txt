The luminescent characteristics of lipofuscin granules in the human brain, heart, adrenal glands, and liver have been investigated. Lipofuscin luminescent spectra in all the tissues studied were shown to be of the same type and to contain two emission bands with maxima in the yellow (550--560 nm) and red (680--690 nm) regions of the spectrum. The relative variability in the intensity of these bands determines the changes in colour from yellow to red-brown in lipofuscin luminescence observed visually. The two main emission bands in luminescent spectra indicate the presence of two main luminescent chemical compounds in lipofuscin.
