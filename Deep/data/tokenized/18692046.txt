Old age is associated with enhanced susceptibility to and poor recovery from brain injury. An exacerbated microglial and astrocyte response to brain injury might be involved in poor outcomes observed in the elderly. The present study was therefore designed to quantitate the expression of markers of microglia and astrocyte activation using real-time RT-PCR, immunoblot and immunohistochemical analysis in aging brain in response to brain injury. We examined the hippocampus, a region that undergoes secondary neuron death, in aged (21-24 months) and adult (5-6 months) mice following controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury to the sensorimotor cortex. Basal mRNA expression of CD11b and Iba1, markers of activated microglia, was higher in aged hippocampus as compared to the adult. The mRNA expression of microglial markers increased and reached maximum 3 days post-injury in both adult and aged mice, but was higher in the aged mice at all time points studied, and in the aged mice the return to baseline levels was delayed. Basal mRNA expression of GFAP and S100B, markers of activated astrocytes, was higher in aged mice. Both markers increased and reached maximum 7 days post-injury. The mRNA expression of astrocyte markers returned to near basal levels rapidly after injury in the adult mice, whereas again in the aged mice return to baseline was delayed. Immunochemical analysis using Iba1 and GFAP antibodies indicated accentuated glial responses in the aged hippocampus after injury. The pronounced and prolonged activation of microglia and astrocytes in hippocampus may contribute to worse cognitive outcomes in the elderly following TBI.
