Kindling in rats produces enduring behavioral changes that parallel the psychobehavioral disturbances frequently accompanying temporal lobe epilepsy. Some evidence suggests that the site of kindling is an important determinant of the type of behavioral changes observed following kindling, although this variable has not been systematically investigated. In the present experiments, the effects of amygdaloid kindling were assessed on a battery of behavioral tests we used previously to assess the effects of kindling in dorsal hippocampus or perirhinal cortex. Three generalized seizures were kindled with stimulation in or near the basolateral amygdala. One week later, rats were tested successively on measures of anxiety, activity, object recognition memory, and spatial working memory over a period of 3 weeks. Amygdaloid kindling produced increased anxiety, but spared all other behaviors assessed. This pattern of results is partially distinct from the previously described effects of perirhinal cortical kindling, which increases anxiety but also impairs object recognition memory, and is completely distinct from dorsal hippocampal kindling, which selectively increases activity and impairs spatial working memory. The observations suggest that kindling of distinct highly interconnected temporal lobe sites produces distinct patterns of behavioral comorbidity. The underlying mechanisms are thus most likely localized to intrinsic circuits at the site of seizure origination.
