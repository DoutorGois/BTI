AIM: To study the effect of nimodipine (Nim) on ischemic cerebral damage. METHODS: The four-vessel occlusion method was performed on rats. Monoamines were measured by fluorospectrophotometry. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal injection of Nim 0.75 and 1.5 mg.kg-1 quickened the recovery of EEG changes to 19 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 4 min (P < 0.01), respectively. Nim reduced the decreases of monoamines (NE, DA, 5-HT, and 5-HIAA) contents after 30-min cerebral ischemia and 1-h reperfusion. CONCLUSION: Nim protects the brain from ischemic damage.
