In addition to numerous GABA-ergic efferent neurons, the striatum contains a subpopulation of fast-firing GABA-ergic interneurons characterized by the presence of immunoreactivity for the calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin. Double-label in situ hybridization with digoxigenin- and radiolabelled cRNA probes was performed on striatal sections of adult rats to identify mRNAs expressed by striatal GABA-ergic interneurons. In the dorsolateral striatum, only parvalbumin mRNA-positive neurons expressed the mRNA encoding the potassium channel Kv3.1, a member of the Shaw family of potassium channels with rapid activation and inactivation kinetics, usually found in fast-firing neurons such as the basket cells of the hippocampus. Colocalization of the parvalbumin and Kv3.1 proteins was confirmed by double-label immunohistochemistry. Parvalbumin mRNA-positive neurons expressed very high levels of the mRNA encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase (Mr 67,000: GAD67) in the dorsolateral striatum. A smaller proportion of double-labelled neurons was found in the ventrolateral striatum. A small number of densely labelled neurons for GAD67 mRNA also expressed the mRNA encoding the dopamine D2 receptor, but none expressed detectable levels of the dopamine D1 receptor mRNA. This indicates major differences in the expression of dopamine receptor mRNA in a majority of GABA-ergic interneurons vs. GABA-ergic efferent neurons of the striatum. The results suggest that distinct molecular characteristics are associated with the distinct electrophysiological properties of striatal GABA-ergic neurons.
