Immunohistochemical studies prove the most of the neurons of the central nervous system express one or more protein kinase C isoenzymes. However, there are only a few descriptions of the glial localization. In the present study, we detected protein kinase C immunohistochemically in guinea pig sensory neocortex, hippocampus and hippocampal slices following in vitro maintenance. Monoclonal antibodies against types II and III of protein kinase C were used. Consecutive sections were stained with polyclonal anti-glial-fibrillary-acidic protein serum. Scattered astrocytes contained protein kinase C in layers I and VI of the cerebral cortex, in the subcortical white matter, the subiculum, alveus and molecular layer of Ammon's horn, in the hilus and molecular layer of the dentate fascia. Ultrastructurally, immunostaining of glial processes in the neuropil and around blood vessels was observed. Strong staining of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope was noted in glial cell bodies. The ultrastructural localization of protein kinase C suggests its participation in receptor-mediated processes, which may influence the shape and function of astrocytes.
