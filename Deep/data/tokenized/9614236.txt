During neural development, specific recognition molecules provide the cues necessary for the formation of initial projection maps, which are reshaped later in development. In some systems, guiding cues for axonal pathfinding and target selection are provided by specific cells that are present only at critical times. For instance, the floor plate guides commissural axons in the spinal cord, and the subplate is involved in the formation of thalamocortical connections. Here we study the development of entorhinal and commissural connections to the murine hippocampus, which in the adult terminate in nonoverlapping layers. We show that two groups of pioneer neurons, Cajal-Retzius cells and GABAergic neurons, form layer-specific scaffolds that overlap with distinct hippocampal afferents at embryonic and early postnatal stages. Furthermore, at postnatal day 0 (P0)-P5, before the dendrites of pyramidal neurons develop, these pioneer neurons are preferential synaptic targets for hippocampal afferents. Birthdating analysis using 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulses showed that most such early-generated neurons disappear at late postnatal stages, most likely by cell death. Together with previous studies, these findings indicate that distinct pioneer neurons are involved in the guidance and targeting of different hippocampal afferents.
