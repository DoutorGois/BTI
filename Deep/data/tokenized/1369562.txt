Higher nervous activity of dogs was studied by classical Pavlovian method of alimentary salivary conditioned reflexes and serotonin content in blood was measured. Kynurenine sulfate in a dose of 300 + 300 mkg (bilaterally) was injected in the dorsal hippocampus region through chemiotrodes. In most cases the injection of the substance led to changes towards excitation (increase of conditioned and unconditioned alimentary salivation in the day of injection and the next day) and also to a rise of serotonin content in animals blood.
