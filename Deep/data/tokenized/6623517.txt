Two trials involving male and female weanling albino rats (Wistar strain) were conducted to investigate the effects of cowpea and limabean hemagglutinin extracts on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in different parts of the brain. The results show that AChE activity varies with brain region. Cowpea hemagglutinin significantly inhibited AChE activity in the pons of male and female rats, while limabean hemagglutinin significantly inhibited AChE activities in the pons of both male and female rats, in the hippocampus of female rats and in the medulla, cerebellum and midbrain of male rats. Inhibition of AChE activities was more pronounced in male or female rats inoculated with a mean lethal dose of either phytohemagglutinin, than in those inoculated with a sublethal dose.
