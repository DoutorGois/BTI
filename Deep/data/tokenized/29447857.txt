Estrogens positively affect object recognition memory (ORM). However, whether this effect rely on acetylcholine is unknown. Here we investigated if 17beta-estradiol (E2) would be able to recover ORM deficits in animals with decreased expression of the Vesicular Acetylcholine Transporter (VAChT KD(HET)). We found that E2 improved short-term ORM (STM) in VAChT KD(HET) male and in OVX female mutant mice. However, E2 did not recover long-term (LTM) ORM in both sexes. Next, we tested whether hippocampal ERs activation could also rescue STM in mutant mice. Our results showed that ERalpha seems to be both sufficient and necessary for STM consolidation in female VAChT KD(HET). Differently, in male, both ERalpha and ERbeta activation recovered STM. In addition, we tested whether mRNA level of estrogen receptors (ER) is also sensitive to VAChT expression. Female mutant mice showed lower levels of ER alpha (ERalpha) mRNA in the hippocampus, while no differences in male were observed. Together, our results showed that under hypocholinergic function, E2 improve short-term object recognition in both male and female. Furthermore, we showed that changes in VAChT expression might potentially modulate hippocampal ERalpha expression in a sex-dependent-manner.
