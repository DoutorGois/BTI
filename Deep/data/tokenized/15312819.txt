BACKGROUND: Isolation rearing of rats is a nonpharmacologic, nonlesion manipulation that leads to deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) and other behavioral and neurochemical alterations reminiscent of schizophrenia. N-acetylaspartate (NAA) is present in high concentrations in the central nervous system and is found primarily in neurons. N-acetylaspartate is considered to be a marker of both neuronal loss and cellular dysfunction. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown reductions of cortical and hippocampal NAA in schizophrenia, and a recent postmortem study has demonstrated a regionally selective temporal cortex deficit. METHODS: The aim of the present study was to determine whether rats reared in isolation exhibit deficits in PPI and reductions in NAA in discrete brain regions, namely the temporal cortex, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. RESULTS: Compared with socially housed rats, isolation rearing resulted in PPI deficits (p <.05) and reductions in NAA in the temporal cortex (p <.001), with no significant change in the other regions investigated. CONCLUSION: These results suggest a disturbance of neuronal function, reflected by NAA reductions in the temporal cortex in isolation-reared rats, providing further evidence that isolation rearing can mimic aspects of the neuronal pathology of schizophrenia.
