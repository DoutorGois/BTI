To investigate the changes underlying kindling epileptogenesis in the rat hippocampus, the levels of the messenger RNAs encoding for the subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor (1, 2A-D) and the kainate-receptor (1, -2, GluR-5, -6, -7) were determined in hippocampal principal neurons using in situ hybridization techniques and semi-quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms. Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway kindled rats were investigated at three different stages of kindling acquisition, always 24 h after the last stimulation. Furthermore, fully kindled rats were studied at long-term (28 days) after termination of kindling stimulations. NR1 messenger RNA levels were slightly decreased in CA1 area of fully kindled animals. In the fascia dentata region, a minor increase of NR2A and NR2B transcripts was found at all stages of kindling acquisition. KA-2 messenger RNA was enhanced in all hippocampal subfields during kindling development. However, none of these changes persisted at long-term after the last seizure and only the low-abundant GluR-7 expression was slightly depressed in the fascia dentata. From our observations we conclude that it is unlikely that alterations in N-methyl-Daspartate or kainate receptor gene expression play an important role in kindling acquisition or maintenance.
