To study nicotine's effects on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, nicotine was injected intraperitoneally into adult rats. After sacrificing, the hippocampal formation was processed for immunohistochemical staining of PSA-NCAM, NeuN and GFAP. Nicotine decreased numbers of PSA-NCAM(+) and NeuN(+) cells dose-dependently.
