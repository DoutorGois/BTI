Responses to oxidative stress contribute to damage caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, which is characteristic of certain neurodegenerative diseases. We used a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion to determine whether green tea polyphenols, which are potent antioxidants and free radical scavengers, can reduce vascular cognitive impairment and to investigate their underlying mechanisms of action. Different doses of green tea polyphenols were administered orally to model rats from 4 to 8 weeks after experimentally induced cerebral hypoperfusion, and spatial learning and memory were assessed using the Morris water maze. Following behavioral testing, oxygen free radical levels and antioxidative capability in the cortex and hippocampus were measured biochemically. The levels of lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for 4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, respectively. Rats that received green tea polyphenols 400 mg/kg per day had better spatial learning and memory than saline-treated rats. Green tea polyphenols 400 mg/kg per day were found to scavenge oxygen free radicals, enhance antioxidant potential, decrease lipid peroxide production and reduce oxidative DNA damage. However, green tea polyphenols 100 mg/kg per day had no significant effects, particularly in the cortex. This study suggests that green tea polyphenols 400 mg/kg per day improve spatial cognitive abilities following chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and that these effects may be related to the antioxidant effects of these compounds.
