We have previously demonstrated that both stress manipulations and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) elevate locomotor activity in mice primarily in the center region of an open field. In the present study, other than confirming these findings, we have further examined the roles of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the caudate nucleus in mediating the locomotor-stimulating effect of CRF. Results indicate that among the areas examined, the hippocampus is the most important neural substrate of the action of CRF. The amygdala is also partly responsible for the behavioral effect produced by CRF. The caudate nucleus, however, although is important in the expression of gross motor activity, is not involved in the effect of CRF on locomotion in mice. The results are compared with those obtained in rats and are discussed in terms of the interactions between CRF and stress.
