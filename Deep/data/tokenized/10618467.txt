Imipramine, a serotonin and noradrenaline uptake inhibitor, is the prototypical tricyclic antidepressant. The effects of imipramine on neuronal responsiveness to the group I glutamate metabotropic (mGlu) receptor agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) were studied ex vivo, in the CA1 area of rat hippocampus, using extracellular and intracellular recording. DHPG increased the population spike amplitude, depolarized CA1 cells and decreased the slow afterhyperpolarization. Imipramine (20 microM) administered acutely in vitro did not change the effect of DHPG on population spikes. Repeated treatment with imipramine (10 mg/kg, twice daily, for 14 days) significantly attenuated the enhancing effect of DHPG (2.5 and 5 microM) on population spikes, as well as the DHPG-induced depolarization and the decrease in the slow afterhyperpolarization. Repeated treatment with imipramine had no effect on passive or active membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal cells. The results of the time-course experiment demonstrated that the imipramine-induced decrease in the responsiveness of CA1 cells to DHPG was apparent after a 7-day treatment; there was a further decrease after 14 days of treatment to a level which was not changed by longer (21-day) administration of imipramine. The attenuation of neuronal responsiveness to DHPG induced by a 14-day treatment was still detectable 7 days after imipramine withdrawal. It is concluded that repeated treatment with imipramine induces a decrease in the responsiveness of rat CA1 hippocampal neurons to group I mGlu receptor activation with a time course which correlates with the delayed onset of the therapeutic effect of antidepressants in humans. This suggests that alterations in mGlu receptors may contribute to antidepressant efficacy.
