Granule cells of the dentate gyrus can be selectively destroyed by intrahippocampal injections of colchicine. The present study evaluates the consequences of this selective neuronal destruction on the afferent axon terminals which have been deprived of their normal targets. The area of the neuropil in the dentate gyrus (the molecular layer) was evaluated in sections stained using the Timm's method for heavy metals, which selectively marks the terminal fields of the different afferent systems. The molecular layer was examined electron microscopically to determine the fate of afferent terminals. Anterograde transport of HRP or [3H]proline was used to define the location and extent of afferent terminal fields of the entorhinal and commissural projections to the dentate gyrus in which the granule cells had been destroyed. There was a substantial reduction in the size of the dentate gyrus molecular layer after destruction of granule cells with colchicine. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that there were very few axon terminals or synapses remaining in the shrunken molecular layer. Tract tracing methods revealed that both the entorhinal and commissural pathways were still present in their normal terminal zones in the dentate gyrus, however, the density of the projections was greatly reduced. There was no evidence to suggest the formation of ectopic projections to unusual locations, such as the contralateral dentate gyrus. Pathways passing through the hippocampus appeared to survive the colchicine injections. These results suggest that target destruction in adult animals leads to the disappearance of the afferent axon terminals which normally innervate the cells which die.
