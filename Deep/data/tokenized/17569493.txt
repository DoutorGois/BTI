The anticholinergic agent atropine decreases acetylcholine concentrations and increases high-affinity choline uptake in cortical and hippocampal regions of rat brain. Administration of choline 1 hour before atropine prevents both of these atropine-induced alterations. These findings suggest that alterations in acetylcholine precursor availability may modify the effects of centrally active anticholinergic agents.
