The extracellular protease cascade of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen has been implicated in neuronal plasticity and degeneration. We show here that unstimulated expression of tPA in the mouse hippocampus is concentrated in the mossy fiber pathway, with little or no expression within the perforant path, the Schaffer collaterals, or neuronal cell bodies. tPA protein is also expressed in vascular endothelial cells throughout the brain parenchyma. Four hours after excitotoxic injury, tPA protein is transiently induced within CA1 pyramidal neurons. The induced CA1 tPA is localized to neurons that survive the injury and is enzymatically active. Within the mossy fiber pathway, injury resulted in decreased tPA protein. In contrast, mossy fiber tPA activity displayed a biphasic character: transient increase at 8 hr, then a decrease by 24 hr after injury. Analysis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression showed that PAI-1 antigen is upregulated by 24 hr and could account for the tPA activity downregulation seen at this time point. Plasminogen immunohistochemistry suggested an increase within the mossy fiber pathway after injury. Finally, hippocampal tPA expression among various mammalian species was strikingly different. These results indicate a complex control of tPA protein and enzymatic activity in the hippocampus that may help regulate neuronal plasticity.
