The present report describes the participation of nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) in controlling the excitability of local neuronal circuitries in the rat hippocampus and in the human cerebral cortex. The patch-clamp technique was used to record responses triggered by the non-selective agonist ACh and the alpha7-nAChR-selective agonist choline in interneurons of human cerebral cortical and rat hippocampal slices. Evidence is provided that functional alpha7- and alpha4beta2-like nAChRs are present on somatodendritic and/or preterminal/terminal regions of interneurons in the CA1 field of the rat hippocampus and in the human cerebral cortex and that activation of the different nAChR subtypes present in the preterminal/terminal areas of the interneurons triggers the tetrodotoxin-sensitive release of GABA. Modulation by nAChRs of GABAergic transmission, which can result either in inhibition or disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, depends both on the receptor subtype present in the interneurons and on the agonist acting upon these receptors. Not only do alpha7 nAChRs desensitize faster than alpha4beta2 nAChRs, but also alpha7 nAChR desensitization induced by ACh lasts longer than that induced by choline. These mechanisms, which appear to be retained across species, might explain the involvement of nAChRs in cognitive functions and in such neurological disorders as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
