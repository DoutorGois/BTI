Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenol which is rich in grape seeds and skin. Several studies have revealed that resveratrol possesses neuroprotective effects. In the case of global brain ischemia, there are few reports regarding the protective effect of resveratrol. Therefore, the influence of resveratrol on neuronal damage after transient global brain ischemia remains to be clarified. In the current study, C57BL/6 black mice were subjected to 20 min of transient global brain ischemia and followed by 72 h of reperfusion. Resveratrol (20 or 40 mg/kg, once daily, dissolved in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose) was administered orally for 7 days before ischemia and daily until the mice were euthanized. The effect of lower or higher dose of resveratrol on neuronal damage, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity and in situ DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) assay in the hippocampus after global ischemia was examined. Neuronal damages were remarkable in CA1 and CA2 pyramidal cell layers after global ischemia. In resveratrol-treated mice (40 mg/kg), neuronal damage was significantly reduced compared with vehicle-treated mice. Mice treated with resveratrol showed reduced MMP-9 activity. Resveratrol also inhibited TUNEL staining. These data suggest that resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, reduces hippocampal neuronal cell damage following transient global ischemia by reducing MMP-9 activity.
