A quantitative acetylcholinesterase enzyme-histochemical study was performed with microdensitometric methods in the hippocampus of the rat in order to correlate this enzymatic activity with the different zones of the hippocampal pyramidal layer. Higher values of acetylcholinesterase activity were found in the CA3 pyramidal zone. CA1 and CA4 showed the same activity, while the stratum oriens at CA3 showed the highest values among the hippocampal layers studied. The results were correlated with differences in septal afferences.
