It has been demonstrated that several types of adult stem cells have a common attribute of tropism for gliomas. In our study, we provided evidence that embryonic stem cell-derived embryoid body (EB) cells also exhibited a tropism for gliomas. Chemotaxis assays and organotypic hippocampal slice culture experiments showed that EB cells were attracted by the conditioned medium from C6 glioma cells and by C6 glioma cells deposited on the slice. Aggregate culture assays showed that EB cells could coaggregate with C6 glioma cells. Embryoid body cells injected intratumorally were found to distribute throughout the tumor mass. All data indicated that EB cells displayed a tropism for gliomas.
