Brain radiation is an important treatment option for malignant and benign brain diseases. The possible acute or chronic impact of radiation therapy on cognitive performance is important for daily functioning and quality of life. A detailed evaluation of cognitive impairment is important in the context of how to control disease progression. The susceptibility of the hippocampus to radiation-induced neuronal damage and its important role in memory highlight that therapeutic strategies require precision medicine.
