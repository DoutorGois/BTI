In order to follow the maturation-related evolution of neuronal damage, cellular activation and stress response subsequent to Li-Pilo seizures in the 10- (P10), 21-day-old (P21) and adult rat, we analyzed the expression of the c-Fos protein as a marker of cellular activation, HSP72 immunoreactivity as the stress response and silver staining for the assessment of neuronal damage in 20 selected brain regions. The early wave of c-Fos measured at 2 h after the onset of seizures was present in most structures of the animals at the three ages studied and particularly strong in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. The late wave of c-Fos measured at 24 h after the onset of seizures and that was shown to correlate to neuronal damage was absent from the P10 rat brain, and present mainly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of P21 and adult rats. The expression of the stress response, assessed by the immunoreactivity of HSP72 at 24 h after the seizures was absent from the P10 rat brain and present in the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus and thalamus of P21 and adult rats. The expression of Jun D at 24 h after the seizures was discrete and present in most brain regions at all ages. Neuronal injury assessed by silver staining at 6 h after the onset of seizures was very discrete in the brain of the P10 rat and limited to a few neurons in the piriform and entorhinal cortices. In older animals, marked neuronal degeneration occurred in the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, lateral septum and thalamus. Thus the immediate cell activation induced by lithium-pilocarpine seizures which is present at all ages translates only into a late wave of c-Fos and the expression of HSP72 in P21 and adult animals in which there will be extensive cell damage.
