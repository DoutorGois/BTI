Glial cells are sensitive to aging, but the real extent of age-related quantitative and qualitative changes of these brain cellular elements has not yet been clarified. Brain volume undergoes age-related changes, but several studies on the number of glial cells have not taken this important variable into account. In this study we quantitatively evaluated the number and morphology of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunoreactive astroglia in the frontal cortex and in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus of male Sprague-Dawley rats of aged 12 and 24 months, considered adult and aged, respectively. The volume of frontal cortex was unchanged in the two age groups investigated, whereas the volume of hippocampus was higher in aged rats. An increase in the number and size of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes was observed in the frontal cortex and in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus of aged rats. The numeric increase in astrocytes was more pronounced in the hippocampus than in the frontal cortex, whereas age-related hypertrophy of astroglia was more accentuated in the frontal cortex. The possible significance of hyperplasia and hypertrophy of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes in the frontal cortex and in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus of aged rats is discussed.
