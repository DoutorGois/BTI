This paper briefly reviews the role of mixed feedback, neural delays, and neural noise in the genesis of complex oscillations in neurological feedback systems. The results are concretely discussed within the context of recurrent inhibition in the mammalian hippocampus, and a hybrid version of the pupil light reflex with externally imposed electronic feedback.
