The effects of the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor soman were investigated on different receptors coupled to phosphoinositide (PPI) breakdown on hippocampal slices in vitro. We observed that muscarinic receptor subtypes M1 and M3 are involved in the increase of intracellular inositol phosphate, which is consistent with the procholinergic effect of soman induced by inhibition of AChE. Although the M2 receptor subtypes are known to be coupled to the cAMP second messenger, we demonstrated that in vitro, under soman, they are also involved in the PPI turnover. The other receptor subtypes known to be linked to PPI hydrolysis are not involved in this model of stimulation.
