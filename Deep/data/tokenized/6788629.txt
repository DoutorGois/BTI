Recent studies have shown that rats have a remarkable ability to keep track of their spatial location. Explanations stress the involvement of a form of short-term (working) memory in which the hippocampus appears to play a major role. The hippocampus appears to be vulnerable to early undernutrition and preliminary investigations indicate that Areas CA3 and CA4 suffer the most. Ninety-day-old rats, previously undernourished prenatally and throughout lactation, were tested in an 8- and, then, a 16-arm radial maze. Significant differences were observed between the experimental and control groups on both tests, especially in the 16-arm maze. Error distributions were also significantly different with experimental animals tending to perseverate in 1 area of the maze. Differences were also observed in the time taken to make the choices and in exploratory behavior. We conclude that early undernutrition affected the spatial learning ability of the animals and that this may be due to the distortions observed in the normal growth pattern of the hippocampus.
