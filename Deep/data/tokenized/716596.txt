The state of nuclear DNA, revealed by the microfluorometric method, changed unequally in conditions of dissimilar afferentation in different classes of the neurones in the neocortex and the hippocampal dentate fascia. It may be assumed that the examined classes of cells (large pyramids and stellate neurones of the sensorimotor zone of the cerebral cortex and the granular cells of the dentate fascia of the hippocampus) possess a different structural functional organization of genome. This probably accounts for the peculiarities of their functioning.
