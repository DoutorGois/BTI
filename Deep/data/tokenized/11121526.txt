The senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) is known to be a murine model for accelerated aging. The SAMP8 strain shows age-related deterioration of learning and memory at an earlier age than control mice (SAMR1). In the present study, we investigated the changes in expressions of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the brain of SAMP8. In the hippocampus of 10 months old SAMP8, the expression of IL-1 mRNA was significantly elevated in comparison with that of SAMR1. In both strains of SAMs, increases in IL-1beta protein in the brain were observed at 10 months of age compared with 2 and 5 months. The only differences found between the strain in protein levels were at 10 months and were elevations in IL-1beta in the hippocampus and hypothalamus, and in TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus in SAMP8 as compared with SAMR1. However, lipopolysaccharide-induced increases in the expression of these cytokines in brain did not differ between SAMP8 and SAMR1. Increases in expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain may be involved in the age-related neural dysfunction and/or learning deficiency in SAMP8.
