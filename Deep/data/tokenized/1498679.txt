Rats received high frequency (100 Hz, 1 s) hippocampal stimulations that evoked afterdischarges (ADs) in a partial kindling model of epilepsy. Kindled rats were given 15 ADs over 3 days. Control rats received the same stimulation pulses at 0.17 Hz (low frequency stimulation, LFSs). Subsequent to in vivo stimulations, hippocampal slices were obtained from the rats and extracellular field responses were recorded in the CA3 cell layer following CA1 stratum radiatum stimulation, and in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) following perforant path stimulation. At the DG, the paired-pulse facilitation of the population spike was depressed in the kindled than the control group, on 1 day or 23 days post ADs/LFSs. The excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) responses in DG following single or paired pulses were not different between kindled and control slices. At CA3, paired-pulse facilitation of both the population spike and the population EPSP was increased in the kindled compared to the control group.
