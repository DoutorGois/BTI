Acute and chronic experiments on cats have shown the possibility of obtaining in one session conditioned EEG-responses and vegetative changes as well as conditioned motor reactions time-locked to the moment of the unconditioned pain stimulation omitted during testing. Electro-convulsive stimulation directly after elaboration prevents the appearance of conditioned motor reactions, while conditioned EEG and vegetative changes are retained after electric seizures. A conclusion has been drawn that the emotional component of conditioned reactions is not subjected to the amnestic effect of electro-convulsive action.
