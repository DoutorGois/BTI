A new method of introducing active substances into the CNS is described. The autologous connective tissue chambers were obtained by implantation of a silicone tube under the back skin of rats. Subsequently they were filled with fibrine and additionally with NGF or submicrosomal fractions from nonpredegenerated and predegenerated peripheral nerves. Filled chambers were implanted stereotaxically into the injured hippocampus. The neurite outgrowth was examined by means of FITC-HRP and acetylcholinesterase-method. Implanted connective tissue chambers are very useful in getting active substances into the CNS. This method allows to avoid inflammatory processes and does not hinder the histological procedures.
