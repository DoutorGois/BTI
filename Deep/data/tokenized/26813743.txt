AIMS: Chemical entities containing mercapto group have been increasingly attractive in the therapy of central nerve system (CNS) diseases. In the recent study, we screened a series of mercapto-tacrine derivatives with synergistic neuropharmacological profiles in vitro. METHODS: We investigated the effect and mechanism of ST09, a thioester derivative of tacrine containing a potential mercapto group, on the vascular dementia (VaD) model of rat induced by bilateral common carotid arteries occlusion (2-VO). RESULTS: ST09 and its active metabolite ST10 retained excellent inhibition on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. ST09 significantly attenuated the 2-VO-induced impairment in spatial acquisition performance and inhibited the 2-VO-induced rise of AChE activity. In the VaD model, ST09 attenuated the oxidative stress and decreased the apoptosis in the cortex and hippocampus. Compared with donepezil, ST09 exhibited a better effect on the regeneration of free thiols in 2-VO rats. Interestingly, ST09, not donepezil, greatly improved glucose metabolism in various brain regions of 2-VO rats using functional imaging of (18) F-labeled fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). CONCLUSIONS: ST09 may serve as a more promising agent for the therapy of VaD than tacrine owing to the introduction of a potential mercapto group into the parent skeleton.
