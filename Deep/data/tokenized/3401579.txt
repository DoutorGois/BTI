The influence of some drugs (piracetam and 3-oxypyridine derivative) having a nootropic effect on ethanol-induced changes of bioelectrical activity was studied in experiments on freely moving rats. Discontinuation of ethanol administration (1, 2 g/kg, i.p. for 40 days) has been found to provoke destructuring of Fourier's spectral power of sensorimotor cortex and dorsal hippocamp on the EEG. Long-term administration of piracetam or 3-oxypyridine derivative (300 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, i.p. for 40 days) with ethanol has a protective effect and normalizes EEG at the cortical level. The authors discuss possible neurophysiological mechanisms of nootropic drug action in ethanol-induced pathology.
