Enolase in cerebrospinal fluid is a sensitive marker for many types of neurological injuries including head injury and ischemia. We assessed neuron-specific enolase (NSE) as a quantitative and specific biochemical marker of neuronal damage in an experimental model of kainate neurotoxicity. Rat hippocampal cultures were treated with various concentrations of kainate. NSE release into the culture medium was compared with neuronal death estimated either by direct cell counting or by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, largely used to quantify neuronal injury. A dose-response relationship was observed between kainate concentration and the amount of NSE released (r = -0.69; p < 0.05) as well as a significant correlation between NSE release and neuronal death (r = 0.64; p < 0.05). Likewise, a significant correlation was found between LDH and NSE release (r = 0.85; p < 0.05). The specificity of NSE as an indicator of neuronal death was demonstrated using immunocyto-chemistry labeling and measurement of NSE release by pure astrocyte cultures. We concluded that NSE is a reliable, quantitative, and specific marker of neuronal injury.
