BACKGROUND: Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy are characterized by Lewy bodies in distinct brain areas. These aggregates are mainly formed by alpha-synuclein inclusions, a protein crucial for synaptic functions in the healthy brain. Transgenic animal models of synucleinopathies are frequently based on over-expression of human wild type or mutated alpha-synuclein under the regulatory control of different promoters. A promising model is the Line 61 alpha-synuclein transgenic mouse that expresses the transgene under control of the Thy-1 promoter. RESULTS: Here, we show an extended characterization of this mouse model over age. To this end, we analyzed animals for the progression of human and mouse protein expression levels in different brain areas as well as motor and memory deficits. Our results show, that Line 61 mice exhibited an age dependent increase of alpha-synuclein protein levels in the hippocampus but not the striatum. While murine alpha-synuclein was also increased with age, it was lower expressed in Line 61 mice than in non-transgenic littermates. At the age of 9 months animals exhibited increased neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we found that Line 61 mice showed severe motor deficits as early as 1 month of age as assessed by the wire hanging and nest building tests. At later ages, initial motor deficits were validated with the RotaRod, pasta gnawing and beam walk tests. At 8 months of age animals exhibited emotional memory deficits as validated with the contextual fear conditioning test. CONCLUSION: In summary, our results strengthen and further expand our knowledge about the Line 61 mouse model, emphasizing this mouse model as a valuable in vivo tool to test new compounds directed against synucleinopathies.
