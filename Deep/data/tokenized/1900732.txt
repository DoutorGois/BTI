The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is known to take part in the cohesion of cellular interactions through a homophilic binding mechanism. During development, NCAM shifts from an embryonic polysialic acid-rich form to a poorer adult one. This conversion reflects a loss of plasticity to the benefit of more stability. We have shown here an inverse process, namely the reexpression of the embryonic form of NCAM in adult rats following a status epilepticus induced through systemic administration of kainic acid.
