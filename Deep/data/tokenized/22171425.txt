The purpose of this work was to study the dynamics of expression of mitochondrial Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) 3 and 24 hours after single and triple exposure to mild hypoxia. The investigation was conducted in 18 male Wistar rats using immunocytochemical method. It was shown that in various hippocampal areas the effects of single and triple hypoxia exposure on the Mn-SOD expression could be different or largely similar. The expression dynamics at four time points studied (3 and 24 hours after the first exposure, 3 and 24 hours after the third one) had a wave character which may be important for the development of moderate hypoxia-induced tolerance to subsequent more severe exposures.
