Small electrolytic lesions placed in the hilus of the dentate gyrus have been shown to induce behavioral seizures, an elevation in the concentration of the opioid peptide enkephalin, and an increase in the transcription of the gene coding for the peptide precursor of enkephalin. Since polyamines and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in their synthesis, have been shown to play critical roles in the growth and differentiation of several types of tissue, we tested for changes in ODC activity at various times following the initiation of seizures. ODC activity is significantly increased 3 hr after the lesions, reaches maximal (50-fold) levels about 12 hr later, and returns to control values after 48 hr. The increase occurs in both hippocampi following unilateral electrolytic lesions, is blocked by treatments that suppress limbic seizures, and does not occur after lesions that fail to elicit seizures; accordingly, we conclude that the increase in ODC activity results from epileptiform activity rather than some other consequence of the hilar lesion (e.g., deafferentation). The increase in ODC activity precedes the increase in the amount of mRNA coding for the enkephalin prohormone, which, in turn, precedes the increase in enkephalin levels. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the early induction of ODC following the initiation of seizures leads to an alteration in genomic expression, which, in turn, changes neuropeptide levels. Adult brains thus appear to possess trophic responses of a type found in a variety of developing cell types and organs, and the possibility exists that these are involved in the control of seizure susceptibility.
