Different types of network oscillations occur in different behavioral, cognitive, or vigilance states. The rodent hippocampus expresses prominent theta oscillations at frequencies between 4 and 12 Hz, which are superimposed by phase-coupled gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz). These patterns entrain multineuronal activity over large distances and have been implicated in sensory information processing and memory formation. Here we report a new type of oscillation at near-theta frequencies (2-4 Hz) in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized mice. The rhythm is highly coherent with nasal respiration and with rhythmic field potentials in the olfactory bulb: hence, we called it hippocampal respiration-induced oscillations. Despite the similarity in frequency range, several features distinguish this pattern from locally generated theta oscillations: hippocampal respiration-induced oscillations have a unique laminar amplitude profile, are resistant to atropine, couple differently to gamma oscillations, and are abolished when nasal airflow is bypassed by tracheotomy. Hippocampal neurons are entrained by both the respiration-induced rhythm and concurrent theta oscillations, suggesting a direct interaction between endogenous activity in the hippocampus and nasal respiratory inputs. Our results demonstrate that nasal respiration strongly modulates hippocampal network activity in mice, providing a long-range synchronizing signal between olfactory and hippocampal networks.
