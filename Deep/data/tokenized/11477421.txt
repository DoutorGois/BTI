In cultured hippocampal neurons, one axon and several dendrites differentiate from a common immature process. Here we found that CRMP-2/TOAD-64/Ulip2/DRP-2 (refs. 2-4) level was higher in growing axons of cultured hippocampal neurons, that overexpression of CRMP-2 in the cells led to the formation of supernumerary axons and that expression of truncated CRMP-2 mutants suppressed the formation of primary axon in a dominant-negative manner. Thus, CRMP-2 seems to be critical in axon induction in hippocampal neurons, thereby establishing and maintaining neuronal polarity.
