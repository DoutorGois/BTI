We studied the effect of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling (35 mg/kg, i.p., daily) on somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SOM) with special attention to the duration of changes (rats were sacrificed either 10 days or 4 months after the development of kindling) and to transmitters or modulators related to somatostatin (neuropeptide Y (NPY), GABA, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AchE]. In rats sacrificed 10 days after the last kindled seizure, SOM was elevated in frontal cortex and striatum (p less than 0.01); NPY was elevated in frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus (p less than 0.05) of kindled or prekindled rats (i.e., rats which were treated daily with PTZ but did not express three consecutive generalized seizures). ChAT activity was slightly decreased (p less than 0.05) in cortex. GABA levels and AchE activity were unchanged in kindled cortex. In rats sacrificed 4 months after the development of kindling none of the parameters analyzed differed from controls. The present study suggests that the cortical and striatal neurons containing SOM/NPY are affected by PTZ-kindling. The cortical cholinergic system is affected to a much smaller extent. The neuropeptide changes are not persistent, as is the lowered seizure threshold, so they are probably not involved in the maintainance of the latter.
