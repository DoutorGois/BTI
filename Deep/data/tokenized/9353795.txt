Over the past two decades, evidence has been accumulating that diffusible molecules, such as growth factors and steroids hormones, play an important part in neural senescence, particularly in the hippocampus. There is also evidence that these molecules do not act as independent signals, but show interrelated regulation and cooperative control over the aging process. Here, we review some of the changes that occur in the hippocampus with age, and the influence of two classes of signaling substances: glucocorticoids and neurotrophins. We also examine the interactions between these substances and how this could influence the aging process.
