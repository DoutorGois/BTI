Adrenalectomy (ADX) in rats has been shown to induce apoptosis of hippocampal granule cells. We tested whether neurotrophins are able to protect hippocampal neurons in this neurodegeneration model. Acid fucshsin stain was used to identify pyknotic cells in ADX rats treated for 4 days with NT-3, NT-4-5 or cytochrome-C, as a control protein. Cytochrome-C injections slightly decreased cell death on the ipsilateral side. NT-3 did not further promote this effect. Significantly less cell death was observed bilaterally in hippocampus treated with NT-4/5. TUNEL end labeling also confirmed the results. Our results demonstrated that NT-4/5, but not NT-3, promotes hippocampal neuron survival in adrenalectomized rats. They further show that injections of a control solution can induce a local protective effect.
