Modifications in thee content of monoamines after different lesions of the cerebellar cortex were investigated in eight prosencephalic structures of cat's brain. Apart from other minor changes, lesions of the posterior vermis induced significant changes in the thalamus (decrease of DA and increase of 5-HT). Lesions of the cortex of a cerebellar hemisphere, on the other hand, produced an increase of 5-HT in the caudate nucleus and an increase of DA in the hippocampus in addition to a generalized increase of 5-HT in all the prosencephalic structures studied. These findings are discussed in relation to the anatomical connections of the lesioned areas and their expected role in the sleep-wakefulness cycle.
