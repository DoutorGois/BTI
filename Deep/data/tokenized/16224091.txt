BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MK-801 is a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors with protective efficacy in experimental stroke. This study examined the impact of MK-801 on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and its relationship to gene expression changes during focal ischemia. METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to surgical occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and ipsilateral common carotid artery after 30 minutes pretreatment with 5 mg/kg MK-801 or saline vehicle. After 2.5 hours of ischemia, regional CBF was evaluated by [14C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography and compared with distributions of gene expression changes evaluated by in situ hybridization detection of mRNAs encoding several immediate-early genes and the stress protein, hsp72. RESULTS: MK-801 increased CBF in contralateral cortex from 93+/-15 to 187+/-37 mL/100 g per minute and produced a significant 25% reduction in the volume of ischemic cortex ipsilateral to occlusion. The extent of cortex failing to express inducible mRNAs correspondingly decreased, but the CBF threshold for mRNA synthesis remained unchanged (25 to 30 mL/100 g per minute). Widespread immediate-early gene expression in the neocortex became restricted to periinfarct regions after MK-801 treatment, and hybridization patterns in the striatum and hippocampus reflected the altered topography of cortical activation after drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MK-801 alters ischemia-induced gene expression by 2 distinct mechanisms. Generalized increases in CBF reduce the volume of cortex falling below ischemic injury thresholds, protecting tissue and facilitating transcription of inducible genes proximal to the ischemic focus. In addition, MK-801 attenuates the signals that induce expression of immediate-early genes in cortical and subcortical regions remote from the middle cerebral artery territory.
