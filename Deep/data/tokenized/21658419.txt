This study consists of a thorough immunohistochemical examination of the expression profile of the transcription factor Satb1 (special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1) in the adult mouse central nervous system (CNS). Satb1-positive neurons were abundant in the deep layers of the neocortex, subiculum, anterior olfactory nucleus, nucleus of diagonal band, anterior part of the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, compact part of substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and medullary and spinal dorsal horns. Relatively smaller populations of Satb1-positive neurons were observed in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, other subnuclei of the amygdala, centrolateral thalamic nucleus, parafascicular thalamic nucleus, posterior hypothalamic area, ventral part of the premammillary nucleus, supramammillary nucleus, deep layers of the superior colliculus, dorsal raphe nucleus, nucleus of trapezoid body, superior periolivary nucleus and nucleus of lateral lemniscus, and parabrachial region. Double immunostaining showed that Satb1 was expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons, but not in cholinergic or serotonergic neurons. Satb1 expression was never observed in glial cells. This study presents a comprehensive overview of Satb1 expression in the CNS, and provides insights for investigating the role of Satb1 in the mature CNS.
