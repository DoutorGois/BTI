Selective amygdalohippocampectomy was developed as a surgical treatment for temporal lobe epilesy with a well-defined unilateral mesiobasal limbic seizure onset. Since 1975, 236 patients have been operated on in Zurich. We briefly summarize recent studies on the seizure outcome with analysis of the postoperative long-term fluctuations in relation to postoperative anticonvulsant drug treatment, on the underlying neuropathology, and on the relationships between magnetic resonance scanning estimates of total volume of the removed tissue and the resection scores of amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampus gyrus.
