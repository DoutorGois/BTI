It was shown in experiments on 25 dogs that the generalized a-like limbic activity is recorded on ECoG in the post-resuscitation period after 12-minute cardiac arrest largely in the cases of forced spontaneous breathing. The use of large tidal volumes of artificial lung ventilation during resuscitation significantly diminished frequency of the appearance on ECcG of the activity in question because of hypccapnia and resultant suppression of the respiratory centre. The forced work of the respiratory centre is conducive to the development of this activity by irradiating the excitaticn to the higher brain structures.
