The proper assembly of a cohort of distinct cell types is a prerequisite for building a functional hippocampus. In this review, we describe the major molecular events of the developmental program leading to the cellular construction of the hippocampus. Data from rodent studies are used here to elaborate on our understanding of these processes.
