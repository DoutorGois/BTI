In this study, we investigated the effect of GST, an extract of Chinese traditional herb, on transient brain ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal cell death. Immunoblotting was used to detect the phosphorylation of MLK, JNK and c-jun. Transient (15 minutes) brain ischemia was induced by the four-vessel occlusion in Sprague-Dawley rats. GST was administrated to the SD rats 20 minutes before ischemia or 1 hour after ischemia. Our data showed that the pretreatment of GST could inhibit phosphorylation of MLK, JNK and c-jun. Moreover, GST showed potent neuroprotective effects on ischemic brain damage in vivo and administration of it 1 hour after ischemia also achieved the protective effects. These results indicate that GST has a prominent neuroprotection action against brain ischemic damage and provides a promising therapeutic approach for ischemic brain injury.
