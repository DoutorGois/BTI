Glycoprotein gp130 is involved in signaling out of significant cytokine receptors as interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor, which play critical role in immunity, inflammation and neurogenesis. IL-6 and brain neurotransmitter serotonin are involved in the mechanism of depression. The aim of this work was to investigat the role of protein gp130 in the regulation of expression of genes, coding the key enzyme of serotonin synthesis--tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), 5-HT-transporter, 5-HT(1A)- and 5-HT(2A)-receptors of serotonin. The study was carried out on adult mouse males of AKR and congenic AKR.CBA-D13Mit76 strains, created by transfer of the fragment of chromosome 13 containing the gene coding gp130 protein from CBA/Lac strain to the genome of AKR/J strain. Decreased expression of 5-HT(1A) - 5-HT(2A)-receptor genes in hippocampus midbrain and TPH2 gene in midbrain in AKR.CBA-D13Mit76 mice compared with AKR mice were shown. Activation of nonspecific immunity by bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration did not affect the genes expression in AKR mice, but increased 5-HT(2A)-receptor expression in midbrain and decreased 5-HT(1A)-receptor expression in cortex in AKR.CBA-D13Mit76 mice. The results indicate: 1) the participation of gp130 in the regulation of TPH2, 5-HT(1A)- and 5-HT(2A)-receptor genes and 2) association of this protein in the genetically determined sensitivity to LPS.
