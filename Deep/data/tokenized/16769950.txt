The authors describe diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) changes in the hippocampus within 48 hours of acute symptomatic seizures or status epilepticus in 12 patients. DWI showed increased signal and a decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in all patients, with corresponding lactate detected on MRS in six patients and EEG seizure activity in nine patients. On follow-up, the atrophic hippocampus had an increased ADC in six patients. DWI and MRS may predict development of hippocampal sclerosis.
