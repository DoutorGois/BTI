By inducing morphine dependence in mice, the changes of cGMP contents, phosphodiesterase (PDE) and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activities and their phosphorylation regulated by protein kinase A (PKA) were observed. It was found that: (1) cGMP contents in cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex were significantly lower. (2) The sGC activities were apparently decreased in cerebellum and striatum. In the striatum and cerebral cortex the sGC activities and phosphorylation levels in vitro were significantly increased and were inhibited by PKA inhibitor. (3) The PDE activities showed no change in cerebellum and hippocampus, but in striatum and cerebral cortex PDE activities and phosphorylation levels in vitro were significantly increased and were inhibited by PKA inhibitor. (4) These changes described above were not observed in mice treated with naloxone 30 min prior to daily morphine injection. Our data indicate that the decrease of cGMP contents occurred generally in brain regions of morphine-dependent mice. The decrease of cGMP contents in cerebellum and hippocampus may be due to the decrease of sGC activities, but the decrease of cGMP contents in striatum and cerebral cortex may be mainly due to the increase of PDE activity. Both sGC and PDE activities were regulated by PKA.
