The ontogeny of the ability of C57BL/6 mice to use different cues for spatial learning was examined in several Morris water maze tasks. In the first two studies, three learning procedures were used, in which only distal cues (place learning), only proximal cues (cue learning), or both proximal and distal cues (cue + place learning) were pertinent to localize the platform. The results indicated that whatever the procedure, 22-day-old mice showed the same capabilities as adults. Moreover, in the cue + place-learning procedure, although the distal cues were not necessary to solve the task, both young and adult mice demonstrated the integration of distal information by exhibiting a strong spatial bias during a probe test. However, in the third experiment, it was shown that nonpertinent proximal cues perturbed 22-day-old mice in a place-learning procedure. Taken together, these results suggest that while even the youngest mice show striking spatial navigation abilities, young mice give greater importance to proximal cues for orientation whereas adults preferentially use distal information.
