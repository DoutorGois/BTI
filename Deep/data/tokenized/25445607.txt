Apelin and its receptor APJ (apelin receptor) are prominently expressed in brain regions involved in learning and memory. However, the role of apelin in cognition was largely unclear. Here, the role of apelin-13 in memory processes was investigated in mice novel object recognition task. Post-training injection of apelin-13 (0.3 and 1 nmol) dose-dependently impaired short-term memory (STM), however, pre-training infusion of apelin-13 (1 nmol) did not affect STM, suggesting apelin-13 blocks formation but not acquisition of STM. Apelin-13 (1 nmol) administered immediately, 30, 60 or 120 min post-training impaired long-term memory (LTM) in a time-dependent manner (30 min), however, both pre-training and pre-test infusion of apelin-13 (1 nmol) did not affect LTM, suggesting apelin-13 impaired consolidation but not acquisition and recall of LTM. Taken together, for the first time, our results indicate that apelin-13 blocks STM formation and LTM consolidation in novel object recognition task.
