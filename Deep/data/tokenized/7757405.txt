Glial cells have long been recognized as participating in development of neural tissue by providing a scaffolding for migration and by synthesis and secretion of a variety of growth factors and extracellular matrix components. An additional role for glia and other non-neuronal cells in the electrical differentiation of neurons has been suggested by several recent articles, in particular a group that has focused on the potassium currents that influence action potential repolarization and repetitive activity. In this review I present examples of developmental regulation of potassium currents by interactions with non-neuronal cells and discuss some implications of this regulation.
