The dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampus perform different functions. Whether the integrative properties of hippocampal cells reflect this heterogeneity is unknown. We focused on dendrites where most synaptic input integration takes place. We report enhanced backpropagation and theta resonance and decreased summation of synaptic inputs in ventral versus dorsal CA1 pyramidal cell distal dendrites. Transcriptional Kv4.2 down-regulation and post-transcriptional hyperpolarization-activated cyclic AMP-gated channel (HCN1/2) up-regulation may underlie these differences, respectively. Our results reveal differential dendritic integrative properties along the dorso-ventral axis, reflecting diverse computational needs.
