Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a polypeptide produced by a variety of cells of hematological, dermal and neural origin. We have investigated the effect of type I diabetes mellitus and insulin treatment on tissue levels of IL-1 beta using streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mouse as an animal model. Diabetes affected IL-1 beta in a tissue specific manner. For example, IL-1 beta levels (as measured by ELISA) were markedly decreased in the liver and spleen of the STZ diabetic mice. In contrast, the levels of this cytokine remained unalatered in other tissues including kidney, testis, hippocampus and pituitary. Insulin treatment restored the diabetes-related decreases in liver and spleen IL-1 beta levels. Overall, the present data suggest that the abnormalities in hepatic and splenic IL-1 beta levels may contribute, at least in part, to the immunodeficiency and increased susceptibility to infection in diabetes mellitus.
