Combining the techniques of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and mass spectrometry, we unambiguously identified the trace metals Cu, Zn, Fe, Pb, Mn, Co, and Mg in the brain of a female human who had no evidence of any pathologic disease in the central nervous system, and in brains from mouse, rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. These trace metals were also found in anatomic regions of human brain: cortex (gray), cortex (white), caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus, and in anatomic regions of rat brain: hypothalamus, cerebellum, stem striatum, and "the rest." The metals were characterized from the color and Rf values of their tetraphenylporphyrin chelates on TLC and from the mass and pattern of molecule ion cluster of the mass spectrum. The unexpected presence of lead in the brain is discussed.
