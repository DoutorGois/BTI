The experiments on white outbred male rats with cobalt-induced epileptogenic focus in the left sensomotor cortical region showed that the anticonvulsant effect of carbamazepine (20 mg/kg) depends on the functional state of the epileptic system (ES). In various stages of the ES development, the drug effect is related to the influence upon the determinant focus generating the epileptic activity. In the initial stage, carbamazepine primarily affects epileptic activity of the cortical foci (ipsi- and contralateral hemisphere). In the second (generalization) stage, the drug decreases the epileptic activity in all structures, but to a greater extent, in the dorsal hippocampus and lateral hypothalamus.
