Nitric oxide formed in vivo in the rat brain regions of hippocampus, striatum, neocortex and cerebellum was spin trapped and measured ex vivo by cryogenic electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In non-ischemic control animals the rate of nitric oxide (NO) formation in the individual brain regions ranged from 15 to 42 pmol.g-1.min-1. During exposure to global ischemia for 7 min the generation of NO increased in all parts of the brain. In the hippocampus the rate of NO formation during ischemia increased by 6-fold from a control rate of 19 pmol.g-1.min-1. This increase was attenuated 47% by pretreatment with the NO synthase antagonist 7-nitroindazole, whereas pretreatment with the non-NMDA receptor anatogonist NBQX and the Ca2+ channel blocker NS638 did not influence the NO formation. The data show that short-duration ischemia elicits a significant, NO-synthase-dependent formation of NO in all brain regions.
