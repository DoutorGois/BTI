A prospective study of 8,987 canine, feline, human, and other mammalian brains (and one avian brain) was undertaken. The brains were analyzed for rabies antigens; two samples were obtained from each brainstem, and one sample was obtained from each hippocampus. The samples were stained with rabies conjugate and examined by use of fluorescence microscopy. There were no false-negative results. We conclude, therefore, that postexposure rabies treatment is not requisite in all cases, provided that the fluorescent antibody test is performed without delay in a laboratory experienced with the procedure and microscopy results are fluorescent negative.
