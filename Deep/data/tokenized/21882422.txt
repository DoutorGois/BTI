One of the most characteristic features of odor memory in humans is the rather unique ability of odors to vividly trigger the evocation of emotional experiences. This property might be sustained by the direct connections established by the olfactory bulb and piriform/olfactory cortex on two structures involved in emotion and memory, namely the amygdala and hippocampus. In animals, memory for environmental odors plays a vital role because it regulates many behaviors that are crucial for survival. Highly emotional or at least particularly ethologically relevant olfactory learning occur during an animal's major life events. Moreover, conditioning procedures can be used to induce emotional olfactory learning, thus allowing an experimental approach in a laboratory environment. The aim of the present chapter is to illustrate some aspects of the neurobiology of odor emotional memory in rats, both in infancy and adulthood. We focus on fear conditioning at both developmental points, since it constitutes one of the most adapted and classical paradigms to study emotional memory in animals and has been the focus of intense investigation. We begin by reviewing the available literature describing the neural circuits involved in odor fear conditioning in adult rats, and conclude the chapter by reviewing the ontogeny of odor fear conditioning. The same experimental paradigm can be supported by overlapping but distinct neural circuits, and lead to dramatically different behavioral outcome, depending on the age at learning. This approach highlights how the fear system changes to meet the ecological demands of different life stages.
