Calcium-binding proteins calbindin D28k (CaBP) and parvalbumin (PV) were localized in neurons of the monkey hippocampal formation. CaBP immunoreactivity is present in all granule cells and in a large proportion of CA1 and CA2 pyramidal neurons, as well as in a distinct population of local circuit neurons. In the dentate gyrus, CaBP-immunoreactive nongranule cells are present in the molecular layer and in the hilar region, but they do not include the pyramidal basket cells at the hilar border. In the Ammon's horn, CaBP-positive, nonpyramidal neurons are more frequent in the CA3 area than in any other parts of the hippocampal formation. They are concentrated in the strata oriens and pyramidale of areas CA1-3, whereas only a few small neurons were found in the strata lucidum and radiatum of CA3 and in the stratum moleculare of the CA1 area. PV is exclusively present in local circuit neurons both in the dentate gyrus and in Ammon's horn. In the dentate gyrus the presumed basket cells at the hilar border exhibit PV immunoreactivity. In the hilar region and molecular layer only a relatively small number of cells are immunoreactive for PV. Most of these PV-positive cell bodies are located in the inner half of the molecular layer, with occasional horizontal cells at the hippocampal fissure. In Ammon's horn, strata oriens and pyramidale of areas CA1-3 contain a large number of PV-positive cells. There are no PV-immunoreactive cells in the strata lucidum, radiatum, or lacunosum moleculare. The CaBP- and PV-containing neurons form different subpopulations of cells in the monkey hippocampal formation. With the exception of a basket cell type in the monkey dentate gyrus, the CaBP- and PV-positive cell types were found to be remarkably similar in rodents and primates.
