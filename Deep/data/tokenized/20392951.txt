The retrosplenial cortex (RSP), a brain region frequently linked to processes of spatial navigation, contains neurons that discharge as a function of a rat's head direction (HD). HD cells have been identified throughout the limbic system including the anterodorsal thalamus (ADN) and postsubiculum (PoS), both of which are reciprocally connected to the RSP. The functional relationship between HD cells in the RSP and those found in other limbic regions is presently unknown, but given the intimate connectivity between the RSP and regions such as the ADN and PoS, and the reported loss of spatial orientation in rodents and humans with RSP damage, it is likely that the RSP plays an important role in processing the limbic HD signal. To test this hypothesis, we produced neurotoxic or electrolytic lesions of the RSP and recorded HD cells in the ADN of female Long-Evans rats. HD cells remained present in the ADN after RSP lesions, but the stability of their preferred firing directions was significantly reduced even in the presence of a salient visual landmark. Subsequent tests revealed that lesions of the RSP moderately impaired landmark control over the cells' preferred firing directions, but spared the cells directional stability when animals were required to update their orientation using self-movement cues. Together, these results suggest that the RSP plays a prominent role in processing landmark information for accurate HD cell orientation and may explain the poor directional sense in humans that follows damage to the RSP.
