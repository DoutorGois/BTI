The degree to which NMDA receptors contribute to hippocampal CA(1) stratum radiatum excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) is a matter of debate. This experiment was designed to resolve the issue by documenting and positively identifying the elements of the NMDA dependent component in the extracellularly recorded stratum radiatum CA(1) field potential under low stimulation conditions and in the presence of physiologic levels of Mg(2+). We show that EPSP generation consists of activation of both AMPA and NMDA receptor channels, which mediate distinct components of the recorded field potential. We propose that the EPSP is a combination of two waves rather than one, which sometimes has been attributed to the exclusive activation of AMPA channels. Our data suggest that the three recorded peaks signify different events. The first peak reflects the presynaptic volley while the other two represent the actual EPSP. The first peak of the EPSP is determined mainly by flow of ions through AMPA channels. The second peak most likely is determined by the concurrence of two phenomena: ionic flow through NMDA channels and the source corresponding to the sink generated at the cell bodies in the pyramidal layer. The NMDA dependent component was recorded when Mg(2+) was present in physiological concentrations. The presynaptic volley and second peak do not saturate over a 10-fold increase of the stimulation charge and their amplitudes are highly correlated. The first peak amplitude rapidly saturates. The sensitivity of the recorded signals is different, the first peak being the most sensitive (1.25-0.26 mV/nC). Isolation of NMDA dependent components under physiological conditions when using a single pulse low stimulation protocol would allow more precise investigations of the NMDA dependent forms of synaptic plasticity.
