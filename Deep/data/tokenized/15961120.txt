Pretreatment with a low dose of 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) has been shown to induce ischemic tolerance in the gerbil hippocampus. It is well known that sublethal (2-min) ischemia also induces ischemic tolerance. To investigate the acquisition of ischemic tolerance with 3-NPA, we examined the protein expression after 3-NPA treatment in comparison with sublethal ischemia. Immunohistochemical studies revealed intense expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in the hippocampal CA1 area after 3-NPA treatment. Furthermore, the time course of the expression of Bcl-xL showed a similar pattern to the acquisition of ischemic tolerance by 3-NPA treatment. The induction of Bcl-xL occurred in the hippocampal CA1 area at 24 h after 3-NPA treatment, and significant induction was observed at 48 h. Western blot analysis of hippocampus harvested 48 h after the pretreatment, showed that the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was significantly increased by either 3-NPA treatment or 2-min ischemia. However, PMCA1 and HSP70 protein expression increased only in the sublethal ischemia treated group. The difference between 3-NPA treated group and control group was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are essential for acquisition of ischemic tolerance, while HSP70 and PMCA1 play important roles in the enhancement of ischemic tolerance.
