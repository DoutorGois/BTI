Yulangsan polysaccharide (YLSP) has been utilized as a phytomedicine to managing nervous dysfunction in China. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the potential YLSP-mediated detoxification role against morphine dependence in rats. The results indicated that the morphine dependence model significantly increased withdrawal symptoms, levels of NO and NOS (P<0.05). Furthermore, monoaminergic neurotransmitters, including DA and NE, were detected at elevated levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), hippocampus (HIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), respectively, while the level of DA was decreased and NE was increased in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Conversely, YLSP administration significantly reversed naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms, expression of brain NO and NOS, and monoaminergic neurotransmitters (P<0.05). Interestingly, YLSP shows an even more effective trend in attenuating withdrawal symptoms than does clonidine, although without a significant difference. These findings indicate that YLSP attenuation of the naloxone-induced withdrawal symptoms of morphine dependence may be mediated by regulation of the NO pathway and modulation of monoaminergic neurotransmitters.
