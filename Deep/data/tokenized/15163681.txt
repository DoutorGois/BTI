Long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA1 synapses has been extensively studied, but the mechanisms responsible for its expression remain unresolved. We tested a hypothesis that there are multiple, developmentally regulated expression mechanisms by directly comparing LTP in hippocampal slices obtained from rats of two ages. At postnatal day 12 (P12), LTP was fully accounted for by an increase in potency (mean amplitude of responses excluding failures). This was associated with either an increase in AMPA receptor single-channel conductance (gamma) or no change in gamma, suggesting an increase in the number of AMPA receptors. At P6, LTP was explained by an additional two mechanisms. In the majority of neurons, LTP was associated with an increase in success rate and a decrease in paired-pulse facilitation. In the remaining neurons, LTP was attributable to an increase in potency. However, in contrast to P12 neurons, the potency increase was associated with a decrease in gamma, suggesting the insertion of receptors with lower gamma. We conclude that there are multiple expression mechanisms for LTP at CA1 synapses that are developmentally regulated. These findings suggest that a single class of synapse uses a number of different molecular mechanisms to produce long-term changes in synaptic strength.
