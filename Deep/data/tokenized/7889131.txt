Hilus lesion-induced recurrent limbic seizures cause a dramatic increase in the numbers of somatic spines on dentate gyrus granule cells in the adult rat. Somatic spines are maximally increased 3 h after the initiation of seizures at which time many of these spines form synapses. The present quantitative electron microscopic study assessed the numbers and types of synapses present on the granule cell perikarya and somatic spines of control and experimental seizure rats with the goal of determining if newly elaborated somatic spines arise at the site of pre-existing synapses or are associated with new innervation. Experimental rats were sacrificed 5 h after hilar lesion placement (or 3 h after seizure onset). In both control and hilus-lesioned (HL) rats, 15-20% of the somatic spines could be seen to form synaptic contacts within a single plane of section; these synapses were almost exclusively of the asymmetric type. With the increased incidence of spines in experimental-seizure rats, there was a 6.25-fold greater number of spine synapses in HL versus control rats. There was, in addition, a 60% decrease in the number of asymmetric synapses occurring directly on the granule cell perikarya but no change in the total (spine plus somatic) number of asymmetric synapses. Although few asymmetric synapses were associated with spines in control tissue, 60-70% of asymmetric synapses were associated with spines in experimental-seizure tissue. In addition, in hilus lesion rats symmetric somatic synapses were increased by 20% on cells in deep stratum granulosum resulting in a dissolution of the superficial-to-deep innervation gradient present in the untreated rat. These findings support the conclusion that spines induced by seizure activity form at the site of pre-existing asymmetric synapses on the granule cells and demonstrate that brief seizure episodes can rapidly induce marked changes in innervation patterns in the adult brain.
