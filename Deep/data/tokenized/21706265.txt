Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. The goal of stroke rehabilitation is to improve recovery in the years after a stroke and to decrease long-term disability. This article, titled "Rehabilitation--Emerging Technologies, Innovative Therapies, and Future Objectives" gives evidence-based information on the type of rehabilitation approaches that are effective to improve functional mobility and to address cognitive impairments. We review the importance of taking a translational approach to neurorehabilitation, considering the interaction of motor and cognitive systems, skilled learned purposeful limb movement, and spatial navigation ability. Known biologic mechanisms of neurorecovery are targeted in relation to technology implemented by members of the multidisciplinary team. Results from proof-of-concept, within subjects, and randomized controlled trials are presented, and the implications for optimal stroke rehabilitation strategies are discussed. Developing clinical practices are highlighted and future research directions are proposed with goals to provide insight on what the next steps are for this burgeoning discipline.
