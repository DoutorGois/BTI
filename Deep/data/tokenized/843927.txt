Slices from rat hippocampus, striatum or cortex were incubated with l mum [3H] choline and following 75 min superfusion with Krebs solution the efflux of radioactivity was measured. The slices were stimulated either electrically (1 Hz) or with 25 mM potassium and the rate constant of the evoked release and the size of the releasable pool were estimated. The spontaneous efflux of radioactivity and the releasable pool but not the rate of evoked release correlated with the reported endogenous ACh content of the 3 areas. Raised potassium released radioactivity at a lower rate but from a larger pool than electrical stimulation from all 3 areas. In all 3 areas atropine alone potentiated while physostigmine, oxotremorine and carbamylcholine decreased the rate of evoked release. This depression was fully antagonized by atropine. The drugs had no effect on the size of the releasable pool. Findings suggest that muscarinic receptors located on cholinergic axons or terminals have a physiological role in the autoregulation of ACh release from these 3 areas.
