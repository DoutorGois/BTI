This study investigates the relationship between hippocampal volume and seizure control following temporal lobectomy in patients with volumetrically symmetric hippocampi. Forty-six patients who underwent temporal lobectomy for nonlesional temporal-lobe-onset seizures, and in whom the volumes of the two hippocampi were roughly equal (ie, the difference of the right minus the left hippocampal volume fell between -0.1 and 0.3 cm3), were included. We graded postoperative seizure control on a four-point scale according to criteria defined by Engel. We found no relationship between the hippocampal sum (sum of the right plus left hippocampal volumes normalized for cranial size) and operative outcome. A satisfactory operative outcome is possible in patients with bilaterally symmetric mesial temporal sclerosis by MRI criteria.
