A 31-year old man with chicken-pox encephalitis presented with a cerebellar syndrome and disorders of memory. The latter consisted of severe anterograde amnesia with normal retrograde memory, without confabulation or anosognosia. This suggested that the hippocampus was involved, probably functionally, since the outcome was rapidly favourable and the MRI was normal.
