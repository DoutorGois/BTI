Previous studies have shown that acute ethanol administration induces expression of c-Fos immunoreactivity in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CNA) [S.L. Chang, N.A. Patel, A.A. Romero, Activation and desensitization of Fos immunoreactivity in the rat brain following ethanol administration, Brain Res., 679 (1995) 89-98; M. Morales, J.R. Criado, P.P. Sanna, S.J. Henriksen, F.E. Bloom, Acute ethanol induces c-fos immunoreactivity in GABAergic neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala, Brain Res., 798 (1998) 333-336; A.E. Ryabinin, J.R. Criado, S.J. Henriksen, F.E. Bloom, M.C. Wilson, Differential sensitivity of c-Fos expression in hippocampus and other brain regions to moderate and low doses of alcohol, Mol. Psychiatry, 2 (1997) 32-43]. We recently showed that over 70% of these c-Fos immunoreactive neurons are GABAergic [M. Morales, J.R. Criado, P.P. Sanna, S.J. Henriksen, F.E. Bloom, Acute ethanol induces c-fos immunoreactivity in GABAergic neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala, Brain Res, 798 (1998) 333-336]. In the present study, we report that ethanol-induced c-Fos immunoreactivity was mainly confined to neurons that express pro-enkephalin (ENK). In contrast, a small number of c-Fos immunoreactive neurons express corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Our results thus provide anatomical evidence indicating that within the amygdala, GABAergic neurons that contain ENK are responsive to acute ethanol exposure.
