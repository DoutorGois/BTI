Minocycline has been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effects in various experimental models. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of minocycline on cell injury induced by the inhalation of the anesthetic, sevoflurane. In our in vivo experiments using rats, minocycline attenuated sevoflurane-induced neuronal degeneration and apoptosis in the rat hippocampus, and this effect was associated with the minocycline-mediated suppression of oxidative stress in the hippocampus. In in vitro experiments, minocycline inhibited sevoflurane-induced apoptosis and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in H4 human neuroglioma cells. In addition, minocycline suppressed the sevoflurane-induced upregulation of interleukin (IL)-6 and the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway in H4 cells. Furthermore, we found that nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), an activator of the stress response, was upregulated and activated upon sevoflurane treatment both in the rat hippocampus and in H4 cells. In addition, minocycline further augmented the upregulation and activation of Nrf2 when used in conjunction with sevoflurane. Moreover, the knockdown of Nrf2 in H4 cells by small interfering RNA (siRNA) diminished the cytoprotective effect of minocycline, and attenuated the inhibitory effect of minocycline on ROS production, IL-6 upregulation and the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. On the whole, our findings indicate that minocycline may exert protective effects against sevoflurane-induced cell injury via the Nrf2-modulated antioxidant response and the inhibition of the activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
