Multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected in senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT). Among them, acetylcholine has been most studied. It is now well accepted that the activity of the enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) is much decreased in various brain regions including the frontal and temporal cortices, hippocampus and nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbm) in SDAT. Cortical M2-muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic receptors are also decreased but only in a certain proportion (30-40%) of SDAT patients. For other systems, it appears that cortical serotonin (5-HT)-type 2 receptor binding sites are decreased in SDAT. This diminution in 5-HT2 receptors correlates well with the decreased levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactive materials found in the cortex of SDAT patients. Cortical somatostatin receptor binding sites are decreased in about one third of SDAT patients. Finally, neuropeptide Y and neuropeptide Y receptor binding sites are distributed in areas enriched in cholinergic cell bodies and nerve fiber terminals and it would be of interest to determine possible involvement of this peptide in SDAT. Thus, it appears that multi-drug clinical trials should be considered for the treatment of SDAT.
