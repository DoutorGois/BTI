Transplants of the embryonic locus coeruleus (LC) region were implanted into the circuity of the hippocampal formation in adult rats in which the normal adrenergic afferents to the hippocampus had been removed. The growth of new adrenergic axons from the implant in the denervated hippocampus was followed for 1-14 months after surgery by means of fluorescence histochemistry, and the function of the implant-hippocampal connections was tested electrophysiologically after 2-3 months survival. In the successful cases the entire hippocampal formation was reinnervated from the LC implant within 3-6 months after operation, and the newly formed innervation still persisted unchanged by 14 months. The reinnervation was equally effective irrespective of the route by which the axons entered the hippocampus, i.e. along the lesioned fornix-fimbria or along a retrosplenial route. The pattern formed by the ingrowing LC axons mimicked to a large extent that of the normal LC afferents. Little growth was seen into denervated terminal fields of the commissural, septal or entorhinal afferents, pointing to a preference of the ingrowing LC fibers for the areas normally innervated by adrenergic afferents. In the electrophysiological experiments, stimulation of the LC implants caused (in 20 out of 29 cells monitored) an inhibition of the spontaneous activity of neurons in the host hippocampus. This inhibition had a relatively long latency and a long duration, similar to that observed after stimulation of the innate LC in the intact rat. As in the normal rat, the inhibitory responses were blocked by systemic or local application of the beta-adrenergic receptor blockers propranolol or sotalol. It is concluded that the adult rat brain is capable of carrying out all steps involved in correct functional reinnervation of a denervated region. Moreover, the implant-hippocampal preparation should be a highly suitable model system for functional studies of a central noradrenergic connection.
