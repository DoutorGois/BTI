Perturbations of brain energy metabolism are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) is a master energy sensor that monitors the levels of key energy metabolites. Electroacupuncture (EA) has demonstrated therapeutic potential for the treatment of AD. The effects of EA on cognitive functions and the changes of AMPK and its phosphorylated form (p-AMPK) expression were investigated in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. Cognitive function of SAMP8 mice was assessed using Morris water maze test after EA treatment. Then mice were sacrificed for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. EA stimulation significantly alleviated memory impairment of AD mice, and increased the levels of p-AMPK in the hippocampus. These results suggest that EA improved cognitive function associated with AMPK activation, AMPK may be a molecular target of EA in treating AD.
