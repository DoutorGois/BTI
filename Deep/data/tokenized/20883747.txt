New granule cells are continuously generated throughout adulthood in the mammalian hippocampus. These newly generated neurons become functionally integrated into existing hippocampal neuronal networks, such as those that support retrieval of remote spatial memory. Here, we sought to examine whether the contribution of newly born neurons depends on the type of learning and memory task in mice. To do so, we reduced neurogenesis with a cytostatic agent and examined whether depletion of young hippocampal neurons affects learning and/or memory in two hippocampal-dependent tasks (spatial navigation in the Morris water maze and object location test) and two hippocampal-independent tasks (cued navigation in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition). Double immunohistofluorescent labeling of the birth dating marker 5-bromo-2'deoxyuridine (BrdU) together with NeuN, a neuron specific marker, was employed to quantify reduction of hippocampal neurogenesis. We found that depletion of young adult-generated neurons alters recent and remote memory in spatial tasks but spares non-spatial tasks. Our findings provide additional evidence that generation of new cells in the adult brain is crucial for hippocampal-dependent cognitive functions.
