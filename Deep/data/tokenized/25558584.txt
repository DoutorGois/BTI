OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the relationship between MRI findings and clinical features in patients with hypothalamic hamartoma (HH). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MRI and clinical data (mental retardation, precocious puberty, behavioral problems, and epilepsy) in six patients (3 males and 3 females, ages 12 to 26) with HH. Based on the MRI classification by Arita, HH was classified into two types: parahypothalamic (P) and intrahypothalamic (I). RESULTS: Only one patient was classified as having P-type HH and five were classified as having I-type HH. The patient with P-type HH (diameter 21 mm) showed precocious puberty and mild behavioral problems, but did not developed epilepsy. On the other hand, all patients with I-type HH (diameter 10-32 mm, median 17 mm) developed epilepsy and behavioral problems. Except for one patient, who had the smallest sized HH, I-type four patients developed mental retardation and precocious puberty. Among patients with I-type HH, the size of the tumor was inversely correlated with the age at epilepsy onset and with the degree of mental retardation (DQ/IQ). CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that the MRI classification by Arita, when combined with tumor size, might be helpful in predicting the clinical manifestations in patients with HH.
