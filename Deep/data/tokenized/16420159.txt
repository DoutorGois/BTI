Male Long-Evans rats were injected with 32 ng/mul of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) or vehicle and trained to locate a hidden platform in a different location (reversal training) than used on the initial 4 days of training. Rats treated with vehicle or CPP into the dorsal hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, or mediodorsal striatum had similar latencies to locate the platform on the reversal day. Rats infused with CPP into the dorsal hippocampus or mediodorsal striatum failed to search preferentially in the novel location during a 24-hr, drug-free retention test, whereas all other groups searched preferentially in this location. Therefore, blocking dorsal hippocampal or mediodorsal striatal NMDA receptors selectively blocked long-term spatial retention without producing short-term performance deficits.
