In order to study the molecular mechanism of the selective vulnerability in central nervous system, the expression and distribution of hsp70 and BCL-2 gene were detected by using Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization and histochemistry method in transient forebrain ischemia and reperfusion rats. It was found that hsp70 gene expression occurred and the synthesis of BCL-2 protein was inhibited in hippocampalCA1 region vulnerable to ischemia, while BCL-2 protein was stained strongly and the signals of hsp70 were not observed in CA3 region resistant to ischemia. The results indicate that the expression of hsp70 gene may be not only as a marker for neuron ischemia, but also play a protective role in the neuronal injury. BCL-2, meanwhile, may have neuro-protective effect on the ischemic neurons.
