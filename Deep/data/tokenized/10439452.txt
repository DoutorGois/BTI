The present study describes the effects of intraseptal infusions of 1 nmol AMPA and 12 nmol NBQX on both frequency and amplitude of physostigmine-induced theta rhythm in urethane-anesthetized rats. Infusion of AMPA increased the theta frequency. This effect was blocked by a prior infusion of NBQX. Infusion of NBQX decreased the theta amplitude, and this effect was not altered by AMPA. These results suggest that the septal AMPA/glutamate receptors exert subtle modulatory influences on septohippocampal cells involved in theta rhythm generation.
