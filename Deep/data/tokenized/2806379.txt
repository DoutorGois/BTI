We have determined the antagonist affinity of hexahydrodifenidol in a range of receptor assays in the rat:-radioreceptor binding and phosphatidyl-inositol turnover assays in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and electrophysiological experiments on the superior cervical ganglion and hippocampus. We failed to detect any appreciable differences in the affinity of hexahydrodifenidol among any of these assays.
