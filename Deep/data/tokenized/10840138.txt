Neuropeptide Y (NPY), has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and the mechanisms of action of electroconvulsive treatment (ECT). In this series of experiments, we explored whether there are differences between Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, an animal model of depression, and controls, Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) in (1) baseline brain NPY-LI concentrations, (2) effects of ECS on locomotion and brain neuropeptides, (3) amphetamine effects on behavior, and (4) effects of ECS pretreatment on subsequent effects of amphetamine on behavior. Both strains were divided into two groups, receiving eight ECS or ShamECS. Twenty-four hours after the last session, animals were habituated in activity boxes for 45 min before given d-amphetamine (1.5 mg.kg(-1), subcutaneously) or vehicle. Locomotor activity was then recorded for an additional 45 min. Twenty-four hours later, rats were sacrificed by microwave irradiation, the brains dissected into frontal cortex, occipital cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum, and the neuropeptides extracted and measured by radioimmunoassay. No differences between FSL and FRL rats in baseline locomotor activity were found. FSL compared to FRL animals showed a significantly larger locomotion increase following saline and a significantly smaller increase following amphetamine. ECS pretreatment significantly decreased the saline effects on locomotion in the FSL and the amphetamine effects in the FRL rats. 'Baseline' NPY-like immunoreactivity (LI) concentrations were lower in the hippocampus of the 'depressed' rats. ECS increased NPY-LI in frontal cortex, occipital cortex and hippocampus of both strains. The hippocampal NPY-LI increase was significantly larger in the FSL compared to FRL animals.
