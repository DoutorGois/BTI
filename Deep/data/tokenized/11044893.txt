Fluoxetine (FLU) rapidly enhances extracellular (EC) serotonin (5-HT) in rodent brain, whereas the antidepressant effects of this drug in humans are typically not observed for 2-3 weeks. Thus, the effects of chronic oral FLU administration on neocortical and hippocampal EC 5-HT, and on caudate EC 5-HT and dopamine (DA), were examined in awake monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) using in vivo microdialysis (10.0 mg/kg; 3, 7, 14, and 21 days). On day 3, 5-HT was significantly increased above baseline levels in hippocampus (HC) and caudate. There was a trend for an increase in neocortex EC 5-HT levels. However, by day 7 5-HT remained significantly elevated only in HC, although 5-HT levels elsewhere had not completely returned to baseline. In contrast, levels of the 5-HT metabolite, 5-HIAA, were significantly reduced in all brain regions at all time points. Caudate DA levels tended to be decreased throughout FLU treatment. Local FLU and K(+) infusion were also used at various times during chronic systemic FLU administration to evaluate changes in functional synaptic regulation. In general, these results, along with the significant decrease in 5-HIAA levels and the tendency for basal EC 5-HT levels to remain modestly elevated only in HC during sustained FLU administration, suggest a reduction in releasable pools of 5-HT. Taken together with the trend for a decrease in caudate EC DA levels, these results do not appear to support the current hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action of SSRI antidepressants-that monoaminergic neurotransmission is progressively augmented during chronic treatment.
