This article summarizes the results of studies concerning the influence of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on the hippocampal theta rhythm. Temporary VTA inactivation resulted in transient loss of the hippocampal theta. Permanent destruction of the VTA caused a long-lasting depression of the power of the theta and it also had some influence on the frequency of the rhythm. Activation of glutamate (GLU) receptors or decrease of GABAergic tonus in the VTA led to enhancement of dopamine release and increased hippocampal theta power. High time and frequency cross-correlation was detected for the theta band between the VTA and hippocampus during paradoxical sleep and active waking. Thus, the VTA may belong to the broad network involved in theta rhythm regulation. This article also presents a model of brainstem-VTA-hippocampal interactions in the induction of the hippocampal theta rhythm. The projections from the VTA which enhance theta rhythm are incorporated into the main theta generation pathway, in which the septum acts as the central node. The neuronal activity that may be responsible for the ability of the VTA to regulate theta probably derives from the structures associated with rapid eye movement (sleep) (REM) sleep or with sensorimotor activity (i.e., mainly from the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei and also from the raphe).
