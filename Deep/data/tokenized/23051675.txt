We investigated the effects of minocycline, a microglia suppressant, on olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rats, a model of cognitive and behavioral impairments arising from neurodegenerative processes. Previously, we demonstrated that the major OBX-induced behavioral and cognitive impairments develop between day 3 and 7 following bulbectomy. Here we show that the onset of these cognitive changes parallel in time with signs of microglia activation (increased mRNA levels of IL-1beta and CD68) in hippocampus. Next, rats were treated with minocycline (50mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 4 weeks. OBX surgery was done at day 3 of drug treatment. Animals were tested in a battery of behavioral assays: open field, passive avoidance (fear learning and memory-acquired prior to OBX) and T-maze (spatial memory, conducted post bulbectomy). Minocycline normalized OBX-induced hyperactivity in the open field. Minocycline failed to prevent fear memory loss, but protected the OBX rats against hippocampal-dependent spatial memory deficit. Our findings suggest that treatment with minocycline may be effective in the early phase of a neurodegenerative disease.
