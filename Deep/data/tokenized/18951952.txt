Neuronal death during brain aging results, at least in part, from the disruption of synaptic connectivity caused by oxidative stress. Synaptic elimination might be caused by increased instability of the neuronal processes. In vitro evidence shows that melatonin increases MAP-2 expression, a protein that improves the stability of the dendritic cytoskeleton, opening the possibility that melatonin could prevent synaptic elimination by increasing dendritic stability. One way to begin exploring this issue in vivo is to evaluate whether long-term melatonin treatment changes the intensity of MAP-2 immuno-staining in areas commonly afflicted by aging that are rich in dendritic processes. Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of administering melatonin for 6 or 12 months on the intensity of MAP-2 immuno-staining in the strata oriens and lucidum of the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 fields of aging male rats, through semi-quantitative densitometry. Melatonin treated rats showed a relative increment in the intensity of MAP-2 immuno-staining in both regions after 6 or 12 months of treatment, as compared with age matched control rats. Although melatonin untreated and treated rats showed a decrease of MAP-2 immuno-staining in the hippocampus with increasing age, such decrement was less pronounced following melatonin treatment. These findings were confirmed by qualitative Western blot analyses. The melatonin effect seems specific because MAP-2 staining in the primary somatosensory cortex was not affected by the treatment. Thus, chronic melatonin administration increases MAP-2 immuno-staining and attenuates its decay in the adult aging hippocampus. These results are compatible with the idea that melatonin could improve dendritic stability and thus diminish synaptic elimination in the aging brain.
