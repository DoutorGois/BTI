Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated cation channels composed of alpha and beta subunits. nAChR subunit expression is highly regulated during development. Previous studies have revealed increased expression of alpha3, alpha5, alpha7, and beta4 subunit mRNAs and alpha7 binding sites during hippocampal and cortical development. Here, we examined the expression of alpha2 subunit mRNA in rat cortex and hippocampus using highly sensitive radioactive in situ hybridization. alpha2 Subunit mRNA expression was first detected at P3 in cortex and hippocampus. During postnatal development the distribution of alpha2 subunit mRNA expression was spatially similar to the one found in adult, exhibiting highly restricted expression in scattered cells mostly in cortical layer V and retrosplenial cortex, and in scattered cells in CA1/CA3 stratum oriens and CA3 stratum radiatum. However, the expression intensity and number of alpha2 positive cells strongly increased to reach peak levels in both cortex and hippocampus at P7 and decreased thereafter to moderate to low to levels. Double in situ hybridization revealed that most, but not all, alpha2 mRNA expression was located in non-pyramidal GAD-positive cortical and hippocampal interneurons. Thus, similar to other nAChR subunits, alpha2 mRNA expression is transiently upregulated during postnatal development and nAChRs containing alpha2 subunits could regulate GABAergic activity during a critical period of network formation.
