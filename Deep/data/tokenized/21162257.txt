AIM: To study the protection mechanisms of K(ATP) channels on hippocampal CA1 neurons during chronic severe hypoxia. METHODS: p53 expression, DNA fraction, and cell apoptosis were examined in cultured hippocampal neurons in control group, hypoxia group, hypoxia group treated with K(ATP) channels antagonist and hypoxia group treated with K(ATP) channels agonist. RESULTS: In the group of a 12 h long exposure to oxygen concentration of 0%, diazoxide (100 micromol/L), the K(ATP) channels agonist, reduced p53 expression and the hypoxia-induced apoptosis. In contrast, tolbutamide (100 micromol/L), the K(ATP) channels antagonist, significantly rose p53 expression and the hypoxia-induced apoptosis, which could be reversed by p53 inhibitor TSA. CONCLUSION: K(ATP) channels protect hippocampal neurons against chronic severe hypoxia by suppressing p53 expression.
