Manually annotating images for multi-atlas segmentation is an expensive and often limiting factor in reliable automated segmentation of large databases. Segmentation methods requiring only a proportion of each atlas image to be labelled could potentially reduce the workload on expert raters tasked with labelling images. However, exploiting such a database of partially labelled atlases is not possible with state-of-the-art multi-atlas segmentation methods. In this paper we revisit the problem of multi-atlas segmentation and formulate its solution in terms of graph-labelling. Our graphical approach uses a Markov Random Field (MRF) formulation of the problem and constructs a graph connecting atlases and the target image. This provides a unifying framework for label propagation. More importantly, the proposed method can be used for segmentation using only partially labelled atlases. We furthermore provide an extension to an existing continuous MRF optimisation method to solve the proposed problem formulation. We show that the proposed method, applied to hippocampal segmentation of 202 subjects from the ADNI database, remains robust and accurate even when the proportion of manually labelled slices in the atlases is reduced to 20%.
