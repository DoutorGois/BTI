In transverse hippcampus slices a short period of hypoxia/hypoglycemia induced by perfusion with O(2)/glucose-free medium caused early loss and incomplete restoration of evoked field potentials to only 50% in the CA(1) region. We report about a study investigating the effect of an ethanolic Gynostemma pentaphyllum extract in this system. When given with reperfusion the extract completely protected the cells of the slices from functional injury. The extract also protected at the subcellular level isolated mitochondria which had been subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation in combination with elevated extramitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration from functional injury. In isolated mitochondria the extract protected from Ca(2+)-induced opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and reduced lipid peroxidation. Our data demonstrate that the ethanolic extract of Gynostemma pentaphyllum has a high potential to protect from ischemia/reperfusion injury. It should be beneficial as prophylactic nutrition supplement and during revascularization of arterial blood vessels from stroke and other ischemic events such as coronary occlusion.
