We investigated the role of PDZ proteins (GRIP, ABP, and PICK1) interacting with the C-terminal GluR2 by infusing a ct-GluR2 peptide ("pep2-SVKI") into CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices using whole-cell recordings. Pep2-SVKI, but not a control or PICK1 selective peptide, caused AMPAR-mediated EPSC amplitude to increase in approximately one-third of control neurons and in most neurons following the prior induction of LTD. Pep2-SVKI also blocked LTD; however, this occurred in all neurons. A PKC inhibitor prevented these effects of pep2-SVKI on synaptic transmission and LTD. We propose a model in which the maintenance of LTD involves the binding of AMPARs to PDZ proteins to prevent their reinsertion. We also present evidence that PKC regulates AMPAR reinsertion during dedepression.
