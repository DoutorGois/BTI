We investigated and compared the toxicity profile, as well as possible neuroprotective effects, of some antiepileptic drugs in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We used two novel carbamazepine derivatives, (S)-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b, f]azepine-5-carboxamide (BIA 2-093) and 10, 11-dihydro-10-hydroxyimino-5H-dibenz[b,f]azepine-5-carboxamide (BIA 2-024), and compared their effects with the established compounds carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. The assessment of neuronal injury was made by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl (MTT) assay, as well as by analysing morphology and nuclear chromatin condensation (propidium iodide staining), after hippocampal neurons were exposed to the drugs for 24 h. The putative antiepileptic drugs, BIA 2-093 or BIA 2-024 (at 300 microM), only slightly decreased MTT reduction, whereas carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine were much more toxic at lower concentrations. Treatment with the antiepileptic drugs caused nuclear chromatin condensation in some neurons, which is characteristic of apoptosis, and increased the activity of caspase-3-like enzymes, mainly in neurons treated with carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine. The toxic effect caused by carbamazepine was not mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors. Moreover, the antiepileptic drugs failed to protect hippocampal neurons from the toxicity caused by kainate, veratridine, or ischaemia-like conditions.
