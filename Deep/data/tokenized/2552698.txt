On Wistar rats characteristics were studied of investigating behaviour in the open field, of learning of conditioned food-reinforced reaction and also of BA and their metabolites content in various brain structures under local intracerebral injections of specific neurotoxins; 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), abolishing correspondingly catecholaminergic and serotoninergic terminals. Bilateral injection of 6-OHDA in the neocortex led to a weakening of rats investigating activity in the open field and to an increase of the time of fulfillment of the forming of conditioned food-reinforced reaction. Administration of 5,7-DHT was accompanied by an increase of the investigating behaviour in the open field and a reduction of the duration of the forming of conditioned reaction. Administration of 6-OHDA to the neocortex caused a lowering of catecholamines level in the frontal area of the neocortex and the hippocampus. Analogous administration of 5,7-DHT elicited simultaneously with a deep level lowering of 5-HT and its metabolite in these structures, a change of catecholamines content which testifies to a lesser specificity of the neurotoxin 5,7-DHT in comparison with 6-OHDA. Structures lesion of serotoninergic and catecholaminergic systems of the frontal cortex and the hippocampus brought about by a local administration of 6-OHDA and 5,7-DHT in the neocortex was accompanied by differently directed changes in animals behaviour.
