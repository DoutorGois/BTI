We examined the effects of continuous infusion of exendin (5-39), an antagonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, into the rat brain using a mini-osmotic pump on beta-amyloid protein-induced amnesia and apoptosis. Co-infusion of exendin (5-39) with beta-amyloid protein (1-40) prevented the memory impairment and DNA fragmentation in the hippocampal CA1 region observed with infusion of beta-amyloid protein alone. These results indicated a functional role of endogenous GLP-1 in beta-amyloid protein-induced neurotoxicity.
