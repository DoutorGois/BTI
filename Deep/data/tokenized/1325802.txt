Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a moderate level (2.2 atm) of traumatic brain injury (TBI) using fluid percussion. Injured animals were allowed to survive posttrauma for periods of 5 min, 3 h, and 24 h. The effect of TBI on binding to forebrain opiate receptors was assessed using quantitative receptor autoradiography, and compared to a sham control group. Binding of [3H]DAGO to mu receptors in neocortex and the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus was significantly decreased in the 24-h group (p less than 0.05). [3H]Bremazocine binding to kappa receptors was unchanged at 5 min and 24 h, but showed large decreases 3 h after TBI in the CA1 pyramidal layer (65%, p less than 0.05) and dentate gyrus (43%, p less than 0.05). Levels of delta binding (measured with [3H]DSLET) and lambda binding (measured with [3H]naloxone) were unaffected by TBI. These data support previous suggestions of a role for endogenous opioids in TBI, and provide further evidence that mu and kappa opioid receptor subtypes in neocortex and hippocampus may have different functions in TBI.
