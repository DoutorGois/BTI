In the experiments on 300 rats it was established that morphine (5 mg/kg) and galantamine (0.5 mg/kg) exert the normalizing effect on the higher nervous activity in rats during the postoperative period. It is correlated with an increase of Pa,K-ATP activity of the cerebral hemispheric cortex. Administration of piracetam (200 mg/kg) following the previous laparotomy aggravates disturbances of the higher nervous activity occurring after the operative injury and decreases Mg-ATP activity of the cortex of the cerebral hemispheres and hippocampus.
