The authors detected LH--RH-containing neurons in the dorsal part of the hippocampus and in the indusium griseum of the rat. LH--RH-containing nerve fibres interconnect the organum subfornicale (OSF) and the dorsal hippocampus. Axons leaving the OSF can be traced backwards, then around the splenium of the corpus callosum, from where they run forwards in the stria longitudinalis medialis (SLM). LH--RH fibres of the SLM give axon collaterals to the cingulate cortex, then intermingle with the LH--RH system of the septum pellucidum. Following coronal transection of the SLM, it could be determined that LH--RH fibres form bidirectional connection between the septum and different regions of the hippocampus.
