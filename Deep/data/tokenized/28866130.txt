Depression is commonly associated with hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction that primarily manifests as aberrant glucocorticoid secretion. Glucocorticoids act on Type I mineralocorticoid (MR) and Type II glucocorticoid receptors (GR) to modulate mood and endocrine responses. Successful antidepressant treatment normalizes HPA axis function, in part due to modulatory effects on MR and GR in cortico-limbic structures. Although women are twice as likely to suffer from depression, little is known about how antidepressants modulate brain, endocrine, and behavioral stress responses in females. Here, we assessed the impact of CORT118335 (GR modulator/MR antagonist) and imipramine (tricyclic antidepressant) on neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to restraint or forced swim stress (FST) in female rats (n=10-12/group). Increased immobility CORT118335 in the FST is purported to reflect passive coping or depression-like behavior. CORT118335 dampened adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone responses to the FST, but did not affect immobility. Imipramine suppressed ACTH, but had minimal effects on corticosterone responses to FST. Despite these marginal effects, imipramine decreased immobility, suggesting antidepressant efficacy. In an effort to link brain-endocrine responses with behavior, c-Fos was assessed in HPA axis and mood modulatory regions in response to the FST. CORT118335 upregulated c-Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Imipramine decreased c-Fos in the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3), but increased c-Fos in the central amygdala. These data suggest the antidepressant-like (e.g., active coping) properties of imipramine may be due to widespread effects on cortico-limbic circuits that regulate emotional and cognitive processes.
