The adequate histochemical demonstration of adenylate cyclase still involves serious methodical problems (low basal activity, fixation procedures, heavy metal ions as capture agents etc.). We have tried to revise fixation approach and composition of incubation medium in order to specify the mode of demonstration of the enzyme. The influence of strontium and barium (instead of lead) as well as dithiothreitole and sodium fluoride on the survive of adenylate cyclase activity was studied using a radiochemical model system.
