The supramammillary neurons projecting directly to the hippocampus or indirectly via the septum participate in the regulation of hippocampal theta activity. Inputs to the supramammillary nucleus are only partly specified neurochemically. Glutamate appears to be an excitatory transmitter in this cell group, however, the origin of the glutamatergic afferents is unknown. The present investigations were devoted to study this question. The transmitter-selective [(3)H]D-aspartate retrograde transport method was used injecting the tracer into the lateral subregion of the nucleus. The radioactive tracer was visualized by autoradiography. Non-selective retrograde tracing experiments were also performed for reference injecting wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated colloidal gold into the same supramammillary region. Retrogradely radiolabelled neurons in various numbers were detected in several brain regions including medial septum-diagonal band complex, lateral septum, rostral part of medial and lateral preoptic areas, lateral habenula, ventral premammillary nucleus, apical subregion of interpeduncular nucleus, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and dorsal and median raphe nuclei. Radiolabelled neurons in the mentioned raphe nuclei were serotonin-immunonegative. In the non-selective retrograde tracing experiments combined with immunocytochemistry, about 50% of the retrogradely labelled neurons in the raphe nuclei was serotonin-immunonegative, showing that not only serotonergic raphe neurons project to the supramammillary nucleus. The findings indicate that a significant part of the afferents from telencephalic, diencephalic and brainstem regions to the supramammillary nucleus may contain glutamate/aspartate as neurotransmitter. The most important functional implications of these observations concern the role of the supramammillary nucleus in controlling the electrical activity of the hippocampus, and in particular the generation and maintenance of the theta rhythm.
