The present study assessed the effects of 2-, 3-, and 4-methylpyridine on rat hippocampal slice excitability. Tests of excitatory and inhibitory systems in area CA1 of the hippocampal slice were conducted over a period of 3 h postexposure. Following exposures of 100 microM 2-, 3-, or 4-methylpyridine, evoked population excitatory postsynaptic potential and population spike responses recorded in the cell body field of hippocampal area CA1 were slowly suppressed over the course of 3 h, whereas no effects on local inhibitory processes or latency of evoked responses were detected. No significant differences were observed between agents.
