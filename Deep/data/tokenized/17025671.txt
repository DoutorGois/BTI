Synchronization of the coupled neuronal oscillators with multiple connections of different coupling nature is analyzed using the phase-model reduction method. Each coupling connection contributes to the dynamic behavior of the system in a complex nonlinear fashion. In the phase-model scheme, the contribution of the individual connections can be separated in terms of the effective coupling functions associated with each connection and a linear superposition of them provides the total effective coupling of the coupled system. The case of multiple connections with various conduction time delays is also examined, which is shown to be capable of promoting synchronization over an ensemble of spatially distributed neuronal oscillators in an efficient way.
