Investigations into the anatomical substrate of temporal lobe epilepsy have yielded a number of important observations regarding the involvement of the piriform and perirhinal cortical areas in temporal lobe seizure propagation. Although early reports indirectly suggested that the circuits of the piriform cortex might act as a critical conduit for limbic seizure discharges to access motor systems, recent reports more strongly implicate the perirhinal cortex in this process. In the following report, we provide a brief summary of the earlier work involving the piriform cortex and its potential involvement in kindled limbic seizures. This is followed then by the results of several recent in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological studies that ascribe a critical importance for the perirhinal cortex in convulsive limbic seizures. Finally, since our anatomical studies indicated that the perirhinal cortex densely innervates the frontal motor cortex, we examined the involvement of this latter region in amygdala kindled seizures using the reversible functional lesion of cortical spreading depression. Based on these findings we suggest that the circuits of the perirhinal cortex may be important in the amplification and distribution of temporal lobe seizure discharges, providing access to structures that are capable of driving a convulsive response.
