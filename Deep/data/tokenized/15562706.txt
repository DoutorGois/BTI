OBJECTIVE: The effects of different concentration Kadsura heteroclita extract (HS2) on the growth of newborn rat hippocampal neurons were observed by means of dissociated cell culture. METHODS: The newborn rat hippocampal neurons were cultured with different level HS2. The convert phase microscope was used to analyse the number and the length of neurites, as well as the maximum diameter of hippocampal neurons soma. The survival neurons count and LDH assay were carried out to investigate the effect of HS2 on the growth and development of neurons in different culture time. RESULTS: After 36h, the number and the length of neurites of 1 mg/ml HS2 group were increased and the maximum diameter of hippocampal neurons soma did not change. The 0.2 mg/ml HS2 group did not show statistical difference as compared with the control group, while 8 mg/ml HS2 inhibited notably the growth of neurons. The number of survival neurons of 1 mg/ml HS2 group was more than that of the control group, and the LDH activity of 1 mg/ml HS2 group was lower in different culture time. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that suitable dose HS2 can promote the growth and development of hippocampal neurons.
