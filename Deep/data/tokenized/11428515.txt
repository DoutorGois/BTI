Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) immunoreactivity (IR) was examined in the ependyma and choroid plexus (CP) of lateral and third ventricles in normal adult rats, as well as in response to transient forebrain ischemia (TFI) and exogenous FGF-2 delivered intraventricularly for several days by osmotic pump. Similar patterns of FGF-2 IR were seen in the CP epithelia of both lateral and third ventricles, as well as in ependymal cells of the third ventricle and along lateral sides of the lateral ventricles. Consistent staining was seen along the apical aspect of epithelial cells facing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Cytoplasmic staining was seen in the absence of ischemia, and was dramatically reduced in response to TFI. FGF-2 treatment followed by TFI resulted in sustained FGF-2 IR within CP and ependymal cells, supporting the idea that these tissues are involved in synthesis and secretion of growth factors into the CSF. In contrast, along the medial sides of the lateral ventricles, adjacent to brain structures such as the hippocampus, consistent staining was seen along the basal aspect of the ependymal cells. We propose that at least some regions of ependyma may function to transport molecules such as FGF-2 directly into the underlying brain parenchyma.
