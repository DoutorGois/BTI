The effect of inhibition of 3',5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity on the cGMP accumulation was studied in control and nitric oxide (NO) stimulated hippocampal slices incubated in vitro using immunohistochemical visualisation of cGMP. Isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) was used as a non-selective PDE inhibitor and zaprinast was used as a selective inhibitor of cGMP-specific PDE activity. In the absence of PDE inhibitors cGMP-immunoreactivity (cGMP-IR) was found in blood vessel walls only. After incubation with the NO-donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) cGMP-IR was found in a few isolated varicose fibres which were distributed throughout the slice. Incubation in the presence of either 1 mM IBMX or 10 microM zaprinast resulted in cGMP-IR in small numbers of varicose fibres distributed throughout the hippocampal slice. SNP in combination with IBMX resulted in cGMP-IR in small numbers multitude of varicose fibres throughout the slice; occasionally cell somata were observed. After incubation with SNP and zaprinast cGMP-IR was found in varicose fibres, although with a more restricted distribution and less numerous than in the presence of IBMX. In the latter combination, varicose fibres were observed predominantly in the CA2/CA3 region and in the stratum lacunosum molecular of the hippocampus, and cell somata were occasionally observed throughout the hippocampus. The differential distribution of cGMP-IR in the presence of different PDE inhibitors is consistent with the notion that there are regional differences in the localization of cGMP hydrolyzing enzymes in the hippocampus.
