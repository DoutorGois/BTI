Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia with a gradual memory loss and a progressive decline in mental functions with time (1, 2). It is characterized pathologically by neuronal loss, extracellular amyloid-beta senile plaques (APs; aggregates of amyloid-beta peptides consisting of 40 to 42 amino acids) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs; filaments of microtubule-binding hyper-phosphorylated protein tau) in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and associative regions of the cortex (3, 4). Beta-amyloid peptides and tau protein are implicated as the main causes of neuronal degeneration and cell death (5, 6). Early diagnosis of AD is important for treatment consideration and disease management (7). Various amyloid imaging agents have been developed for MRI, SPECT, and PET (8-13). The binding of different derivatives of Congo red, thioflavin, stibene, and aminonaphthalene has been studied in human post-mortem brain tissue and in transgenic mice. Out of these analogues, 2-(1-(6-[(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl)ethylidene)malono nitrile ([(18)F]FDDNP) was first studied in humans, showing more binding in the brains of patients with AD than in those of healthy people (14). Despite of its slow clearance kinetics for PET imaging, [(18)F]FDDNP has been found to be a useful tool for detection of both NFTs and APs in AD patients. [(11)C]PIB, also known as Pittsburgh Compound B or [(11)C]6-OH-BTA-1, showed marked retention in brain cortices known to contain substantial amounts of APs. Other radioligands tested in humans were [(11)C]4-N-methylamino-4 -hydroxystilbene ([(11)C]SB-13, a stilbene derivative), and [(125)]IMPY (a pyridine derivative), which displayed a high accumulation in the frontal cortex in AD patients. (E)-2-(2-(2-(2-[(18)F]Fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)-5-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-pyrid ine ([(18)F]FPEGN3-styrylpyridine) is a modified stilbene derivative, in which one of the benzene rings of stilbene was replaced with one pyridine ring (15). [(18)F]FPEGN3-styrylpyridine is being developed as a PET for amyloid plaque imaging.
