Successful acquisition of active avoidance by rats with low frequency (15 cps) stimulation of the perforant path as a conditioning stimulus is correlated with a slowly developing long-term enhancement of perforant path-granular cell synapses. After selective destruction of granular cells of the stimulated side by unilateral microinjection of 1.6 micrograms/0.2 microliter colchicine into the dentate area, field potentials could no longer be evoked by test stimuli and animals subsequently failed to acquire the conditioned active avoidance with perforant path stimulation as a CS. However, colchicine-treated animals showed the same development of conditioned emotional responses as saline controls and they could also successfully be conditioned with light and tone as the CS. These results suggest that the granular cells are necessarily involved in the conditioning pathway for the active avoidance with perforant path stimulation as the CS. Other targets of the perforant path, e.g., ipsi- and contralateral CA1 pyramidal cells and contralateral granular cells, or antidromic activation of the entorhinal cortex seem an insufficient substitute for granular cells in the pathway for this conditioned active avoidance, but would probably participate in the conditioned emotional responses. The results additionally support our hypothesis, that post-conditioning LTP in granular cell synapses contribute to the acquisition and/or the storage of a memory trace.
