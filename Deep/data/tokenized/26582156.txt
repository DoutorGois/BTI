The present study attempts to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of the isolated lipid extracts of three-spot seahorse which is rare marine bony fish. Petroleum ether (PE) extract was obtained from systematic solvent extraction after reflux extraction with 95% ethanol. FrIV was collected after silica gel column chromatography, and neutral lipids (NL), glycolipids (GL), phospholipids (PL) were separated from FrIV. Basic compositions were detected and analyzed via thin layer chromatography (TLC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Anti-inflammatory activities of total lipids (TL), isolated NL, GL, and PL were detected by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in murine monocyte macrophage RAW264.7 cells in vitro. The results revealed that lipids of seahorse showed a positive correlation with the in vitro suppression of the release of nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha potently in a dose dependent manner, and showed cell compatibility. Among the fractions, GL (50 mug/mL) showed the highest capacity to attenuate the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines which was comparable to that of the positive drug dexamethasone (DX) (20 mug/mL). Collectively, our findings indicated that the lipids from seahorse may be effective in the management of inflammation.
