Accumulating evidence suggest that TRPC channels play critical roles in various aspects of epileptogenesis. TRPC1/4 channels are major contributors to nonsynaptically derived epileptiform burst firing in the CA1 and the lateral septum. TRPC7 channels play a critical role in synaptically derived epileptiform burst firing. The reduction of spontaneous epileptiform bursting in the CA3 is correlated to a reduction in pilocarpine-induced SE in vivo in TRPC7 knockout mice. TRPC channels are also significant contributors to SE-induced neuronal cell death. Although the pilocarpine-induced SE itself is not significantly reduced, the SE-induced neuronal cell death is significantly reduced in the CA1 and the lateral septum, indicating that TRPC1/4 channels directly contribute to SE-induced neuronal cell death. Genetic ablation of TRPC5 also reduces SE-induced neuronal cell death in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus.
