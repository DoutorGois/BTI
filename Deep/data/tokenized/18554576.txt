The influence of a pulsed magnetic field (PMF) on hippocampal evoked potentials has been investigated in vitro. The exposure to PMF (0.16 Hz, 15 mT) applied for 30 min amplified the population spike and the slope of EPSP recorded from stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum respectively. This amplification was additive to previously induced LTP and occurred in an NMDA-independent way. The increase in the activity of electrical synapses accompanied PMF-induced amplification of evoked potentials. Since PMF exposure modified paired-pulse facilitation and paired-pulse inhibition, it was concluded that it modifies excitatory and inhibitory processes in the hippocampus. Control experiments revealed that observed effects were exclusively related to PMF exposure. The results support and extend our previous research indicating a significant influence of magnetic fields on hippocampal physiology.
