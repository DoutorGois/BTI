With ethanol consumption, activity of carboxypeptidase H was increased in all the brain regions of rats with chronic emotional-painful stress. The most distinct increase of enzyme activity was found in the striatum membrane fraction and in the hippocampus. Carboxypeptidase H appears to be involved in development of stress reactions under conditions of ethanol consumption via the enkephalinergic system.
