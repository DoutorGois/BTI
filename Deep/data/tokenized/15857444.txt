Acute seizure-associated changes have been described in the animal and human literature. Controversy exists over whether seizures cause permanent damage to the brain, and whether a (prolonged) seizure can induce changes that lead to an epileptic lesion, resulting in habitual seizures and epilepsy. Current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a variety of imaging tools and is capable of detecting acute seizure-associated changes. In contrast to the histologic examination, serial MRI studies are possible and allow longitudinal observation of the fate of these changes. This report reviews the literature on acute seizure-associated effects emphasizing the MRI evidence.
