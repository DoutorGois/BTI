Onconeural antibodies are diagnostic markers for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes and indicate the underlying tumor type. Recently, a new antibody against protein-kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma) was detected in a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD). We report here a second patient. A 70-year-old woman presented with cerebellar ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, and dysarthria. Her serum showed immunoreactivity against the cytoplasm, dendrites and axons of Purkinje cells in tissue-based screening, later confirmed by immunoblot and phage plaques as anti-PKCgamma. Tumor search revealed an adenocarcinoma of hepatobiliary origin. Detection of PKCgamma antibodies should be considered in PCD and adenocarcinoma without typical onconeural antibodies.
