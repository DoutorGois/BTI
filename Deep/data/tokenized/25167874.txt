PURPOSE: We compared the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) obtained by pulsed continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) and iodine-123-N-isopropyl-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using 3-dimensional stereotactic region-of-interest (ROI) software for automated definition of ROIs in anatomic regions of the brain. METHODS: Thirteen patients with cerebrovascular occlusive disease and three with transient ischemic attacks underwent pCASL and IMP SPECT imaging. We compared rCBF values of each anatomic region and calculated the correlation coefficients between pCASL and IMP SPECT. We also calculated the asymmetry index (AI) using ROIs in contralateral regions of the hemispheres. RESULTS: The rCBF values calculated from pCASL and IMP SPECT were comparable in most segments, but rCBF in the thalamus (P < 0.0001) and hippocampus (P = 0.0006) was significantly higher measured by pCASL than IMP SPECT. The correlation of rCBF between pCASL and IMP SPECT in the affected hemisphere (r = 0.50) tended to be lower than that in the normal hemisphere (r = 0.59), but not significantly different (P = 0.25). Moreover, there was a fixed bias for underestimation of rCBF by pCASL (P = 0.0047) in the affected hemisphere. The calculated AI showed a significant relationship between methods (r = 0.79, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The rCBF obtained by pCASL had positive relationships with IMP SPECT. However, it should be considered that pCASL tends to have a weak relationship with IMP SPECT in some normal regions and regions affected by cerebrovascular occlusive disease.
