We compared semiquantitatively AT8 immunoreactivity in the locus ceruleus (LC) and hippocampus of 154 brains from routine autopsies to investigate the initial sites of phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) development. The numbers of AT8-positive neurons and the severity of AT8-positive neuropil threads (NTs) in the LC were strongly associated: there were no cases with AT8-positive neurons that lacked NTs and 20 cases (13%) had only NTs in the LC. Phospho-tau pathologies in the LC were almost equally on both sides, although some cases (7.8%) showed unilateral predominance. The numbers of AT8-positive neurons in the LC and the numbers of AT8-positive neurons and NTs in the hippocampus were also strongly associated. There were only two cases with AT8-positive neurons in the LC that lacked phospho-tau pathology in the hippocampus, and 21 cases (13.6%) with phospho-tau pathology in the hippocampus that lacked AT8-positive neurons in the LC. The numbers of AT8-positive NTs in the LC and AT8-positive neurons and NTs in the hippocampus were also strongly associated. There were seven cases (4.5%) with AT8-positive NTs in the LC that lacked phospho-tau pathology in the hippocampus, and five cases (3.2 %) with phospho-tau pathologies in the hippocampus that lacked AT8-positive NTs in the LC. In this study, we could not confirm that phospho-tau pathologies begin in the LC. We suspect their simultaneous occurrences in both hippocampal regions and in LC.
