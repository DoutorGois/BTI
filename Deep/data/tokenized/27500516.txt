Approximately 8% of stroke patients present symptoms of central post-stroke pain (CPSP). CPSP is associated with allodynia and hypersensitivity to nociceptive stimuli. Although some studies have shown that neuropathic pain may involve the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, rostral ventromedial medulla, and medial thalamus, the neural substrates and their connections that mediate CPSP remain unclear. [(14)C]-Iodoantipyrine (IAP) uptake can be measured to evaluate spontaneously active pain. It can be used to assess the activation of neural substrates that may be involved in CPSP in an animal model. The [(14)C]-IAP method in rats is less expensive to perform compared with other brain mapping techniques. The present [(14)C]-IAP protocol is used to measure the activation of neural substrates that are involved in CPSP that is induced by lesions of the ventral basal nucleus (VB) of the thalamus in a rodent model.
