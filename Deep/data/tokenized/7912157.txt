1. The competitive antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, CGP39551 and CGP37849, protected against the barbiturate withdrawal syndrome in mice, as measured by ratings of convulsive behaviour on handling. 2. The effective doses of these compounds were lower than those required to prevent seizures due to NMDA in naive animals; these were in turn lower than those needed to prevent the convulsive effects of the alpha-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist, bicuculline. 3. The NMDA-receptor antagonists did not alter the increase in the incidence of convulsions due to the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, that is seen during barbiturate withdrawal, although the latencies to these convulsions during barbital withdrawal were significantly increased after CGP39551. 4. Barbiturate withdrawal did not affect the convulsive actions of NMDA, whether measured by the incidence of convulsions or by intravenous infusion. 5. The Bmax for [3H]-dizocilpine ([3H]-MK801) binding was significantly increased by chronic barbital treatment in cerebrocortical but not in hippocampal tissues, while the Kd remained unaltered in either case. 6. At 1 h and 24 h after administration of a single dose of barbitone, the Bmax for [3H]-dizocilpine binding was unaltered in cerebrocortical tissue. Acute addition of barbitone in vitro did not alter [3H]-dizocilpine binding or the displacement of binding of thienylcyclohexylpyridine.
