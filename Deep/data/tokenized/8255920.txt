Many studies reported that chronic ethanol consumption leads to cognitive dysfunction in rodents. It has been suggested that the effects of chronic ethanol consumption resemble those of aging because of the behavioral and neurochemical similarities between the two processes. The present study examined the effects of a chronic ethanol treatment (20% aqueous solution) in Lewis rats on performance in three different tasks: the Morris spatial navigation task, a cone-field task, and a temporal discrimination task. Although an age-related deficit was found in water escape learning, chronic ethanol consumption did not affect the performance of adult and old rats. The results of this experiment were, however, not conclusive. No differences between old control and ethanol-treated rats were found for spatial (cone-field task) and temporal discrimination learning. However, old ethanol-treated rats showed a transient tendency to perseverate in the temporal discrimination task. The present results are at variance with the generally found cognitive impairments after chronic ethanol consumption using aqueous solutions. It is suggested that the effects of ethanol could be related to strain of rat, task complexity, method of ethanol administering, and housing conditions and may explain the discrepancy between results.
