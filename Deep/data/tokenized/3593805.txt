The protein content in neurons of areas CA-1 and CA-3 of the dorsal hippocampus has been determined by means of cytointerferometry in rats during elaboration of unlocal alimentary instrumental reflex (ULAIR) and local alimentary instrumental reflex (LAIR) on the background of increased and normal serotonine content in the brain. It has been found that during the ULAIR elaboration the hippocampal neurons react by an increase of dry mass, during the LAIR elaboration-by its decrease. Under condition of serotonine excess in the brain the changes of dry mass in hippocampal neurons during elaboration of the two reflexes are opposite to these observed during the ULAIR and LAIR elaboration with normal serotonine content.
