HO-2 is a constitutive isoform of heme oxygenase (HO), a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of the heme ring to form ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin. In contrast to HO-1, which is inducible, HO-2 is not responsive to stimuli tested to date except for prolonged exposure to the adrenal glucocorticoids (GCs). Previous studies have shown that high GC concentrations or stress damage or kill hippocampal neurons. In the present study, it was found that chronic restraint stress decreased HO-2 protein levels in hippocampal neurons, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Moreover, our results showed that the combination of 2.5mg/kg of venlafaxine and 5mg/kg of quetiapine effectively prevented the HO-2 protein decrease in hippocampal neurons of stressed rats, whereas either of the drugs alone did not show any effect. At higher dose levels, both quetiapine (10mg/kg) and venlafaxine (5mg/kg) produced significant effects comparable to that of their combination. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic and venlafaxine an antidepressant. In previous studies, these two drugs have been shown to prevent or protect against the stress-induced decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF expression. These data suggest that both quetiapine and venlafaxine share the hippocampus as their common target by enhancing hippocampal resilience, which may be impaired in patients with schizophrenia or depression.
