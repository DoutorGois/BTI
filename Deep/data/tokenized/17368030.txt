We report a patient with herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis presenting as recurrent syncope due to sinus node arrest. Although the patient's initial presentation suggested a primary cardiac cause, an eventual diagnosis of HSV encephalitis was supported by computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, and confirmed by HSV polymerase chain reaction. The mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias in HSV encephalitis remains unclear; however, cardiac monitoring should be considered in all patients in whom the diagnosis is suspected. With diagnosis and appropriate management, a permanent pacemaker is generally not indicated. This case report highlights the importance of considering potentially reversible causes of collapse secondary to sinus node dysfunction beyond primary cardiac causes.
