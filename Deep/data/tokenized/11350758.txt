Despite the popularity of Na+-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI) to measure intracellular free Na+ concentrations ([Na+](i)), the in situ calibration techniques described to date do not favor the straightforward determination of all of the constants required by the standard equation (Grynkiewicz G, Poenie M, and Tsien RY. J Biol Chem 260: 3440-3450, 1985) to convert the ratiometric signal into [Na+]. We describe a simple method in which SBFI ratio values obtained during a "full" in situ calibration are fit by a three-parameter hyperbolic equation; the apparent dissociation constant (K(d)) of SBFI for Na+ can then be resolved by means of a three-parameter hyperbolic decay equation. We also developed and tested a "one-point" technique for calibrating SBFI ratios in which the ratio value obtained in a neuron at the end of an experiment during exposure to gramicidin D and 10 mM Na+ is used as a normalization factor for ratios obtained during the experiment; each normalized ratio is converted to [Na+](i) using a modification of the standard equation and parameters obtained from a full calibration. Finally, we extended the characterization of the pH dependence of SBFI in situ. Although the K(d) of SBFI for Na+ was relatively insensitive to changes in pH in the range 6.8-7.8, acidification resulted in an apparent decrease, and alkalinization in an apparent increase, in [Na+](i) values. The magnitudes of the apparent changes in [Na+](i) varied with absolute [Na+](i), and a method was developed for correcting [Na+](i) values measured with SBFI for changes in intracellular pH.
