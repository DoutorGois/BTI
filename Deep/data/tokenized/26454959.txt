OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of resveratrol on astrocyte and TNF-alpha in hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease (AD) model rats. METHODS: Sixty rats were randomly divided into six groups: sham control group, model group, resveratrol 20, 40, 80 mg/kg group, and estradiol valerate group (0.8 mg/kg). The model of AD was established by ovariectomy combined injection of D-galactose (100 mg/kg). Twelve weeks later, the heart perfusion in vivo was done and then the hippocampus was fixed. Additionally, the changes of hippocampal astrocytes and TNF-alpha expression were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and TNF-alpha in the model group were significantly higher than those of the sham control group (P < 0.01). No marked difference in the production of GFAP was observed between the resveratrol 20 mg/kg group and the model group (P > 0.05). However, the resveratrol 40, 80 mg/kg and estradiol valerate treated groups showed a decrease in the expression of GFAP compared with the model group (P < 0.01). Moreover, with the increasing of resveratrol concentration, the expression of GFAP decreased gradually. The levels of TNF-alpha decreased markedly in Res 20, 40, 80 mg/kg and estradiol valerate group compared with the model group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of TNF-alpha can be inhibited by Res in AD rats.
