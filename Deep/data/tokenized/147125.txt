The authors examine and review current research on recovery of function following brain damage. Emphasis is placed upon the physiological and neurochemical states of the organism prior to neurosurgery and their influences on behavioral recovery of function. It is proposed that the consequences of a given neurosurgical procedure depend not only on its neuroanatomical locus but also on the organismic state of the brain substrate at the time of such a procedure. The brain substrate can be modified prior to a given manipulation, resulting in an alternation of the effects of the manipulation. The implications of this new perspective for both basic research and clinical medicine are discussed.
