In vitro granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO), and erythroid differentiation factor (EDF) augmented choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in mouse embryonic primary septal neurons and in cholinergic hybridoma cell line, SN6.10.2.2. This is similar to the effects seen with interleukin-3 (IL-3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Moreover, in vivo GM-CSF and EPO promoted survival of septal cholinergic neurons in adult rats which had undergone fimbria-fornix transections. These results suggest that some of the hematopoietic factors act on cholinergic neurons as 'neurotrophic factors' to influence the differentiation, maintenance and regeneration of these neurons.
