OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic changes of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression in the hippocampus of epileptic rats and to study its effect on vitamin E levels in rats following status epilepticus (SE). METHODS: Rat model of SE was induced by intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine. The rats receiving an injection of normal saline were used as a control group. The expression of LPL in the hippocampal tissue was determined using immunofluorescent methods and the level of vitamin E was examined by the colormeric method 12 hrs, 24 hrs, 3 days, 7 days and 14 days after SE. RESULTS: LPL was expressed in the control and SE groups. In the SE group, the LPL expression began to increase 24 hr after SE (P<0.05), reached a peak 3 days after SE (P<0.01), and kept at a high level 7 days after SE (P<0.01). By 14 days, the LPL expression was reduced to the level similar to the control group. The level of vitamin E began to decline 12 hrs after SE (P<0.01), and decreased to a nadir 24 hrs after SE (P<0.01). At 3 and 7 days after SE, the levels of vitamin E were still significantly lower than the controls (P<0.05). By 14 days, the vitamin E level increased to the level similar to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The over-expression of LPL in the hippocampus may play an important role in the oxidative stress mechanisms following SE by regulating the uptake of vitamin E.
