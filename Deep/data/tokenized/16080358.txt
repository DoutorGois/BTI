The paper reviews the current data on the structural peculiarities of the interneurons of hippocampal area CA 3. Special attention is paid to horizontal spiny interneurons located in the stratum lucidum and forming direct contacts with the system of mossy fibers. Their axons terminate at the proximal portions of dendrites and cell body of pyramidal neurons, occasionally they make contacts with the main cells of the hilus and other hippocampal interneurons. Some portion of axon collaterals is in close vicinity to direct and indirect entorhinal-hippocampal connections, indicating their accommodation to selectively suppress mossy fiber input. The latter form the synapses of various types on the principal cells and on various types of interneurons of area CA 3, indicating different mechanisms of transmitter uptake and presynaptic control of their release.
