PURPOSE: : To assess whether structural and metabolic brain abnormalities are correlated in MTLE/HS syndrome. METHODS: : Optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter concentration (GMC) and gray matter volume (GMV) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements from both-sided hippocampal and thalamic regions were performed in 20 MTLE/HS patients and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The local GMC and GMV values were calculated in both the affected and unaffected hippocampi and ipsilateral and contralateral thalami in patients and healthy subjects, and these were compared. VBM variables and NAA, NAA/Cr and NAA/(Cr+Cho) values from the investigated brain regions were correlated. RESULTS: : (1) Analysis revealed significantly more extensive GMV reduction than GMC reduction in patients' affected hippocampus. In addition, significant GMV reduction was observed in the ipsilateral thalamus in MTLE/HS patients. (2) Significant decreases in all VBM and MRS variables were revealed in the affected hippocampus. Whilst practically normal GMC values were revealed in patients' both-sided thalamic regions, a significant decrease in local GMV and metabolic measurements were found in the patients' ipsilateral thalamus. (3) Pearson's correlations between structural and metabolic abnormalities were significant for the ipsilateral thalamus only. CONCLUSION: : Structural and metabolic abnormalities as detected by optimized voxel-based morphometry and (1)H MRS in hippocampal and thalamic regions are only partially correlated in MTLE/HS patients. It seems therefore reasonable that both methods reflect different aspects of brain pathology, which, at least to some degree, might be independently ongoing.
