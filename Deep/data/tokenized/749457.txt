The influence of dimethylsulfolane on active avoidance conditioning with simultaneous registration of EEG was investigated. Dimethylsulfolane, which shows some pharmacological properties of pentylenetetrazole causes a decrease of the amount of conditioned reactions. There was no strong correlation between the impairment of learning ability and the number of EEG spindle discharges after dimethylsulfolane.
