The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of Gproteincoupled receptor 30 (GPR30) in longterm 17betaestradiol (E2) deprivation (LTED) in a rat model with global cerebral ischemia (GCI), and its therapeutic target for ischemic stroke in the clinical setting. Following bilateral ovariectomy, GCI was induced in rats 1 or 10 weeks postsurgery. To determine the protein and mRNA expression levels of GPR30 in the hippocampal CA1 region of LTED rats, shortterm E2 deprivation (STED) rats and naturally aging rats, western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed. The results of the present study demonstrated that E2 treatment revealed significant neuroprotection postGCI in STED rats, but not in LTED rats, as well as a decrease in the expression levels of GPR30 in the hippocampal CA1 region. In LTED rats,. Notably, no effects were observed on the ubiquitination of GPR30 following investigation in STED or LTED rats. While the protein and mRNA expression levels of GPR30 were also decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of female 24monthold rats compared with 3monthold rats. E2 treatment initiated for the entire ovariectomy period elevated GPR30 mRNA and protein expression levels, and attenuated the loss of hippocampal neurons in the GCIinduced CA1 region, indicating that E2 treatment exerted robust neuroprotection within LTED rats. However, the neuroprotective effect of E2 may be blocked by G15. The results of the present study revealed that downregulation of GPR30 expression may attenuate the neuroprotection of E2 within LTED conditions in rats postovariectomy by leading to neuronal insensitivity to E2 neuroprotection following cerebral ischemia. These results provide evidence that GPR30 may have potential as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of clinical ischemic stroke.
