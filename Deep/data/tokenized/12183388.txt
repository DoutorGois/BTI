Information in neuronal networks is thought to be represented by the rate of discharge and the temporal relationship between the discharging neurons. The discharge frequency of neurons is affected by their afferents and intrinsic properties, and shows great individual variability. The temporal coordination of neurons is greatly facilitated by network oscillations. In the hippocampus, population synchrony fluctuates during theta and gamma oscillations (10-100 ms scale) and can increase almost 10-fold during sharp wave bursts. Despite these large changes in excitability in the sub-second scale, longer-term (minute-scale) firing rates of individual neurons are relatively constant in an unchanging environment. As a result, mean hippocampal output remains stable over time. To understand the mechanisms responsible for this homeostasis, we address the following issues: (i) Can firing rates of single cells be modified? (ii) Once modified, what mechanism(s) can maintain the changes? We show that firing rates of hippocampal pyramidal cells can be altered in a novel environment and by Hebbian pairing of physiological input patterns with postsynaptic burst discharge. We also illustrate a competition between single spikes and the occurrence of spike bursts. Since spike-inducing (suprathreshold) inputs decrease the ability of strong ('teaching') inputs to induce a burst discharge, we propose that the single spike versus burst competition presents a homeostatic regulatory mechanism to maintain synaptic strength and, consequently, firing rate in pyramidal cells.
