Local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was examined in an El mouse during an entire seizure (tonic-clonic convulsions and recovery), and during the recovery period only. LCGU was measured quantitatively in 18 structures. In the whole-seizure group, the parietal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, dentate gyrus, ventral thalamus and cerebellar nuclei showed a significant increase in the uptake of 2-DG. In the recovery-period group, compared with the control group, a relative increase was found in the frontal, temporal and occipital cortex, amygdala, substantia grisea centralis mesencephali, cerebellar nuclei and caudate putamen, as well as the parietal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus and dentate gyrus. To summarize, the hyperactivity in the parietal cortex, dorsal hippocampus, dentate gyrus, amygdala and cerebellar nuclei continued throughout the convulsive and recovery periods.
