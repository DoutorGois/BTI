This Editorial highlights a study by Huang and colleagues in the current issue of Journal of Neurochemistry. The authors introduce a novel ALS-FTD (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia) rat model to explore the role of the UBLQN2 gene that has previously been associated with familial ALS-FTD. Over-expression of ubiquilin 2 in the cortex (CTX) and hippocampus of the rat results in ubiquilin 2 aggregates and neurodegeneration together with cognitive deficits. The new rat model not only gives insight into potential molecular underpinnings of ALS-FTD, but also represents an important new tool for future research and therapeutic approaches.
