The serotonin (5-HT) agonists, D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and 5-methoxytryptamine (5-Me-O-T), dose dependently inhibited the K+-evoked outflow of [3H]5-HT from preloaded rat hippocampal slices in vitro, indicating activation of the 5-HT autoreceptor. However, this effect was abolished in slices pretreated with pertussis toxin. It is thus concluded that the 5-HT autoreceptor in the hippocampus is coupled to G proteins.
