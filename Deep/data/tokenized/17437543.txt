We have evaluated the possibility that changes in the vascular system may constitute a contributing factor for the death of nigral dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease. Thus, we have employed intranigral injections of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the most potent inducer of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. A single dose of 1 mug of VEGF, chosen from a dose-response study, highly disrupted the BBB in the ventral mesencephalon in a time-dependent manner. A strong regional correlation between BBB disruption and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons was evident. Moreover, Fluoro-Jade B labelling showed the presence of dying neurons in the substantia nigra in response to VEGF injection. High number of TUNEL-positive nuclei was observed in this area along with activation of caspase 3 within nigral dopaminergic neurons. Analysis of the glial population demonstrated a strong inflammatory response and activation of astroglia in response to BBB disruption. We conclude that disruption of the BBB may be a causative factor for degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons.
