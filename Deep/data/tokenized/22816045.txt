Neurogenesis occurs during embryonic development and continues throughout adulthood. Although spontaneous adult neurogenesis is restricted to selective germinal regions, including the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, neural stem cells (NSCs) are widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Besides their ability to integrate into existing neural networks during physiological conditions, NSCs also proliferate and differentiate in response to injury, thus promising the potential use of endogenous NSCs for the treatment of neuropathological conditions. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the understanding of adult neurogenesis in the brain and peripheral nervous system.
