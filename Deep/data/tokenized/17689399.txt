We report serial magnetic resonance imaging findings in a case of anoxic encephalopathy (AE). Diffusion-weighted images clearly showed early development of lesions in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and caudate putamen, along with delayed manifestation of lesions in the hippocampus, corpus callosum, and white matter. The present case is the first to demonstrate delayed development of postischemic changes in the hippocampus and deep white matter after AE on neuroimaging.
