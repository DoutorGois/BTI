Megencephaly, enlarged brain, is a major sign in several human neurological diseases. The mouse model for megencephaly (mceph/mceph) has an enlarged brain, presumably due to brain cell hypertrophy, and exhibits neurological and motor disturbances with seizure-like activity, as well as disturbances in the insulin-like growth factor system. Here, we report that expression of the neuropeptides cholecystokinin, enkephalin, galanin and neuropeptide Y is dramatically changed in mceph/mceph brains compared to wild type, as revealed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The changes were confined to discrete brain regions and occurred in a parallel fashion for peptides and their transcripts. For cholecystokinin, mceph/mceph brains had region-specific up- and down-regulations in several layers of the hippocampal formation and increased levels in, especially ventral, cortical regions. Enkephalin messenger RNA expression was up-regulated in the dentate gyrus granular layer and in ventral cortices, but down-regulated in the CA1 pyramidal layer. Enkephalin-like immunoreactivity was elevated in mossy fibers of the hippocampus and the ventral cortices. Galanin expression was increased in several layers and interneurons of the hippocampal formation, as well as in ventral cortices. Galanin-like immunoreactivity was reduced in nerve terminals in the forebrain. Neuropeptide Y expression was increased in the hippocampal formation and ventral cortices. Whether the mainly increased peptide levels contribute to the excessive growth of the brain or represent a consequence of this growth and/or of the neurological and motor disturbances remains to be elucidated.
