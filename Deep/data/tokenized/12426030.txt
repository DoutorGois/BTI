In an all-male sample of schizophrenic patients stabilized by medication (n=62) and normal controls (n=27), we obtained neuropsychological test data and high-resolution whole brain magnetic resonance scans, as well as detailed psychiatric rating scales on a subset of the patients (n=47). Schizophrenic patients had significantly worse overall age-adjusted cognitive performance than normal controls (average z-score=-0.90, range=-0.60 to -1.81), which included relatively more severe deficits with different types of memory, psychomotor speed, verbal fluency and verbal abstraction. Schizophrenic patients also had significantly smaller bilateral volumes in gray but not white matter in the prefrontal region, superior temporal gyrus and whole temporal lobe, but no group differences were observed in the hippocampus and parahippocampus. Correlations between the brain regions and cognitive performance revealed different sets of significant relationships for the two groups, particularly in the prefrontal and hippocampal regions. In addition, inverse correlations were observed between certain cognitive abilities (psychomotor speed, cognitive flexibility and verbal fluency) and patients' psychiatric ratings, especially with measures of negative symptoms. The convergence of findings for schizophrenic patients regarding the prefrontal region, negative symptoms, psychomotor speed and cognitive flexibility suggests that schizophrenic negative symptoms may involve disruption of frontal-subcortical connections.
