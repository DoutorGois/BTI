The actions of pumiliotoxin-B, extracted from the skin of the frog Dendrobates pumilio, were examined on hippocampal slices and on acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons from the adult guinea pig. Application of 0.5-1 microM pumiliotoxin-B to hippocampal slices caused spontaneous, repetitive field discharges in the CA3 subfield. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of isolated CA1 and CA3 neurons, 1-2 microM pumiliotoxin-B shifted the midpoint of Na+ current activation by -11.4 +/- 1.1 mV. This shift was not dependent upon prior activation of the sodium channel. Pumiliotoxin-B did not block macroscopic Na+ inactivation but did reduce the apparent voltage-dependence of inactivation such that currents decayed faster at membrane potentials more negative than -30 mV. Single-channel recordings of sodium currents from excised membrane patches indicated that pumiliotoxin-B had little or no effect on channel closings due to entry into inactivated state(s) but did increase the rate of channel closings due to reversal of channel opening. The increase in the channel closing rate was consistent with a +8.7 mV shift in voltage sensitivity. Negative shifts in activation and positive shifts in closing rates implied a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of channel opening, suggesting that pumiliotoxin-B increases the rate of Na+ channel opening and closing in cells at rest, which could result in spontaneous activity in the neurons.
