Valproic acid (VPA) is widely used clinically, as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer but is, however, also known to block cell proliferation through its ability to inhibit histone deacetylase enzymes. There have been a number of reports of cognitive impairments in patients taking VPA. In this investigation we examined the relationship between cognition and changes in cell proliferation within the hippocampus, a brain region where continued formation of new neurons is associated with learning and memory. Treatment of rats by i.p. injection of VPA, reduced cell proliferation in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus within the hippocampus. This was linked to a significant impairment in their ability to perform a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory test (novel object location). In addition, drug treatment caused a significant reduction in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Notch 1 but not doublecortin levels within the hippocampus. These results support the idea that VPA may cause cognitive impairment and provide a possible mechanism for this by reducing neurogenesis within the hippocampus.
