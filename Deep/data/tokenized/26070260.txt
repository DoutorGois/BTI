Diverse cortical and subcortical regions are synergically engaged during reward processing. Previous studies using time-frequency decomposition of Electroencephalography (EEG) data have revealed an increase of mid-frontal beta oscillatory activity (BOA) after reward delivery, which could be a potential mechanism in the coordination of the different areas engaged during reward processing. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, twenty subjects performed a monetary gambling paradigm in two separate sessions (EEG and fMRI). Time-frequency oscillatory EEG data and fMRI activity were fused using Joint Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The present results showed that mid-frontal BOA elicited by monetary gains is associated with the engagement of a fronto-striatal-hippocampal network previously involved in reward-related memory enhancement, supporting the role of this activity during reward processing.
