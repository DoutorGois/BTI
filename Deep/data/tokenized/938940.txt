Injection of a potent, cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, [3H]3-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB), results in a localization of the drug to muscarinic receptors in rat brain. The distribution of these drug receptors was examined in various brain regions previously thought to contain cholinergic neurons. They were localized to dendritic regions in the hippocampus, corpus striatum, nucleus accumbens and cerebral cortex. Particularly in the hippocampus, the receptor distribution may correspond to that for cholinergic nerve terminals.
