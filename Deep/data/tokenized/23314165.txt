BACKGROUND: Adult neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus of most mammals, including humans, and plays an important role in hippocampal-dependent learning. This process is highly regulated by neuronal activity and might therefore be vulnerable to anesthesia. In this article, the authors investigated this possibility by evaluating the impact of propofol anesthesia on mouse hippocampal neurons generated during adulthood, at two functionally distinct maturational stages of their development. METHODS: Adult-born hippocampal neurons were identified using the cell proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine or a retroviral vector expressing the green fluorescent protein in dividing cells and their progenies. Eleven or 17 days after the labeling procedure, animals (n = 3-5 animals per group) underwent a 6-h-long propofol anesthesia. Twenty-one days after labeling, the authors analyzed the survival, differentiation, and morphologic maturation of adult-born neurons using confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Propofol impaired the survival and maturation of adult-born neurons in an age-dependent manner. Anesthesia induced a significant decrease in the survival of neurons that were 17 days old at the time of anesthesia, but not of neurons that were 11 days old. Similarly, propofol anesthesia significantly reduced the dendritic maturation of neurons generated 17 days before anesthesia, without interfering with the maturation of neurons generated 11 days before anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that propofol impairs the survival and maturation of adult-born hippocampal neurons in a developmental stage-dependent manner in mice.
