The protective effect of E-2001 (2-(4-(p-fluorobenzoyl)-piperidin-1-yl)-2'-acetonaphthone hydrochloride) was examined in various ischemic models, and the mechanisms of its action were investigated in vitro and in vivo. 1. Pretreatment with E-2001 ameliorated the degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 sector following transient ischemia in Mongolian gerbils. 2. E-2001 improved stroke symptoms induced by permanent unilateral carotid artery ligation in gerbils. 3. E-2001 prolonged the survival time following permanent bilateral carotid artery ligation in gerbils and mice. E-2001 also prolonged the survival time following intravenous injection of KCN into mice. 4. E-2001 suppressed the high potassium-evoked release of glutamate from rat hippocampal slices. Furthermore, E-2001 prevented the excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate induced by a brief ischemia in gerbils. 5. E-2001 exerted calcium antagonistic action, i.e., a relaxing effect on high potassium-induced contraction of rat aorta. 6. E-2001 exerted inhibitory action on the lipoperoxide production in vitro and in vivo, and exhibited a radical scavenging effect against O- and N-radicals. These results suggest that E-2001 might be effective as a novel anti-ischemic agent.
