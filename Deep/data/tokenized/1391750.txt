In situ hybridization and Northern blotting were used to study the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA in the rat brain following photochemical stroke. A focal thrombotic lesion of the sensorimotor cortex was produced by intravenously injecting the light-sensitive dye rose bengal and exposing the skull to a controlled beam of light. Four hours after the light exposure the level of BDNF mRNA was increased in the hippocampus and cortex ipsilateral and perifocal to the lesion. The stroke-induced BDNF mRNA increase was prevented by the non-competitive glutamate receptor blocker dizocilpine (MK-801). The results indicate that the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive glutamate receptors is involved in the stroke-triggered stimulation of BDNF mRNA increase.
