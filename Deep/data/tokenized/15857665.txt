Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels increase in rats treated with a regimen of delayed, mild hypothermia that improve neurological recovery after asphyxial cardiac arrest. BDNF transcription in rat brain involves at least five different BDNF exons (exons I-V) that produce four different varieties of mRNA, each containing exon V paired with one of exons I-IV. This study examined whether these different BDNF transcripts are differentially affected by cardiac arrest and by therapeutic hypothermia in rat hippocampus using a reverse transcription and PCR-based method. At 24 h after asphyxial cardiac arrest, transcripts containing exons I and III increased. In rats treated with hypothermia after cardiac arrest, transcripts containing exon III were further increased. No significant alterations in transcripts from exons II or IV were observed, though there was a trend for hypothermia to decrease message from these exons. These data suggest that hypothermia after cardiac arrest produces exon-specific changes in BDNF transcription.
