AIM: To explore the effect of platelet-activating factor on long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. METHODS: We recorded the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and investigated effect of long-term potentiation by PAF in rat hippocampus in vitro. RESULTS: Low doses (1 micromol/L ) of PAF could induce LTP, while higher doses (10-50 micromol/L) of PAF could inhibit induction of LTP. But it couldn't inhibit the LTP induced by subsequent high frequency stimulation and the EPSP of basal. GB of PAF receptor antagonists could prevent the LTP induced by low doses of PAF, and could't inhibit the LTP induced by HFS. CONCLUSION: Higher doses of PAF is an HIV-1-induced neurotoxin, it may contribute to the HAD pathogenesis by inhibition of LTP.
