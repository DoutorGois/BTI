In order to check the structure-activity relationship and prepare more potent derivatives of imperialine with anticholinergic activity, imperialinol (2), 3 beta-acetoxyimperialine (3), 3 beta-propionoxyimperialine (4), and 3 beta-butyroxyimperialine (5) were prepared. Compounds 4 and 5 displayed better anticholinergic activity against muscarinic receptors of the heart and brain than imperialine (1). The decrease in activity in 2 showed the importance of the 6-keto functionality in imparting the anticholinergic activity.
