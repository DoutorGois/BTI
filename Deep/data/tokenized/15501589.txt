We have investigated changes in the extracellular matrix of the hippocampus associated with the early progression of epileptogenesis in a murine model of temporal lobe epilepsy using immunohistochemistry. In the first week following intrahippocampal injection of the glutamate agonist, domoate, there is a latent period at the end of which begins a sequential upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, beginning with neurocan and tenascin-C. This expression precedes the characteristic dispersion of the granule cell layer which is evident at 14 days post-injection when the first recurrent seizures can be recorded. At this stage, an upregulation of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, phosphacan, the DSD-1 chondroitin sulfate motif, and the HNK-1 oligosaccharide are also observed. The expression of these molecules is localized differentially in the epileptogenic dentate gyrus, especially in the sprouting molecular layer, where a strong upregulation of phosphacan, tenascin-C, and HNK-1 is observed but there is no expression of the proteoglycan, neurocan, nor of the DSD-1 chondroitin sulfate motif. Hence, it appears that granule cell layer dispersion is accompanied by a general increase in the ECM, while mossy fiber sprouting in the molecular layer is associated with a more restricted repertoire. In contrast to these changes, the expression of the ECM glycoproteins, laminin and fibronectin, both of which are frequently implicated in tissue remodelling events, showed no changes associated with either granule cell dispersion or mossy fiber sprouting, indicating that the epileptogenic plasticity of the hippocampus is accompanied by ECM interactions that are characteristic of the CNS.
