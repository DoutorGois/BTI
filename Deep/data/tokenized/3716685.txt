In experiments on neurones of the isolated ganglia of the snail and surviving hippocampal slices from mice, studies have been made of the effect of Met- and Leu-enkephalins on neuronal sensitivity to acetylcholine and norepinephrine. It was shown that in some cases the enkephalins do not affect bioelectrical activity of the neurones, but changed their responses to acetylcholine and norepinephrine. It is concluded that during investigation of the effect of enkephalins on the nervous cells, alongside with changes in the bioelectrical activity, special attention should be paid to changes in chemoreceptive properties of the neurones.
