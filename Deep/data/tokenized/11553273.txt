A wealth of indirect data suggest that the H218/AGR16/Edg-5/LP(B2) sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor plays important roles in development. In vitro, it activates several forms of development-related signal transduction and regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival. It is expressed during embryogenesis, and mutation of an H218-like gene in zebrafish leads to profound defects in embryonic development. Nevertheless, the in vivo functions served by H218 signalling have not been directly investigated. We report here that mice in which the H218 gene has been disrupted are unexpectedly born with no apparent anatomical or physiological defects. In addition, no abnormalities were observed in general neurological development, peripheral axon growth or brain structure. However, between 3 and 7 weeks of age, H218(-/-) mice have seizures which are spontaneous, sporadic and occasionally lethal. Electroencephalographic abnormalities were identified both during and between the seizures. At a cellular level, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that the loss of H218 leads to a large increase in the excitability of neocortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, H218 plays an essential, unanticipated and functionally important role in the proper development and/or mediation of neuronal excitability.
