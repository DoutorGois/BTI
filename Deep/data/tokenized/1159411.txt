In the cat brain the highest monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity is observed in the hypothalamus followed by hippocampus, caudate nucleus, pons and median cortex. Tyramine was the most actively deaminated substrate tested followed by dopamine. Clorgyline was more selective in its inhibitory action and could distinguish between tyramine and dopamine MAO deaminating system. The latter being more resistant to inhibition. The multiple forms of solubilized MAO as separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis have varying phospholipid phosphorus content and sensitivity to inhibition by clorgyline in vitro and in vivo.
