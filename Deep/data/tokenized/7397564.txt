The distribution of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the rat brain was studied using a sensitive radioimmunoassay. The highest concentration of AVP was found in the hypothalamus. Individually, the supraoptic, paraventricular and suprachiasmatic nuclei contained in the order of 10% of the total hypothalamic content. Vasopressin was also found in the thalamus, medulla, cerebellum, amygdala, substantia nigra and hippocampus. Much lower levels were detected in the pons, spinal cord, frontal and occipital lobes and caudate putamen. No AVP could be detected in any other regions of the cortex or corpus callosum. Chromatographically the vasopressin found outside the hypothalamus is of a similar nature to that of hypothalamo-hypophysial origin. This study supports previous reports of extrahypothalamic localization of vasopressin by immuno-histochemical methods. It is clear that AVP is not confined to the hypothalamo-hypophysial axis, and the possibilities that this may reflect an involvement in brain function are discussed.
