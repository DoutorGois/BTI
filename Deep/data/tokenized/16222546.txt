The aim of this study was to determine whether the knockout of the taurine-transporter gene in the mouse affects the densities of GABA(A), kainate, AMPA and NMDA receptors in the brain. The caudate-putamen, the hippocampus and its subregions, and the cerebellum of six homozygous taurine-transporter gene knockout mice and six wild-type (WT) animals were examined by means of quantitative receptor autoradiography. Saturation studies were carried out for all four receptor types in order to find possible intergroup differences in Bmax and K(D) values. Taurine-transporter gene knockout animals showed significantly higher GABA(A) receptor densities in the molecular layer of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and in the cerebellum than did WT animals. The densities of kainate receptors were significantly higher in the caudate-putamen, the CA1 and hilus regions of the hippocampus and in the cerebellum of knockout animals. The caudate-putamen and cerebellum of these mice also contained significantly higher AMPA receptor densities. However, there were no significant differences between knockout and WT animals concerning the densities of NMDA receptors. Reduced brain taurine levels are associated with increased GABA(A), kainate and AMPA receptor densities in some of the regions we examined.
