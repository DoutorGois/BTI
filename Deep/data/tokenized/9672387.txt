The cellular distribution of sodium channel beta2 subunit mRNA was examined in the central nervous system from adult Wistar rats using a non-radioactive in situ hybridization method with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes. The expression of the subunit was strong in cerebral and cerebellar cortex, in medulla oblongata and in the spinal cord whereas heterogeneous in hippocampus. The distribution was evaluated in hippocampus and cerebral cortex from 1 to 72 h after kainate injection and compared to control rats using densitometric analysis. In these areas, a transient increase was seen 1 h after the drug administration, followed, in the hippocampus, by a significant decrease. These variations differ from those we previously reported for alpha subunits and might play a role in cellular excitability changes occurring in the course of seizures.
