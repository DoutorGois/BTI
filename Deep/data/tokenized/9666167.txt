Alteration of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor and its mRNA after long-term adrenalectomy (ADX) was studied in the hippocampus by in vitro receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridization histochemistry, respectively. Significantly, decreased levels of IGF-1 receptor and its mRNA was noted in the dentate and CA1-CA4 regions of the hippocampus of the ADX animals, suggesting that the level and expression of IGF-1 receptors in the hippocampus is influenced by adrenal hormones.
