Neural recording and stimulation with high spatial and temporal resolution are highly desirable in the study of neurocommunication and diseases. Planar multiple microelectrode arrays (MEA) or quasi-three-dimensional (3D) MEA with fixed height have been proposed by many researchers and become commercially available. In this paper, we present the design, fabrication, and test of a novel true 3D multiple electrode array for brain slice stimulation and recording. This MEA is composed of 105 microelectrodes with 50 mum diameter and 125 mum center-to-center spacing integrated in a 1.2 x 1.2 mm2 area. This "true" 3D MEA allows us to precisely position the individual electrodes by piezoelectric-based actuators to penetrate the inactive tissue layer and to approach the active neurons so as to optimize the recording and stimulation of electrical field potential. The capability to stimulate nerve fibers and record postsynaptic field potentials was demonstrated in an experiment using mouse brain hippocampus slice.
