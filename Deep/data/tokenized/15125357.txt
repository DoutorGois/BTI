INTRODUCTION: Mesiotemporal epilepsy (MTLE) is a clinical syndrome characterised by the association of a history of febrile seizures, a homogenous clinical presentation of seizures, temporal interictal and ictal EEG recordings and an underlying pathology that is mesial sclerosis. MTLE is the most common type of medically intractable partial epilepsy with a drug-resistance in 90% of cases. OBJECT: The aim of this study is to describe the clinical, EEG and MRI findings of 9 patients with MTLE attending the outpatient clinic of Charles Nicolle Hospital. RESULTS: The median age of our study population was 30 years. A history of febrile seizures was found in 5 patients. Hippocampal atrophy was found in all the cases right in 4 cases and left in 5 cases. Drug-resistance was observed in 7 patients. No patient underwent surgery. CONCLUSION: It is important in front of medically intractable partial epilepsy to evoke MTLE, to confirm the diagnosis with neuro-imaging and to propose an interdisciplinary therapeutic approach including neurologists, epileptologists and neurosurgeons.
