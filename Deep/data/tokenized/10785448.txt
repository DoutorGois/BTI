Abnormal phosphorylation of the tau-protein is regarded as a crucial step in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles in the neuronal cell body and neuropil threads in dendrites. We studied the effects of tau-pathology on the clinical expression of dementia in 106 autopsy cases in the entorhinal region, the hippocampal stratum oriens, the stratum radiatum, and the perforant path target zone. The first cytoskeletal lesions were located in the perikarya and dendrites of the pre-alpha cells of the transentorhinal and entorhinal region. Next, abnormally phosphorylated tau-protein (PHF-tau) was found in the neuropil of the CA1-subiculum region. Thereafter, the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens began to be involved in PHF-tau pathology in Braak stage II. In the Braak stages IV and V, the stratum radiatum was completely involved, the stratum oriens increasingly so. Beginning in Braak stage III, we noted cases having PHF-tau pathology in the perforant path target zone of the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. The increase of this pathology with ever greater involvement on the part of the entorhinohippocampal circuit correlated significantly not only with the Braak stages and with the neurochemically determined hippocampal content of PHF-tau but also with the degree of dementia as defined by the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. The affection of the stratum oriens in combination with PHF-tau pathology in the stratum radiatum and in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was encountered almost exclusively in demented individuals (CDR 1-3). These results indicate that axonal PHF-tau pathology in hippocampal pathways presumably is critical for the clinical expression of dementia and may constitute an anatomical substrate of clinically verifiable memory dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.
