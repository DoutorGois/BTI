The effects of various K+ concentrations on the inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine release from rat hippocampal brain slices and evoked synaptosomal 45Ca2+ influx by omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx) and neomycin were examined. K+ (15-75 mM) caused a concentration-dependent release of [3H]norepinephrine that was greater than 90% dependent on extracellular calcium. The ability of omega-CgTx to inhibit [3H]norepinephrine release was optimal at 25 mM K+ and was reduced substantially at higher concentrations of K+. omega-CgTx maximally inhibited [3H]norepinephrine release by 49% (15 mM K+), 58% (25 mM K+), 22% (50 mM K+), and 12% (75 mM K+). In contrast, neomycin caused a concentration-dependent and virtually complete inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine release at all concentrations of K+, with IC50 values of 210 microM (15 mM K+), 150 microM (25 mM K+), 450 microM (50 mM K+), and 1500 microM (75 mM K+). omega-CgTx (1 microM) had little effect (10% or less inhibition) on hippocampal synaptosomal 45Ca2+ influx at any concentration of K+, whereas 3 mM neomycin caused at least 75% inhibition of 45Ca2+ influx, with the largest inhibition (96%) occurring at 25 mM K+. The results suggest that increasing stimulus intensity decreases the contribution of N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) in mediating K(+)-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine. The comparative absence of omega-CgTx-sensitive synaptosomal 45Ca(2+)-influx sites suggests that N-type calcium channels are a small subset of channels in rat hippocampal synaptosomes. The demonstration that neomycin can inhibit omega-CgTx-sensitive and -insensitive neurotransmitter release and calcium influx suggests that neomycin may block N-type VSCC as well as non-N-type VSCC.
