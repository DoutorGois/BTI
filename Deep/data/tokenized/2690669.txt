It was previously demonstrated that after prolonged alcohol consumption, dendrites might display either degenerative or plastic changes according to the central nervous system areas studied. Furthermore, and rather unexpectedly, we also found that withdrawal from alcohol led to a decrease of the relative number of granule cells in the fascia dentata. Thus, it seemed worthwhile to quantify, using a semiautomatic measuring system, the dendritic arborizations of hippocampal granule cells of rats alcohol-fed for 12 months followed by 6 months of abstinence and compare the results with age-matched control and alcohol-fed groups. The results indicate smaller dendritic trees in the abstinent group when compared with the higher values of the dendritic parameters found in alcohol-fed rats.
