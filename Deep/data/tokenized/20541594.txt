Non-clustered protocadherins (PCDHs) are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules which have attracted attention for their possible roles in the neuronal circuit formation during development and their implications in the neurological disorders such as autism and mental retardation. Previously, we found that a subset of the non-clustered PCDHs exhibited circuit-dependent expression patterns in thalamo-cortical connections in early postnatal rat brain, but such patterns disappeared in adulthood. In this study, we identified that the non-clustered PCDHs showed differential expression patterns along the septotemporal axis in the subregions of adult hippocampus and dentate gyrus with topographical preferences. The expressions of PCDH1, PCDH9, PCDH10 and PCDH20 showed septal preferences, whereas the expressions of PCDH8, PCDH11, PCDH17 and PCDH19 showed temporal preferences, suggesting that they play roles in the formation/maintenance of intrahippocampal circuits. PCDHs also exhibited the region-specific expression patterns in the areas connected to hippocampal formation such as entorhinal cortex, lateral septum, and basolateral amygdaloid complex. Furthermore, the expression levels of three PCDHs (PCDH8, PCDH19 and PCDH20) were regulated by the electroconvulsive shock stimulation of the brain in the adult hippocampus and dentate gyrus. These results suggest that non-clustered PCDHs are involved in the maintenance and plasticity of adult hippocampal circuitry.
