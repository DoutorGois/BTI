Alzheimer's disease (AD) is progressive dementia with senile plaques composed of beta-amyloid (Abeta). Recent studies suggest that synaptic dysfunction is one of the earliest events in the pathogenesis of AD. Here we provide the first experimental evidence that a change in the level of dynamin 1 induced by Abeta correlates with memory impairment in vivo. We treated rats with transient cerebral ischemia with oligomeric forms of Abeta (Abeta oligomers), including dimers, trimers, and tetramers, intracerebroventricularly. The combination of Abeta oligomers and cerebral ischemia, but not cerebral ischemia alone, significantly impaired memory and decreased the level of dynamin 1, which plays a critical role in synaptic vesicle recycling, but did not affect the levels of other synaptic proteins, such as synaptophysin and synaptobrevin, in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist memantine prevented memory impairment and dynamin 1 degradation, suggesting that these changes might be mediated by NMDA receptors. These results suggest that Abeta oligomers induce memory impairment via dynamin 1 degradation, which may imply that dynamin 1 degradation is one of the causes of synaptic dysfunction in AD.
