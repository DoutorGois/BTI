Peroxiredoxins (Prdx), a family of antioxidant proteins, have important defensive roles in the degenerative brain diseases and neuronal cell death in adult subjects. However, little is known in the neonatal brain. Here, we studied the developmental expression of Prdxs and their response to dexamethasone in the perinatal rat brain. Prdx 1 expression increased during late gestations and peaked at postnatal-day 1, when its expression gradually decreased. Prdx 2 expression remained largely unchanged. Prdx 6 expression continually increased as growing. Using immunohistochemistry, each Prdx showed a strong expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Prdx 1 was strongly expressed in the corpus callosum. The dexamethasone injection increased the expression of Prdx 6. In conclusion, we reveal for the first time that Prdx 1, 2 and 6 are found in abundance in the perinatal rat brain and are differentially expressed during development. The expression of Prdx 6 was affected by dexamethasone treatment.
