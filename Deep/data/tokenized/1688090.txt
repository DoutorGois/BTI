Using HPLC with electrochemical detection, we found that icv somatostatin (Som) 5 or 10 micrograms increased rat's pain threshold and contents of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in hippocampus, hypothalamus and brainstem, except the 5-HIAA content of brainstem in Som 5 micrograms group. However, the changes of NE among above three areas of brain were different, the NE contents of hypothalamus and brainstem significantly increased while that of hippocampus markedly decreased. After icv Som 20 micrograms, hypoxanthine and xanthine in hippocampus and hypothalamus decreased significantly, but encephaledema occurred. Som 40 micrograms icv caused necrotic changes of neurons in brain.
