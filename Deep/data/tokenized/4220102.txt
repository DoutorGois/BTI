We examined first the behavior of a single animal (Macacus Rhesus), partially free to move on a Brady chair, before and after direct electrical stimulation of the amygdala and the hippocampus; then the social behavior of two animals, completely free to move in a large behavioral cage, before and after stimulation, by radio, of the amygdala. Certain ventromedial areas of the amygdala have a short and long term inhibitory effect on feeding and social behavior and the hippocampus has a short and long term facilitating effect on feeding behavior, especially during the after discharge.
