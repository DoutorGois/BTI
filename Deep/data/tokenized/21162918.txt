OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of Arc mRNA in insular electrical kindled and single electrical stimulated rats and its significance. METHODS: Male SD rats were divided randomly into kindled group, single electrical stimulated group, sham-operated group and control group. Each group was divided into 2 sub-groups at different time points. Kindled group: establishing chronic insular electrical kindled model, decapitation to perform RT-PCR of Arc mRNA on hippocampus and to applying in situ hybridization of Arc mRNA on dentate gyrus; Single electrical stimulated group: using the same method as the kindled group with only electrical stimulation twice; Sham-operated group: using the same method to the kindled group without electrical stimulation; CONTROL GROUP: no surgery. RESULTS: Expression of Arc mRNA in the hippocampus of single electrical stimulated, sham-operated and control groups were 0.72 +/- 0.14, 0.75 +/- 0.16 and 0.71 +/- 0.14 respectively. They were significantly less than the kindled group of 1.78 +/- 0.43(P < 0.01) at 3 h. The expression of Arc mRNA had no significant difference (P > 0.05) among 4 groups at 6 h; in situ hybridization (cell count) of Arc mRNA showed the expression of Arc mRNA in the kindled group was 112.8 +/- 6.0. And it was significantly higher than the other three groups of 46.25 +/- 4.35, 45.25 +/- 6.23, 44.75 +/- 6.49 (P < 0.01) after 3 h, there were no significant difference among 4 groups at 6 h (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Insular epilepsy increase the expression of Arc mRNA in hippocampus. Arc may play an important role in the synaptic plasticity of insular epilepsy.
