Ts65Dn mouse displays a partial triplication of chromosome 16 and is adopted as a model for Down syndrome (DS). It is known that Ts65Dn mice present memory deficiencies. In order to gain insight into the cause of these deficiencies, we studied the possibility of changes in volumes and neuronal numbers in different regions of the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA3, CA2 and CA1) in trisomic mice as compared to control littermates using stereological methods. The mean hippocampal volumes of Ts65Dn mice did not show significant differences as compared to controls, except in CA2 where there was a barely significant decrease. However, mean neuron number was significantly lower in Ts65Dn mice than in controls in dentate gyrus (43.7 x 10(4), CV 21%, n = 5, vs. 30.4 x 10(4), CV 18.1%, n = 4) and higher in CA3 (23.1 x 10(4), CV 18.9% vs. 33.3 x 10(4), CV 14.9%). These quantitative changes may account for the memory deficiencies observed in Ts65Dn mice.
