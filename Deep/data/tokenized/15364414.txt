Protein kinase C gamma (PKC gamma) is highly expressed in the rodent hippocampus and has been implicated in long-term alterations in synaptic efficacy. Acute stress has been shown to negatively affect hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and the present study examined the effect of acute stress on PKC gamma expression/subcellular distribution by quantitative western blotting in two inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J versus DBA/2J) with established differences in hippocampal plasticity. It was found that both DBA/2J and C57BL/6J strains exhibited similar basal, stress-induced elevations, and recovery of serum corticosterone levels. Acute stress produced a significant reduction in both membrane and cytosolic PKC gamma expression in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice compared to no-stress controls, but did not alter either membrane or cytosolic PKC gamma expression in the hippocampus of DBA/2J mice compared to no-stress controls. These data provide direct evidence that PKC gamma is differentially regulated in the hippocampus of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice by acute stress. The role of stress-induced regulation of hippocampal PKC gamma expression in hippocampal synaptic plasticity is discussed.
