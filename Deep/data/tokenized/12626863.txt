Knowledge of symptoms of appropriate brain areas lesion helps to differ psychiatric and neurological disorders. The objective of our work was to find out the situation in scientific research about mental disorder relation to brain lesion location and to except the location of lesions, which are most complicated in differential diagnosis. We discussed the relation of most important mental disorders to brain lesion location. The study of discrete organic cerebral lesions resulting in clearly definable psychiatric disorders may provide an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological basis of these disorders. Different nervous functions need the integrational work of various brain areas. The regions differ from each other by the importance of playing part in corresponding functions. The differential problems appear because various structural brain lesions provide symptoms, similar to mental disorder symptoms. The development of mental disorders and lesion location questions are very urgent. While analyzing the location of lesion, it is important to motivate the theories of development of schizophrenia, organic depression, emotional lability and other disorders.
