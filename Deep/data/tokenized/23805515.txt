OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) on the cAMP/PKA-CREB signaling pathway of hippocampus in mice. METHODS: Accommodating 30 KunMing mice to the animal house for 3 days, then dividing the mice into 5 groups according to their weights. That is, one control group and four experimental groups (I group, 50 mg/kg BW; II group, 250 mg/kg BW; Ill group, 500 mg/kg BW; IV group, 1000 mg/kg BW). The mice were fed with the corn oil in control group, and the other groups were fed with the related dose of DiBP mixture by gavages last for 8 weeks. At the end of experimental time, the mice were killed, and the tissue samples of hippocampus were taken immediately. The content of cAMP was determined by ELISA, and p-CREB, P-PKA C were measured by western blotting, while mRNA expressions including CREB, BDNF, c-fos and c-jun were checked by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The cAMP content and the p-PKA C protein of hippocampus in IV group was significantly less than control group (P<0.05) and compared with control group, the p-CREB protein of hippocampus in 1I group decreased (P<0.05), while the relative level of CREB, BDNF, c-fos and c-jun mRNA were down-regulated in all experimental groups. CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal changes of expression of the signal molecules composing the cAMP/PKA-CREB signaling pathway were observed in the hippocampus of DiBP exposure mice. This might be one of the possible mechanisms of DiBP induced cognitive impairment.
