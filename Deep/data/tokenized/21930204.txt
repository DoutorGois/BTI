In addition to their discharge strongly related to a rat's location in the environment, hippocampal place cells have recently been discovered to carry other more subtle signals. For instance, place cells exhibit overdispersion, i.e., a tendency to have highly variable firing rates across successive passes in the firing field, which may reflect the processing of different classes of cues. In addition, the place cell population tends to fire synchronously during specific phases of place navigation, presumably signaling the animal's arrival at the goal location, or to be reactivated during either sleep or wakefulness following exposure to a new environment, a process thought to be important for memory consolidation. Although these various phenomena are expressed at different timescales, it is very likely that they can occur at the same time during an animal's exposure to a spatial environment. The advantage of such simultaneous processing is that it permits the organism both to be aware of its own location in the environment, and to attend to other environmental features and to store multiple experiences. However its pitfall is that it may result in noisy signals that are difficult to decipher by output structures. Therefore the question is asked of how the information carried by each process can be disentangled. We provide some examples from recent research work showing that this problem is far from being trivial and we propose an explanatory framework in which place cell activity at different timescales could be viewed as a series of dynamic attractors nested within each other.
