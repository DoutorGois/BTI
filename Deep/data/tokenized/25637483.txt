The immune system is an important modulator of learning, memory and neural plasticity. Interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, significantly affects several cognitive processes. Previous studies by our group have demonstrated that intrahippocampal administration of IL-1beta impairs reconsolidation of contextual fear memory. This effect was reversed by the melanocortin alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). The mechanisms underlying the effect of IL-1beta on memory reconsolidation have not yet been established. Therefore, we examined the effect of IL-1beta on glutamate release, ERK phosphorylation and the activation of the transcription factor zinc finger- 268 (zif268) during reconsolidation. Our results demonstrated that IL-1beta induced a significant decrease of glutamate release after reactivation of the fear memory and this effect was related to calcium concentration in hippocampal synaptosomes. IL-1beta also reduced ERK phosphorylation and zif268 expression in the hippocampus. Central administration of alpha-MSH prevented the decrease in glutamate release, ERK phosphorylation and zif268 expression induced by IL-1beta. Our results establish possible mechanisms involved in the detrimental effect of IL-1beta on memory reconsolidation and also indicate that alpha-MSH may exert a beneficial modulatory role in preventing IL-1beta effects.
