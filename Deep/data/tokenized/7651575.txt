Ubiquitin-conjugating activities in the soluble fractions of gerbil cortex and hippocampus following transient ischemia were examined in vitro. Ten minutes of ischemia did not affect the ubiquitination of heat-denatured lysozyme both in the cortex and in the hippocampus. No reduction of the conjugating activities following ischemia was also confirmed using the partially purified ubiquitin conjugating enzymes from the cortex. These results indicate that protein ubiquitination might not be impaired following transient ischemia.
