OBJECTIVE: The seizure network may be different between temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE+HS) and without HS (TLE-HS). Chronic seizure activity may alter the diffusion properties of a seizure network. The thalamus is known to have an anatomical connection to the medial temporal area and to play a role in seizure modulation. This study aimed to evaluate differences in thalamic changes between TLE+HS and TLE-HS with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS: Nine patients with TLE+HS and nine patients with TLE-HS were included in the study. All patients underwent surgery with good seizure outcomes. Hippocampal sclerosis was verified pathologically. Sixteen right-handed, normal subjects were enrolled as controls. DTI was acquired using 3.0 T MRI. The mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated in the center of the bilateral thalamus with the DTIstudio program. RESULTS: The MD of bilateral thalami increased in both TLE groups compared to controls (p<0.05), while FA values did not differ from controls. The MD of the thalamus ipsilateral to the epileptogenic side was higher in the TLE+HS group than in the TLE-HS group (p=0.007). Onset age, seizure duration, seizure frequency and total seizure number were not correlated with FA and MD changes (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Bilateral thalamic diffusion properties are altered in temporal lobe epilepsy. The presence of hippocampal sclerosis enhances the change ipsilaterally.
