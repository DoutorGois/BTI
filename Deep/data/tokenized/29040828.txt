Interictal hypometabolism is commonly measured by 18-fluoro-deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) in the temporal lobe of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE-HS). Left temporal lobe interictal FDG-PET hypometabolism has been associated with verbal memory impairment, while right temporal lobe FDG-PET hypometabolism is associated with nonverbal memory impairment. The biochemical mechanisms involved in these findings remain unknown. In comparison to healthy controls (n=21), surgically treated patients with MTLE-HS (n=32, left side=17) had significant lower scores in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT retention and delayed), Logical Memory II (LMII), Boston Naming test (BNT), Letter Fluency and Category Fluency. We investigated whether enzymatic activities of the mitochondrial enzymes Complex I (C I), Complex II (C II), Complex IV (C IV) and Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) from the resected samples of the middle temporal neocortex (mTCx), amygdala (AMY) and hippocampus (HIP) were associated with performance in the RAVLT, LMII, BNT and fluency tests of our patients. After controlling for the side of hippocampus sclerosis, years of education, disease duration, antiepileptic treatment and seizure outcome after surgery, no independent associations were observed between the cognitive test scores and the analyzed mitochondrial enzymatic activities (p>0.37). Results indicate that memory and language impairment observed in MTLE-HS patients are not strongly associated with the levels of mitochondrial CI, CII, SDH and C IV enzymatic activities in the temporal lobe structures ipsilateral to the HS lesion.
