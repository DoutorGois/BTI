The main kappa opioid receptors (kappaORs) subtypes already described (kappa1ORs and kappa2ORs) are expressed in brain regions involved in aversive memory consolidation, including the dorsal hippocampus (DH). However, the role of DH kappaORs in consolidation of aversive memories with varied intensity and specificity is still uncertain. The present study aimed to investigate this question using pharmacological agents in rats subjected to a weak, moderate or strong contextual aversive conditioning (CAC) protocol. Antagonizing DH kappaORs with nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), immediately after, but not 6h later, a moderate CAC leads to intensified freezing behavior in the re-exposure to the paired context. Thus, indicating that DH kappaORs have an inhibitory role in the consolidation of an aversive memory. Increased DH kappaORs expression 1h and 3h after the moderate CAC was also observed. This up-regulation was absent in animals only exposed to the context or to the shock, indicating that this phenomenon requires a shock-context pairing to occur. Intra-DH nor-BNI infusion induced no changes following a weak CAC, but it was able to potentiate the expression of freezing behavior in novel and unpaired context after a strong CAC, indicating that DH kappaORs also modulate the consolidation of a generalized memory. Moreover, infusing the kappa2ORs agonist GR 89696, but not the kappa1ORs agonist U-69593, into the DH reduced the conditioned freezing expression. Nor-BNI pretreatment in a sub-effective dose prevented the kappa2ORs agonist effects. Altogether, the present findings provide convergent evidence that kappaORs activation negatively modulates contextual aversive memory consolidation in rat dorsal hippocampus.
