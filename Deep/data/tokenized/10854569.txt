Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a major apolipoprotein in the central nervous system (CNS) that may play a role in various CNS disorders. ApoE is primarily localised in astrocytes, but neuronal apoE mRNA expression has been demonstrated in normal and diseased human brain, as well as in ischaemic rat brain. To obtain further insight into the role of apoE in neuronal degeneration in the CNS and conditions of neuronal apoE localisation, we have investigated in mice the distribution of apoE following neuronal injury induced by kainic acid (n=35, 25 or 35 mg kainic acid/kg BW). Consecutive series of brain sections were immunostained for apoE and markers for astroglia (GFAP) and microglia/macrophage cells (CR3). Degenerating neurones were identified with a silver-degeneration staining technique. The intensity and cellular distribution of apoE-immunoreactivity (apoE-ir) was dependent on the severity of neuronal injury. Mice that developed mild neuronal degeneration, restricted to a subset of neurones in the hippocampus, showed increased apoE-ir in astrocytes concomitant with increased GFAP-ir and mild microgliosis. In these mice, no neuronal apoE-ir was detected. In contrast, mice developing severe neuronal injury in the hippocampus - frequently also showing degeneration in other brain regions including cortex, thalamus, striatum and amygdala - showed intense apoE-ir in degenerating neurones. Surrounding the lesion, apoE-ir was increased in neuropil recurrently whereas GFAP-ir astrocytes disappeared. Thus, in mice apoE accumulates in degenerating neurones in conditions of severe neuronal injury putatively in association with disruption of the glial network.
