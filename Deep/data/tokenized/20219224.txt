INTRODUCTION: Cognitive disorders such as deficit of attention and executive and visuoconstructive dysfunctions occur in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Memory impairment is not an early feature and statement not well delimited. CASE REPORT: A 78-year-old man with PDD underwent neuropsychological assessment and moreover demonstrated memory decline. After death, pathology examination of the brain and immunohistochemy analysis confirmed PD and showed Lewy body pathology (LBP) in the insula, limbic and especially in CA3 hippocampus areas. Hippocampus and gyrus parahippocampic also exhibited neurofibrillary tangles. Lack of senile plaque and lack of beta A4 amyloid deposition were noticeable in the whole brain examination. CONCLUSION: Severe executive dysfunctions are probably related to LBP and dysfunction in memory process may be related to DNF lesions in medial temporal area.
