To determine the uptake and distribution of oligodeoxynucleotides in brain, a 20-mer phosphorothioated oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to a portion of the D2 dopamine receptor mRNA was fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and injected into the lateral cerebral ventricles of mice. At various survival times after the injection, the brains were removed, fixed, sectioned, and viewed under a fluorescent microscope. The results showed that the oligodeoxynucleotide was rapidly taken up into the brain. Initially the label was relatively diffusely spread throughout the interstitial spaces of the brain, then became redistributed to the cellular compartments. The signal extended from those forebrain nuclei located immediately in contact with the ventricles, such as the corpus striatum, septum, and hippocampus, to areas further removed from the ventricles, such as the cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, and substantia nigra. When the FITC-labeled D2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide was given once daily for 4 d, the signal intensity seen 24 h after the last injection appeared to be of greater intensity overall compared to that seen after a single injection. At early time-points the oligodeoxynucleotide signals appeared to be punctuated and were found in cell bodies as well as in proximal dendritic processes. However, not all cells were equally labeled, suggesting an uneven uptake and accumulation of the D2 antisense into the various cell types. At later time-points the fluorescent signal appeared granular; at these times the injected material was largely degraded. These studies show that a D2 dopamine receptor antisense oligodeoxynucleotide is rapidly taken up from cerebral ventricles into brain, becomes widely distributed throughout the brain tissue to areas far removed from direct contact with the ventricles, and appears to accumulate to a different extent in the various brain areas and cell types.
