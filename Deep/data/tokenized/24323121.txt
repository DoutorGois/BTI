Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and is caused by the lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression. In-vitro findings in mice and post-mortem autopsies in humans are characterized by dendritic spine abnormalities in the absence of Fmrp/FMRP. Biochemical and electrophysiological studies have identified postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95 as having an established role in dendritic morphology as well as a molecular target of Fmrp. How Fmrp affects the expression of PSD-95 following behavioral learning is unknown. In the current study, wild type controls and Fmr1 knockout mice were trained in a subset of the Hebb-Williams (H-W) mazes. Dorsal hippocampal PSD-95 protein levels relative to a stable cytoskeleton protein (beta-tubulin) were measured. We report a significant upregulation of PSD-95 protein levels in wild type mice, whereas training-related protein increases were blunted in Fmr1 knockout mice. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between mean total errors on the mazes and PSD-95 protein levels. The coefficient of determination indicated that the mean total errors on the H-W mazes accounted for 35% of the variance in PSD-95 protein levels. These novel findings suggest that reduced PSD-95-associated postsynaptic plasticity may contribute to the learning and memory deficits observed in human fragile X syndrome patients.
