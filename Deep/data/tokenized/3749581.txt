The dependent GDH-NADPH activity in adenohypophysis and other cerebral areas, has been studied in hypothyroid rats, in which hypothyroidism has been induced surgically. After thyroidectomy a decrease of GDH activity in limbic system (amygdala, septum and hippocampus), and an increase of this enzyme in cortex and hypothalamus have been found, with no changes in adenohypophysis. The alterations of GDH activity, induced by thyroidectomy, have been corrected, although not uniformly in the different brain areas after L-T3 treatment.
