This study aims to investigate the effects of maternal lead exposure on learning and memory ability and the protein expression of TNF-alpha and SNARE complex (SNAP-25, VAMP-2, and Syntaxin 1A) in hippocampus of mice offspring. Pb exposure was initiated from beginning of gestation to weaning. Pb acetate administered in drinking solutions was dissolved in distilled deionized water at 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% groups, respectively. On the PND21, the learning and memory ability of mouse pups was tested by water maze test, and the Pb levels in their blood and hippocampus were also determined. The protein expression of TNF-alpha and SNARE complex in hippocampus was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The Pb levels in blood and hippocampus of all exposure groups were significantly higher than control group (P < 0.05). In the water maze test, the performances of 0.5% and 1% groups were worse than that of control group (P < 0.05). The expression of TNF-alpha, Syntaxin 1A, and VAMP-2 was increased in Pb-exposed groups comparing control group (P < 0.05), but the expression of SNAP-25 was decreased (P < 0.05). Up-regulation of TNF-alpha and disturbance of SNARE expression in the hippocampus of pups may contribute to impairment of learning and memory ability associated with maternal Pb exposure.
