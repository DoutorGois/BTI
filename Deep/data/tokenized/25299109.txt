The effect and mechanism of different ways of transplanting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were explored for treating cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a rat model. Rats were divided into the cardiopulmonary resuscitation group (Group Con), the stereotactic lateral ventricle transplantation group (Group LV), the internal carotid artery transplantation group (Group A), and the femoral vein transplantation group (Group V). MSCs were transplanted in Groups LV, A, and V. The MSC transplantation groups had a significantly higher neurological score than Group Con on days 3 and 7 after recovery (P < 0.05), and the Group LV score was the highest in all groups (P < 0.05). On day 3 after recovery, the MSC count of Group LV was significantly higher than those of Groups A and V (P < 0.01). On day 7 after recovery, the MSC count in the hippocampus of Group LV was significantly higher than those of Groups A and V (P < 0.05). On day 3 after recovery, the S100B level of Group LV was significantly lower than those of Groups A and V (P < 0.05). On day 7 after recovery, the S100B level was not significantly different between the MSC transplantation groups (P > 0.05). The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor did increased significantly in the MSC transplantation groups on day 7 after recovery, particularly Group LV. Therefore, MSC therapy could significantly improve nerve function after cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and stereotactic lateral ventricle injection transplantation is an optimal method.
