Changes in metabolic activity in the hyperstriatal regions of the chick forebrain have been assessed just prior to and after hatching using [14C] 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) autoradiography. Embryos were injected on day E19, followed by either exposure to light for 30 min or being held in darkness. Other embryos were injected on day E20, after pipping of the egg shell had occurred, and chicks were injected on day 1 (D1) after hatching, followed by light exposure. In the E19 groups metabolic activity in visual regions of the hyperstriatum accessorium (HA) was significantly higher than that in the hyperstriatum dorsale (HD), the region which receives the thalamofugal visual projections. The result was the same in both the light and dark exposed embryos, indicating that the high level of activity in HA on day E19 is not visually driven and that HA may be processing inputs from other sensory modalities. At stage E20 the activities of HA and HD did not differ and by day 1 post-hatching HD activity exceeded that of HA. Activity in HA fell between E19 and E20, while in HD activity rose between E20 and D1. The developmental sequence of metabolic activity levels in the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV), a region involved with imprinting memory formation, was higher on E19 and D1 than on E20. E20 is thus a quiescent period of neural activity in the hyperstriatum prior to hatching. Although a small number of the embryos showed distinct hemispheric asymmetries in metabolic activity, overall there was no significant asymmetry in the embryo groups. The implications of these results for imprinting and early perceptual processing are discussed: it appears that HA activity may be inhibited or limited during the sensitive period for visual imprinting, thereby temporarily diminishing the importance of the thalamofugal visual pathway relative to the tectofugal pathway in the imprinting process.
