Previous work has provided evidence of a role for the hippocampal formation in contextual as opposed to cue conditioning. Similar deficits have been observed after transection of the fimbria/fornix, part of which consists of the hippocampal-nucleus accumbens (N.Acc) connection arising from both the dorsal and ventral subiculum. By means of electrolytic lesions of the N.Acc, we showed that the subiculo-accumbens projection appears to participate in aversive conditioning to context, but not to a cue (tone). Freezing, measured as an index of learning, in the experimental context was greatly reduced in animals with lesions of the N.Acc, as compared with sham-operated controls. No difference was found in freezing to a distinct tone. These data lend further support to the notion that the N.Acc is an important interface between limbic structures and motor output.
