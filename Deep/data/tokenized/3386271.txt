In order to study the receptor system for adrenocortical steroids, hippocampal cytosolic preparations--containing both type I and type II receptors--were subjected to anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). With running buffer containing Tris, EDTA, and glycerol three peaks (1-3) were eluted from the column at 220, 400 and 560 mM NaCl respectively regardless of whether [3H]corticosterone or [3H]RU 28362 had been used as radiotracer. None of the peaks was caused by serum transcortin as revealed by control studies. However, the sequestering influence of transcortin on receptor binding of corticosterone could be demonstrated by the FPLC technique with mixtures containing serum and hippocampus cytosol. Competition experiments with cytosolic samples revealed that type I receptor was present only in peaks 2 and 3 while type II was found in all three peaks in variable amounts, depending on the presence of molybdate. When molybdate was added to the running buffer only two peaks (2 and 3) were eluted, both containing type I and type II receptors. Peak 1 was attributed to the activated type II receptor while peak 2 represented nonactivated receptors. The origin of peak 3 remains uncertain. The data indicate that molybdate must be present in the cytosolic preparation and in the running buffer to keep type II receptor in its nonactivated form. Type I receptor was probably not transformed into the activated form in the absence of molybdate but lost binding capacity and/or affinity for corticosterone.
