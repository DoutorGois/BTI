In the central nervous system (CNS), the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor, NGFR, in cholinergic neurons has been demonstrated. In this study we report that, after exposure to stress, there was a reduction in total binding of NGF in the hippocampus and basal forebrain of 3.5-month-old rats without significant changes in the frontal cortex or cerebellum. Chronic treatment with acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR), that prevents some age-related impairments of CNS, for 1.5 months, decreased NGF binding in hippocampus and basal forebrain but abolished the stress-related reduction of NGF binding observed in the hippocampus of untreated rats.
