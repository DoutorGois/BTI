Clinical expression of temporal lobe seizures is different with a more diverse and more extensive etiology in infants and children than it is in adults. It is dominated by cortical dysplasia, low-grade tumors and perinatal damage. Hippocampal sclerosis, although less frequent, exists in children usually as a dual pathology associated with ipsilateral neocortical lesions. The clinical semiology of temporal seizures is more varied, and sometimes misleading. Motor features including tonic, clonic or myoclonic behaviors, and infantile spasms predominate in infants. Classical complex partial seizures with behavioral arrest and automatisms, as well as lateralizing signs are rare and occur mostly with onset after the age of two years. Interestingly, aura, emotional, and autonomic signs seem to be independent on the brain maturation process. Moreover, the neuropsychological profile varies according to age of onset and duration, lateralization of the focus and etiology. Quality of care benefits from individual cognitive assessment for memory and emotional processes.
