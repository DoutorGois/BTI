The morphology and molecular composition of synapses provide the structural basis for synaptic function. This article reviews the electron microscopy of excitatory synapses on dendritic spines, using data from rodent hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellar cortex. Excitatory synapses have a prominent postsynaptic density, in contrast with inhibitory synapses, which have less dense presynaptic or postsynaptic specializations and are usually found on the cell body or proximal dendritic shaft. Immunogold labeling shows that the presynaptic active zone provides a scaffold for key molecules involved in the release of neurotransmitter, whereas the postsynaptic density contains ligand-gated ionic channels, other receptors, and a complex network of signaling molecules. Delineating the structure and molecular organization of these axospinous synapses represents a crucial step toward understanding the mechanisms that underlie synaptic transmission and the dynamic modulation of neurotransmission associated with short- and long-term synaptic plasticity.
