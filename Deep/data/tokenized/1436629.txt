Very recently, contradictory results were presented as to the effects of exogenous nerve growth factor (NGF) on the hippocampal delayed neuronal necrosis following transient ischemia. In the present study, we administered a large amount of NGF with the atelocollagen mini-pellet system, measured the local NGF contents, and evaluated the effect of this neurotrophic factor on the postischemic hippocampal pyramidal cells in gerbils. We concluded that the exogenous NGF, when given continuously at sufficient concentrations, prevents pyramidal cell damage. The possible cause of discrepancy in previous studies is discussed.
