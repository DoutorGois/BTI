Numbers of dystrophic neurites, seen with the electron microscope, in CA1 of the hippocampus of either C3H mice infected with 22C or 79A strains of scrapie, or LM mice infected with strain ME7 were greater than in age-matched control mice. Vacuolation, seen by light microscopy in CA1 of the hippocampus of mice infected with either 22C or 79A, preceded the increase in dystrophic neurites by up to about 20 days. In mice infected with ME7, however, the vacuolation followed the increase in dystrophic neurites by some 20 to 40 days. In view of the differences in the times at which dystrophic neurites and vacuolation were seen, no causative relationship between the two lesions appeared to exist.
