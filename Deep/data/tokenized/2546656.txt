Transient forebrain ischemia is followed within minutes by accelerated proteolysis of the cytoskeletal protein, spectrin. This effect is most pronounced in the selectively vulnerable CA1 region of hippocampus which also experiences a second proteolytic phase during the terminal stages of neuronal degeneration. Both proteolytic phases are suppressed by MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist. Cytoskeletal disruption, via NMDA receptor-linked proteolytic events, is suggested to predispose vulnerable neurons to delayed cell death.
