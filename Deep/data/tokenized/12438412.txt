Transformation of a contact between axon and dendrite into a synapse is accompanied by accumulation of the synaptic machinery at this site, being delivered in intracellular organelles mainly of TGN origin. Here, we report that in cultured hippocampal neurons, TGN organelles are linked via spectrin to clusters of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the plasma membrane. These complexes are translocated along neurites and trapped at sites of initial neurite-to-neurite contacts within several minutes after initial contact formation. The accumulation of TGN organelles at contacts with NCAM-deficient neurons is reduced when compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that NCAM mediates the anchoring of intracellular organelles in nascent synapses.
