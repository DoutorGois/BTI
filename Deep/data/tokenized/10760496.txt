To investigate a potential role of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in transient global ischemia, we have studied the postischemic regulatory changes in the expression of CNTF and its receptor, the ligand-binding alpha-subunit (CNTFRalpha). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated CNTF levels were slightly upregulated already during the first day after ischemia and then increased markedly by more than 10-fold until 2 weeks postischemia. Immunoreactivity for CNTF became detectable 1 day after ischemia and was localized in reactive astrocytes. The intensity of the immunolabeling was maximal in CA1 during the phase of neuronal cell death (days 3-7 postischemia) and in the deafferented inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. Upregulation of CNTF expression was less pronounced in CA3 and absent in the stratum lacunosum moleculare and the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and thus did not simply correlate with astroliosis as represented by upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). As shown by in situ hybridization, expression of CNTFRalpha mRNA was restricted to neurons of the pyramidal cell and granule cell layers in control animals. Following ischemia, reactive astrocytes, identified by double labeling with antibodies to GFAP, transiently expressed CNTFRalpha mRNA with a maximum around postischemic day 3. This astrocytic response was most pronounced in CA1 and in the hilar part of CA3. These results show that CNTF and its receptor are differentially regulated in activated astrocytes of the postischemic hippocampus, indicating that they are involved in the regulation of astrocytic responses and the neuronal reorganizations occurring after an ischemic insult.
