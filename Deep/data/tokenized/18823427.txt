Impaired P50 gating is thought to reflect a core deficit in schizophrenia, but the relevant neural network is not well understood. The present study used EEG and MEG to assess sensory gating and volumetric MRI to measure hippocampal volume to investigate relationships between them in 22 normal controls and 22 patients with schizophrenia. In the schizophrenia group, anterior but not posterior hippocampal volume was smaller, and both the P50 and M50 gating ratios were larger (worse) than in controls. Independent of group, left-hemisphere M50 gating ratio correlated negatively with left anterior hippocampal volume, and right-hemisphere M50 gating ratio correlated negatively with right anterior hippocampal volume. Schizophrenia diagnosis predicted M50 gating independent of hippocampal volume. These results are consistent with the finding that hippocampus is a critical part of a fronto-temporal circuit involved in auditory gating.
