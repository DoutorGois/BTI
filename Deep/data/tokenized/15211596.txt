Ischemia/reperfusion-associated translation inhibition in the hippocampus is attenuated significantly at reinitiation and elongation steps by ischemic preconditioning (Burda et al. [2003] Neurochem. Res. 28:1237-1243). To address potential regulation of the elongation step by changes in eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) phosphorylation with and without acquired ischemic tolerance (IT), Wistar rats were preconditioned by 5-min sublethal ischemia and 2 days later, 30-min lethal ischemia was induced. Given the important role that oxidative stress plays in the ischemic process, eEF2 phosphorylation was also studied in a model of oxidative stress in vitro. Three blocks of our results support a lack of correlation between eEF2 phosphorylation status and protein synthesis rate. First, eEF2 was dephosphorylated significantly (activated) after transient cerebral ischemia in rats with and without IT or H2O2-treated cells; however, protein synthesis was significantly inhibited under these three conditions. Second, after 30-min reperfusion, the protein synthesis rate was maintained below control levels in cortex and hippocampus of rats without IT. Eukaryotic EF2 phosphorylated levels were notably low only in the cortex, whereas levels in the hippocampus were close to that of sham controls. In rats with IT, protein synthesis was virtually restored in both brain regions, but phosphorylated eEF2 levels were even higher than in rats without IT. Third, after 4-hr reperfusion, the protein synthesis rate in cortex and hippocampus was observed to be below sham control values in rats with and without IT. Conversely, phosphorylated eEF2 levels were below sham control in rats with IT and reached sham control values in rats without IT.
