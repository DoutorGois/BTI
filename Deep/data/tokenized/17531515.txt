When simultaneous presentation of odor and taste cues precedes illness, rats acquire robust aversion to both conditioned stimuli. Such a phenomenon referred to as taste-potentiated odor aversion (TPOA) requires information processing from two sensory modalities. Whether similar or different brain networks are activated when TPOA memory is retrieved by either the odor or the taste presentation remains an unsolved question. By means of Fos mapping, we investigated the neuronal substrate underlying TPOA retrieval elicited by either the odor or the taste conditioned stimulus. Whatever the sensory modality used to reactivate TPOA memory, a significant change in Fos expression was observed in the hippocampus, the basolateral nucleus of amygdala and the medial and the orbito-frontal cortices. Moreover, only the odor presentation elicited a significantly higher Fos immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex and the insular cortex. Lastly, according to the stimulus tested to induce TPOA retrieval, the BLA was differentially activated and a higher Fos expression was induced by the odor than by the taste in this nucleus. The present study indicates that even if they share some brain regions, the cerebral patterns induced by either the odor or the taste are different. Data are discussed in view of the relevance of each conditioned stimulus to reactivate TPOA memory and of the involvement of the different labeled brain areas in information processing and TPOA retrieval.
