We studied the involvement of hippocampal protein synthesis-, PKA-, and MAP kinase-dependent processes in short- (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) for inhibitory avoidance task. Fifteen minutes before or immediately after training rats received intrahippocampal infusions of vehicle, the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPs or the MAPKK inhibitor PD098059. The results show that STM recruits PKA and MAPK, whereas, LTM depends on PKA activity and protein synthesis during the early post-training period.
