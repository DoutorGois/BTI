The density of diffuse, primitive, classic and compact beta-amyloid (beta/A4) deposits was estimated in the hippocampus and adjacent gyri in human patients with Down's syndrome (DS) and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The objective of the study was to determine whether there were differences in beta/A4 deposition in DS and sporadic AD and whether these differences could be attributed to overexpression of the amyloid precursor gene (APP) in DS. Total beta/A4 deposit density was greater in DS than AD in all brain regions studied but the DS/AD density ratios varied between brain regions. In the majority of brain regions, the ratio of primitive to diffuse beta/A4 deposits was greater in DS but the ratio of classic to diffuse deposits was greater in AD. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that overexpression of the APP gene in DS may lead to increased beta/A4 deposition. However, local brain factors also appear to be important in beta/A4 deposition in DS. Overexpression of the APP gene may also be responsible for increased production of paired helical filaments (PHF) and result in enhanced formation of primitive beta/A4 deposits in DS. In addition, increased formation of classic deposits in AD suggests that factors necessary for the production of a compact amyloid core are enhanced in AD compared with DS.
