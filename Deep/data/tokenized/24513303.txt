The search for immune biomarkers in psychiatric disorders has primarily focused on pro-inflammatory cytokines. Other immune proteins including chemokines have been relatively neglected in such studies. Recent evidence has implicated chemokines in many neurobiological processes potentially relevant to psychiatric disorders, beyond their classical chemotactic functions. These may include neuromodulator effects, neurotransmitter-like effects, and direct/indirect regulation of neurogenesis. This systematic review presents the existing early evidence which supports an association of many chemokines with the psychiatric disorders: depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The non-specific association of chemokines including CXCL8 (IL-8), CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha) and CCL5 (RANTES) with these disorders across diagnostic categories implies a generalised involvement of many chemokine systemic with psychiatric disease. Additional chemokines with great mechanistic relevance including CXCL12 (SDF-1) and CX3CL1 (fractalkine) have been rarely reported in the existing human literature and should be included in future clinical studies. The potential utility of these proteins as pathologically relevant biomarkers or therapeutic targets should be considered by future clinical and translational research.
