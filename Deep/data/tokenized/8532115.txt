A deficient regulation of neuronal cytosolic calcium levels has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. However, evidence for an alteration in cytosolic calcium regulation in old age is at present controversial. The present work was aimed at studying whether changes in synaptosomal calcium homeostasis in 30-month-old rats are uniform throughout the brain or affect specific brain regions. A second question addressed in this work is whether the effect of ageing on calcium homeostasis is restricted to the nerve terminal or a more general process affecting also cell bodies. To study these questions cytosolic calcium regulation was studied in parallel in synaptosomes and a preparation of acutely dissociated brain cells obtained from different regions of 3- and 30-month-old rats. 45Ca2+ accumulation and distribution in mitochondria (assessed as FCCP-releasable 45Ca2+) was also studied. Mean [Ca2+]i obtained at rest and after high K+ depolarization were unchanged in cerebral cortex synaptosomes but increased in hippocampal synaptosomes at 30 months. Resting [Ca2+]i also increased with age in hippocampal, but not cerebral cortex cells, whereas the increase in [Ca2+]i obtained by depolarization was larger in both brain regions. Calcium compartmentation in mitochondria from hippocampal neurons incubated under high K+ conditions was also decreased with ageing. An altered calcium regulation in cell bodies and synaptic terminals in the hippocampus may be involved in the development of functional impairments in the hippocampal formation.
