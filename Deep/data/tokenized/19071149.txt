The synthesis of several novel 5alpha- and 5beta-20-oxo-pregnane derivatives substituted in the position 3 and 7 of the steroid skeleton is described. Activity of synthesized compounds was studied in voltage-clamped cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Substituted derivatives inhibited NMDA-elicited neuronal activity. The relationship between biological activity and structure is discussed.
