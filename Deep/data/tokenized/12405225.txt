Many experiments in the past have demonstrated the requirement of de novo gene expression during the long-term retention of learning and memory. Although previous studies implicated individual genes or genetic pathways in learning and memory they did not uncover the collective behaviors of the genes. In view of the broad variety of genes and the cross-talk of genetic pathways, gene expression profiles offer a new dynamic and functional dimension to the exploration of learning and memory. This review illustrates how DNA microarray-based gene expression profiling may help to dissect and analyze the complex mechanisms involved in gene regulation during the acquisition and storage of memory.
