To assess a potential relationship between cortical neurofibrillary degeneration and cortical cholinergic deafferentation, the load of PHF-tau was analysed in eight cortical regions and in the basal nucleus of Meynert in 12 cases with Alzheimer's disease by means of a sensitive ELISA employing the monoclonal antibody B5-2. The activity of choline acetyltransferase was determined on identical tissue samples. The results demonstrate a highly correlative relationship between the cortical distribution of the amount of PHF-tau, mainly present in neuropil threads, and cholinergic depletion early during the course of the disease. This relationship was less strong in more advanced stages. The results support the suggestion that the formation of PHF-tau in cholinergic axon terminals which might result in a loss of cholinergic synapses and a cholinergic dysconnection of the cortex, is an early event in AD. During the progression of the disease, formation of PHF-tau appears to spread over the cortex which results in a more even distribution of neuropil threads and a progressive involvement of non-cholinergic neurons.
