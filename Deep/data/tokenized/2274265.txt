Using quantitative autoradiography of [3H]forskolin we have visualized the activated states of adenylate cyclase in the hippocampal formation bilaterally in sections from schizophrenic brain and age-matched controls. There is a generalized increase in binding in schizophrenic hippocampi, particularly in the CA1 region and parahippocampal gyrus. The effect is particularly marked in the left parahippocampal gyrus. These findings add some support to the notion of schizophrenia as a medial temporal lobe disorder and suggest novel substrates as therapeutic targets in schizophrenia.
