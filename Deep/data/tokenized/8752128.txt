The effects of CNS axotomy on glutamate transporter and glutamate receptor expression were evaluated in adult rats following unilateral fimbria-fornix transections. The septum and hippocampus were collected at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days postlesion. Homogenates were immunoblotted by using antibodies directed against glutamate transporters (GLT-1, GLAST, and EAAC1) and glutamate receptors (GluR1, GluR2/3, GluR6/7, and NMDAR1), and they were assayed for glutamate transport by D-[3H]aspartate binding. GLT-1 was decreased at 7 and 14 days postlesion within the ipsilateral septum and at 7 days postlesion in the hippocampus. GLAST was decreased within the ipsilateral septum and hippocampus at 7 and 14 days postlesion. No postlesion alterations in EAAC1 immunoreactivity were observed. D-[3H]Aspartate binding was decreased at 7, 14, and 30 days postlesion within the ipsilateral septum and 14 days postlesion in the hippocampus. GluR2/3 expression was down-regulated at 30 days postlesion within the ipsilateral septum, whereas GluR1, GluR6/7, and NMDAR1 immunoreactivity was unchanged. In addition, no alterations in glutamate receptor expression were detected within hippocampal homogenates. This study demonstrates a selective down-regulation of primarily glial, and not neuronal, glutamate transporters and a delayed, subtype-specific down-regulation of septal GluR2/3 receptor expression after regional deafferentation within the CNS.
