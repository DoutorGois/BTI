We report an 84-year-old woman who was clinically diagnosed with late-life major depression (LLMD) and having a diffuse type of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) neuropathologically. Clinically, this case showed depressive mood, anxiety, and irritation, but did not show cognitive dysfunction, visual hallucination, fluctuation of alertness and parkinsonism, which define the criteria for diagnosing DLB. Neuropathological examination demonstrated abundant Lewy-related pathology including Lewy bodies and neurites in the hippocampal region and the cerebral cortex, and moderate levels in brain stem nuclei including the substantia nigra, locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus. These findings suggest the possibility that Lewy-related pathology is associated with the depressive symptoms. Furthermore, it must be noted that some patients diagnosed with LLMD clinically may develop pathology of DLB without the typical or usual clinical symptoms.
