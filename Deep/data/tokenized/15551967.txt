OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Capsule Yizhi on the delayed neuronal death in hippocampal CA1 region and memory function after global cerebral ischemia in rats. METHODS: The model of acute reperfusion injury after cerebral ischemia in rats was made by vertebral and carotid arteries occlusion. 1,2,4,8 and 40 days later, the neurons in hippocampal CA1 region were immunohistochemically stained and calculated. And the Morris water maze test was carried out to observe the learning and memory capacities in the 40th day. RESULTS: The number of normal neurons was significantly higher in Capsule Yizhi (100 mg/kg) group than that in the control group. Compared with the control group, Capsule Yizhi (100 mg/kg) could significantly shorten time in finding the platform under the water surface in Morris water maze test. CONCLUSION: Capsule Yizhi had protective effects on neurons in hippocampal CA1 region,and presented promising effects on learning and memory dysfunction after global ischemia/reperfusion injury.
