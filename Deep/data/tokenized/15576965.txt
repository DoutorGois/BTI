The calcium influx plays an important role of the neuronal signal transduction of the central nervous system. There are several pathways of the calcium influx, such as voltage dependent calcium channel and receptor associated calcium channel. It has been demonstrated that these channels are associated with not only neurons but also glial cells. These channels are also indicated to be related to the neuronal plasticity of the hippocampus and cerebellum. Recently, the transcription factor CREB are also reported as the new mechanism of memory in hippocampus.
