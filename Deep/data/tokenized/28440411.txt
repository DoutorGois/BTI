Therapeutic exercise is an integral component of the rehabilitation of patients who have suffered a stroke. The objective of the present study was to use immunohistochemistry to investigate the effects of postischemic exercise on neuronal damage or death and gliosis in the aged gerbil hippocampus following transient cerebral ischemia. Aged gerbils (male; age, 2224 months) underwent ischemia and were subjected to treadmill exercise for 1 or 4 weeks. Neuronal death was detected in the stratum pyramidale of the hippocampal CA1 region and in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus using cresyl violet and FluoroJade B histofluorescence staining. No significant difference in neuronal death was identified following 1 or 4 weeks of postischemic treadmill exercise. However, postischemic treadmill exercise affected gliosis (the activation of astrocytes and microglia). Glial fibrillary acidic proteinimmunoreactive astrocytes and ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1immunoreactive microglia were activated in the CA1 and polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus of the group without treadmill exercise. Conversely, 4 weeks of treadmill exercise significantly alleviated ischemiainduced astrocyte and microglial activation; however, 1 week of treadmill exercise did not alleviate gliosis. These findings suggest that longterm postischemic treadmill exercise following transient cerebral ischemia does not influence neuronal protection; however, it may effectively alleviate transient cerebral ischemiainduced astrocyte and microglial activation in the aged hippocampus.
