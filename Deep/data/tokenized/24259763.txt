[Purpose] In the present study, we investigated the effects of treadmill training on limb motor function and acetylcholinesterase activity following focal cerebral ischemia injury. [Methods] Focal cerebral ischemia was examined in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by using a middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group I included untreated normal rats (n=12), Group II included untreated rats with focal cerebral ischemia (n=12), and Group III included rats that performed treadmill exercise (20 m/min) training after focal cerebral ischemia (n=12). We determined the limb placement test score for each rat on days 1,7, 14, and 21; acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was examined at the end of the experiment. [Results] We observed that the motor behavior index improved in the treadmill group, and hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity was decreased. [Conclusion] These results indicated that treadmill training after focal cerebral ischemia exerts a neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain injury by improving motor performance and decreasing the levels of acetylcholinesterase activity. Furthermore, these results suggest that treadmill training at an appropriate intensity is critical for post-stroke rehabilitation.
