Kainate receptors are involved in a variety of synaptic functions in the CNS including the regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Previously we described the depressant action of the GLU(K5) selective agonist (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (ATPA) on synaptic transmission in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway of rat hippocampal slices. In the present study we report several new features of the actions of ATPA at this synapse. Firstly, the effectiveness of ATPA is developmentally regulated. Secondly, the effects of ATPA decline during prolonged or repeated applications. Thirdly, the effects of ATPA are not mediated indirectly via activation of GABA(A), GABA(B), muscarinic or adenosine A(1) receptors. Fourthly, elevating extracellular Ca(2+) from 2 to 4 mM antagonises the effects of ATPA. Some differences between the actions of ATPA and kainate on synaptic transmission in the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway are also noted.
