To clarify the role of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) in ischaemic tolerance following pretreatment with sublethal cerebral ischaemia, we examined whether the induction of tolerance in the gerbil hippocampus is inhibited by quercetin, an inhibitor of HSP70 expression, or anti-HSP70 antibody. A 3 min period of forebrain ischaemia was induced following pretreatment with 2 min of ischaemia and 3 days of reperfusion. Quercetin or anti-HSP70 antibody was continuously infused into the left lateral ventricle using an implanted osmotic minipump started 3 h after or 2 h before the first ischaemia. The animals were killed 4 days after the second ischaemia for histological observations. Both agents produced no neuronal damage in the brain following a single 2 min period of ischaemia. The neuronal density of the CA1 hippocampus in animals subjected to treatment with quercetin and anti-HSP70 antibody was significantly lower than vehicle-treated animals but were significantly higher than animals with a single 3 min period of ischaemia. Thus, the present study showed that quercetin and anti-HSP70 antibody prevent the induction of ischaemic tolerance. The result suggests that HSP70 expression, at least in part, plays a role in the induction of ischaemic tolerance.
