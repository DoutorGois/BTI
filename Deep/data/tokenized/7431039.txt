After a brief training period (2 x 25 min) consisting of reversal of handedness, soluble protein synthesis in the hippocampus was measured by incorporation of [3H]leucine and double labelling with [3H]valine and [14C]valine together with densitometric tracings of polyacrylamide gels. Among the proteins showing increased incorporation values, 3 polypeptides of mol. wt. 13,000, 30,000 and 65,000 were found. Thus, the soluble protein-polypeptide pattern in the hippocampus was found to be altered after a short training period for the establishment of a new behavior.
