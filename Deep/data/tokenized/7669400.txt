The authors assessed proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in patients with unilateral refractory temporal bole epilepsy. The subjects consisted of 20 patients (those with brain tumors, trauma, malformations or definite organic lesions were excluded) and 10 normal volunteers. 1H-MRS and MRI were performed using a 1.5 tesla machine. 1H-MRS was achieved using point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) or the stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM), and a 3 x 3 x 3 cm volume of interest was positioned at the hippocampus. N-Acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and choline-containing substance (Cho) signals were evaluated. The results showed decreased NAA and elevated Cho or asymmetry of both NAA and Cho in the epileptogenic focus in 19/20 cases. The reductions in NAA presumably reflect neuronal loss, while the elevation of Cho probably represents membrane break down within the lesion. These abnormalities were observed in 19/20 cases (95%), whereas abnormal magnetic resonance imaging was detected in only 6/20 (30%) of the patients. Thus, 1H-MRS appears to be a useful, non-invasive modality for evaluating metabolic changes in epileptogenic foci, and these metabolic changes can serve as a more sensitive indicator than magnetic resonance imaging.
