The actions of alpha-kainic acid (KA) were reexamined in thin sections of the hippocampus and the cerebellum of the guinea pig in view of various discrepancies between our previous findings and reports from other laboratories. Brief pulses of KA ejected in st. lucidum in the CA3 region induced short- and long-lasting depolarizations in neurons nearby, whereas those ejected in st. radiatum or st. oriens induced only short-lasting responses. Neurons in CA1 region and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum generated only short-lasting depolarizations in response to KA pulses ejected in their dendritic fields. The short-lasting KA responses in CA1 region were sensitive to gamma-D-glutamylglycine and pentobarbital. The slow KA responses were suppressed by kynurenic acid. They were not accompanied by increases in extracellular potassium concentration. These results suggest that the mossy fiber-innervated portions of the surface membrane of CA3 neurons have a type of KA receptor different from those ubiquitously distributed in central neurons.
