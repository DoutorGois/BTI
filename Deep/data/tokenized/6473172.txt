FMRFamide immunoreactive material (irFMRFamide) was studied in rat brain and gastrointestinal tract. Highest irFMRFamide concentrations were found in tissues of the gastrointestinal tract and, in the brain, highest concentrations were found in the hippocampus, midbrain, brainstem and hypothalamus. High pressure liquid chromatographic characterization of irFMRFamide demonstrated that the immunoreactive material in brain, pancreas and duodenum was different from molluscan FMRFamide but it was also distinct from any known neuropeptide.
