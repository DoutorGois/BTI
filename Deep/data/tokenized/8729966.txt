The fimbria is a major route for afferent and efferent fibers of the hippocampal formation. However, little is known about the intrinsic organization of the fimbria-fornix complex. In this study, the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHAL) was used to analyze the ultrastructure and topography of identified fiber tracts within the fimbria-fornix. Septo-hippocampal fibers are loosely distributed throughout the fimbria-fornix. Commissural fibers cross the midline in the ventral hippocampal commissure and form a tight fiber bundle in the fimbria. Crossed entorhino-hippocampal fibers cross the midline in the ventral hippocampal commissure rostral to the commissural fiber bundle, and crossed entorhino-entorhinal fibers pass through the dorsal hippocampal commissure. This suggests a topographical organization of fiber tracts within the fimbria-fornix that reflects the laminar organization of the hippocampal target structure: fibers of the diffusely terminating septohippocampal projection are loosely distributed throughout the fimbria-fornix, while those projections that are known to terminate in specific laminae of the hippocampal formation (commissural projection, crossed entorhino-hippocampal projection) form fiber bundles within the fimbria and the ventral hippocampal commissure.
