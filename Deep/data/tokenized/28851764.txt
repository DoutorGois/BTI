GPR52 is a Gs-coupled G protein-coupled receptor that is predominantly expressed in the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc) and was recently proposed as a potential therapeutic target for schizophrenia. In the current study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic activities of a novel GPR52 agonist, 4-(3-(3-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-2-methy lbenzamide (FTBMT). FTBMT functioned as a selective GPR52 agonist in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the activation of Camp signaling in striatal neurons. FTBMT inhibited MK-801-induced hyperactivity, an animal model for acute psychosis, without causing catalepsy in mice. The c-fos expression also revealed that FTBMT preferentially induced neuronal activation in the shell of the Nac compared with the striatum, thereby supporting its antipsychotic-like activity with less catalepsy. Furthermore, FTBMT improved recognition memory in a novel object-recognition test and attenuated MK-801-induced working memory deficits in a radial arm maze test in rats. These recognitive effects were supported by the results of FTBMT-induced c-fos expression in the brain regions related to cognition, including the medial prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus. Taken together, these findings suggest that FTBMT shows antipsychotic and recognitive properties without causing catalepsy in rodents. Given its unique pharmacologic profile, which differs from that of current antipsychotics, FTBMT may provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of positive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.
