Errors in the generation of the inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus have variable consequences. Studies of the molecular pathways of interneuron development reveal genes that are associated with human epilepsies. Animal models of gene variants exhibit seizures and abnormal electroencephalographic activity, providing unique models for discovering better treatments for individual forms of epilepsy.
