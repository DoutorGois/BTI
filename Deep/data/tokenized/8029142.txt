A concept of regulatory mechanism of abnormal activity in epileptic foci is discussed, basing on the results of current experimental studies. Such a model is illustrated with an example of basket and pyramidal cell in the hippocampus, results of simulation studies of the role of stimulating and inhibiting junctions in synchronous discharges of high frequency which are an equivalent of epileptic activity in the foci.
