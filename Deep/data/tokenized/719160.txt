The author compared the protein composition of the brain structures (premotor zone of the cortex, CA3 are of the hyppocampus, the caudate nucleus, the frontal lobe of the cerebellum) in rats by electrophoresis in the continuous gradient of polyacrylamide gel pores in capillaries. The method used proved to possess a much greater resolving capacity in comparison with electrophoresis in the homogeneous gel concentration; no differences could be revealed in the protein composition of the brain structures under study.
