PKC is implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. We examined the association of PKCbeta with mitochondria and followed postischemic changes in its amount in mitochondria isolated from ischemia-vulnerable (CA1) and ischemia-resistant (CA2-4,DG) hippocampus in gerbil model of transient brain ischemia. Our observations suggest that transient ischemic episode induces a significant, rapid and long lasting increase of PKCbeta in mitochondria in CA2-4,DG, which may bespeak neuroprotection. In organotypic hippocampal culture (OHC) model of neurodegeneration, PKCbeta inhibition imposed over NMDA toxicity extended the death area beyond the CA1. These results suggest that PKCbeta might have a protective effect against excitotoxic damage in rat OHC. The pull-down method and LC-MS/MS analysis revealed mitochondrial proteins that can bind directly with PKCbetaIota. The proteins were parts of i) mitochondrial redox carriers forming the electron transport chain including ATP synthase and ii) MPTP: ANT and creatine kinase. PKCbeta acting through mitochondrial proteins could play a role in protecting the cells from death by e.g. influencing ROS and ATP production after ischemia in CA2-4,DG region of the hippocampus.
