OBJECTIVE To determine values of perfusion parameters determined via MRI in the brains of healthy dogs. ANIMALS 10 healthy adult Beagles. PROCEDURES Each dog was anesthetized for MRI examination of the brain, including standard sequences and a perfusion-weighted sequence. Gadoteric acid (0.2 mmol/kg) was injected IV at a rate of 5 mL/s. A dedicated workstation was used to measure the times from contrast medium injection to arrival at an ROI (TO) and peak contrast enhancement (TTP), mean contrast medium transport time (MTT), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, piriform lobe, hippocampus, semioval center, and temporal cerebral cortex. A simple mathematical model was used to compare parameter values among the various brain regions. RESULTS T0 and time to peak contrast enhancement had a significant linear relationship. A significant negative correlation was identified between T0 and CBF and, to a lesser extent, between MTT and CBF. Differences among brain regions were significant for MTT and CBF. The CBF was lowest in the semioval center, and the piriform lobe had almost 2-fold the CBF of that region. No significant differences were identified between hemispheres of the brain. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings obtained in this study involving healthy dogs may serve as a reference for MRI perfusion measurements in specific brain regions and may help in the characterization of various brain diseases in dogs.
