Study of the time course of the content of 3 brain proteins in 6 different structures of the central nervous system 1 and 7 days after the conditioned reflex development has shown that both specific and nonspecific proteins of nervous tissue may participate in the processes that accompany the formation of the memory trace. The visual cortex appeared to be the most active in these processes, which may be accounted for by the use in this model of light as conditioned stimulus.
