OBJECTIVE: To observe the distribution of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and microvessel density (MVD) in different brain regions in aged rats and determine the role of VEGF and MVD in the aging process of the nervous system. METHODS: We observed the expression of VEGF and MVD in different parts of rat brain in the 3- month group and 30-month group with immunohistochemical technique. RESULTS: Compared with the 3-month group, the 30-month group showed fewer VEGF-positive cells and MVD in the brain (P<0.01), and the number varied significantly in different brain regions (P<0.01). The motor cortex region contained more VEGF-positive cells and MVD than the hippocampus and cerebellum. CONCLUSION: VEGF-positive cells and MVD are decreased in every brain region of aged rats, and the motor cortex region contains more positive cells, suggesting exogenous VEGF may enhance the formation of microvessels and delay the aging of the nervous system.
