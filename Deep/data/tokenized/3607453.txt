Pretreatment of hippocampal slices with glutamine doubled the recovery rate of the synaptic function (electrically evoked population spike) from a standardized hypoxic insult in CA1 pyramidal neurons. This protective effect of glutamine was dose-dependent and biphasic; recovery of synaptic function was observed in 44% of the control slices and in 55%, 90%, 92% and 0% of slices pretreated with 0.1, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 mM glutamine, respectively. The synaptic function did not recover after hypoxia in slices pretreated with glutamic acid (1.0 mM).
