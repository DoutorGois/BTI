Cognitive decline is known to be associated with both increased theta power over frontal regions and hippocampal atrophy. The aim of this study was to reveal the relation between these parameters in groups with mild dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy control subjects. The authors examined a preliminary randomly selected sample of 39 right-handed subjects joining the Leipzig Longitudinal Study of the Aged, consisting of 17 normal elderly subjects, 12 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 10 patients with mild dementia assessed by Clinical Dementia Rating. All subjects were between 75 and 85 years old (mean age, 78 years; standard deviation, 2.78 years) and underwent EEG and brain MRI. Mean spectral power densities were calculated, and hippocampal body volume was measured. Significant negative linear correlations between theta power over frontal regions and hippocampal volumes were found. The results support the assumption about a relationship between hippocampal atrophy and theta power, and may be helpful for a better understanding of the course of Alzheimer's disease.
