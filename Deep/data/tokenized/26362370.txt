PURPOSE: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common variety of focal epilepsy among adults. The neuroinflammatory mechanisms of epilepsies may be involved in the genesis of seizures and refractory epilepsies, particularly in the case of progressive syndromes such as TLE associated with mesial hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS). The goal of the present study is investigate the genetic profile of susceptibility of individuals with TLE-HS by analyzing the possible association of TLE-HS with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 alleles. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 42 individuals with pharmacoresistant TLE-HS and 89 healthy controls. The typing of the HLA class II alleles from DRB1, DQB1, and DQA1 loci were analyzed using sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction (SSP-PCR) and identified through sequencing. Statistical analysis of relative allele frequencies was performed using an Excel spreadsheet; p-value, relative risk (RR), and odds ratio (OR) were calculated using the software Epi Info 6.0. p-values <0.05 following Bonferroni's method correction were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: HLA-DRB1*13:02 was the only allele with a statistically significant difference (p=0.01) in frequency between patients and controls. However, the significance was lost following Bonferroni's method correction (p=0.44). The remainder of the alleles in the HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 regions did not exhibit any significant association. CONCLUSION: The allele HLA DRB1*13:02 has exhibited a tendency to behave as a susceptibility factor for TLE-HS.
