AIM: To investigate the effect of antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN) of noggin on rat spatial learning and memory. METHODS: Expression of noggin mRNA was measured by in situ hybridization method and the ability to spatial learning and memory was tested with Morris water maze. RESULTS: Compared with control rats, noggin mRNA positive neurons in dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 region of hippocampus were markedly increased after the Morris water maze training (P<0.01). The increase of noggin mRNA positive neurons in hippocampus following maze training could be significantly blocked by icv injection of antisense noggin ODN, and the injection also impaired the learning and memory formation as compared to that in control rats. But the sense oligonucleotide (SODN) had no effect. CONCLUSION: Noggin, as an embryonic gene expressed in adult hippocampus, plays an important role in the process of learning and memory formation.
