The rat strains Naples high-excitable (NHE) and Naples low-excitable (NLE) have been selectively bred since 1976 for behavioral arousal in a spatial novelty situation. The Timm-stained hippocampi of 20 NHE and 18 NLE rats were examined morphometrically for differences in the proportions (volume percentages) of terminal fields in the fascia dentata and CA3/CA4 at the mid-septotemporal level. Prior to histology animals were tested on 2 days for exploratory activity in a square alley system (Lat box). Overall, the two strains differed significantly in the percentage of stratum lacunosum molecular (NHE greater than NLE, P less than 0.001), of the intra/infrapyramidal mossy fiber (IIP-MF) projection (NLE greater than NHE, P less than 0.001), of the granule cell layer (NLE greater than NHE, P less than 0.05) and of the outer molecular layer (NHE greater than NLE, P less than 0.05). Both strains had an IIP-MF projection smaller than in any other rat strain. Most of the strain differences, however, appear to reflect genetic drift rather than a response to selective breeding. Unexpectedly, the highly active line (NHE) showed a strong correlation between the IIP-MF and overnight habituation; the larger the IIP-MF projection, the lesser the long-term habituation (r = -0.70, P less than 0.001). In the NLE rats, the IIP-MF correlated positively with overnight habituation (though not significantly, because of an outlier). In both lines, stratum oriens was negatively correlated with short-term habituation in the second exposure (NHE: r = -0.68, P less than 0.001; NLE: r = -0.66, P less than 0.01). Thus, hippocampal variability of non-genetic origin appears to be correlated with processes which modulate strain-characteristic responses to a spatial novelty situation.
