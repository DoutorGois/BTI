It has been shown that single hydrocortisone administration increased 3H-GABA binding by hypothalamic synaptic membranes. ACTH administration enhanced binding in both studied brain structures. Multiple hydrocortisone administration did not effect 3H-GABA binding by hypothalamic and hippocampal membranes, while multiple ACTH administration caused the decrease in mediator binding by hypothalamic membranes and increased its level in hippocampal membranes. Adrenalectomy did not change 3H-gaba binding and single hydrocortisone administration to adrenalectomized rats increased 3H-GABA binding only by hypothalamic synaptic membranes.
