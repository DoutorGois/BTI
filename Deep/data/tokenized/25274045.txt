The Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI) originally downregulates Rho family GTPases by preventing nucleotide exchange and membrane association. Although RhoGDI2 functions as a metastasis regulator, little is known in glial cells under neuropathological conditions. We monitored RhoGDI2 expression in the mouse brain after administering a kainic acid(KA)-induced excitotoxic lesion. In control, RhoGDI2 immunoreactivity (IR) was evident in the neuronal layer of the hippocampus. However, RhoGDI2 IR was increased in astrocytes markedly throughout the hippocampus at day 3 post-treatment with KA. To further investigate the molecular mechanism of RhoGDI2-induced cellular migration, primary astrocytes were transfected with the flag-tagged RhoGDI2 cDNA. Cell migration assay revealed that RhoGDI2 cDNA transfection inhibits astrocyte migration. Overexpression of RhoGDI2 leads to inhibit protein kinase B (PKB) activation and cdc42 and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results suggested for the first time that RhoGDI2 is required for PKB and CREB activation and cdc42 expression in astrocyte migration after KA-mediated excitotoxic lesion in mouse brain.
