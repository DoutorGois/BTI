Stress is among the strongest signals promoting neuroplasticity: Stress signals, indicating real or perceived danger, lead to alterations of neuronal function and often structure, designed to adapt to the changed conditions and promote survival. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is expressed and released in several types of neuronal populations that are involved in cognition, emotion and the regulation of autonomic and endocrine function. CRF expressing neurons undergo functional and structural plasticity during stress and, in addition, the peptide acts via specific receptors to promote plasticity of target neurons.
