OBJECTIVE: To introduce and discuss an evolutionary model of frontal lobe functioning (the dual cytoarchitectonic trends theory [DTT]) and its application to understanding the neurobiology of schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. METHOD: An introduction to the DTT with respect to neural architecture, connectivity, and function is presented. In addition, neurobiologic, neuropathologic, clinical, and cognitive research supporting the application of this model to schizophrenia and anxiety disorders is reviewed. RESULTS: Traditional neuropsychologic models of acquired brain damage have been limited in their ability to explain frontal lobe dysfunction and its consequences in relation to psychopathology. The DTT offers an appropriately general neural-systems framework that may be better able to account for the diversity of symptoms, widespread neuropathology, and developmental abnormalities that are associated with most forms of psychopathology. CONCLUSIONS: Research investigating the neurobiology of psychopathology would benefit from adopting models of brain dysfunction that are consistent with neurodevelopmental pathology and evolution. Such efforts would likely lead to a greater understanding of neurobiologic mechanisms and, ultimately, better treatment strategies.
