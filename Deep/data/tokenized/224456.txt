Low-frequency stimulation of hippocampal mossy fiber axons in zinc-deficient adult rats produced synaptic responses that declined in amplitude with successive stimuli. This response decrement is abnormal and suggests that the heavy deposits of zinc in mossy fiber boutons are important for synaptic transmission.
