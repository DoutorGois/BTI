A study was made of the role of different structures of the limbico-reticular complex (midbrain reticular formation, dorsal hippocampus and septum) in the mediation of UHF modulated electromagnetic field (frequency 40 MHz, modulation frequency 7 Hz, intensity 30--300 V/M) on the reactions evoked by electrical stimulation of the rabbit ventromedial hypothalamus. It was shown that the effect of UHF field on electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus leads to the blockade of the hypertensive reaction in 33% of cases. Destruction of the midbrain reticular formation in the zone located laterally to the central grey matter and above the red nucleus eliminates the blocking effect of the UHF field on the hypothalamic responses.
