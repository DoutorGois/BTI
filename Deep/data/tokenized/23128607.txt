Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an endotoxin derived from Gramnegative bacteria, which induces brain inflammation. LPSinduced brain inflammation deteriorates hippocampusdependent cognitive deficits. In the present study, we investigated the effects of forced treadmill exercise and voluntary wheel exercise on shortterm memory in relation to neuronal maturation in LPSinduced brain inflammation of rats. Brain inflammation in rats was induced by an injection of LPS into the cerebral ventricle. Shortterm memory was evaluated using a stepdown avoidance task. Cell proliferation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was determined by 5bromo2'deoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of new cells, immunohistochemistry. Western blot analysis for the determination of doublecortin (DCX), a marker of immature neurons and neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), a marker of mature neurons, was performed. In the present study, LPSinduced brain inflammation impaired shortterm memory by increasing DCX expression and suppressing NeuN expression. These results suggest that LPSinduced brain inflammation disturbs neuronal maturation. The number of BrdUpositive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus was increased by LPS injection. This increase in the number of BrdUpositive cells can be ascribed to the increase in the number of of immature neurons following LPS injection. On the other hand, forced treadmill exercise and voluntary wheel exercise improved brain inflammationinduced shortterm memory impairment by suppressing DCX expression and increasing NeuN expression, enhancing neuronal maturation. Forced treadmill exercise and voluntary wheel exercise showed similar efficacy. From these results, it can be inferred that forced treadmill exercise and voluntary wheel exercise may improve memory function deteriorated by brain inflammation.
