We investigated the effects of chronic carbamazepine treatment in rats on brain somatostatin. Following 12 days of carbamazepine treatment, no changes in somatostatin levels were found in any of the brain areas examined which included: amygdala, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, median eminence, arcuate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, nucleus interstitialis of the stria terminalis, nucleus periventricularis, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex. Thus, carbamazepine in low doses does not affect basal levels of brain somatostatin in the rat, in contrast to the previous reports of decreased somatostatin in the cerebrospinal fluid of affectively ill patients.
