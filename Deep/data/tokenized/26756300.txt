This study investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of a mushroom extract from Phellinus igniarius (Piwep) after transient cerebral ischemia. Ph. Igniarius, which has a history of traditional medicinal use, contains immunomodulatory compounds that have been described to have effects on the human immune system. Using a model of transient cerebral ischemia induced by both common carotid artery occlusion and hypovolemia, a water-ethanol extract precipitate of Ph. Igniarius (Piwep) was delivered intraperitoneally immediately after the insult and was injected subsequently every other day for the experimental course. Neuronal death was examined by Fluoro-Jade B staining 1 week after the insult. Piwep injection lead to decreased hippocampal neuronal death, suppression of oxidative injury, activation of microglia, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier. We conclude that Piwep potently inhibits hippocampal neuronal death following ischemia and may have a high therapeutic potential for ameliorating stroke-induced neuron death in the clinical setting.
