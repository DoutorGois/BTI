This study assessed the effects of drugs which manipulate the cAMP system on afterdischarges (ADs) induced in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. The adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (50 microM) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram (0.1 and 1 microM) enhanced AD generation. These effects were reversed by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors H-89 (5 microM) and Rp-cAMPS (100 microM). These findings suggest that AD generation can be modulated through cAMP generation and the subsequent activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.
