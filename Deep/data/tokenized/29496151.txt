Recordings from fresh human brain slices derived from surgically resected brain tissue are being used to unravel mechanisms underlying human neurophysiology and for the evaluation of potential therapeutic targets and compounds. Data resulting from these studies provide unique insights into physiologic properties of human neuronal microcircuits. However, substantial limitations still remain with this approach. First, the tissue is always resected from patients, never from healthy controls. Second, the patient population undergoing brain surgery with tissue resection is limited to epilepsy and tumor patients - never from patients with other neurologic disorders. Third, the vast majority of tissue resected is limited largely to temporal cortex and hippocampus, occasionally amygdala. Therefore, the possibility to study brain tissue: (1) from healthy controls; (2) from patients with different neuropathologies; (3) from different brain areas; and (4) from a wide spectrum of ages only exists through autopsy-derived brain tissue. Here we describe methods and results from physiologic recordings of adult human neurons and microcircuits in both surgically derived brain tissue as well as in tissue derived from autopsies. We define postmortem time windows during which physiologic recordings could match data obtained from surgical tissue.
