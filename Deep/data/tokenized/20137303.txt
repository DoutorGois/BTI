OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of low concentration of organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) prenatal exposure on generation mouse brain development. METHODS: 5 mg/kg CPF was administered daily on gestation days (GD) 7.5 - 11.5. On postnatal day (PD) 35, quantitative morphologic examines were measured in CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus regions of the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. RESULTS: After CPF prenatal exposure, selective morphology impairments were observed, showing 22.37%, 25.66% thinning of the CA1 and CA3 layers, 24.14% enlargement of the dentate guys and 81.77% to 74.61% decreasing of the ratio of neuron/glial of the somatosensory cortex. CONCLUSION: There maybe slight morphological changes after prenatal low concentration pesticide exposure even without obviously systemic toxicity.
