A regional Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the highest levels of NF-L mRNA in the adult mouse brain are present in brain stem followed by mid-brain, with lower levels found in neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. The study was extended to the cellular level over course of postnatal development using in situ hybridization. This developmental analysis revealed that the expression of NF-L mRNA closely follows the differentiation pattern of many large neurons during postnatal neurogenesis. Neurons which differentiate early such as Purkinje, mitral, pyramidal, and large neurons of brain stem and thalamic nuclei, expressed high levels of NF-L mRNA at postnatal day 1. Early expression of NF-L mRNA may be required for the maintenance of the extensive neurofilament protein networks that are detected within the axons of larger neurons. Smaller neurons which differentiate later, such as dentate gyrus granule cells, small pyramidal and granule cells of the neocortex, and granule cells of the cerebellum, exhibit a delayed expression of NF-L mRNA.
