Triggers of brain inflammation in pneumococcal meningitis are unknown. TNF-alpha and IL-1beta were upregulated (real time PCR and in situ hybridization) in neurons and astrocytes time-dependently and maximally in the hippocampus during murine pneumococcal meningitis. Upregulation of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA in the brain parenchyma was independent of cerebrospinal fluid leukocytosis, pneumococcal pneumolysin and H2O2, but it was potently induced by pneumococcal cell wall (PCW) fragments. Brain TNF-alpha mRNA was downregulated by a matrix metalloproteinases inhibitor. PCW fragments were located in the brain parenchyma. In conclusion, PCW fragments and matrix metalloproteinases trigger cytokine induction in the brain parenchyma during pneumococcal meningitis.
