The authors report an unusual case of acute, rapidly progressive, unilateral neck swelling following extubation after elective left anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy. Due to severe neck swelling, the patient developed critical airway compromise, brachial plexopathy, and Horner's syndrome. After critical airway management and appropriate rehabilitation, the patient recovered completely and remains seizure free at 1.5 years of follow-up. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of acute postoperative sialadenitis and the steps needed to prevent serious morbidity and possible mortality from this rare complication.
