Brief exposure to Mg2(+)-free medium (MFM) enhanced the population response of CA1 neurons to stratum radiatum stimulation in hippocampal slices from normal (+/?) and epileptic tottering (tg/tg) mice. The enhancement was maintained in both groups for at least 2 h following reperfusion with normal medium (NM). Excitability curves obtained from the extracellular records suggest that, while both synaptic activation and postsynaptic excitability are enhanced during MFM perfusion, only the latter enhancement is maintained at significant levels after reperfusion with NM. The long-term increase in postsynaptic excitability was comparable in strength to that produced by long-term potentiation (LTP) inducing tetanic stimuli, was accompanied by an increase in the slope of the population spike/field excitatory postsynaptic potential (PS/fEPSP) curve and did not appear to depend on the induction of epileptiform activity by MFM. Both the short- and the long-term effects of MFM on synaptic activation and postsynaptic excitability were qualitatively similar in normal and epileptic mice and any quantitative differences were not statistically significant. Thus, epileptogenesis in the tottering mutant may not involve a change in the NMDA receptor-mediated control of excitability, at least in the CA1 area of hippocampus.
