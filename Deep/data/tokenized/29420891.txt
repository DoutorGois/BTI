A novel series of quinoline-indole derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as multitarget-directed ligands for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biological evaluation revealed that the derivatives had multifunctional profiles including antioxidant effects, blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, biometal chelation, Abeta aggregation modulation, neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. Moreover, several representative target derivatives demonstrated hippocampal cell proliferation in living adult mice by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection or oral administration. Further drug-like property analysis demonstrated that the optimized compound, 8d (WI-1758), had liver microsomal metabolic stability, was well tolerated (>2000 mg/kg), and had a rational pharmacokinetic profile, as well as an oral bioavailability of 14.1% and a positive log BB (-0.19) to cross the BBB in vivo. Pharmacodynamics studies demonstrated that chronic oral administration of 8d.HCl substantially ameliorated the cognitive and spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 AD mice and noticeably reduced overall cerebral beta-amyloid deposits.
