Injection of the anticholinesterase drug diisopropyl fluorophosphate into the hippocampi of rats, 30 minutes after escape learning, produces partial amnesia with full recovery 5 days after injection. No such amnesia is produced if the injection takes place 3 days after learning. However, with injections 5 days after learning there is again an effect, and at 14 days amnesia is complete though no normal forgetting occurs within this period.
