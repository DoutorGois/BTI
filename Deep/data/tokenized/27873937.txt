Extensive evidence supports an important role for soluble oligomers of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) in Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis. In the present study we combined intracerebroventricular (icv) injections with brain microdialysis technology in the fully conscious rat to assess the effects of icv administered SDS-stable low-n Abeta oligomers (principally dimers and trimers) on excitatory and inhibitory amino acid transmission in the ipsilateral dorsal hippocampus. Microdialysis was employed to assess the effect of icv administration of Abeta monomers and Abeta oligomers on dialysate glutamate, aspartate and GABA levels in the dorsal hippocampus. Administration of Abeta oligomers was associated with a +183% increase (p.
