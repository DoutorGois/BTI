Two tests of auditory recognition memory were given to four patients with bilateral hippocampal damage (H+) and three patients with large medial temporal lobe lesions and additional variable damage to lateral temporal cortex (MTL+). When single stimuli were presented, performance was normal across delays as long as 30 sec, presumably because information could be maintained in working memory through rehearsal. When lists of 10 stimuli were presented, performance was impaired after a 5-min delay. Patients with MTL+ lesions performed marginally worse than patients with H+ lesions, consistent with findings for recognition memory in other modalities. The findings show that auditory recognition, like recognition memory in other sensory modalities, is dependent on the medial temporal lobe.
