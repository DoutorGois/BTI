The septum of male Wistar rats was injected with synthetic beta-amyloid fragments, beta 12-28, beta 25-35 and beta 1-40, and hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release was evaluated by transversal microdialysis. A marked decrease in basal and K(+)-evoked ACh release was found 7 or 21 days after injection of 5 nmol of beta 12-28 and beta 25-35, or 3 nmol of beta 1-40, respectively. These data indicate that septal injection of beta-amyloid peptides causes hypofunction of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system.
