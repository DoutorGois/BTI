These experiments combined extracellular electrophysiological multirecordings from hippocampal organotypic slice cultures with application of drugs to and sampling of extracellular fluid from a restricted region of the slice using a microdialysis probe. Glutamate (Glu) concentrations were monitored in 0.5 or 2 min microdialysis samples, while evoked field potentials responses (EvFPR) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (stimulation in the CA3 area) were simultaneously recorded using a multi-electrodes array (Physiocard). Glu was assayed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection combined with a continuous flow derivatization of dialysates. The performance of this combined approach was demonstrated by monitoring extracellular Glu concentrations and EvFPR after K+ induced depolarisation, Glu uptake blockade by trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (PDC), and electrical stimulation. Such an approach allows a global monitoring of the neuronal functioning with a fine time resolution (up to 30 s) on a simple in vitro brain slice model, to be used as a complement to conventional in vivo microdialysis studies.
