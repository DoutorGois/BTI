The locomotor effects of acute amphetamine treatment (1 mg/kg, i.p.) were assessed in Long-Evans rats after 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5, 7-DHT) injections into the fimbria-fornix/cingular bundle (FiFx/CB; 4 microg/side), or the dorsal and median raphe (Raphe; 10 microg). In control rats, amphetamine induced a significant increase of home-cage activity for about 2 h. This effect was similar in Raphe rats, but was absent in FiFx/CB rats. The raphe lesions reduced serotonin concentrations by 50% in the dorsal hippocampus, 75% in the ventral hippocampus and 58% in the fronto-parietal cortex. After FiFx/CB lesions, the reduction amounted 50, 61 and only 25%, in each of these regions, respectively. In the fronto-partietal cortex, dopamine concentration was significantly decreased in Raphe (-27%) and FiFx/CB rats (-65%). The results suggest that a serotonergic denervation of the hippocampus by injections of 5,7-DHT into the FiFx/CB pathways hampers the stimulating effects of amphetamine on locomotor activity. This effect might be related to the reduced dopaminergic tone in the fronto-parietal cortex.
