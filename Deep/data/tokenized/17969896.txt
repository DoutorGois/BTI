OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of repeated seizures and anti-epileptic drug on phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB) in rat model of cognitive impairment, and the effect of Caoguo Zhimu Decoction (CZD) on it. METHODS: On the basis of epileptic model induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), cognitive impairment model was induced by kindling epilepsy with PTZ everyday, which were then di-vided into the model-1 group, the CZD-1 group, the nimodipine-1 group, and those by injecting large dosage phenytoin sodium were divided into the model-2 group, the CZD-2 group and the nimodipine-2 group. Changes of pCREB protein in rat's hippocampus were detected using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting assay. RESULTS: The expression of pCREB was higher in the CZD-1 and nimodipine-1 group than in the model group, while it was significantly different in the CZD-2 and nimodipine-2 groups than in the model-2 group. CONCLUSION: CZD could relieve the cognitive dysfunction in the epileptic model rats induced by everyday PTZ kindling or by dilantin through increasing the pCREB expression.
