The effects of treatment with the dihydropyridine Ca+2 antagonist darodipine (PY 108-068) on age-related changes in the cerebral capillary network was studied using alkaline phosphatase histochemistry with quantitative image analysis. The investigation was performed on male Wistar rats of 12 months (adult reference group) and 27 months. The 27-month-old rats consisted of two groups, the first of control untreated animals and the second of rats receiving an oral dose of 5 mg/kg/day of darodipine from the 21st to the 27th month. The cerebral areas examined included the frontal cortex, the occipital cortex, Ammon's horn of the hippocampus, and the dentate gyrus. The number and the average length of alkaline phosphatase-positive capillaries were decreased in old rats, when compared with adult rats. The intercapillary distance, which is considered as a sensitive parameter for capillary density was increased in aged rats in comparison to adult rats. The capillary diameter was increased slightly or unchanged in old rats. The Ammon's horn and the frontal cortex were the cerebral areas most affected by age-dependent changes of the capillary network. Treatment with darodipine increased the number and the average length of alkaline phosphatase-reactive capillaries and reduced the intercapillary distance and the diameter of cerebral capillaries in old rats. The pericapillary microenvironment of the Ammon's horn was the most sensitive to treatment with darodipine. The above results showed that treatment with darodipine is capable of counteracting some microvascular changes occurring in the brain of aged rats. This suggests that the blockade of dihydropyridine-type Ca2+ channels has a positive effect on the brain microvascular system and may counteract the impairment of pericapillary microenvironment occurring with aging.
