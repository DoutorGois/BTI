On the basis of results obtained from extensive pre- and intraoperative diagnostic investigations of 69 patients, minimalisation of epileptogenic brain tissue resection was strived for. The extent of resection ranged from selective amygdalohippocampectomy up to "en bloc" standard resections, and in rare cases even beyond these. In the majority of cases however, tailoring allowed smaller resections than the standard "en bloc" resections. The outcome of tailoring in regard to seizure control as well as verbal memory and visual performance show that this method should be favoured in epilepsy surgery of temporal lobe epilepsies.
