BACKGROUND: We quantified the interictal metabolic changes associated with temporal lobe epilepsy by using an accurate stereotactic method. METHODS: We selected 16 patients who had proven unilateral focal or regional temporal onset defined by SEEG criteria. Each patient underwent stereotactic MRI and stereotactic [18 fluoro] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: Asymmetries (mean, +/- SD) were found in mesio-temporal structures: amygdala (-0.033+/-0.027, p = 0.0002), hippocampus (-0.035+/-0.032, p = 0.0006), and superior temporal gyrus (-0.036+/-0.032, p = 0.0004). Four of the sixteen patients had previously had unlocalized qualitative nonstereotactic PET analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The quantitative stereotactical PET method allows a higher resolution study of mesio-temporal structures.
