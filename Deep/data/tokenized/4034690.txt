In experiment 1, electrical stimulation of the posterior hippocampus was shown to produce state-dependent learning (SDL) for a step-out inhibitory avoidance task in rats. Stimulation sites in either the right or left hippocampus were equally effective in producing this effect. Similarly, the presence or absence of afterdischarge (AD) following the stimulation did not differentially affect performance on the task. In experiment 2, forebrain bisection ameliorated the behavioral deficits in the animals receiving stimulation before testing but not before training (N/S group), while those stimulated before training but not before testing (S/N group) remained impaired; thus, providing a demonstration of asymmetrical SDL. Variations in extent of the commissurotomy differentially affected the laterality of the afterdischarge but not the performance in the SDL task. Speculation as to the mechanisms of this SDL effect was presented.
