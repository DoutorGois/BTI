We describe a method for producing high-resolution chemical patterns on surfaces to control the attachment and growth of cultured neurons. Microcontact printing has been extended to allow the printing of micron-scale protein lines aligned to an underlying pattern of planar microelectrodes. Poly-L-lysine (PL) lines have been printed on the electrode array for electrical studies on cultured neural networks. Rat hippocampal neurons showed a high degree of attachment selectivity to the PL and produced neurites that faithfully grew onto the electrode recording sites.
