We investigated the effect of long-term potentiation (LTP) of the perforant path-granule cell synapse, on the synthesis of DNA in the target area and in polysynaptically stimulated hippocampal (CA3/CA1) and cortical areas (entorhinal, temporal, and occipital cortices) in the rat. The contralateral nonstimulated side was used as a control. The degree of LTP was indexed by the field EPSP and population spike amplitude recorded in the dentate area of the stimulated side before and after high frequency stimulation (250 Hz, 250 ms) every 30 min. DNA synthesis was evaluated in tissue homogenates after a 3-h period of incorporation of 3H-thymidine. DNA synthesis was significantly lower in the stimulated side in the hippocampal cortex CA3/CA1 (-25%), and in the entorhinal cortex (-50%), but not in the dentate area. In addition, the occurrence of preparations without expression of LTP allowed the analysis of unscheduled brain DNA synthesis (UBDS) in a supposedly long-term depression (LTD) subgroup. UBDS was higher in the group without LTP (no-LTP group) than in that with a significant LTP expression (LTP-group) on both sides of the brain. Furthermore, correlative analyses revealed that UBDS covaried with LTP of the EPSP (but not of population spike) in the dentate area and in extratarget hippocampal subregions on both sides and in dorsal cortex on the stimulated side. Further, regional crosscorrelation analyses revealed a high degree of coupling among brain sites following LTP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
