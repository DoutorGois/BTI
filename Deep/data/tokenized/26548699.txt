AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subchronic administration of agomelatine on energy metabolism, oxidative stress markers and antioxidant defense in the brains of rats. METHODS: The animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of agomelatine (10, 30 or 50 mg/kg) or saline for 14 days. The prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum and posterior cortex were analyzed. RESULTS: The findings showed that complex I was activated in the prefrontal cortex, cerebellum and striatum and inhibited in the posterior cortex at the 10-mg/kg dose, and inhibited in all brain areas analyzed at the 30-mg/kg and 50-mg/kg doses. Complex II was activated in the posterior cortex at the 50-mg/kg dose. Complex IV was inhibited in the striatum and posterior cortex at the 10-mg/kg dose, inhibited in the striatum at the 30-mg/kg dose and activated in the hippocampus at the 50-mg/kg dose. Creatine kinase activity was inhibited in the striatum at the 10-mg/kg and 30-mg/kg doses. Lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation levels were not changed after the administration of agomelatine. Superoxide dismutase activity was increased in the striatum at the 10-mg/kg dose, and catalase activity was inhibited in the cerebellum at the 10-mg/kg dose and increased in the posterior cortex at the 30-mg/kg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are consistent with other studies showing that some antidepressants may influence brain energy metabolism and oxidative stress parameters and expand knowledge about the effects of agomelatine in biochemical parameters in the brains of rats.
