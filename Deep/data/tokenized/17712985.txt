The nucleus accumbens (Acb) is a crucial component of the brain reward system. This report reviews electrophysiological studies that examined Acb cell firing during goal-directed behaviors for natural reinforcers (food, water, sucrose) and drugs of abuse (cocaine, heroin, ethanol). Studies that examined the role of environmental stimuli and operant contingencies on Acb activity during behavior are also explored. Given the extensive literature that links dopamine in the Acb with drug reinforcement, experiments are considered that examined the influence of dopamine in modulating Acb cell firing during drug-seeking behaviors. Finally, because the Acb is one neural substrate of a larger brain reward circuit, the influence of afferent input (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) on Acb cell firing during behavior is also discussed. These findings provide a unique insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying reward-related processing and goal-directed behaviors and reveal a level of functional organization in the Acb not identified by other experimental approaches.
