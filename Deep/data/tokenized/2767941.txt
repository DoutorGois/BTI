Bicuculline (either 25 mumol or 12.5 mumol/kg body wt) was administered to rats by intraperitoneal route. Animals treated with 25 mumol/kg experienced convulsions, whereas those receiving 12.5 mumol/kg did not. Controls received saline instead of the drug. Radioactive precursors [2-3H] glycerol and/or [1,2 14C] ethanolamine were injected into cerebral ventriculi simultaneously with bicuculline and the rats were killed 12 min afterwards. Their brains were dissected by hand into four parts (cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus, cerebral cortex) and the labeling of lipid classes determined after extraction and separation. Although glycerol was incorporated into lipid better than ethanolamine in all areas, the fate of the injected radioactive precursors varied according both to area and treatment. The lowest uptake of radioactivity was in the cerebral cortex and the highest in the brain stem and hippocampus. Moreover, the administration of bicuculline influenced the distribution of radioactivity among lipid classes; these variations, however, were not dependent on the administered doses of bicuculline. We conclude that the effects on glycerolipid metabolism observed in convulsing animals are due to several causes including alterations of systemic parameters (hypertension, hypoxia, etc.). The distribution of glycerol label between phospholipid and neutral lipid is proposed as a biochemical model for the study of convulsive and subconvulsive states.
