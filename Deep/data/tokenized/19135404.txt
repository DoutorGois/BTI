The function of the human hippocampus is a contentious subject among neuroscientists. Theoreticians have long viewed the hippocampus as a computational device, with researchers in humans increasingly adopting this perspective, buoyed by recent reports that its role is not limited to declarative memory. Here, we set out a new strategy for discovering the nature of information processing within the human hippocampus. We argue that novelty responses, measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging, provide a window into the neural representations and computations sustained by the hippocampus. More generally, we suggest that a renewed emphasis on the information processing qualities of the human hippocampus offers the promise of a long awaited union between theoretical and empirical research across species.
