Basal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) were studied quantitatively by the Golgi impregnation method. The present data suggested that basal dendrites of the pyramidal cells were decreased in number in SDAT, and that the dendritic decrease was associated with a decrease in size of their cell bodies.
