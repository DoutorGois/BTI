Status epilepticus (SE) can cause severe neuronal loss and oxidative damage. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) can be neuroprotective by inducing the antioxidant system, so we evaluated the role of PGC-1alpha in SE. The expression of PGC-1alpha and one of its target genes, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), was upregulated after SE, which may represent an endogenous neuroprotective mechanism. Furthermore, pretreatment with an adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor significantly attenuated both AMPK and PGC-1alpha activation, followed by downregulation of UCP2 and enhanced oxidative stress and hippocampal neuronal damage. AMPK/PGC-1alpha may be neuroprotective in SE-induced brain damage, at least in part via UCP2.
