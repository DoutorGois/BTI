Previous studies have shown that a somatostatin-depleting drug, cysteamine (CYS), suppresses kindled seizures. However, no data is available concerning the levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) in the kindled rat brain after CYS administration. In the present study, we used radioimmunoassay to measure SLI in the frontal cortex, amygdala + piriform cortex, hippocampus, striatum and hypothalamus: 1) in control rats, 2) in amygdala-kindled rats decapitated 14 days after the last stimulus, and 3) in amygdala-kindled rats decapitated 14 days after the last stimulus but treated either 11 days or 4) 4 hours before decapitation with CYS (100 mg/kg, subcutaneously). The results showed that, compared to controls, in kindled rats SLI was elevated both in the ipsi lateral (28%, p = 0.0372) and contralateral (17%, p = 0.0078) frontal cortex. Compared to kindled rats, CYS given 4 hours before decapitation decreased SLI in the frontal cortex (to 71%, p = 0.0066) and hippocampus (to 72%, p = 0.0027), but compared to the controls, only in the hippocampus. In rats given CYS 11 days before decapitation, SLI did not differ from either the controls or from the kindled rats. In conclusion, the somatostatinergic system is affected in amygdala-kindling; but the relationship of anatomical localization and the magnitude of CYS-induced decrease of SLI to elevated seizure threshold needs to be studied further.
