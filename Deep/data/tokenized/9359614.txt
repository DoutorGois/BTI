Neocortical and hippocampal EEG power spectra obtained during REM-like sleep induced by unilateral carbachol microinjections (0.01 M, 0.02 M and 0.2 M; volume 20 nl) into the ventral part of the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis have been compared with EEG power spectra obtained during spontaneous REM sleep. Our findings indicate that neocortical and hippocampal electrical activities during the REM-like state generated by carbachol delivery in this pontine region mimic those present in spontaneous REM sleep.
