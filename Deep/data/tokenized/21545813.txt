Since zinc transporter ZnT3 is localized to the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex, we used ZnT3 knockout mice (KO) to analyze the role of ZnT3 in memory and behavior dependent on these brain regions. ZnT3KO mice were normal in initial learning in the standard water maze but had difficulty finding a second platform location. The mutants showed increased social interaction but were deficient in social and object recognition memory. These data suggest that ZnT3 is involved in certain types of spatial memory and behavior dependent on the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex.
