The HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 produces neuronal cell damage in primary cultures of a variety of cell types including hippocampal and retinal ganglion cell neurons. The properties of primary cell cultures are, however, often markedly different from those of cells living in their normal environment. We now report that gp120 induces widespread chromatin condensation and lesions in pyramidal granular neurones and in interneurones of rat hippocampal organotypic slice cultures. This damage is clearly of an apoptotic (programmed cell death) type. The use of an in vitro organized structure will enable the molecular and cellular mechanism of action of gp120 to be examined in conditions which are particularly suitable and relevant to the in vivo situation.
