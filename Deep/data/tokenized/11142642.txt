Rats with hippocampus, medial caudoputamen (CPU), lateral CPU, or control lesions were trained on declarative and procedural knowledge variants of a novel rodent sequential learning task. Medial CPU lesions impaired rats' ability to learn the procedure of running through a sequence of open maze arms but did not disrupt their capacity to explicitly generate (i.e.. "declare") maze arm sequences. Hippocampus lesions produced the opposite set of results. Rats with lateral CPU lesions were not impaired on either version of the task. Transfer tests indicated that control rats predominantly used egocentric cues to solve the procedural task and allocentric spatial cues to solve the declarative task. These findings suggest a double dissociation between the medial CPU and hippocampus in processing egocentric-procedural and allocentric-declarative sequential information, respectively.
