The enduring changes in long-term memory probably depend on regulation of gene expression in the hippocampus. To seek genes regulated by learning, we used microarray technology to compare hippocampal gene expression in mice undergoing training in the Morris water maze and control mice forced to swim for the same period in the absence of a hidden platform. ANOVA was employed to prioritize genes for further study, and three genes were confirmed by real-time PCR as being regulated during learning. One of the genes was the alpha subunit of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (Pdgfra); another showed homology to DnaJ and cAMP response element-binding protein 2 (CREB2); and a third was novel. These genes may provide useful insights into the molecular mechanisms of hippocampal learning.
