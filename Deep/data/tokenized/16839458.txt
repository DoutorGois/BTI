Walking produced increases in both the extracellular acetylcholine level and regional blood flow in the hippocampus in aged rats 26-29 months old. The present results in aged rats were compared with our previous data in young adult rats (Nakajima et al., 2003), and it was found that both the acetylcholine and blood flow responses in the hippocampus were well maintained in aged rats.
