Partial removal of layer-specific afferents of the hippocampus is said to induce sprouting of intact fibers from neighboring layers that invade the zone of the degenerating axons. However, recent in vivo and in vitro studies using sensitive anterograde tracers have failed to demonstrate sprouting across laminar boundaries. Sprouting does occur; but, it mainly involves unlesioned fiber systems terminating within the layer of fiber degeneration in addition to the degenerating afferents. These findings point to rigid laminar cues attracting certain fiber systems while repelling others in normal development and after partial deafferentation.
