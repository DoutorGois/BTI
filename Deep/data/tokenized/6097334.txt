One prediction of the hypothesis that the capacity for hippocampal frequency potentiation is relevant to behavioral plasticity is tested in this study, by chronically elevating magnesium in intact aged and young rats. Elevated extracellular Mg2+ specifically improves frequency potentiation in hippocampal slices, and chronic alterations in plasma Mg2+ can increase brain Mg2+ in intact animals. Aged and young rats on a diet that elevated plasma Mg2+ exhibited stronger frequency potentiation under urethane anesthesia, and showed improved maze reversal learning.
