Cortical e.e.g. and multiple unit activity (m.u.a.) of the mesencephalic reticular formation, the anterior hypothalamic area, the basal nuclear group of the amygdala and the dorsal hippocampus were studied before and following i.p. injection of different doses of ketamine hydrochloride and a barbiturate in cats with chronically implanted electrodes. Barbiturate administration resulted in a rapid decrease in m.u.a. in the mesencephalic reticular formation which was accompanied by a significant decrease of activity in the limbic structures. No m.u.a. response was observed to visual, acoutic or somatosensory stimulation or to pain. The m.u.a. of the mesencephalic reticular formation and limbic structures increased gradually following ketamine injection. Intermittent or continuous hypersynchronous activity was characteristic in the cortical e.e.g. During the hypersynchronous activity the responsiveness of m.u.a. in the mesencephalic reticular formation, to visual and acoustic stimuli, was blocked. Somatosensory and painful stimulation, however, resulted in a significant increase in the activity both of the mesencephalic reticular formation and of the limbic neuronal pools.
