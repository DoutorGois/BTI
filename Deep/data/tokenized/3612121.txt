Local cerebral glucose metabolism (LCMRglc) and local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were studied following implantation of a microdialysis fiber in rat dorsal hippocampus. Recovery time after implantation varied from 0 to 24 h. All rats showed pronounced disturbances in LCMRglc and LCBF during the first 2 h of implantation. The changes consisted of (a) a general decrease in blood flow and glucose phosphorylation and (b) small areas (spots) around the fiber with increased glucose phosphorylation and decreased blood flow. Animals allowed to recover for 24 h demonstrated a near normalization of LCMRglu and LCBF, and the focal disturbances (spots) of glucose phosphorylation and blood flow disappeared. The slight reduction in blood flow and glucose metabolism at this time must be accepted, because extension of the recovery period beyond 24 h may give interpretation problems due to the developing gliosis.
