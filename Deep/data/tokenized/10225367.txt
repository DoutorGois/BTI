Carbamazepine produces dose-related anticonvulsant effects in epilepsy models including the genetically epilepsy-prone rat (GEPR) model and the rat maximal electroshock model. Dose-response relationships are quantitatively different among the models. Against electroshock seizures in Sprague-Dawley rats the ED50 dose is 7.5 mg/kg whereas the ED50 against audiogenic seizures in severe seizure GEPRs (GEPR-9s) is 3 mg/kg. In contrast, the ED50 in moderate seizure GEPRs (GEPR-3s) is 25 mg/kg. The present study was designed to ascribe dose-response differences among the three rat strains to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic factors. After systemic carbamazepine, pharmacokinetic studies revealed differences in area under the concentration-vs.-time curve. In other experiments, carbamazepine-induced serotonin release from hippocampus was used as a pharmacodynamic marker. In a concentration-controlled design using intracerebral microdialysis, hippocampal carbamazepine infusions produced similar concentration-response relations for the three rat strains. These data support the hypothesis that dose-response differences among the three rat strains are primarily pharmacokinetic in nature.
