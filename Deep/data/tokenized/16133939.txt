1. High-fat diets disrupt metabolic equilibrium and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and may lead to the development of metabolic and endocrine dysfunctions. The early neuroendocrine responses elicited by a combination of short-term metabolic and emotional stressors is not fully elucidated. 2. The purpose of the present study was to determine the impact on female rats, of a short-term enriched in fat diet, combined with an acute stressor. 3. Adult female Wistar rats were fed a fat diet for 7 days and subsequently exposed to 5 min swimming stress. Plasma leptin, insulin, glucose, luteinizing hormone (LH) and corticosterone, along with brain corticosteroid receptors' mRNAs were measured at 1 h post stress. 4. Diet, compared to chow, reduced food intake and body weight gain, increased leptin and LH, and decreased glucose in the periphery. The diet increased plasma corticosterone and reduced GR mRNA in the hippocampus, similarly to swim stress. 5. The diet significantly modified the animals' response to the subsequent swim stress, by blocking further corticosterone rise and GR mRNA reduction. In addition, exposure of diet-fed rats to stress, altered their endocrine response, in terms of leptin and LH. 6. These observations suggest that even short, moderately unbalanced diets can affect peripheral and central components of energy balance, reproduction and stress response.
