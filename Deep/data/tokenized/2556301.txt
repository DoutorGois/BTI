GABAA receptor alpha subunit transcripts were detected by Northern analysis of rat, chicken and human brain mRNA using a series of 32P-labelled antisense RNA probes derived from human alpha 1 subunit cDNAs. These alpha subunit mRNAs differ in their distribution among various brain regions in the rat and at least one species is detected primarily in fetal brain. GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit probes encoding the putative extracellular domain detect at least five alpha subunit transcripts in rat brain, whereas probes encoding the putative intracellular domain detect only two mRNAs. These data suggest the presence in brain of multiple GABAA receptor alpha subunits having homologous extracellular domains and whose expression is regionally and developmentally regulated. These alpha subunit transcripts may encode proteins that comprise GABAA isoreceptors differing in their pharmacological and physiological properties.
