A specific interaction between the AMPA receptor subunits GluR2 and GluR3 and the fusion protein NSF has recently been identified. Disruption of this interaction by adenoviral-mediated expression of a peptide (pep2m) corresponding to the NSF-binding region of GluR2 results in a dramatic reduction in surface expression of AMPA receptors in primary hippocampal neurons. Here we report that expression of pep2m from a recently developed neuronal-specific adenoviral system gave significant neuroprotection to primary CA1-CA3 hippocampal neurons following stimulation with kainate (KA) and this was accompanied by a reduction in Ca(2+) influx. Protection was also observed following glucose deprivation and exposure to ischemic buffer in the absence of any NMDA receptor antagonists. These results provide strong evidence that AMPA receptors play a direct role in mediating postischemic neurotoxicity.
