AIM: To investigate the migration mechanism of murine flMSCs in ischemic injured brain. METHODS: flMSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro. BALB/c mice were adopted to build model of cerebral ischemia. Chemokine receptor mRNA in flMSCs and SDF-1alpha (the only ligand for CXCR4) mRNA in injured brains were determined by RT-PCR. Expression and distribution of SDF-1alpha protein was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Migration of flMSCs induced by SDF-1alpha in vitro was detected by Boyden chamber assay. RESULTS: Murine flMSCs expressed a restricted set of chemokine receptors including CR1, CR3, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4. Expression of SDF-1alpha mRNA was significantly increased in ischemic injured brain compared with those in normal brain (P < 0.01). Protein level of SDF-1alpha in ischemic injured brain (12 h: 0.35 +/- 0.05, 24 h: 0.35 +/- 0.05, 48 h: 0.88 +/- 0.04) was statistically up-regulated compared with those in normal brains (0.74 +/- 0.07, P < 0.01). Expression of SDF-1alpha was significantly increased in peri-ischemia area such as cerebral cortex and hippocampus 24 h after ischemic injury. Expression of SDF-1alpha wasn't detected in contralateral hemisphere and normal brain. Migration of flMSCs could be induced by SDF-1alpha and blocked by CXCR4 antibody in vitro. CONCLUSION: Interaction between CXCR4 and SDF-1alpha is one of the mechanisms in directing murine flMSCs migration in ischemic injured brain.
