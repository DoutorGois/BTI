The effect of a single or repeated swim stress on in vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding to various brain regions in adrenalectomized and sham-operated (control) mice was assessed using the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, [3H]Ro15-1788. In sham-operated mice the binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 to benzodiazepine receptors was reduced in the hippocampus and hypothalamus (single or repeated stress) and cerebral cortex (repeated swim stress) compared to non-stressed mice. In contrast, no alterations in [3H]Ro15-1788 binding were observed in any brain region in adrenalectomized mice after either single or repeated swim stress. These data suggest that an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is required for the stress-induced decrease in benzodiazepine receptor occupancy measured using the in vivo binding method.
