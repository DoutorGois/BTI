The rate of 35S-methionine incorporation into the anterior and posterior hypothalamus, tonsil and hippocamp was studied in experiments on intact, adrenalectomized, and hypophysectomized rats as well as in those exposed to ACTH or dexamethasone. A conclusion is drawn that ACTH and glucocorticoids exert a dissimilar and non-equivalent effect on the brain structures responsible for the activity displayed by the hypophyseal-adrenal system.
