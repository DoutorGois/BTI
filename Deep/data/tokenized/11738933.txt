The sudden interruption of an intracortical instillation of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) generates an epileptic focus in mammals. Seizures elicited by GABA withdrawal (GW) last for weeks. A similar withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability is also produced by several GABA(A) receptor agonists. This work reports a quantitative analysis of GW-induced hyperexcitability produced in the hippocampus in vitro. GW produced a left-ward displacement of the input/output (I/O) function, suggesting that the postsynaptic component is predominant to explain the hyperexcitability. A decrease in the inhibitory efficacy of the GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, confirmed that inhibition was impaired. Binding saturation experiments demonstrated a decrease in [(3)H]-muscimol binding after GABA withdrawal showing a close correlation with the development of hyperexcitability. All these modifications coursed without changes in receptor affinity (K(D)) for muscimol or bicuculline as demonstrated by both binding studies and Schild analysis. It is concluded that, in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, it is the number of functional GABA(A) receptors, and not the affinity of the receptor, what is decreased during GW-induced hyperexcitability.
