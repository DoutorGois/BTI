Synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors detect coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity and play a critical role in triggering changes in synaptic strength at central synapses. Despite intensive study of synaptic plasticity, relatively little is known about the magnitude and duration of calcium accumulation caused by unitary events at individual synapses. We used fluorescence imaging to detect NMDA receptor-mediated miniature synaptic calcium transients (MSCTs) caused by spontaneous release of synaptic vesicles in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons. MSCTs originated focally in dendritic regions <1 microm in length and decayed with a time constant of 0.35 +/- 0.03 s. Multiple occurrences of MSCTs recorded at single sites had fluctuating amplitudes, with a coefficient of variation of 0.34. From the reduction in the spatial spread of MSCTs with decreasing concentration of indicator dye, we estimated that the dominant endogenous calcium buffer in dendrites is relatively immobile (diffusion coefficient between 10 and 50 microm(2)/s). We conclude that calcium rise caused by spontaneous quantal synaptic NMDA receptor activation (i) is variable, (ii) lasts for a time period briefer than previous measurements indicate, and (iii) is confined by endogenous calcium buffers to local dendritic regions even when synapses are not on spines.
