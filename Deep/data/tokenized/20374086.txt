Neurogenesis in the hippocampus continues throughout adult life and can be regulated by the local microenvironment. To determine whether denervation stimulates neurogenesis in hippocampus, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of local neural stem cells (NSCs) in dentate gyrus was investigated after fimbria fornix transection. In the denervated hippocampus, NSCs proliferated markedly and migrated along the subgranular layer, and more newborn cells differentiated into neurons or astrocytes. After denervation, more newborn cells in the deafferented hippocampus expressed Brn-4 and differentiated into beta-Tubulin III positive neurons. It is concluded that the local NSCs in hippocampus may proliferate and migrate into granule cell layer, in which changes in the deafferented hippocampus provided a suitable microenvironment for hippocampal neurogenesis and the increased Brn-4 in denervated hippocampus may be involved in this process.
