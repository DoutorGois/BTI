In vivo microdialysis and EEG recording have been used in order to study the combined neurochemical and electrophysiological events during intoxication with soman (o-1,2,2-trimethylpropyl methylphosphono-fluoridate), a potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in the freely moving rat. All rats exposed to soman exhibited signs of AChE inhibition. The duration of EEG recorded seizures after soman intoxication averaged 43 +/- 24 min. The extracellular striatal levels of dopamine and GABA, increased significantly during the EEG seizure periods. Using an EEG based differentiation between seizure and non-seizure conditions, we found that intrastriatal release of dopamine, but not glutamate, during soman intoxication is highly correlated with seizures. Our results suggest that excitatory amino acids (EAA) involvement in soman-induced seizures, as demonstrated in hippocampus, may not be relevant in the striatum. Our data, instead, may indicate the importance of dopamine as a neurotoxic agent.
