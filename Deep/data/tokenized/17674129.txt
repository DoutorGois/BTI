It has been known that GnRH, LH and their receptors exist in hippocampal neurons. However, whether FSH and its receptor also exist in hippocampal neurons remained unknown yet. In situ hybridization, double-labeled immunofluorescence stain and double-labeled immunohistochemistry stain in adjacent sections were used in our research to study the distribution, co-localization of FSH and its receptor and co-localization of FSH and GnRH receptor in rat hippocampus. The result found that pyramidal neurons from CA1 to CA4 region and granule neurons in dentate gyrus could express FSH and its receptor, majority of hippocampal neurons co-expressed FSH and its receptor, FSH and GnRH receptor. These suggested that hippocampal neurons not only express FSH but also act as FSH target cells. FSH may regulate the function of hippocampal neurons by ways of paracrine or autocrine. At the same time, GnRH may regulate the function of FSH neuron in hippocampus through GnRH receptor.
