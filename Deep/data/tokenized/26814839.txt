The tuning of glutamatergic transmission is an essential mechanism for neuronal communication. alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate fast synaptic transmission. The phosphorylation states of specific serine residues on the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits are considered critical post-translational modifications that regulate AMPAR activity and subcellular trafficking. While behavioral stress, via stress hormones, exerts specific alterations on such glutamatergic processes, there have been conflicting data concerning the influence of stress on AMPAR phosphorylation in different brain regions, and the post-stress signaling mechanisms mediating these processes are not well delineated. Here, we examined the dynamics of phosphorylation at three AMPAR serine residues (ser831-GluA1, ser845-GluA1, and ser880-GluA2) in four brain regions [amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal hippocampus, and ventral hippocampus] of the rat during the hour following behavioral stress. We also tested the impact of post-stress corticosteroid receptor blockade on AMPAR phosphorylation. Both GluA1 subunit residues exhibited elevated phosphorylation after stress, yet post-stress administration of corticosteroid receptor antagonists curtailed these effects only at ser831-GluA1. In contrast, ser880-GluA2 displayed a time-dependent tendency for early decreased phosphorylation (that was selectively augmented by mifepristone treatment in the amygdala and mPFC of stressed animals) followed by increased phosphorylation later on. These findings show that the in vivo regulation of AMPAR phosphorylation after stress is a dynamic and subunit-specific process, and they provide support for the hypothesis that corticosteroid receptors have an ongoing role in the regulation of ser831-GluA1 phosphorylation during the post-stress interval.
