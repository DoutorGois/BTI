We examined the changes in immunoreactivity of microtubuli-associated protein (MAP) 2 in dendrites by immunohistochemical analysis following 20 min of cerebral ischemia in the rat. A decrease of immunoreactivity of MAP 2 in dendrites in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus was observed on days 3 and 7 but not on day 1 after ischemia. Early destructive changes of this protein were not observed, a finding which was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. We elucidated one factor which indicated that destruction of the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons would not take place any earlier than the destruction of the neurons themselves after ischemia in rats.
