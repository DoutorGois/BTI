Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) post-translationally modifies proteins in a calcium-dependent manner by incorporation of polyamines, deamination or crosslinking. Moreover, tTG can also bind and hydrolyze GTP. tTG is the major transglutaminase in the mammalian nervous system, localizing predominantly in neurons. Although tTG has been clearly demonstrated to be elevated in neurodegenerative diseases and in response to acute CNS injury, its role in these pathogenic processes remains unclear. Transgenic mice that overexpress human tTG (htTG) primarily in CNS neurons were generated to explore the role of tTG in the nervous system and its contribution to neuropathological processes. tTG transgenic mice were phenotypically normal and were born with the expected Mendelian frequency. However, when challenged systemically with kainic acid, tTG transgenic mice, in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, developed more extensive hippocampal neuronal damage. This was evidenced by a decreased number of healthy neurons, and increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) labeling as an indicator of neuronal cell death in the kainic acid-treated transgenic mice. Moreover, the duration and severity of seizures developed by htTG transgenics in response to kainic acid administration were significantly more pronounced than those observed in WT mice. These data indicate for the first time that tTG may play an active role in excitatory amino acid-induced neuronal cell death, which has been postulated to be an important component of acute CNS injury and chronic CNS neurodegenerative conditions.
