Slices of hippocampus were incubated with Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides known to block members of the integrin class of matrix receptors. Though the peptides caused no detectable difference in the amount of long-term potentiation (LTP) expressed in the CA1 field 1-2 min after induction with high frequency stimulation, they did produce a reversible, dose dependent decay of LTP over a period of 40 min. This effect was not obtained with various non-RGD control peptides. These results suggest that stabilization of LTP requires adhesive interactions via specific matrix recognition sites, whereas induction and expression do not.
