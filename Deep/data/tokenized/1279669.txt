The results of anterograde and retrograde axonal transport experiments in the rat indicate that the dorsal premammillary nucleus (PMd) gives rise to a branched pathway ending in the anterior thalamic group and brainstem, like the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei. However, unlike these nuclei, the ascending PMd projection courses through and to the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, and the descending PMd projection ends in the periaqueductal gray, superior colliculus, and adjacent parts of the reticular formation. Also unlike the traditional mammillary nuclei, the PMd does not receive a direct input from the columns of the fornix; instead, it receives a bilateral input from the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, which in turn receives inputs from areas related to the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. The results provide interesting perspectives on the organization of medial hypothalamic circuits underlying the goal-oriented behaviors associated with hunger, thirst, and reproduction.
