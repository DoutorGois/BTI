Among the different forms of epilepsies, mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is one of the most common and represents the main pharmaco-resistant form of epilepsy. There is therefore an urgent need to better understand this form of epilepsy to develop better anti-epileptic drugs. Many rodent models are mimicking some aspects of the human temporal lobe epilepsy but only few are addressing most of the human mesiotemporal lobe epilepsy. In this article, we describe the main characteristics of a mouse of model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. This model is generated by a single injection of kainic acid into the dorsal hippocampus which reproduces most of the morphological and electrophysiological features of human MTLE in a mouse. This model may help to better understand mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and the development of new therapeutic drugs.
