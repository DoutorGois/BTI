A transient cerebral ischemia produced in rats by 4-vessel occlusion, produces with a delay of 24 h a fall in the number of somatostatin-containing neurons. In the present study we show that this loss is preceded by a loss of somatostatin mRNA that starts as soon as 30 min after the anoxic episode. By 24 h of revascularization the surviving somatostatinergic hilar cells present a transient recovery of hybridization signal. This effect could be related to a previously reported increase in intracellular calcium.
