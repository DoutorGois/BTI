The distribution of [3H]glycine binding sites was compared with that of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors labelled with L-[3H]glutamate, and with that of phencyclidine (PCP) receptors labelled with [3H]1-(1-(2-thienyl)-cyclohexyl)piperidine ([3H]TCP) in sections from 7 normal human hippocampi. The results indicate that strychnine-insensitive glycine binding sites are present in high concentrations in CA1 and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. This distribution is very similar to the distributions of NMDA and PCP receptors in the human hippocampus.
