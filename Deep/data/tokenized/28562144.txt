AIM: To investigate the behavioral deficits, cognitive impairment and possible mechanisms induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in mice of different ages. METHODS: The behaviors and cognition were tested using the open field test, tail suspension test and the Morris water maze. The changes in the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylation (p-ERK) in the hippocampus (HP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The 15-month-old mice revealed a significant decline in spontaneous behavior and the learning-memory function and showed a decrease in IGF-II and p-ERK expression levels in HP and PFC. Four weeks of CUS exposure induced significant anxiety- and depression-like behavior and learning-memory function impairment in 3- to 15-month-old mice, and reduced IGF-II and p-ERK expression levels in HP and PFC, compared with control group mice, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioral deficits and cognitive impairment induced by CUS and aging in mice could be associated with the down-regulated expression of IGF-II and p-ERK in HP and PFC. This role seems to be dependent on the intracellular ERK pathway.
