Tenascin-C is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein with trophic and repulsive properties, involved in migratory processes in CNS. Previous reports demonstrated that this molecule is produced and secreted by astrocytes. Preliminary data on fibroblasts and astrocytes have suggested that bFGF may modulate tenascin-C expression. bFGF is a mitogenic growth factor, involved in cell differentiation and neovascularization. In the present study, we examined whether bFGF modulates the expression of tenascin-C in hippocampal astrocytes from newborn rats. Our results suggest that bFGF increases the production of tenascin-C by cultured hippocampal astrocytes. We found that both tenascin-C mRNA and protein immunoreactivity were increased after bFGF treatment. Our results also demonstrated that tenascin-C polypeptides were secreted into the extracellular medium. In agreement with previous studies, we suggest that secreted tenascin-C is mainly the high molecular weight form. In addition, our results suggest that a cleavage of the high molecular weight form. In addition, our results suggest that a cleavage of the high molecular weight form may occur in the extracellular medium causing production of proteolytic fragments, that may modify the biological properties of tenascin-C. The present results may be relevant to the understanding of lesion scarring and regeneration process.
