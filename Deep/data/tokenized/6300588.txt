[3H] RO5-4864 binding sites have been characterized in kidney, heart, brain, adrenals and platelets in the rat. In all these organs the following order of potency in the RO5-4864 displacement was found: RO5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam indicating that they correspond to the "peripheral type" of benzodiazepine binding sites. PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, displaces [3H] RO5-4864 from its binding sites in all the organs. PK 11195 was as potent as RO5-4864 in the platelets, heart, adrenals, kidney and several brain regions (midbrain, hypothalamus, medulla + pons and hippocampus. However it was 5 to 10 times more effective in cortex and striatum. In conclusion PK 11195 might represent a new tool to elucidate the physiological relevance of "peripheral type" benzodiazepine binding sites and might help to discriminate the hypothetical subclasses of these binding sites.
