Currently antidepressants take several weeks to be effective, which is one of the main reasons why patients with depression quit therapy. In the present study, we examine the acute and subacute effects of soluble epoxide hydolase (sEH) inhibitor (sEHI), a compound shown to have antidepressant effects, on mice. We found that acute administration of sEHI TPPU decreases immobility time in the forced swimming test and reduces latency to feed in the novelty suppressed-feeding test in adult male mice. Intraperitoneal administration of TPPU for seven days also increased interaction time of socially defeated mice in the social defeat test. Hippocampal BDNF expression and cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus increased six and 24 hours after TPPU treatment, respectively. Improvement in antidepressant behavior and cell proliferation were inhibited by BDNF-trkB antagonist K252a, which suggests that anti-depressant effects of sEHI may be involved in BDNF signaling. Taken together, our findings suggest that sEHI may provide a rapid antidepressant effect through alterations to BDNF-trkB signaling in the hippocampus and may provide an alternative to current slow-acting antidepressants.
