The present study examined the protective effects of vitamin E against aluminum-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Wistar rats were given daily aluminum via their drinking water containing 1600 mg/liter aluminum chloride for six weeks. Aluminum induced a significant increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in hippocampus and frontal cortex. Furthermore, aluminum caused marked elevation in the levels of the glial markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100B) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1beta) in both brain areas. Vitamin E treatment reduced the contents of glial markers and cytokines and the levels of LPO. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that vitamin E ameliorates glial activation and reduces release of proinflammatory cytokines induced by aluminum.
