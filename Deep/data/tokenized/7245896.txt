Results of experiments on animals with ablation of different parts of the brain and analysis of published data suggest that the neurophysiological basis of temperaments, according to Hippocrates, of nervous system types, according to Pavlov, and of extra-introversion consists in individual peculiarities of interaction of four structures: the frontal neocortex, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the hypothalamus. Pathological disturbance of this interaction produces the basic varieties of neuroses: hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia and obsessive states. The significance is discussed of individual features of sets and hierarchy of basal human needs: material-biological, social, ideal (with their variants: retention and development, "for oneself" and "for others") needs of overcoming (will) and of "fitness" - for the formation of individuality.
