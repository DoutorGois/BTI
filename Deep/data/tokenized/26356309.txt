AIDA-1 is highly enriched in postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions and is considered a major component of the PSD complex. In the present study, immunogold electron microscopy was applied to determine localization as well as the activity-induced redistribution of AIDA-1 at the PSD using two antibodies that recognize two different epitopes. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons under basal conditions, immunogold label for AIDA-1 is mostly located within the dense core of the PSD, with a median distance of ~30 nm from the postsynaptic membrane. Under excitatory conditions, such as depolarization with high K+ (90 mM, 2 min) or application of NMDA (50 muM, 2 min), AIDA-1 label density at the PSD core is reduced to 40% of controls and the median distance of label from the postsynaptic membrane increases to ~55 nm. The effect of excitatory conditions on the postsynaptic distribution of AIDA-1 is reversed within 30 minutes after returning to control conditions. The reversible removal of AIDA-1 from the PSD core under excitatory conditions is similar to the redistribution of another abundant PSD protein, SynGAP. Both SynGAP-alpha1 and AIDA-1 are known to bind PSD-95. Activity-induced transient translocation of these abundant proteins from the PSD core could promote structural flexibility, vacate sites on PSD-95 for the insertion of other components and thus may create a window for synaptic modification.
