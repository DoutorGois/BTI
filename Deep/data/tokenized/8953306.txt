We investigated the contribution of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic system to spatial and nonspatial aspects of learning and memory that had previously been found to correlate with the extent of the hippocampal intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber projection in different inbred mouse strains. The following cholinergic and GABAergic markers were measured in the septi and hippocampi of male mice: the number of cholinergic and parvalbumin-containing neurons in the medial septum/vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca (MS/vDB), the number of septo-hippocampal cholinergic and GABAergic projection neurons, the density of cholinergic fibers in different hippocampal subfields, and the density of muscarinic receptors (predominantly M1 and M2) in the hippocampus. In addition, animals were behaviorally tested for spatially dependent and activity-dependent variables in a water maze and spatial and nonspatial working and reference memory in different experimental set-ups in an eight-arm radial maze. Using only those variables for which significant strain differences were obtained, we looked for covariations between behavior and neuroanatomy. The density of cholinergic fibers in the dentate gyrus was significantly correlated with activity-dependent learning in the water maze, whereas the number of septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection neurons correlated with spatial and, to a lesser extent, also with nonspatial aspects of radial maze learning. Only weak correlations were found between receptor densities and behavioral traits. From these data we conclude that variations in the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system, like variations in the mossy fiber projection, entail functional consequences for different types of maze learning in mice.
