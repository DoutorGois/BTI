Kluver-Bucy syndrome may result from affection of various location of brain. We report a case of Kluver-Bucy syndrome associated with isolated bilateral hippocampal atrophy without any abnormal lesion in other areas following status epilepticus. A 31-year-old man who had no significant medical history presented with status epilepticus after encephalitis of unknown etiology. He had been recovered from status epilepticus three weeks later, but afterwards he developed Kluver-Bucy syndrome: hyperphagia, hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis, anterograde amnesia and dysosmia. Initial brain MRI showed T2 hyperintensity and swelling of isolated bilateral hippocampus, especially CA1 region without any abnormal lesion in other areas. One month later, follow-up brain MRI showed isolated bilateral hippocampal atrophy. This is a meaningful case report because this case differs from other reports of Kluver-Bucy syndrome in humans in that the anatomic abnormalities revealed by MRI were very selective. We report this case because this case is very educative for above reason. Moreover, this report would give us additional information of the relationship between human behavior and limbic system.
