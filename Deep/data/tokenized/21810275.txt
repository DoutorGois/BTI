BACKGROUND: Proanthocyanidin is a polyphenolic bioflavonoid with known antioxidant activity. Some flavonoids have a modulatory effect on [Ca(2)(+)]i. Although proanthocyanidin extract from blueberries reportedly affects Ca(2)(+) buffering capacity, there are no reports on the effects of proanthocyanidin on glutamate-induced [Ca(2)(+)]i or cell death. In the present study, the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) on glutamate-induced excitotoxicity was investigated through calcium signals and nitric oxide (NO) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. RESULTS: Pretreatment with GSPE (0.3-10 mug/ml) for 5 min inhibited the [Ca(2)(+)]i increase normally induced by treatment with glutamate (100 muM) for 1 min, in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment with GSPE (6 mug/ml) for 5 min significantly decreased the [Ca(2)(+)]i increase normally induced by two ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists, N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). GSPE further decreased AMPA-induced response in the presence of 1 muM nimodipine. However, GSPE did not affect the 50 mM K+-induced increase in [Ca(2)(+)]i. GSPE significantly decreased the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (RS)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine-induced increase in [Ca(2)(+)]i, but it did not affect caffeine-induced response. GSPE (0.3-6 mug/ml) significantly inhibited synaptically induced [Ca(2)(+)]i spikes by 0.1 mM [Mg(2)(+)]o. In addition, pretreatment with GSPE (6 mug/ml) for 5 min inhibited 0.1 mM [Mg(2)(+)]o- and glutamate-induced formation of NO. Treatment with GSPE (6 mug/ml) significantly inhibited 0.1 mM [Mg(2)(+)]o- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neuronal cell death. CONCLUSIONS: All these data suggest that GSPE inhibits 0.1 mM [Mg(2)(+)]o- and oxygen glucose deprivation-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of calcium signals and NO formation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.
