Spatial navigation in the real-world is a complex task that involves many functions, such as landmark identification, orientation, and the calculation of heading vectors. This study uses a 2 x 2 experimental design with fMRI to isolate mnemonic and navigational processes that accompany the calculation of heading vectors. The conditions are based on a working memory version of the Morris water maze task and navigation takes place in a visually austere virtual environment. In an allocentric condition, subjects navigate around a circular arena where there is one small red square on the wall. Each trial begins with an encoding phase in which subjects locate and navigate to a visible coin. Then, in a test phase, after being randomly repositioned, they retrieve the coin when it is invisible. In a control task, there are eight distinct cues around the arena that provide direct cue-place information. Results show significant interaction effects in bilateral posterior parietal cortex, which is compatible with evidence that parietal cortex helps translating between allocentric coordinates and egocentric directions. There was also greater activation for the allocentric task in right posterior hippocampus and left retrosplenial cortex, which could be related to self-localization and orientation. The findings are also compatible with the recent proposal by Kubie and Fenton (2009) that navigation primarily depends on heading vectors between salient places.
