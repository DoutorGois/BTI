In the present study, the effects of intrahippocampal injections of cholinergic ligands on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures were investigated in rats. The rats were assigned to 1 of the following 9 groups: saline, nicotine (0.5 or 1 mug), atropine (0.25 or 1 mug), oxotremorine-M (0.1 or 1 mug), or mecamylamine (2 or 8 mug). Cholinergic ligands were administered via intrahippocampal infusion 30 min before seizure induction (intraperitoneal injection of 80 mg/kg PTZ). Results show that antagonists caused nonsignificant increases in the latency of tonic-clonic seizures, significant decreases in the duration of tonic-clonic seizures, significant decreases in the latency of death, and increases in mortality rate. Agonists led to increases in the duration of tonic-clonic seizures, decreases in the latency of death, and decreases in mortality rate. These results provide compelling evidence that cholinergic ligands show modulatory effects on a PTZ model of acute seizure in the rat hippocampus.
