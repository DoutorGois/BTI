The expression of hexokinase messenger RNA was evaluated in human hippocampus using in situ hybridization technique. The message showed an uneven distribution with high levels present in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus and CA3 region. The detection of specific transcripts was also observed in the lateral geniculate nucleus, the dentate polymorphic cell layer and the parahippocampal gyrus. The data suggest that, in the hippocampus, the expression of hexokinase is higher in neurons than in glial cells and that the rate of glucose metabolism may display considerable variations in the different subregions of this area.
