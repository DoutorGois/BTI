The effect of transient forebrain ischemia on NADPH-diaphorase-containing neurons was examined in the dentate gyrus of the gerbil. NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry was performed in animals subjected to temporary occlusion of the common carotid arteries and sham-operated animals. Seven days following transient ischemia, the number of NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons in the infragranular zone of the dentate gyrus was reduced by approximately 50% compared with control animals. Since neighboring granule cells are known to be resistant to this level of ischemic challenge, the present observations indicate that NADPH-diaphorase-containing neurons in the dentate gyrus are selectively vulnerable to brief ischemia.
