The post-natal developmental expression in rat retina of four calcium-binding proteins belonging to the calmodulin-troponin-C family was investigated by immunohistochemistry using anti-calbindin-D28k, anti-calretinin, anti-hippocalcin and anti-neurocalcin polyclonal antibodies on paraffin sections from Wistar rat retinae aged from post-natal days 1 (P1), 5 (P5), 10 (P10), 20 (P20) to adulthood (8 weeks). Immunoblot using anti-hippocalcin and homogenates proteins from retina, cerebellar cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum was also performed. Hippocalcin immunoreactivity in adult rat retina was demonstrated by both immunohistochemistry and Western blot. During post-natal development, calbindin-D28k, calretinin and neurocalcin immunoreactivity were detected at P1 in ganglion cells, whereas hippocalcin immunoreactivity was seen later at P5 in this cell layer. In the amacrine cell layer, neurocalcin immunoreactivity was detected at P5 and hippocalcin at P10. Calbindin-D28k was labelling the immature horizontal cell, calretinin was detected in nearly all ganglion cells and in some amacrine cells since P1. These three calcium-binding proteins do not seem to play a role in synaptogenesis which takes place later. We confirmed that calbindin-D28k appeared to be a good marker for horizontal cells. The presence of hippocalcin, a myristoylated calcium-binding protein belonging to the recovering subfamily and previously localized in few brain areas has been detected for the first time in retina.
