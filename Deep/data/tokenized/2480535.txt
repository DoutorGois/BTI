The effect of chronic administration of lithium on the concentration of biogenic amines and some of their metabolites in striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, pons-medulla and parietal cortex of rat were studied. Longterm lithium treatment modifies significantly the content of indoleamines in striatum and hypothalamus with minor changes in other structures. Catecholamine levels change after the treatment in striatum, hypothalamus, pons-medulla and parietal cortex. These results indicate that lithium treatment at therapeutic doses selectively modifies the catecholamine and indoleamine contents in discrete areas of the brain.
