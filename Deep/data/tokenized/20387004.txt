To elucidate the relationships among the brain regions belonging to the limbic system, the authors investigated the relationships among the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, mammillary body, and fornix, using the anterior commissure as a control, from a viewpoint of elements. After ordinary dissections at Nara Medical University were finished, the hippocampi, dentate gyri, mammillary bodies, fornices, and anterior commissures were resected from identical cerebra of the subjects. The subjects consisted of 23 men and 23 women, ranging in age from 70 to 101 years (average age = 83.5 +/- 7.5 years). After ashing with nitric acid and perchloric acid, element contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. With regard to seven elements of Ca, P, S, Mg, Zn, Fe, and Na, it was examined whether there were significant correlations among the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, mammillary body, fornix, and anterior commissure. It was found that there were extremely or very significant direct correlations among all of the five brain regions of the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, mammillary body, fornix, and anterior commissure in the P content. Likewise, with regard to the Fe content, there were significant direct correlations among the four brain regions belonging to the limbic system, except for the anterior commissure. In both the Ca and Zn contents, there were extremely or very significant direct correlations among the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and mammillary body of the gray matter.
