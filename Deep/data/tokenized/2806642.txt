The effect of oxytocin (OXT) administration into the brain ventricles on the process of narcotic dependence formation was studied before and following hippocampal lesion. OXT was found to inhibit the process of narcotic dependence formation. The hippocampal lesion weakened the inhibitory effect. A specific hippocampal involvement in the processes of narcotic reinforcement was suggested.
