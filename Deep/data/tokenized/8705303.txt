Development of kindling and mossy fiber sprouting, and changes of gene expression were studied after 40 seizures produced during about 3 h by electrical stimulation every 5 min in the ventral hippocampus. As assessed by 5 test stimulations, enhanced responsiveness was present already after 6-24 h but from 1 week post-seizure increased gradually up to 4 weeks without additional stimuli. Sprouting of mossy fibers in the dentate gyrus was demonstrated only at 4 weeks with Timm's staining. In situ hybridization showed a transient increase (maximum at 2 h) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkB and TrkC mRNA levels and reduction (maximum at 12-24 h) of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) mRNA expression in dentate granule cells after the seizures. In addition, BDNF mRNA levels were elevated in CA1 and CA3 regions, amygdala and piriform cortex. Marked increases of mRNA for growth-associated protein (GAP-43), with maximum expression at 12-24 h, were observed in dentate granule cells and in amygdala-piriform cortex. Dynorphin mRNA levels showed biphasic changes in dentate granule cells with an increase at 2 h followed by a decrease at 24 h. No long-term alterations of gene expression were observed. These findings indicate that increased responsiveness develops rapidly after recurring seizures but that the kindled state is reached gradually in about 4 weeks. Mossy fiber sprouting occurs in parallel to epileptogenesis and may play a causative role. Short-term changes of neurotrophin and Trk, GAP-43 and dynorphin mRNA levels and the assumed alterations of the corresponding proteins could trigger structural rearrangements underlying kindling but might also contribute to the initial increase of seizure susceptibility.
