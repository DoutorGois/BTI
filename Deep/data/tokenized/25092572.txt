There are strong evidences showed that psychological stress (PS) could result in depression. Recently, many attentions were paid to the roles of corticosterone (CORT) and zinc dyshomeostasis in the development of depression. In this study, we investigated the zinc level in rat hippocampus after exposure to PS and accompanied behavior change. Male SD rats were randomly divided into the control and PS groups. Each group had two subgroups: 7-d group and 14-d group. A communication box was used to produce the PS model in rats. Compared to control group, the PS-treated group showed decreased total zinc levels and increased free zinc levels observed by TSQ staining in hippocampus. Meanwhile, there were significant decreases in mRNA expressions of zinc transporters including ZnT1, ZnT3 and ZIP1 and metallothionein (MT) contents in hippocampus. Moreover, the increased immobility time in forced swim test (FST), lower movement time and total movement distance and longer immobile time in spontaneous activity test were demonstrated in rats after PS exposure. These results suggested that the depression-like behavior in PS-treated rats might be correlated with zinc dyshomeostasis including decreased zinc contents and increased free zinc in hippocampus which was related to changes in zinc transporters and MT expressions.
