A study was made of the effects of isothiobarbamine and guthimine (10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively) on the content of cAMP and cGMP in the brain cortex (BC) and hippocamp under normal conditions and hypoxia. Isothiobarbamine did not change the content of both cyclic nucleotides under normoxia, whereas under hypoxia it reduced the level of the cyclic nucleotides in the BC and raised it in the hippocamp. Guthimine increased their content in the BC and did not change it in the hippocamp under normoxia, whereas under hypoxia it increased the cAMP content in the hippocamp and did not change it in the BC. The cGMP content descended in both the structures under study.
