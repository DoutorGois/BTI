Amygdaloid kindling of rats produced an increase in hippocampal Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 and cholecystokinin immunoreactivities and simultaneously a decrease in dynorphin A1-8 content. In substantia nigra Met5-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 was increased and no change was observed in dynorphin A1-8 content. These data suggest that specific alterations of neuropeptides in limbic and extrapyramidal circuits are prominent manifestations of the kindling process or kindled seizures.
