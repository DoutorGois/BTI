A simple and versatile fabrication process is used to define conducting polymer microelectrode arrays (MEAs), patterning at the same time the recording electrodes as well as the insulating layer. Thanks to the low impedance of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) electrodes, these MEAs allow in vitro recording of action potentials from rat hippocampus slices.
