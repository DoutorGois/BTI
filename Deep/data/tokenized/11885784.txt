Na+,K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase activities were determined in the synaptic plasma membranes from hippocampus of rats subjected to chronic and acute proline administration. Na+,K+-ATPase activity was significantly reduced in chronic and acute treatment by 33% and 40%, respectively. Mg2+-ATPase activity was not altered by any treatment. In another set of experiments, synaptic plasma membranes were prepared from hippocampus and incubated with proline or glutamate at final concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 mM. Na+,K+-ATPase, but not Mg2+-ATPase was inhibited (30%) by the two amino acids. In addition, competition between proline and glutamate for the enzyme activity was observed, suggesting a common binding site for these amino acids. Considering that Na+,K+-ATPase activity is critical for normal brain function, the results of the present study showing a marked inhibition of this enzyme by proline may be associated with the neurological dysfunction found in patients affected by type II hyperprolinemia.
