Sectioning the dorsal afferents to the rat hippocampus led to an 88% decrease in the level of noradrenaline in the dorsal third of the structure, a 62% reduction in the medial region and no significant change in the ventral third. The lesion did not produce a change in either the affinity or maximum binding capacity of the alpha 1-adrenoceptors in any of the three regions of the hippocampus, as assessed by the binding of the radioligand [125I]BE 2254. This result indicates that reported increases in the response to noradrenaline in hippocampal slices after denervation is most likely due to a loss of noradrenaline uptake mechanisms.
