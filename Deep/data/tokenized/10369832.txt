Some amnesic patients show an impairment of temporal order memory that cannot be accounted for by content memory deficits. The performance of an amnesic patient on memory tasks assessing the patient's content and temporal memories for remotely acquired material is described, after a lesion including the bilateral anterior fornix and adjacent anterior thalamus. The patient displayed a deficit in the temporal order tasks for remotely acquired information. Neither frontal cognitive deficits nor recognition deficits can account for this patient's poor temporal memory. This retrograde temporal order memory impairment without content memory deficits were not seen in previously reported thalamic amnesic patients. Accordingly, the present patient's poor retrograde temporal memory could hardly be explained by only a thalamic lesion. It is concluded that the patient's impairment of temporal order memory for the retrograde material is probably due to the direct disconnection between the frontal lobe and the hippocampus by disruption of the fornix.
