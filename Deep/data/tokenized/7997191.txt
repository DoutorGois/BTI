We investigated effects of homocarnosine (gamma-aminobutyric-histidine) dipeptid on neuron nucleus caudatus and hypocampus activity in small and hungry experimental animals--awake grown-up rabbits. In the given conditions, through glass microelectrodes having several channels, an extracellular registration of impulse discharge was performed as well as the microapplication of homocarnosine (HC) in the immediate surroundings of registered neurons. The obtained results show that the investigated different functional conditions of the organism are manifested in the neurons' activity of the investigated brain structures. Homocarnosine represses the activity of most registered neurons in both satiated and hungry experimental animals, while that effect is more manifested in satiated animals. The demonstrated effects of homocarnosine point to its probable neuromediator role.
