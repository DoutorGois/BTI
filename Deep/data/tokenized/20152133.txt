Long-term storage of episodic memories is hypothesized to result from the off-line transfer of information from the hippocampus to neocortex, allowing a hippocampal-independent cortical representation to emerge. However, off-line hippocampal-cortical interactions have not been demonstrated to be linked with long-term memory. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined if hippocampal-cortical BOLD correlations during rest following an associative encoding task are related to later associative memory performance. Our data show enhanced functional connectivity between the hippocampus and a portion of the lateral occipital complex (LO) during rest following a task with high subsequent memory compared to pretask baseline resting connectivity. This effect is not seen during rest following a task with poor subsequent memory. Furthermore, the magnitude of hippocampal-LO correlations during posttask rest predicts individual differences in later associative memory. These results demonstrate the importance of postexperience resting brain correlations for memory for recent experiences.
