Three-month old Long-Evans female rats were submitted to aspirative lesions of the fimbria-fornix and intrahippocampal grafts of a cell suspension prepared from a region of the fetal brain including the septum and the diagonal band of Broca (rich in cholinergic neurons) or the raphe (rich in serotonergic neurons). A group of lesioned rats was grafted with both suspensions mixed. Lesion-only and sham-operated rats served as controls. Four months after the lesions, all rats were tested daily for locomotor activity in their home cage, 1 day without being injected, 2 days with an injection of NaCl and 5 days with an injection of 1 mg/kg (i.p.) d-amphetamine. The effects of the lesions and grafts were assessed by measuring the accumulation of [3H]-choline or [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) by hippocampal slices, and the electrically-evoked release of tritium. Amphetamine injections produced hyperlocomotion which was potentiated by the lesion. This lesion-induced potentiation was also found in rats with septal grafts, but not in those with raphe or co-grafts. The uptake and electrically-evoked release of [3H]-acetylcholine or [3H]-5-HT were reduced in hippocampal slices from lesion-only rats. In rats which received grafts of septal cells or co-grafts, but not in those with raphe grafts, uptake and release of [3H]-acetylcholine were close to normal. Uptake and release of [3H]-5-HT were close to normal in rats with raphe grafts or with co-grafts, but not in those with septal grafts. Altogether, these data suggest that damage to the serotonergic afferents of the hippocampus might play some role in the potentiation of amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion associated with fimbria-fornix lesions.
