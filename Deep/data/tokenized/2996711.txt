Application of the brain neuropeptide Y (NPY) to rat hippocampus in vitro reversibly reduced the amplitude of the CA1 population spike evoked by stratum radiatum stimulation. Threshold for the effect was 10(-8) M. NPY had similar effects on single pulse- and paired pulse-evoked population spikes. Antidromic population spikes, evoked from the alveus, were unaffected by NPY. Thus, NPY appears to modulate excitatory transmission in the hippocampus by a presynaptic mechanism.
