Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that accumulation of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain may underlie the hyperarousal symptoms experienced in post-traumatic stress disorder. In animal experiments, however, the effect of stress on NA content appears complex; acute stress reduces the level, while chronic stress tends to increase it. To explain this discrepancy, it is necessary to observe the long-term effects of acute stress on NA metabolism in the brain. In this study, rats were exposed to intermittent intense footshock stress for 1 h, and the brain NA content was measured for 7 days after the stress stimulus. Hypothalamic NA content was immediately reduced and recovered within 24 h. However, a significant NA increase was observed 7 days after the footshock. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, an increase in NA content was observed 1 day after the stress and lasted for at least 7 days. The fact that the content of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, a major NA metabolite, only transiently increased in all these regions possibly reflects NA release. These results indicate that increase in the brain NA content can be induced by acute stress, though its emergence is delayed. Importantly, this suggests that both acute and chronic stress may lead to NA accumulation under the same mechanism.
