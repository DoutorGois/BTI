Knowledge about second messenger metabolizing enzymes in neuroglia is still rather fragmentary. Therefore, the aim of the present investigation was to localize adenylate cyclase, guanylate cyclase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and protein kinase A in glial cells of the rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Enzyme histochemical and immunohistochemical methods were used to detect the enzymes at the light and electron microscopic level. Astroglial cells were found to contain all 4 enzymes. Especially the microvascular glial cell processes were reactive. Oligodendroglial cells were only stained for adenylate cyclase acticity. Intracellularly, microtubules and intracellular membranes were frequently stained. The results point to the regulation of glial cell metabolism and of transport processes by cyclic nucleotides.
