Monoclonal antibody G10 binds to an epitope on a microtubule-associated protein and specifically labels elongating axons in the developing rat central nervous system. In this paper the expression of this microtubule-associated protein epitope has been studied in developing and regenerating rat peripheral neurons and sprouting and transplanted neurons in the central nervous system. During development bright immunofluorescent fibres were seen from embryonic day 12 (the earliest age studied) to birth, but immunoreactivity declined postnatally and was only barely detectable in adult sciatic nerves. In contrast to the situation in developing axons, immunostaining could not be demonstrated in axons regenerating after crushing of the sciatic nerve nor in axons growing from grafts of septal tissue into the adult hippocampus, despite good evidence for extensive reinnervation in both cases. Immunostaining was only seen at early stages within the septal grafts, and not as axons grew out to reinnervate the host. No staining was seen in areas of deafferented hippocampus where collateral sprouting takes place. These results suggest a molecular difference between the cytoskeletons of developing and regenerating or sprouting nerves.
