Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are known to play a role in synaptic plasticity and learning. We have previously shown that mGluR7 deletion in mice produces a selective working memory (WM) impairment, while other types of memory such as reference memory remain unaffected. Since WM has been associated with Theta activity (6-12 Hz) in EEGs, and since EEG abnormalities have been observed in these mice before, we studied the effect of mGluR7 gene ablation on EEG activity in the hippocampus, in particular in the Theta range, during performance of a WM task. In an eight-arm maze with four arms baited, mGluR7 knock-out (KO) and wild-type mice committed the same number of reference memory errors, whereas KOs committed more WM errors. While performing the task, KO mice showed substantially higher Theta amplitudes, and the ratio of Theta to overall EEG power was much increased. No change was seen in the Delta (0-5 Hz), or Gamma (30-40 Hz) EEG bands compared with controls. When recording EEGs during periods of rest in the home cages, no difference was seen between groups. These findings suggest that mGluR7 is important for modulation and control of Theta activity. Since only WM was affected, and only the Theta range of EEG activity was altered, these results show a correlation between Theta rhythm and WM performance, and therefore support the concept that Theta activity in the hippocampus is involved in WM storage.
