These experiments investigated in the awake rat the involvement of noradrenergic projections to the rostral hypothalamus in the drinking and pressor responses elicited by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of 25 ng of angiotensin II. Phentolamine mesylate in doses of 2.5-125 micrograms injected into the rostral hypothalamus produced a dose-dependent depression of both the drinking and pressor responses elicited by i.c.v. administration of angiotensin II. A paradoxical increase in heart rate was associated with a decrease in pressor responses with increasing doses of phentolamine. This response was due to tissue injections, since pretreatment by injecting 12.5 micrograms of phentolamine into the ventricle did not block either the cardiovascular or drinking responses to i.c.v. injections of angiotensin II. Yohimbine (0.33-3.3 micrograms), DL-propranolol (25 micrograms), and atenolol (25 micrograms) did not, but prazosin (0.7 microgram) did significantly alter the pressor responses. Although yohimbine also was without effect on drinking, prazosin reduced the drinking responses. These results suggest that alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the rostral hypothalamus are involved in the control of both the drinking and pressor responses elicited by i.c.v. injections of angiotensin II. In the case of propranolol and atenolol, beta-adrenergic receptors altered only the drinking response in a nonspecific manner by eliciting competing behaviors. Whether they are involved in modifying the drinking response only remains to be demonstrated.
