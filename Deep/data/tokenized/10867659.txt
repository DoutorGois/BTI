The connections between the medial temporal cortical areas and CA1 of the hippocampus were examined in the Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata) by means of retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing methods with wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue and Diamidino Yellow). The posterior parahippocampal (areas TF1, TF2, and TH), perirhinal (areas 35 and 36), and ventral inferotemporal areas (areas TEav and TEpv) were reciprocally connected with CA1. Projection fibers from CA1 to the medial temporal cortical areas originated in the pyramidal cell layer, whereas those from the medial temporal cortical areas to CA1 terminated in the molecular layer. Each of these cortical areas was reciprocally connected with the entire rostrocaudal extent of CA1. However, the intensity of the connections varied along the rostrocaudal axis of CA1: areas TH and TF2 were connected most markedly with the anterior and middle parts of CA1, respectively. Areas TF, 35, 36, TEav, and TEpv were connected predominantly with the posterior part of CA1. In the coronal plane of CA1, labeled cells were located in proximal CA1 (i. e., near the prosubiculum), but not in distal CA1 (i.e., near CA2). The medial temporal cortical areas in direct reciprocal connection with CA1 were presumed to be involved in the memory system, especially in the system for declarative memory.
