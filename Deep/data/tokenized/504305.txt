In hippocampus slices both dopamine and apomorphine lead to an increased incorporation of (3H)-fucose into total proteins, whereas the incorporation of (14C)-leucine was unchanged or decreased, respectively. Noradrenaline did not alter the incorporation of both precursors, whereas haloperidol partially reduced the dopamine induced increase in incorporation of fucose. Thus, an induction process of the observed macromolecular changes involving dopaminoceptive structures of hippocampus can be assumed.
