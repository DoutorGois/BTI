The basic mechanisms of nerve protection by estrogen remain to be clarified. This study was undertaken to confirm estrogen-induced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) mRNA expression in the immortalized rat hippocampal cell H19-7 using a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, which has considerably increased accuracy and rapidity over other current methods. Upon stimulation by estradiol, the copy number of ERalpha mRNA showed a 1.4-fold increase, and that of IGF-1 mRNA showed a 38.5-fold increase when compared with the control value. ICI182,780 inhibited the estradiol-induced upregulation of ERalpha mRNA completely, while it inhibited estradiol-stimulated IGF-1 mRNA expression partially. The increase of the copy number of IGF-1 mRNA was accomanied by enhancement of IGF-1 protein as observed by Western blot analysis.
