BACKGROUND: The acute kidney injury (AKI) may do damage to remote organs. Objective of the study is to investigate effect of seaweed extract (SE) on brain oxidative damage in kidney ischemia/reperfusion rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Animals were randomly divided into five groups. SE pre-fed to rats. RESULTS: Kidney I/R may cause oxidative injury in kidneys and brains tissue in rats. SE pre-treatment can decrease lipid peroxidation levels and increase antioxidant enzymes activities in kidney and brain hippocampus of kidney I/R rats. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that SE is useful for brain nerve function keeping in kidney I/R rats.
