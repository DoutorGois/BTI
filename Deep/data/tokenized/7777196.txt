Thirty days after induction of experimental diabetes the brain catecholamines namely, norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) were studied in discrete brain regions (striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons and medulla, cerebellum and cerebral cortex) in control, alloxan-diabetic untreated and insulin-treated diabetic rats. E showed significant increase in striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus, whereas NE was increased in hypothalamus, and decreased in pons and medulla significantly in untreated diabetic rats. These effects were not seen in the insulin-treated diabetic rats.
