The action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and some of its agonists and antagonists on the electrical activity of neurons from rat hippocampal slices was studied. GABA decreased the frequency of spontaneous electrical activity and raised the duration of the inhibitory period caused by electrical stimulation of the hippocampal slices. GABA agonists produced the similar action, while antagonists the contrary one. The method offered can be applied to the comparative test of GABA agonists and antagonists.
