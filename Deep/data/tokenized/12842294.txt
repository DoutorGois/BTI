Administration of 192IgG-saporin, a cholinergic neurotoxin, to the medial septum destroys the cell bodies from which the septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection originates, leading to reductions in both hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Despite reports that 192IgG-saporin-induced cholinergic loss leads to post-operative impairments in acquisition and performance of spatial memory tasks, a number of other reports have described intact spatial memory performance following these lesions. Factors that might account for these different outcomes include variations in toxin injection sites or volumes, and post-operative testing at times that might permit regeneration of damaged neuronal processes. We, therefore, assessed the effects of intraseptal microinjection of 192IgG-saporin, in rats, on the post-operative retention of pre-operatively acquired discrete-trial rewarded alternation in the T-maze. This design allowed us to assess the effects of the lesion 7 days post-surgery, at which point, at best, incomplete neuronal regeneration would have been expected to have occurred. The lesion led to a profound loss of hippocampal AChE staining, and a clear inflammatory response, as assessed by proliferation of OX42-stained macrophages in the medial septum and diagonal band nuclei, but there was no impairment in spatial working memory.
