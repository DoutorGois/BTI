Cardiovascular diseases are risk factors for depression in humans. We recently proposed that sigma1 receptor (sigma1R) stimulation rescued cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. Importantly, sigma1R stimulation reportedly ameliorates depression-like behaviors in rodents. Thus, we hypothesized that impaired sigma1R activity in brain triggers depression-like behaviors in animals with cardiovascular disease. Indeed, here we found that cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure induced by TAC were associated with depression-like behaviors concomitant with downregulation of sigma1R expression in brain 6 weeks after surgery. sigma1R levels significantly decreased in astrocytes in both the hippocampal CA1 region and dentate gyrus. Oral administration of the specific sigma1R agonist SA4503 (0.3-1.0mg/kg) significantly improved TAC-induced depression-like behaviors concomitant with rescued astrocytic sigma1R expression in CA1 and the dentate gyrus. Plasma corticosterone levels significantly increased 6 weeks after TAC, and chronic treatment of mice with corticosterone for 3 weeks elicited depression-like behaviors concomitant with reduced astrocytic sigma1R expression in hippocampus. Furthermore, the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone antagonized depressive-like behaviors and ameliorated decreased hippocampal sigma1R expression in TAC mice. We conclude that elevated corticosterone levels trigger hippocampal sigma1R downregulation and that sigma1R stimulation with SA4503 is an attractive therapy to improve not only cardiac dysfunction but depression-like behaviors associated with heart failure.
