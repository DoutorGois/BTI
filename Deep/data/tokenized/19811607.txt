Somatostatin-14 (SRIF) co-localizes with GABA in the hippocampus and regulates neuronal excitability. A role of SRIF in the control of hippocampal activity has been proposed, although the exact contribution of each SRIF receptor (sst(1)-sst(5)) in mediating SRIF action requires some clarification. We used hippocampal slices of wild-type and sst(1) knockout (KO) mice and selective pharmacological tools to provide conclusive evidence for a role of sst(1) in mediating SRIF inhibition of synaptic transmission. With single- and double-label immunohistochemistry, we determined the distribution of sst(1) in hippocampal slices and we quantified sst(1) colocalization with SRIF. With electrophysiology, we found that sst(1) activation with CH-275 inhibited both the NMDA- and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-mediated responses. Results from sst(1) KO slices confirmed the specificity of CH-275 effects; sst(1) activation did not affect the inhibitory transmission which was in contrast increased by sst(4) activation with L-803,087 in both wild-type and sst(1) KO slices. The AMPA-mediated responses were increased by L-803,087. Functional interaction between sst(1) and sst(4) is suggested by the finding that their combined activation prevented the CH-275-induced inhibition of AMPA transmission. The involvement of pre-synaptic mechanisms in mediating inhibitory effects of sst(1) on excitatory transmission was demonstrated by the finding that CH-275 (i) increased the paired-pulse facilitation ratio, (ii) did not influence the AMPA depolarization in the presence of tetrodotoxin, and (iii) inhibited glutamate release induced by epileptiform treatment. We conclude that SRIF control of excitatory transmission through an action at sst(1) may represent an important contribution to the regulation of hippocampal activity.
