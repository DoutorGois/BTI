Functional significance of central dopaminergic and serotonergic mechanism in relation to the pathogenesis of hypertension, was assessed in the brain of hypertensive rat (SHR) models. In the mesolimbic area, dopamine receptors were found to be significantly enhanced in the SHR as compared with the normotensive control, whereas serotonin receptors in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were not significantly altered in the SHR. Our results, coupled with our previous finding on the enhanced 3H-spiroperidol binding in the striatum support the hypothesis that supersensitivity of central dopamine receptors may contribute towards the development of hypertension.
