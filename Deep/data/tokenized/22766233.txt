Abelson interactor protein 1 (Abi-1) localizes to postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of excitatory synapses and was shown to be transported from the PSD to the nucleus and back depending upon synaptic activation. We employed a yeast-two-hybrid screen to search for putative transport molecules. We found Kif26B a member of the Kif family of transport proteins that has not been characterized in the central nervous system as a direct interaction partner of Abi-1. We delineated a proline-rich motif within the cargo-binding domain of Kif26B to be responsible for this protein-protein interaction. Kif26B was able to recruit Abi-1 to the microtubule network and we found that the expression of Kif26B is responsible for the localization of Abi-1 to PSDs in maturing neurons. Taken together we report that Abi-1 is a cargo of Kif26B in primary hippocampal neurons, pointing to a role of this transport molecule in the movement of Abi-1 between different cell compartments. Additionally, we provide the first detailed investigation of Kif26B and its cargo molecules in neuronal cells.
