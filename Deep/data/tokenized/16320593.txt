OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) inhibiting ODC activity in the cortex and hippocampus in rats. METHODS: Forty male rats was randomly divided into ischemal control group and DFMO pretreatment group. DFMO was given intravenously half an hour before global cerebral ischemia, and expression of ODC mRNA was measured by comparative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the cortex and hippocampus in rats after 2, 4, 6 h and 8 h of reperfusion. The variations of the expression of ODC mRNA were studied in the DFMO pretreatment group and the ischemal control group respectively. RESULTS: After 2, 4 and 6 h of reperfusion, the expression of ODC mRNA in the cortex and hippocampus in the pretreatment group was lower than that in the ischemia control group significantly (P <0.05, P <0.01), but not at 8 h reperfusion (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: DFMO suppressed the expression of ODC mRNA after different lengths of reperfusion following 10-minute global cerebral ischemia in rats and it may be one of the ways for DFMO to inhibit ODC activity.
