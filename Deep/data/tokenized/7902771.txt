Bath application of trypsin (0.05%, type I) gave rise to epileptiform activities in CA1 of the rat hippocampal slice. A non-competitive antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, MK-801, blocked the induction of the epileptiform activity, whereas a competitive antagonist, D-APV, showed weak antagonism on the induction of the epileptiform activity. These results may lead us to the understanding of the role of NMDA receptors in the neurotoxic action of trypsin.
