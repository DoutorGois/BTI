A modified enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Dot ELISA) is described for visual detection of rabies antigen in animals. The test materials were dotted onto the nitrocellulose paper and allowed to react with rabies antiserum. The bound antigen--anti-body were reacted with a peroxidase conjugated antirabbit immunoglobulin. Positive reactions were easily visualized as brown dots after enzyme degradation of the substrate. A total of 400 specimens from various geographical locations were tested with the dot ELISA technique, and also with the fluorescent antibody test (FAT), which was used as a reference method. The concordance between the two tests was 95.25%. The dot ELISA may have potential applications as a rapid, simple and economical field test in the diagnosis of rabies.
