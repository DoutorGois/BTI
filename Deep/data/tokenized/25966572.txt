The analysis of neuromorphological, neurophysiological, neurocognitive and neuropsychological data demonstrates the specific involvement of lateral, medial, orbital and rostral parts of prefrontal cortex in the selective regulation and organization of goal-directed behavior. Functional specialization of different prefrontal areas depends on their co-operation with posterior associative cortices and subcortical brain structures such as the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, hippocampus, amygdale and basal ganglia. Separate cortical and subcortical structures are included in functional networks which provide different aspects of the brain executive functions.
