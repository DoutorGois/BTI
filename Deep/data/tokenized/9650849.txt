Glucocorticoids exacerbate neuronal damage due to hypoxia, ischemia, seizure and hypoglycemia. Because the release of glutamate is closely involved in neuronal damage, the effects of dexamethasone on the ischemia-induced accumulation of extracellular amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, and glycine) were investigated in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region by a microdialysis-high-performance liquid chromatography procedure in vivo. There were no differences in the extracellular concentrations of amino acids before ischemia between the control group and the dexamethasone (3m microg, i.c.v.)-injected group. The concentration of glutamate reached 246% of that before ischemia within 2.5 min of transient forebrain ischemia. Dexamethasone augmented the increase in glutamate to 508% of that before ischemia. This finding suggests that glucocorticoids aggravate ischemic neuronal damage by causing glutamate to accumulate in the extracellular space.
