In this study we investigated changes of impulse activity of hippocampal neurons of the hippocampus by using ramp recordings. We have described the usage of serial ramp recordings of neuronal electrical activity for rapid testing of the generating ability of isolated hippocampal neurons. An analysis of the data has shown that the proposed protocol of serial ramp recordings allows to define additional characteristics of the neuronal impulse activity: (i) the thresholds for initiation of generation and suppression of the generation, (ii) the shape and amplitude of relationship between the interpulse intervals and neuronal depolarizations. The suggested stimulation protocols and related analysis are tools that can be effectively used to justify influence of chemicals or other experimental factors on the impulse activity of neurons.
