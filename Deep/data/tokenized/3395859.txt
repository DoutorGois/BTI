Two recently developed methods for estimating changes in presynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) homeostasis were used for the first time to evaluate the effects of acute and chronic ethanol treatments on GABA utilization. GABA accumulation in the left substantia nigra zona reticulata (SNR) following unilateral microinjection of gamma-vinyl GABA (GVG; 5 micrograms) was linear for at least 180 min while GABA concentrations in the uninjected right SNR did not change over this period. Net GABA accumulation (left minus right SNR) also increased linearly over this interval. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of ethanol (0.3, 1 or 3 g/kg) 15 min after GVG microinjection did not significantly change either the rate of GABA accumulation in left SNR, the net GABA accumulated or the concentration of GABA in the uninjected right SNR relative to saline injected controls over the 45-min test interval. Likewise, GABA accumulation in the left SNR or steady-state GABA concentrations in the right SNR of chronically intoxicated rats or physically dependent animals withdrawn from ethanol for 12 h did not change significantly from that dextrose-fed controls. In a separate study, the effects of acute and chronic ethanol treatments on the concentration of GABA in synaptosomes isolated from the frontal cortex, hippocampus, tectum, striatum, cerebellum or brainstem were determined. Thirty min after acute treatment with ethanol (0.5, 1, 2 or 4 g/kg, i.p.) the concentration of GABA in synaptosomes from any of these brain regions was not significantly altered. Furthermore, chronic ethanol treatment sufficient to induce physical dependence and a severe ethanol withdrawal syndrome also did not significantly modify synaptosomal GABA concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
