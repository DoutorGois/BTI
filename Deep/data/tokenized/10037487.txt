The amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) is a major component of the neuritic plaques that are a defining histological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. A beta can be directly toxic and pro-inflammatory to cells in vitro. Numerous reports have shown that oxidative damage and reactive oxygen species play a role in A beta-mediated neurotoxicity. 8-Epiprostaglandin F2alpha (8-isoprostane) is a well characterized product of lipid peroxidation that is formed nonenzymatically in cell membranes following an oxidative insult. We report a time- and concentration-dependent increase in 8-isoprostane levels in rat hippocampal cultures treated with A beta(1-40) or hydrogen peroxide. As evidence that 8-isoprostane production is part of an A beta toxic pathway, alkaline-treated peptide, which shows minimal toxic activity, resulted in greatly attenuated 8-isoprostane production. Although the increase in 8-isoprostane levels preceded cell death, exogenously added 8-isoprostane had no cytotoxic effects. The antioxidants vitamin E and propyl gallate attenuated A beta-induced 8-isoprostane formation yet had no effect on A beta-induced lactate dehydrogenase release. Neither vitamin E nor propyl gallate had any effect on A beta's ability to adopt a beta-pleated sheet structure and deposit on cells as determined by thioflavine S fluorescence. We conclude that 8-isoprostane is an indicator of A beta-induced damage but not necessarily a mediator of A beta-induced neurotoxicity. Also, 8-isoprostane could be a useful marker for assessing oxidative damage in the CNS.
