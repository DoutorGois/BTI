Type I and type II brain corticosteroid receptors are regulated by adrenal hormones as well as being under neural control. Recent studies have indicated that neurotransmitters such as serotonin and noradrenaline are also involved in the regulation of corticosteroid receptors. In a previous study, we showed that dopamine also modulates activity of the corticosteroid receptor system. In the present study, we examined the roles of the dopamine D1 and D2 receptor subtypes in the regulation of corticosteroid receptors. Adrenalectomized rats whose corticosterone levels were maintained within normal limits by corticosterone replacement implants, were injected intraperitoneally with the D1 agonist SKF 38393 or the D2 agonist LY 171555. Corticosteroid receptors were assayed in the ventral striatum and hippocampus. We have shown that the D1 agonist SKF 38393 decreased type II receptor affinity in both regions, whereas the D2 agonist LY 171555 had no effects. The results show that the influence of the dopaminergic system on corticosteroid receptors appears to be mediated by D1 receptors.
