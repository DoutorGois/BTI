Both the amygdala and hippocampus are damaged in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), suggesting that amygdalo-hippocampal interconnectivity is compromised in TLE. Therefore, we examined one of the major projections from the amygdala to the hippocampus, the projection from the amygdala to the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus/subiculum border region, and assessed whether it is preserved in rats with spontaneous seizures. Male Wistar rats were injected with kainic acid (9 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce chronic epilepsy. The occurrence of spontaneous seizures was monitored 5 or 15 weeks later by video-recording the rats for up to 5 days. Saline-injected animals served as controls. Thereafter, the retrograde tracer Fluoro-gold was injected into the border region of the temporal CA1/subiculum. Rats were perfused for histology 1-2 weeks later and sections were immunohistochemically processed to detect Fluoro-gold-positive cells. Comparison of the labeling in control and epileptic tissue indicated that a large cluster of retrogradely labeled cells in the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus was well preserved in epilepsy, even when the neuronal damage in the amygdala was substantial. Another large cluster of retrogradely labeled cells in the lateral division of the amygdalo-hippocampal area, the posterior cortical nucleus (part of the vomeronasal amygdala), and the periamygdaloid cortex (part of the olfactory amygdala), however, had disappeared in epileptic brain in parallel to severe neuronal loss in these nuclei. These data demonstrate that a projection from the parvicellular division of the basal nucleus to the temporal CA1/subiculum region is resistant to status epilepticus-induced neuronal damage and provides a candidate pathway by which seizure activity can spread and propagate from the amygdala to the hippocampal formation.
