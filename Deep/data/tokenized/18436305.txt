Star-fruit ingestion has been previously reported to cause severe neurotoxicity in uremic patients with symptoms ranging from hiccups, vomiting and consciousness disturbances to refractory status epilepticus, coma and death. MRI examinations of five uremic patients with severe neurological disturbances following star-fruit intoxication were reviewed. At the time of MRI, all patients presented with a confusional state, preceded by seizures in three cases. MRI showed focal (four patients) and diffuse (one patient) cortical hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted sequences, with a corresponding low apparent diffusion coefficient. An additional area of increased diffusion intensity was observed in the pulvinar (two patients) and hippocampus (two patients). MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful for the diagnosis of star-fruit neuro-intoxication which is associated with a poor prognosis and requires acute and appropriate treatment.
