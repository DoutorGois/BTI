The authors previously showed that metrizamide causes an inhibition in CO2 production in rat neural tissue. The purposes of this work were to test if this inhibition was the result of a competitive inhibition of metrizamide with the D-glucose transport system and to test the effect of other contrast media. Deoxyglucose was used as a marker for glucose. The first cellular system using rat hippocampus slices was designed to examine the effect of 15 mM and 80 mM metrizamide on deoxyglucose uptake. The second cell-free system, using isolated rat brain synaptosomes, was designed to evaluate more accurately the mechanism and kinetics of metrizamide's inhibitory effect on the uptake of deoxyglucose and to compare metrizamide to other nonionic contrast media (iohexol, iopamidol, iotrol, and iodixanol). These experiments demonstrate that there is inhibition of D-glucose uptake only in hippocampus slices and that the inhibition is dependent on the concentration of metrizamide. This does not, however, appear to be a competitive inhibitory effect on the carrier such as that between D-glucose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In synaptosomes, none of the contrast media had a significant effect on the uptake of 2-deoxyglucose.
