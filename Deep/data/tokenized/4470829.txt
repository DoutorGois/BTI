We have studied the cortical diffusion characteristics of seizures induced at cornu Ammonis by toppical application of:pentilenetetrazol (Metrazol), acetylcholine and stricnine. We have observed that cerebral cortex synchronise with cornu ammonis showing similar morphology, which is characteristic for the differents drugs applied. We have found similar characteristics in the cortical diffusion to those described in a previous paper 4 for the mechanical stimulation. Hence we must conclue that the variability of the discharges depends onto the position of the electrode in the anteroposterior axes. As far as the electrodes are situated backwards the activity is slower with spikes of higher amplitude and without cortical propagation.
