Little is known about injury-induced restructuring of cholinergic neurons projecting from the basal forebrain to nonhippocampal loci in the mature mammalian brain. In an attempt to address this issue further, we made unilateral knife cuts in the cingulate cortex of adult rats and assessed the rates and extents of fiber regeneration. Among the fibers interdicted by these transections were axons of the medial cholinergic pathway, which originates prominently in the diagonal band nuclei and projects to medial frontal, cingulate, and occipital cortices. Immediately following the lesion, acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing fibers proximal to the transection demonstrated increased enzyme activity that remained elevated for at least 12 weeks before returning to control values within 9 months. Loss of distal cholinesterase staining was seen from 1-2 weeks postaxotomy, with partial restoration of enzyme activity within 4 weeks. By 12 weeks, virtually complete restitution of laminar patterns of AChE innervation had occurred in the cortex posterior to the knife cut. At least part of this reinnervation was attributable to fibers growing or elongating across the glial scar, with the degree of regrowth being correlated positively with the rapidity and magnitude of wound closure. Sprouting from the cut ends of axons, as well as collateral growth of those and uncut adjacent fibers, are likely sources of fibers contributing to the restoration of normal laminar profiles of AChE activity.
