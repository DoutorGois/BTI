Fetal lambs were treated with a single dose of anti-mouse nerve growth factor (anti-NGF) at 80 days gestational age. The catecholamine content of tissues was determined at 135 days gestational age. There was a reduction of either norepinephrine, epinephrine, or both, in the thymus, thyroid, atrium (but not ventricle), lung, liver, kidney, and jejunum when compared with age-matched control fetuses. The spleen, ileum, colon, and the adrenal glands were not affected by anti-NGF. In treated fetuses there was a reduction in catecholamine content of the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, medulla, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord. These results show that some tissues are sensitive to, and some are refractory to, the action of anti-NGF at 80 days gestation. Also the results suggest that NGF may play a role in the development of catecholamine-containing neurons within the central nervous system.
