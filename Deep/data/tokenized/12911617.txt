Apolipoprotein-D (apoD), a member of the lipocalin family of proteins, binds to arachidonic acid and cholesterol among other hydrophobic molecules. Recently, elevated apoD levels have been reported in the post-mortem brains, as well as plasma, of schizophrenic patients and in rodent brains after chronic treatment with clozapine (CLOZ). These findings and the evidence for altered membrane lipid metabolism in schizophrenia suggest that apoD may have a role in the pathophysiology of illness, and also in the differential clinical outcome following treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs. Here, we compared the effects of these antipsychotics on the expression of apoD in rat brain. Chronic treatment with typical antipsychotic, haloperidol (HAL) reduced apoD expression in hippocampus, piriform cortex and caudate-putamen (p = 0.027-0.002), whereas atypical antipsychotics, risperidone (RISP) and olanzapine (OLZ) increased (p = 0.051 to < 0.001 and p = 0.048 to < 0.001, respectively) apoD expression. In hippocampus, HAL-induced changes were present in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus, however, apoD levels in motor cortex were unchanged. There were also very dramatic effects of HAL on the neuronal morphology, particularly, cellular shrinkage and disorganization with the loss of neuropil. Post-treatment, either with RISP or OLZ, was very effective in restoring the HAL-induced reduction of apoD, as well as cellular morphology. Similarly, pre-treatments were also effective, but slightly less than post-treatment, in preventing HAL-induced reduction of apoD. The increased expression of apoD by atypical antipsychotics may reflect a novel molecular mechanism underlying their favorable effects compared with HAL on cognition, negative symptoms and extra-pyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia.
