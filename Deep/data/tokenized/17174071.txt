We examined whether (-)-nicotine infusion can affect kainic acid (KA)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Although treatment with a single nicotine infusion (0.5 or 1.0 microg/side, i.c.v.) failed to attenuate KA-induced neurotoxicity, repeated nicotine infusions (1.0 microg/side/day for 10 days) attenuated the seizures, the severe loss of cells in hippocampal regions CA1 and CA3, the increase in activator protein (AP)-1 DNA binding activity, and mortality after KA administration. alpha-Bungarotoxin and mecamylamine blocked the neuroprotective effects of nicotine. These results suggest that repeated nicotine treatment provides alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated neuroprotection against KA toxicity.
