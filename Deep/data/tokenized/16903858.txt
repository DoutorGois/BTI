Synaptic plasticity is an important cellular mechanism that underlies memory formation. In brain areas involved in memory such as the hippocampus, long-term synaptic plasticity is bidirectional. Major forms of bidirectional plasticity encompass long-term potentiation (LTP), LTP reversal (depotentiation) and long-term depression (LTD). Protein kinases and protein phosphatases are important players in the induction of both LTP and LTD, and the serine/threonine protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), in particular, has emerged as a key phosphatase in these processes. The goal of the present study was to assess the contribution of PP1 to bidirectional plasticity and examine the impact of a partial inhibition of PP1 on LTP, LTD and depotentiation in the mouse hippocampus. For this, we used transgenic mice expressing an active PP1 inhibitor (I-1*) inducibly in forebrain neurons. We show that partial inhibition of PP1 by I-1* expression alters the properties of bidirectional plasticity by inducing a shift of synaptic responses towards potentiation. At low-frequency stimulation, PP1 inhibition decreases LTD in a frequency-dependent fashion. It favours potentiation over depression at intermediate frequencies and increases LTP at high frequency. Consistently, it also impairs depotentiation. These results indicate that the requirement of bidirectional plasticity for PP1 is frequency-dependent and that a broad range of plasticity is negatively constrained by PP1, a feature that may correlate with the property of PP1 to constrain learning efficacy and promote forgetting.
