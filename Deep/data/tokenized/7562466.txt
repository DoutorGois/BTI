Evoked fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were measured in mouse CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices after chronic ethanol treatment in vivo. Intracellular recordings were made 2, 4 and 6 hr after ethanol withdrawal, i.e., after the beginning of slice preparation. The resting membrane potentials were standardized to -60 mV by using constant current injection. The fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials were isolated by adding DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, bicuculline and nitrendipine to the bathing solution and injecting QX-314 into the recording cell; stimulation then evoked a monophasic depolarization with a maximum of 16.3 mV at about 30 msec after stimulation, which was inhibited by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinozaline-2,3-dione. At 4 and 6 hr after withdrawal, but not at 2 hr, the estimated fast excitatory postsynaptic potential conductance in slices from ethanol-treated mice was significantly larger than in those from control animals. There were no changes in stimulus/response relation or voltage-dependency of the depolarization. In the presence of these blocking agents, the thresholds for elicitation of field potentials was decreased at 6 hr from withdrawal. The slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were isolated by adding DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinozaline- 2,3-dione and bicuculline to the bathing solution; stimulation of the Schaffer collateral fibers then evoked a monophasic hyperpolarization with a maximum of 5.7 mV at about 180 msec after stimulation, which was inhibited by the gamma-aminobutyric acidB antagonist saclofen. At the three time points, the stimulus/response relation, voltage dependency of the hyperpolarization and estimated slow inhibitory postsynaptic conductance in ethanol-treated mice did not differ from control animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
