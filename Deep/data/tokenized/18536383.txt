OBJECTIVE: To observe the protective effects of total rhizoma panacis japonica saponins (tRPJS) on cerebral ischemia injury in rats. METHOD: The rat model of local cerebral ischemia by using thread method, produced the chronic forebrain ischemic by using the permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries in rats. Investigating the influence of tRPJS on the activity of NOS and iNOS in hippocampus region. RESULT: tRPJS obviously reduced the contents of NOS and iNOS in hippocampus region of local cerebral ischemia rat tRPJS inhibited the increase of iNOS content caused by pemanent ligation of bilateral carotid artery. CONCLUSION: tRPJS has significantly protective effects by virtue of decreasing iNOS.
