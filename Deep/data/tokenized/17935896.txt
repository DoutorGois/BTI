The entorhinal cortex lesion paradigm is a widely accepted and efficient method to provoke reactive synaptogenesis and terminal remodeling in the adult CNS. This approach has been used successfully to contrast the profile of reactivity from various proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in wild-type and apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient (APOE ko) mice. Results indicate that the production of the beta-amyloid 1-40 peptide (A beta 40) is increased in response to neuronal injury, with a timing that is different between wild-type and APOE ko animals. Moreover, we report that baseline levels of the A beta 40 peptide are significantly higher in the APOE ko mice. The expression of the apolipoprotein E receptor type 2 (apoER2) is also modulated by the deafferentation process in the hippocampus, but only in APOE ko mice. These results provide novel insights as to the molecular mechanisms responsible for the poor plastic response reported in apoE4-expressing and apoE deficient mice in response to hippocampal injury.
