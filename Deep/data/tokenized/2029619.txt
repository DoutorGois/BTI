In the CA1 region of hippocampal slices prepared from guinea-pigs, which had been orally treated with sabeluzole, long-term potentiation was significantly enhanced in those slices obtained from animals given 2.5 or 10.0 mg/kg. In an active avoidance task oral treatment of guinea-pigs with 2.5 or 10.0 mg/kg of sabeluzole significantly increased learning. The dose of 0.63 mg/kg was inactive in both paradigms. These results provide new evidence supporting the involvement of LTP in learning.
