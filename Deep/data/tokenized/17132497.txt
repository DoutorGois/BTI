Several knockout mice deficient in transferases, required for glycosylation of cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules, have recently been produced. Extracellular recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials in acute hippocampal slices prepared from these mutant mice proved to be a highly sensitive method to reveal the roles of transferases and related carbohydrates in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Although most available data have been collected for synaptic connections between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells, several other synapses are assessable for extracellular recording in the hippocampus, including connections between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells. Analysis of distinct forms of short- and long-term plasticity in these connections may be instrumental for dissection of mechanisms by which carbohydrates affect synaptic functions.
