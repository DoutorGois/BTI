Spontaneous patterns of hippocampal EEG and septal cell activity were studied in immobilized cats, and the influences of high frequency stimulation of medial hypothalamus (MH) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) were determined. Septal cells were divided into 3 classes on the basis of their discharge patterns: (1), rhythmic bursting (2), non-rhythmic bursting and (3), non-bursting, and the relationship of these discharge patterns to hippocampal theta rhythm was analyzed. Rhythmic bursting cells displayed close frequency and phase relations to hippocampal theta rhythm and were located chiefly in the diagonal band of Broca. Cells of the other two categories were found both within and outside of the diagonal band region.
