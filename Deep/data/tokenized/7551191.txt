This study investigates the plasticity of the excitatory synapses in an experimental model of epilepsy, the kainic acid-lesioned rat hippocampus. Stimulation of afferents in the CA1 area of lesioned hippocampi produced an epileptiform burst of action potentials, with an underlying synaptic potential composed of mixed alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA; 80%) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; 20%) receptor-mediated components. Tetanic stimulation yielded a long-term potentiation (LTP) of the mixed AMPA/NMDA receptor-mediated population excitatory postsynaptic potentials. However, the same type of tetanus resulted in a long-term depression (LTD) of pharmacologically isolated NMDA receptor-mediated responses. This LTD occurred independently of the antagonism of AMPA receptors. This suggests that tetanic stimulation produced LTP of AMPA and LTD of NMDA receptor-mediated responses simultaneously. Finally, both LTP and LTD were shown to be NMDA dependent. This property has profound functional implications for the control of excitatory networks in temporal lobe epilepsy.
