Distribution of type IX adenylyl cyclase and protein phosphatase calcineurin in the brain and in cultured hippocampal neurons from albino rat was immunohistochemically studied. Both enzymes were detected simultaneously in all synaptic structures of most cerebral neurons except for presynaptic sites, where calcium-inhibited type IX adenylyl cyclase was absent.
