Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common progressive form of dementia in aged people. Microscopical changes in the brains of AD patients include the formation of senile plaques (SPs), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and granulovacuolar degeneration and the deposition of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Aged dogs are known to suffer from cognitive dysfunction and this state is associated with deposition of Abeta in the brain. The aim of the present study was to investigate tau phosphorylation of neurons and astrocytes in the brain of aged dogs with progressive cognitive impairment. Changes in the brain of aged dogs with cognitive dysfunction were compared with those in the brain of patients with AD of Braak stage V. Immunohistochemically, Abeta deposition, phosphorylated tau Ser396 (p-tau Ser396) and ubiquitin were observed in the parietal cortex and hippocampus of aged dogs with cognitive dysfunction. Astrocytes with expression of p-tau Ser396 and neurons with co-localization of p-tau Ser396 and ubiquitin were observed. Expression of p-tau Ser396 and accumulation of ubiquitin were significantly increased in the parietal cortex and dorsal part of the hippocampus of the brain of aged dogs when compared with expression of these molecules in human AD.
