Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent type of dementia, has been associated with the accumulation of amyloid beta oligomers (AbetaOs) in the central nervous system. AbetaOs vary widely in size, ranging from dimers to larger than 100 kDa. Evidence indicates that not all oligomers are toxic, and there is yet no consensus on the size of the actual toxic oligomer. Here we used NU4, a conformation-dependent anti-AbetaO monoclonal antibody, to investigate size and shape of a toxic AbetaO assembly. By using size-exclusion chromatography and immuno-based detection, we isolated an AbetaO-NU4 complex amenable for biochemical and morphological studies. The apparent molecular mass of the NU4-targeted oligomer was 80 kDa. Atomic force microscopy imaging of the AbetaO-NU4 complex showed a size distribution centered at 5.37 nm, an increment of 1.5 nm compared to the size of AbetaOs (3.85 nm). This increment was compatible with the size of NU4 (1.3 nm), suggesting a 1:1 oligomer to NU4 ratio. NU4-reactive oligomers extracted from AD human brain concentrated in a molecular mass range similar to that found for in vitro prepared oligomers, supporting the relevance of the species herein studied. These results represent an important step toward understanding the connection between AbetaO size and toxicity.
