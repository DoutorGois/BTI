Patch clamp technique was applied to the plasma membrane of cultured hippocampal neurons of rat. Elementary currents of a cation-selective channel were elicited by low intracellular pH (pHi 3.5-4.5). Channel activity starts with 1-2 min delay from the application of low pHi, and persists upon restoration of physiological pH conditions. The channel has a conductance of approx. 110 pS in symmetrical 300 mM NaCl, and is strongly selective for cations over anions. The channel is active over the whole voltage range tested (from +75 mV to -75 mV). Mean open time is function of voltage, increasing with depolarization. Low pH applied extracellularly did not activate the channel.
