Recently, it has been demonstrated that glial cells express a variety of ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors and can modulate the neuronal activities. We focused on interneuron/peri-interneuronal glial cell pairs in the hippocampus to investigate the direct interactions between these cells. The periinterneuronal astrocytes suppressed the excitatory postsynaptic currents in an adjacent interneuron through the presynaptic mechanism. Moreover, peri-interneuronal astrocytes activation modulated the interneuronal firing pattern with time dependent manner. These results indicate that peri-interneuronal astrocytes play important roles in the modulation of hippocampal excitability.
