Organotypic co-cultures of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus were examined to determine the role of the entorhinal fibers in the dendritic development and formation of spines of dentate granule cells. Quantitative analysis of Golgi-impregnated granule cells in single hippocampal cultures and co-cultures with the entorhinal cortex revealed that the presence of entorhinal fibers promoted the elongation and differentiation of the target granule cell dendrites. This was accompanied by an increase in the total number of spines. The contribution of neuronal activity to this afferent-mediated dendritic development was tested by chronic application of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin for 20 days in vitro. Tracing with biocytin showed that the formation of the entorhinohippocampal pathway was unaffected by the blockade of neuronal activity. The dendritic arbor of cultured granule cells and the number of dendritic spines did not differ between tetrodotoxin-treated slices and untreated controls. However, there was a significant increase in the relative number of filiform spines on granule cell dendrites in tetrodotoxin-treated co-cultures. Such filiform spines are a characteristic feature of immature neurons. These results suggest the cooperation of two mechanisms in the dendritic development of dentate granule cells: the specific afferent-mediated dendritic arborization and the activity-dependent maturation of spines.
