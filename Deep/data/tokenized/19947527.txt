The influence of enriched environment on the long-term posttetanic potentiation of hippocampal evoked potentials is discussed. The attention is focused on the effects of novelty, aging and the influence of enriched environment on synaptic processes in hippocampal neurons in transgenic animals. The evidence that the exposure to the enrichment of the environments prevents the negative effects of stress and other unfavorable factors on the long-term posttetanic potentiation, learning and memory is presented. The molecular-biochemical, neurochemical, neurophysiological and morphological mechanisms underling synaptic changes responsible for the transformation of hippocampal long-term potentiation under exposure to the enriched environment are considered.
