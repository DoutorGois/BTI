Not all experiences are memorized equally well. Especially, some types of stress are unavoidable in daily life and the stress experience can be memorized for life. Previous evidence has showed that synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) that may be the major cellular model of the mechanism underlying learning and memory, is influenced by behavioral stress. However, the effect of behavioral stress on age-related synaptic plasticity in vivo was primarily known. Here we found that the LTP induction in the hippocampal CA1 region of anesthetized rats obviously showed inverted-U shape related to ages (4, 10 and 74 weeks old rats), but low-frequency stimulation was unable to induce reliable long-term depression (LTD) in these animals. Furthermore, acute elevated platform (EP) stress enabled reliable LTD significantly and completely blocked LTP induction at these ages. Importantly, LTD after exposure to acute EP stress showed similar magnitude over these ages. The present results that stress enables LTD but impairs LTP induction at these three ages strengthen a view that stress experience-dependent LTD (SLTD) may underlie stress form of aberrant memories.
