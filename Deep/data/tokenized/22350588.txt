Sepsis is characterized by systemic biochemical alterations including the central nervous system in the early times and cognitive impairment at later times after sepsis induction in the animal model. Recent studies have shown that, besides its hematological activity, erythropoietin (EPO) has cytoprotective effects on various cells and tissues. In order to corroborate elucidating the effects of alternative drugs for sepsis treatment, we evaluated the effects of both acute and chronic EPO treatment on oxidative stress and energetic metabolism in the hippocampus, and cognitive impairment, respectively, after sepsis induction by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). To this aim, male Wistar rats underwent CLP with "basic support" or sham operation. In the acute treatment, EPO was administered once immediately after CLP induction. The rats were then killed after 6 and 24 h, and the hippocampus was removed for analysis of oxidative stress and energetic metabolism, respectively. Regarding the chronic treatment, EPO was administered once daily until the 4th day after induction. Aversive memory was tested on the 10th day after surgery. It was observed that the acute use of EPO (a single dose) alters the oxidative parameters and energetic metabolism. Chronic use (4 days) reversed cognitive impairment in the sepsis animal model. Mortality rates were attenuated only during chronic treatment.
