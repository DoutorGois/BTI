The present study evaluated the effect of diphenyl ditelluride [(PhTe)(2)] exposure to mothers on the cerebral oxidative status of their offspring. The dams received (PhTe)(2) or canola oil via subcutaneous injection once daily during the first 14 days of lactational period. At post natal day 28, biochemical parameters of oxidative stress were evaluated in cerebral structures-cortex, hippocampus and striatum-of young rats. Exposure to (PhTe)(2) increased lipid peroxidation levels and inhibited delta-ALA-D, catalase and SOD activities in hippocampus and striatum of young rats. (PhTe)(2) induced changes in the levels of non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses in cortex and striatum of young rats. The exposure to (PhTe)(2), via maternal milk, caused oxidative stress in cerebral structures of young rats. Thus, the possible role of disrupted prooxidant/antioxidant balance in (PhTe)(2) toxicity was demonstrated. These results highlighted a possible molecular mechanism involved in toxicity caused by (PhTe)(2).
