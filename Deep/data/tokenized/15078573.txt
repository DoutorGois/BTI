In addition to the well-established functional description of the glycine receptor (GlyR) in the spinal cord, GlyR expression has recently been found in higher brain regions, such as the striatum or hippocampus. In this study we have investigated the electrophysiological response of glycine in the rat entorhinal cortex slice. In all recorded cells we found significant current responses to glycine with an EC(50) value of about 100 micro m. Most importantly, we detected a cross-inhibition of glycine responses by GABA but not vice versa. These findings are in line with recent published data of cross-talks between GABA(A)R and GlyR but indicate a novel type of cross-inhibition of these receptors in the entorhinal cortex.
