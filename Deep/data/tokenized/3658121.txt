Chronic administration of theophylline (50 mg/kg twice daily for 14 consecutive days) significantly increased the specific binding of [3H]CHA in membranes of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of the rat, but not in membranes derived from the hippocampus or diencephalon. To characterize further the upregulation of A1 = adenosine receptors induced by theophylline, saturation analysis with [3H]CHA was performed in membranes of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. In both saline- and theophylline-treated cortical membranes the binding isotherms for [3H]CHA could be resolved into receptor affinity states having respectively high (KH) and low (KL) affinity for [3H]CHA. The high and low affinity dissociation constants obtained from theophylline-exposed membranes of the cerebral cortex were 1.14 nM and 25.2 nM and did not differ significantly from the corresponding values in saline-treated animals. Chronic exposure to theophylline did, however, produce significant increases in the densities of both the high and low affinity forms of A1-adenosine receptors in the cerebral cortex. Qualitatively and quantitatively similar results were observed in cerebellar membranes. These results suggest that chronic exposure to theophylline increases the density of A1-receptor in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum with no concomitant changes in the ability of [3H]CHA to distinguish separate agonist affinity states of the receptor. The physiological significance of theophylline-induced upregulation was assessed by determining seizure thresholds for convulsants in rats treated chronically with saline or theophylline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
