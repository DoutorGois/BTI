The Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) are Ca(2+)/calmodulin-binding proteins that are very abundant in the central nervous system. In the mammalian brain, CaMKII is composed by the association of several similar subunits at different ratios produced by four different genes. CaN is composed of two different subunits produced by two genes. We selected the most abundant subunits of each enzyme in the rodent brain, CaMKII alpha and CaN A, and compared their pattern of expression in the mouse brain by using in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. We found that CaMKII and CaN were mainly expressed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum and that low levels of expression were observed in midbrain and brainstem. CaN was also expressed in cerebellum. In the cell, the kinase and the phosphatase were detected in the perikarya, the neuronal processes, and the nucleus. The present study shows that all the regions of the mouse brain in which CaMKII is expressed also show CaN expression. This fact is consistent with the presence of common substrates for both enzymes or with a regulatory action of one versus the other. The lack of correspondence in the cerebellum could be explained by the fact that the major subunit of the kinase in this brain region is CaMKII beta.
