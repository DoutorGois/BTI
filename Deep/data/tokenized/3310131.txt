There is a wealth of information available regarding the complex synaptic pharmacology of the mammalian hippocampus. It is clear that many neurotransmitters are present in the hippocampus. Fig. 3 is an attempt to summarize in a schematic manner some of the synaptic connections of this structure and the neurotransmitters involved. The pyramidal cell and its inputs are shown and how various neurotransmitters modify its action in an excitatory (+) and inhibitory (-) manner. The hippocampus is an excellent model system for studying not only normal brain physiology, but also pathologic processes such as seizures, aging, etc. In view of the important role of the hippocampus in learning and memory and other brain functions, it is essential that the detailed synaptic mechanisms of the hippocampus be thoroughly understood. The present review is an attempt to integrate our knowledge of this structure into a rational basis for understanding how it functions and how it can be modified by pharmacological agents.
