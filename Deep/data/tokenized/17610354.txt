Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in the assessment of the severity and progression of neurotrauma. We evaluated temporal and regional changes after mild fluid percussion (FPI) and controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury using T2-weighted-imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) MRI over 7 days. Region of interest analysis of brain areas distant to the injury site (such as the hippocampus, retrosplenial and piriform cortices, and the thalamus) was undertaken. In the hippocampus of CCI animals, we found a slow increase (51%) in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) over 72 h, which returned to control values. The hippocampal T2 values in the CCI animals were elevated by 18% over the 7-day time course compared to control, indicative of edema formation. Histological analysis supported the lack of overt cellular loss in most brain regions after mild CCI injury. FPI animals showed a generalized decrease in hippocampal ADC values over the first 72 h, which then returned to sham levels, with decreased T2 values over the same period, which remained depressed at 7 days. Histological assessment of FPI animals revealed numerous shrunken cells in the hippocampus and thalamus, but other regions showed little damage. Increased immunohistochemical staining for microglia and astroglia at 7 days post-injury was greater in FPI animals within the affected brain regions. In summary, traumatic brain injury is less severe in mild CCI than FPI, based on the temporal events assessed with MRI.
