We measured the levels of glutamine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid and GABA in cortex and hippocampus of mice acutely treated with i.p. human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) or human recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Administration of IL-2 (5.0 micrograms kg-1) induced a slight but statistically significant increase in glutamine concentrations in both brain areas, while similar administration of IL-1 beta (20 micrograms kg-1) significantly reduced the hippocampal levels of glutamine, glutamic acid and GABA. Our data suggest that brain amino acid pathways are involved in the central modifications induced by IL-1 beta.
