BACKGROUND: Phytol (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadec-2-en-1-ol; PHY), the alcoholic diterpenoid is particularly interesting due to its diverse activities found in literature. This study evaluated in vitro and in vivo antioxidant capacity of PHY. METHODS: We conducted DPPH* (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS*+ (2,2&amp;#039;-azino-bis(3- ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) radical scavenging tests as in vitro, while Saccharomyces cerevisiae test as in vivo. For in vitro tests, trolox and for in vivo test hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were taken as standard and stressor, respectively. Additionally, we measured the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LP) and nitrite (NO2 -) contents in mouse hippocampus taking 0.05% Tween 80 dissolved in 0.9% saline (0.25 ml) and ascorbic acid (250 mg/kg; AA) as vehicle and standard, respectively. PHY was administered at doses 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg. In the latter case, all the treatments were administered via intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. RESULTS: PHY at 7.2 mug/ml exhibited 59.89 +/- 0.73% and 62.79 +/- 1.99% scavenging capacity of DPPH* and ABTS*+, respectively. In S. cerevisiae strains, PHY showed prominent protective effects. Moreover, in Swiss mouse hippocampus; PHY reduced the LP and NO2 - contents, while increased in GSH, SOD and CAT activities. CONCLUSION: PHY exerted antioxidant potential in our current non- and preclinical test systems and can be a good candidate for the development of treatments of oxidative stress mediated diseases.
