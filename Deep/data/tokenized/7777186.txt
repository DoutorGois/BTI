Transient forebrain ischemia in rodents caused internucleosomal DNA fragmentation that appeared in the striatum 24 h after reperfusion, and in the hippocampus 72 h after reperfusion. Gel electrophoresis and an in situ technique to label 3' termini of endonuclease generated DNA fragments demonstrated similar temporal patterns. These data show that endonuclease activation accompanies the demise of selectively vulnerable neurons following transient forebrain ischemia.
