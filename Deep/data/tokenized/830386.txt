Pieces of the immature hippocampal formation were transplanted to the anterior chamber of adult rat eyes. The transplants survived, became vascularized from the host irides, and proliferated extensively in proportion to the age of the donor fetus. These transplants mature and develop an adult organization in oculo. This maturation proceeds unimpaired in the absence of gyrus dentatus or after superior cervical ganglionectomy.
