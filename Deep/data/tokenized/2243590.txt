The effect of intracranial microdialysis on brain glucose metabolism in control and kainic acid-treated rats was assessed by semi-quantitative [14C]2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. A dialysis fiber loop was implanted into the piriform cortex or a horizontal Vita fiber into the hippocampus, and 24 h later, fibers were perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution before and after injection of kainic acid (16 mg/kg, i.p.) [14C]2-Deoxyglucose was injected i.p. 3 h after the injection of kainic acid. Rats injected with kainic acid were initially lethargic and then proceeded through behavioral phases of staring, "wet-dog shakes", Straub tail, rearing, forepaw clonus, and, in some cases, tonic-clonic convulsions. Three hours after kainic acid, the fiber presence in the piriform cortex enhanced kainic acid-induced metabolic activity in areas adjacent to the fiber assembly, whereas the fiber in hippocampus attenuated kainic acid-induced metabolic activity in areas adjacent to the fiber assembly. The results indicate that intracranial microdialysis alters the already abnormal brain metabolism in a kainic acid-induced seizure state, but has no significant effect in the non-seizure control state.
