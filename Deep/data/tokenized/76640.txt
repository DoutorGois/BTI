The laminar staining of the rat hippocampal region with the Timm sulphide silver method is from studies on adult rats known to depend on the various fibersystems terminating in these laminae. In order to illustrate the development of these fibersystems the laminar differentiation of the Timm staining of fascia dentata, hippocampus and subiculum is presented for rats between 1 and 31 days old. Corresponding changes in cytoarchitectonics as revealed by thionin staining are briefly demonstrated. Even on the first postnatal day there are indications of the mature, laminar staining pattern, and between three and nine days all the laminae corresponding to the terminal fields of the major afferent and intrinsic systems appear. After 12 days only minor additions to the laminar pattern develop, but there are adjustments of absolute and relative dimensions of layers and fields, and also the staining densities of individual laminae change. These observations are in good correlation with the available information on both hippocampal neurogenesis and cytodifferentiation, and the few fiber tracing studies performed on the developing hippocampal region. Compared to the latter, which ideally marks only one system or one lamina per animal, the Timm method provides an excellent means for getting an overview of the general developmental situation at the different ages. Thus developmental gradients along septotemporal, medio-lateral and basal-apical axes are found; which should be heeded in future studies on hippocampal synaptogenesis. The observations are discussed in relation to current models for neuronal growth and formation of nervous connections.
