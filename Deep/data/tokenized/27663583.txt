The generation of new neurons during adulthood involves local precursor cell migration and terminal differentiation in the dentate gyrus. These events are influenced by the hippocampal microenvironment. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is relevant for hippocampal neuronal development and behavior. Interestingly, studies that have been performed in controlled in vitro systems that involve isolated precursor cells that were derived from the dentate gyrus (AHPCs) have shown that BDNF induces the activation of the TrkB receptor and, consequentially, might activate signaling pathways that favor survival and neuronal differentiation. Based on the fact that the cellular events of AHPCs that are induced by single factors can be studied in this controlled in vitro system, we investigated the ability of BDNF and the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC), as one of the TrkB-downstream activated signaling proteins, in the regulation of migration, here reflected by motility, of AHPCs. Precursor cells were cultured following a concentration-response curve (1-640 ng/ml) for 24 or 96 h. We found that BDNF favored cell survival without altering the viability under culture proliferative conditions of the AHPCs. Concomitantly, glial- and neuronal-differentiated precursor cells increased as a consequence of survival promoted by BDNF. Additionally, pharmacological approaches showed that BDNF (40 ng/ml)-induced migration of AHPCs was blocked with the compounds K252a and GF109203x, which prevent the activation of TrkB and PKC, respectively. The results indicate that in the in vitro migration of differentiated AHPCs it is involved the BDNF and TrkB cascade. Our results provide additional information about the mechanism by which BDNF impacts adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
