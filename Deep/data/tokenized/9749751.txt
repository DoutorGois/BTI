A growing body of evidence suggests that modulation of certain proteins of the exocytotic machinery is, in part, involved in the biochemical changes that underlie long-term synaptic plasticity. We have previously shown that the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at perforant path to dentate granule cell synapses in the rat hippocampus induces changes in the mRNA levels of syntaxin 1B and synapsin I, known to be involved in neurotransmitter release. Immunohistochemical staining suggested that concomitant changes in these proteins occurred at mossy fibre synapses, downstream of those synapses at which LTP was induced, leading us to postulate that such a mechanism might underlie a form of transsynaptic plasticity. Here we have used a specific mossy-fibre synaptosome preparation to quantify levels of proteins and measure, using a chemiluminescent glutamate assay, depolarization-induced glutamate release from these synaptosomes after induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus in vivo. We show that 5 h after the induction of LTP, there is an increase in the protein levels of syntaxin 1B and, although to a lesser extent, the synapsins I and II, associated with an increase in depolarization-induced release of glutamate within these terminals. Increases in both the protein levels and glutamate release were not observed when dentate gyrus LTP was blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist. From these results we propose a molecular mechanism for the propagation of synaptic plasticity through hippocampal circuits.
