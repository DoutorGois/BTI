1. The effects of 7-chlorokynurenic acid were studied against the epileptiform and neurotoxic effects due to the non-NMDA excitatory amino acid, kainic acid, in rat hippocampal slices. 2. Slice perfusion with 7-chlorokynurenic acid (100 microM), significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the duration of the CA1 epileptiform bursting due to 1 microM kainic acid. 3. Slice perfusion with 7-chlorokynurenic acid (100 microM) significantly (p < 0.05) increased the probability of recovery of the CA1 population spike after a neurotoxic concentration (12 microM) of kainic acid. 4. The results indicate that 7-chlorokynurenic acid affects, with a similar potency, epileptiform and neurotoxic effects due to kainic acid.
