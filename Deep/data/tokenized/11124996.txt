Behavioral studies indicate that the ability to acquire long-term memories is severely impaired during sleep. It is unclear, however, why the highly synchronous discharge of neurons during sleep should not be followed by the induction of enduring plastic changes. Here we show that the expression of phosphorylated CRE-binding protein, Arc, and BDNF, three genes whose induction is often associated with synaptic plasticity, is high during waking and low during sleep. We also show that the induction of these genes during waking depends on the activity of the noradrenergic system, which is high in waking and low in sleep. These molecular results complement behavioral evidence and provide a mechanism for the impairment of long-term memory acquisition during sleep.
