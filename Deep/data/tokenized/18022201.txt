In the present study we first investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of proline on glutamate uptake in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus slices of rats. The action of alpha-tocopherol and/or ascorbic acid on the effects elicited by administration of proline was also evaluated. For in vitro studies, proline (30.0 microM and 1.0 mM) was added to the incubation medium. For acute administration, 29-day-old rats received one subcutaneous injection of proline (18.2 micromol/g body weight) or saline (control) and were sacrificed 1 h later. Results showed that addition of proline in the assay (in vitro studies) reduces glutamate uptake in both cerebral structures. Administration of proline (in vivo studies) reduces glutamate uptake in the cerebral cortex, but not in the hippocampal slices of rats. In another set of experiments, 22-day-old rats were pretreated for one week with daily administration of alpha-tocopherol (40 mg/kg) or ascorbic acid (100 mg/kg) or with both vitamins. Twelve hours after the last vitamins injection, rats received a single injection of proline or saline and were killed 1 h later. Pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol and/or ascorbic acid did not prevent the effect of proline administration on glutamate uptake. alpha-Tocopherol plus ascorbic acid prevented the inhibitory effect of acute hyperprolinemia on Na(+),K(+) -ATPase activity in the cerebral cortex of 29-day-old rats. The data indicate that the effect of proline on reduction of glutamate uptake and Na(+),K(+) -ATPase activity may be, at least in part, involved in the brain dysfunction observed in hyperprolinemic patients.
