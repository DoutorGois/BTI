The four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method of global forebrain cerebral ischemia mimics the human clinical condition of cardiac arrest. It results in selective neuronal damage and is a useful experimental system to dissect underlying mechanisms behind ischemic phenomena such as the differential susceptibility of CA1 compared to the CA3 region of the hippocampus. It also provides a "proof-of-principle" system for testing out potential agents for neuroprotection.
