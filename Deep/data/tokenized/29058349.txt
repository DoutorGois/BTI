Shown in every neuroanatomy textbook, a key morphological feature is the bumpy ridges, which we refer to as hippocampal dentation, on the inferior aspect of the hippocampus. Like the folding of the cerebral cortex, hippocampal dentation allows for greater surface area in a confined space. However, examining numerous approaches to hippocampal segmentation and morphology analysis, virtually all published 3D renderings of the hippocampus show the inferior surface to be quite smooth or mildly irregular; we have rarely seen the characteristic bumpy structure on reconstructed 3D surfaces. The only exception is a 9.4T postmortem study (Yushkevich et al. [2009]: NeuroImage 44:385-398). An apparent question is, does this indicate that this specific morphological signature can only be captured using ultra high-resolution techniques? Or, is such information buried in the data we commonly acquire, awaiting a computation technique that can extract and render it clearly? In this study, we propose an automatic and robust super-resolution technique that captures the fine scale morphometric features of the hippocampus based on common 3T MR images. The method is validated on 9.4T ultra-high field images and then applied on 3T data sets. This method opens possibilities of future research on the hippocampus and other sub-cortical structural morphometry correlating the degree of dentation with a range of diseases including epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia.
