OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of inflammatory molecule CD40 in the pallium and hippocampus of rats after status epilepticus (SE). METHODS: The expression of CD40 in the pallium, the different areas of hippocampus and the different cells from the lithium-pilocarpine epileptic rats at different time points were examined by immunohistochemistry and double-immunofluorescent labeling. RESULTS: After SE, CD40 expression was obviously inhibited, especially in hippocampus. CD40 was mainly expressed in the activated microglia. CD40 positive cells reached a peak at the 3rd day and returned to a slightly higher level at the 7th day after SE compared with the level before SE. CONCLUSION: Elevation of CD40 expression in the activated microglia can promote inflammatory injury of rat's hippocampus, suggesting that CD40 induced-signal pathway is involved in inflammatory injury in the hippocampus after SE.
