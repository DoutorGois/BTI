Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the prominent imaging modality in the field of epilepsy. MRI plays a major role in describing and recognizing the malformations of cortical development and hippocampal sclerosis and has improved epilepsy patient care. MRI is also accurate in detecting the other major epilepsy etiologies (vascular malformations and cicatricial lesions). Presurgical MRI is relevant since it provides a high-resolution study of the brain.
