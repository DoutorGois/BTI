Neurotrophin receptors utilize specific adaptor proteins to activate signaling pathways involved in various neuronal functions, such as neurite outgrowth and cytoskeletal remodeling. The Ankyrin-Repeat Rich Membrane Spanning (ARMS)/kinase D-interacting substrate-220 kDa (Kidins220) serves as a unique downstream adaptor protein of Trk receptor tyrosine kinases. To gain insight into the role of ARMS/Kidins220, a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat dorsal root ganglion library was performed using the C-terminal region of ARMS/Kidins220 as bait. The screen identified a mammalian septin, Septin 5 (Sept5), as an interacting protein. Co-immunoprecipitation using lysates from transiently transfected HEK-293 cells revealed the specific interaction between ARMS/Kidins220 and Sept5. Endogenous ARMS/Kidins220 and Sept5 proteins were colocalized in primary hippocampal neurons and were also predominantly expressed at the plasma membrane and in the tips of growing neurites in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells. Mapping of Sept5 domains important for ARMS/Kidins220 binding revealed a highly conserved N-terminal region of Sept5. The direct interaction between ARMS/Kidins220 and Sept5 suggests a possible role of ARMS/Kidins220 as a functional link between neurotrophin receptors and septins to mediate neurotrophin-induced intracellular signaling events, such as neurite outgrowth and cytoskeletal remodeling.
