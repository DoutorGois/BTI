Memory formation and utilization is a complex process involving several brain structures in conjunction as the hippocampus, the amygdala and the adjacent cortical areas, usually defined as medial temporal lobe structures (MTL). The memory processes depend on the formation and modulation of synaptic connectivity affecting synaptic strength, synaptic plasticity and synaptic consolidation. The basic neurocognitive mechanisms of learning and memory are shortly recalled in the initial section of this paper. The effect of sex hormones (estrogens, androgens and progesterone) and of adrenocortical steroids on several aspects of memory processes are then analyzed on the basis of animal and human studies. A specific attention has been devoted to the different types of steroid receptors (membrane or nuclear) involved and on local metabolic transformations when required. The review is concluded by a short excursus on the steroid activated epigenetic mechanisms involved in memory formation.
