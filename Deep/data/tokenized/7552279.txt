Our previous results indicate that alpha-tocopherol induces a slowly developing long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) in hippocampal slices. In the present study on hippocampal slices obtained from rats fed with vitamin E-deficient diet for 3 months, a tetanic stimulation of the stratum radiatum or applied alpha-tocopherol phosphate failed to induce LTP of CA1 neuronal EPSPs. However, LTP could be induced in rats fed on a matching control diet. These results indicate that vitamin E-deficiency leads to an impairment in LTP induction.
