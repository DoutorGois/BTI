A reliable method for visualization of mannose-containing glycoproteins in electrophoretically (SDS-PAGE) separated Tris-soluble, Triton-soluble and Triton-resistant fractions obtained from rat hippocampus, brain region supposed to play an essential role in learning and memory processes, was elaborated. The method is based on the Concanavalin A-horseradish peroxidase reaction applied successfully for the purpose of light and electron microscopic visualization of cellular carbohydrate components.
