Wide innervation of cholinergic projections throughout the cortex implies that acetylcholine (ACh) plays an essential role in information processing, but how it works is still enigmatic. Experimental as well as theoretical work in the olfactory cortex and hippocampus suggests that ACh, via the muscarinic receptors, serves to shift the dynamics of the cortical networks into a state where afferent influence predominates over intracortical influence. Recent experiments in the visual and somatosensory cortex suggested that this hypothesis could be extended to neocortex. In addition, participation of the nicotinic receptors in regulating the synaptic response in the somatosensory cortex further substantiates this hypothesis. This hypothesis, derived mainly from in vitro work, also seemed to account for results from in vivo experiments without any obvious inconsistencies.
