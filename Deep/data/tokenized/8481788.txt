We examined the effects of treatment with basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) on hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage following 3 min of forebrain ischemia in the gerbil. Continuous infusion of b-FGF (24 or 240 ng/day over 4 days) using an implanted osmotic minipump into the lateral ventricle prevented CA1 neuronal damage in a dose-dependent manner.
