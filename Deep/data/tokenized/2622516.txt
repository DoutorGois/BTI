The efficiency of neuronal grafts is correlated with the differentiation of the grafted cells and the connections they establish with the host tissue. The prolonged survival of a chromaffin cell line (PC12) transplanted into an immunodepressed rat brain shows that neuronal differentiation is correlated with the amount of nerve growth factor (N.G.F.) present in the grafted structure. This result is in agreement with in vitro studies. The characterization of other factors that influence the differentiation of PC12 cells in culture could lead to an increase in the efficiency of intracerebral grafts of adrenal medulla cells in Parkinson's disease.
