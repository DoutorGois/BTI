Twelve split-brain rhesus monkeys were tested for differences in the abilities of their two cerebral hemispheres to learn discriminations based on the comparison of sequentially-presented visual stimuli. Overall there was no generalized advantage for either the left or right hemisphere. There was, however, a significant correlation between each monkey's handedness and the hemisphere that learned more readily; the more proficient hemisphere tended to be contralateral to the preoperatively preferred hand. This result raises the possibility that handedness in monkeys may be more closely related to cognitive processing than is usually believed.
