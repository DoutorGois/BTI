The water maze task can be used to assess sensory motor and cognitive function in rodents. When properly employed, this task can behaviorally assess acquisition of a spatial search strategy, as well as working and reference memory. The following section uses research on age-related, cognitive decline to illustrate the methods employed and highlight areas that can, if not properly controlled, confound a study.
