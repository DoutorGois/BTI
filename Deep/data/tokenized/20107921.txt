To elucidate compositional changes of the limbic system with aging, the authors investigated age-related changes of elements in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and fornix and the relationships among elements by direct chemical analysis. After ordinary dissections at Nara Medical University were finished, the hippocampi, dentate gyri, and fornices were resected from identical cerebra of the subjects which consisted of 23 men and 23 women, ranging in age from 70 to 101 years. After ashing with nitric acid and perchloric acid, element contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. The average contents of P, Zn, and Na were significantly less in both the hippocampi and dentate gyri compared with the fornices. It was found that the Ca and Mg contents increased significantly in the hippocampus with aging; the P content increased significantly in the dentate gyrus with aging, whereas the Na content decreased in the dentate gyrus with aging; and the Mg content increased significantly in the fornix with aging. Regarding the relationships among elements, a significant direct correlation between Ca and Fe contents and an extremely significant inverse correlation between P and Zn contents were found in both the hippocampi and dentate gyri. In addition, a significant direct correlation between P and Mg contents was found in both the hippocampi and fornices. Pearson's correlation was used to examine whether there were elements with significant correlation among the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, fornix, and mammillary body. Significant correlations were found in five elements of Ca, P, Mg, Zn, and Fe except for S and Na among the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and mammillary body with one exception. Regarding the fornix, significant correlations were found in two elements of P and Fe between the fornix and hippocampus, dentate gyrus, or mammillary body.
