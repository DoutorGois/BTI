Several types of voltage-dependent calcium channels appear to occur in neurons, although coupling of the particular subtype of calcium channels to the release of neurotransmitter has not been clearly understood. We have examined the effects of subtype-specific inhibitors of the calcium channels on depolarization-induced release of endogenous neurotransmitters from brain slices. High potassium-induced release of glutamate and aspartate from hippocampal and striatal slices was almost completely inhibited by a P-type channel blocker, omega-agatoxin IVA. omega-Agatoxin IVA also completely inhibited the release of serotonin from the hippocampal slices with almost the same potency as in the case of glutamate, whereas the potency in blocking the release of serotonin and dopamine from striatal slices was lower than that from the hippocampal slices. Another calcium channel blocker, omega-agatoxin TK, that was recently found to block P-type channels with very similar selectivity and potency to omega-agatoxin IVA, also inhibited the release of amino acid transmitters and monoamines, though its potency was lower than that of omega-agatoxin IVA. An N-type channel blocker, omega-conotoxin GVIA, partially inhibited the neurotransmitter release, but an L-type channel blocker, nifedipine was ineffective. We propose that the activation of P-type calcium channels makes a major contribution to depolarization-elicited neurotransmitter release in the CNS and that multiple P-type channels sensitive to omega-agatoxin IVA and omega-agatoxin TK modulate the neurotransmitter release.
