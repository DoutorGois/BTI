BACKGROUND: The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a complex physical and functional barrier protecting the central nervous system from physical and chemical insults. Nevertheless, it also constitutes a barrier against therapeutics for treating neurological disorders. In this context, nanomaterial-based therapy provides a potential alternative for overcoming this problem. Graphene family has attracted significant interest in nanomedicine because their unique physicochemical properties make them amenable to applications in drug/gene delivery and neural interface. RESULTS: In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) systemically-injected was found mainly located in the thalamus and hippocampus of rats. The entry of rGO involved a transitory decrease in the BBB paracellular tightness, as demonstrated at anatomical (Evans blue dye infusion), subcellular (transmission electron microscopy) and molecular (junctional protein expression) levels. Additionally, we examined the usefulness of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) as a new imaging method for detecting the temporal distribution of nanomaterials throughout the brain. CONCLUSIONS: rGO was able to be detected and monitored in the brain over time provided by a novel application for MALDI-MSI and could be a useful tool for treating a variety of brain disorders that are normally unresponsive to conventional treatment because of BBB impermeability.
