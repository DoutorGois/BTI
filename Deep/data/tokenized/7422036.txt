The convergence of corticofugal impulses in reticular and grisea pontis nuclei evoked by stimulation of the neocortex frontobasal regions (proreal, posterior orbital, basal temporal) as well as of the dorsal hippocampus was studied in cats narcotized by a mixture of nembutale and chloralose. Three foci of corticofugal impulse convergence were determined in the structures of pons varolii: one in the reticular formation and two in grisea pontis nuclei -- in their medial and lateral regions. Neurons with excitatory reactions are shown to dominate in the pons varolii reticular formation and those with inhibitory and mixed reactions -- in the grisea pontis. The integrative function of pons varolii nuclei in the functional connection of frontobasal zones of neocortex and hippocampus is discussed.
