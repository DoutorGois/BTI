In the immune system, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules mediate both the innate and adaptive immune responses in vertebrates. There has been a dogma that the central nervous system (CNS) is immune privileged and healthy neurons do not express MHC class I molecules. However, recent studies have indicated that the expression and non-immunobiologic roles of MHC class I in mammalian CNS. But data referring to humans are scarce. In this study we report the expression and cellular localization of MHC class I in the human fetal, early postnatal and adult hippocampal formation. The expression of MHC class I was very low in the hippocampus at 20 (gestational weeks) GW and slowly increased at 27-33 GW. The gradually increased expression in the somata of some granular cells in dentate gyrus (DG) was observed at 30-33 GW. Whereas, a rapid increase in MHC class I molecules expression was found in the subiculum and it reached high levels at 31-33 GW and maintained at postnatal 55 days. No expression of MHC class I was found in hippocampal formation in adult. MHC class I heavy chain and beta2 microglobulin (beta2M) showed similar expression in some cells of the hippocampal formation at 30-33 GW. Moreover, MHC class I molecules were mainly expressed in neurons and most MHC class I-expressing neurons were glutamatergic. The temporal and spatial patterns of MHC class I expression appeared to follow gradients of pyramidal neurons maturation in the subiculum at prenatal stages and suggested that MHC class I molecules are likely to regulate neuron maturation.
