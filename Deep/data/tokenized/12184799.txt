The functions, actions, and regulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are beginning to be unraveled. Mice were fed diets rich in either arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, or both. Liver and hippocampus tissue were then analyzed through a combined gene expression-, lipid-, and behavioral- profiling strategy. Novel hippocampal PUFA-molecular targets suggest that PUFA transcriptionally regulated genes with roles in appetite and learning.
