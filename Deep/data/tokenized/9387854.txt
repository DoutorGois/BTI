It has previously been observed that adrenalectomy (ADX) increases the amplitude of transient Ca currents in CA1 hippocampal neurons. In the present study, the effect of ADX on cellular properties of CA1 neurons was investigated under conditions that challenge the CA1 network, i.e. in fully kindled rats, 5-6 weeks after the last kindling session. At this time, adrenally intact kindled rats showed, in comparison to non-kindled controls, a reduced population spike amplitude evoked in the CA1 area by Schaffer/commissural fiber stimulation, an increased amplitude of low-threshold, transient Ca currents and a decrease of the high-threshold, sustained Ca currents. As observed before, ADX in non-kindled rats increased the amplitude of transient Ca currents while sustained Ca currents were not affected. In kindled rats, ADX did not increase the transient Ca current amplitude beyond the level reached by kindling alone. The kindling-induced reduction of the sustained Ca current was partly normalized after ADX. Field responses of kindled rats were not affected by ADX. These data support the view that lack of adrenal hormones does not exacerbate but, to some extent, normalizes the kindling-induced changes in cellular properties and network function of the CA1 area. The hormonal effects on kindling may be reciprocal in nature, since kindling, in turn, was found to affect the stress response and the corticosteroid receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus.
