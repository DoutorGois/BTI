Excitotoxic activation of glutamate receptors is thought to be a key event for the molecular pathogenesis of postischemic delayed neuronal death of CA-1 neurons in the gerbil hippocampus. Glutamate receptor stimulation also causes induction of transcription factors that belong to the class of immediate early genes. We examined the expression of six different immediate early genes in the gerbil hippocampus after transient global ischemia. Comparative analysis of c-fos and Krox-24 expression was carried out in the same animals at the transcriptional and translational level by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Postischemic synthesis of four additional immediate early gene (IEG)-encoded proteins (FOS-B, c-JUN, JUN-B, and JUN-D) was investigated by immunocytochemistry at recirculation intervals between 1 and 48 h. After 5 min of ischemia, transcription of c-fos and Krox-24 mRNA was induced in all hippocampal subpopulations with peak expression at 1 h after recirculation. In vulnerable CA-1 neurons, increased transcription of c-fos and Krox-24 was not followed by translation into protein. Induction of immediate early gene-encoded proteins was restricted to neuronal populations less vulnerable to brief ischemia and identified neurons that are targets of glutamate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity but that are destined to survive. Our data indicate an asynchronous synthesis and persistence of individual IEG-encoded proteins in these neurons. The staggered induction implies that combinatorial changes of transcription factors allow a differential postischemic regulation of target gene expression both spatially and over time.
