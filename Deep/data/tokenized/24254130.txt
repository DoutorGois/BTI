Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with increased brain levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which readily self-aggregate into fibrils and oligomers that have particularly deleterious properties toward synapses of excitatory glutamatergic neurons. Here, we examined the neuroprotective effects of 1-methyl-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydroisoquinoline (1MeTIQ) against Abeta-induced loss of synaptic proteins in cultured primary hippocampal neurons. Exposure of mature primary hippocampal neurons to 10 muM synthetic Abeta1-40 over 72 h resulted in ~60 % reduction in the surface expression of NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), PSD-95, and synaptophysin, without causing neuronal death. Concomitant treatment with 500 muM of 1MeTIQ, a low-affinity NMDAR antagonist significantly ameliorated the loss of synaptic protein markers. The neuroprotective properties of 1MeTIQ were compared with those of MK-801, which at 0.5 muM concentration also prevented Abeta1-40-induced loss of synaptic proteins in primary neuronal cultures. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence demonstrating effectiveness of 1MeTIQ in reducing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in primary neuronal culture system. As oxidative stress contributes importantly to neurodegeneration in AD, 1MeTIQ may provide a dual neuroproctective effect in AD both as a NMDARs antagonist and ROS formation inhibitor. 1MeTIQ occurs endogenously at low concentrations in the brain and its synthetic form readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier after the systemic administration. Our results highlight a possibility of the application of 1MeTIQ as a neuroprotective agent in AD-related neurodegeneration.
