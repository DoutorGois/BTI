The effects of edible mushroom Mycoleptodonoides aitchisonii on the synthesis of nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotransmitter metabolism in rat brain were examined in Wistar strain rats fed a controlled diet for 14 days. Then each brain was dissected to detect the levels of neurotransmitters and NGF in various regions. Dopamine concentration in the cerebral cortex was 1.5-fold significantly increased in the M. aitchisonii feeding group than the control group. However, NGF concentration of the M. aitchisonii feeding was significantly low. NGF concentration in this remaining area of brain from where the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, hypothalamus and amygdala were removed was significantly higher in the M. aitchisonii feeding. At the same time, in the striatum, the dopamine metabolite DOPAC was significantly increased in the M. aitchisonii feeding. Thereafter, we measured dopamine release from striatal slices using aqueous extract of M. aitchisonii, there was an enhancing effect on dopamine release. These results suggested that M. aitchisonii has enhancing effect on the synthesis of NGF and catecholamine metabolites in the rat brain.
