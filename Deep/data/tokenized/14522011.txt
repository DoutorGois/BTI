Sleep deprivation exerts antidepressant effects after only one night of deprivation, demonstrating that a rapid antidepressant response is possible. In this report we tested the hypothesis that total sleep deprivation induces an increase in extracellular serotonin (5-HT) levels in the hippocampus, a structure that has been proposed repeatedly to play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. Sleep deprivation was performed using the disk-over-water method. Extracellular levels of 5-HT were determined in 3 h periods with microdialysis and measured by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection. Sleep deprivation induced an increase in 5-HT levels during the sleep deprivation day. During an additional sleep recovery day, 5-HT remained elevated even though rats displayed normal amounts of sleep. Stimulus control rats, which had been allowed to sleep, did not experience a significant increased in 5-HT levels, though they were exposed to a stressful situation similar to slee-deprived rats. These results are consistent with a role of 5-HT in the antidepressant effects of sleep deprivation.
