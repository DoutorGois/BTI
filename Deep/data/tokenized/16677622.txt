Prolonged over-exposure of rats to corticosterone attenuates 5-HT(1A)-receptor-mediated responses in hippocampal CA1 cells through an unknown mechanism, not involving downregulation of 5-HT(1A) receptor expression. We here tested if corticosterone changes 5-HT(1A) receptor function indirectly, by altering hippocampal mRNA expression of NCAM, SGK1, or RGS4, which all modulate 5-HT(1A) receptor function. We found that the expression of none of these candidates was affected by corticosterone treatment.
