In addition to the occurrence of numerous neurofibrillary tangles and Abeta plaques, neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity are markedly altered in Alzheimer disease (AD). Although the most popular therapeutic approach has been to inhibit neurodegeneration, another is to promote neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity by utilizing the regenerative capacity of the brain. Here we show that, in a transgenic mouse model of AD, 3xTg-AD mice, there was a marked deficit in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, which occurred before the formation of any neurofibrillary tangles or Abeta plaques and was associated with cognitive impairment. Furthermore, peripheral administration of Peptide 6, an 11-mer, which makes an active region of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF, amino acid residues 146-156), restored cognition by enhancing neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity in these mice. Although this treatment had no detectable effect on Abeta and tau pathologies in 9-month animals, it enhanced neurogenesis in dentate gyrus, reduced ectopic birth in the granular cell layer, and increased neuronal plasticity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. These findings, for the first time, demonstrate the possibility of therapeutic treatment of AD and related disorders by peripheral administration of a peptide corresponding to a biologically active region of CNTF.
