The purpose of this investigation was to examine the issue of reorganization of verbal memory function following early insult to the left mesial temporal region. It was hypothesized that reorganization of memory function was most likely to occur in those patients with an early age of seizure onset who have a more limited degree of extra-hippocampal neuropathology. Fifty-four patients with epilepsy of unequivocal left temporal lobe origin were classified into four groups on the basis of the presence/absence of hippocampal sclerosis and degree of postoperative seizure relief. Measures of verbal learning and memory as well as nonmemory measures were administered both before and 6 to 8 months after anterior temporal lobectomy. Findings were consistent with the reorganization proposal. The clinical and theoretical significance of the findings are discussed.
