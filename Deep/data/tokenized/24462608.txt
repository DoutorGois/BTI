We have previously shown expression of the protein doublecortin (DCX) in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and vestibulocerebellum of the adult rat. We also saw DCX-immunoreactive elements with the appearance of neuroblasts around the fourth ventricle. Expression of DCX is seen in newborn and migrating neurons and hence considered a correlate of neurogenesis. There were two interpretations of the expression of DCX in UBCs. One possibility is that there might be adult neurogenesis of this cell population. Adult neurogenesis is now well-established, but only for the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. The other possibility is that there is prolonged expression of DCX in adult UBCs that may signal a unique role in plasticity of these neurons. We tested the neurogenesis hypothesis by systemic injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog, followed by immunohistochemistry to examine the numbers and locations of dividing cells. We used several different injection paradigms, varying the dose of BrdU, the number of injections and the survival time to assess the possibility of neuronal birth and migration. We saw BrdU-labeled cells in the cerebellum and brainstem; cell division in these regions was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the protein Ki67. However, neither the numbers nor the distribution of labeled nuclei support the idea of adult neurogenesis and migration of UBCs. The function of DCX expression in UBC's in the adult remains to be understood.
