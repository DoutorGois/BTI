Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major neurological diseases of the elderly. The deposition of Abeta peptide, which can induce neuronal oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis, plays important roles in neuronal degeneration in AD. Currently, there are no effective drug treatment options for preventing or even slowing Alzheimer's disease. Bilobalide (BB) is one of the major active compounds extracted from Ginkgo biloba leaves. This study explored the neuroprotective effects of BB on Abeta25-35 intrahippocampal injection induced AD model in rats. Our results showed that BB (4, 8 mg/kg) significantly protected against learning and memory impairments induced by Abeta25-35 in Morris water maze. Besides, BB (4, 8 mg/kg) was able to attenuate the neuronal damage and apoptosis in frontal cortex and hippocampus CA1 in rats. In addition, the inhibition of TNF-alpha and Abeta1-40 expression is also involved in the action mechanisms of BB in this experimental model. This study provided an experimental basis for the clinical application of BB in AD therapy.
