In the human central nervous system, progesterone is rapidly metabolised to 5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone which subsequently is further reduced to allopregnanolone (AP). These conversions are catalysed by 5 alpha-reductase and 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD). Although different isoforms of both enzymes have been identified in the brain, our knowledge of their expression in the human brain remains limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mRNA expression of 5 alpha-reductase 1 as well as 3 alpha-HSD 1, 2, 3 and 20 alpha-HSD in brain tissue from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Specimens were derived from either the hippocampus or the temporal lobe cortex and from the tumor-free approach corridor tissue of patients with brain tumors. Quantification of different mRNAs was achieved by real time PCR. In addition, we provide data on simultaneous evaluation of serum AP concentrations. We could demonstrate that 3 alpha-HSD 1 was not expressed in the hippocampus and temporal lobe of patients with TLE. In the hippocampus and temporal lobe, the expression levels of 3 alpha-HSD 2 were about 20% of that in liver tissue, those of 3 alpha-HSD 3 about 7% and those of 20 alpha-HSD about 2%, respectively. In patients with TLE, expression of 3 alpha-HSD 2 was significantly higher in the hippocampus than in temporal lobe cortex tissue (P<0.006). AP concentrations did not correlate significantly with the mRNA expression levels of 5 alpha-reductase 1, 3 alpha-HSD 2 and 3 and 20 alpha-HSD in any of the patient groups under investigation. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates mRNA expression of 5 alpha-reductase 1 and 3 alpha-HSD 2 and 3 and 20 alpha-HSD in the hippocampus and temporal lobe of epileptic patients. These findings provide further molecular biological evidence for the formation and metabolism of neuroactive steroids in the human brain.
