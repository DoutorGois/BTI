A positive correlation has been shown between the speed of forced stepping on a conveyor belt and the amplitude and frequency of the concomitant hippocampal EEG. Significant modulation in the spectral properties of the dog's hippocampal EEG has been found in relation to 3 elementary motor acts: stepping, respiratory movements and a reflex movement in reaction to linear acceleration of the animal. The findings support the idea that within a certain experimental situation the hippocampal EEG reflects the intensity of motor behaviour in a non-specific but predictable way. However, some experimental results indicate that sensory inputs may modulate the hippocampal EEG as well.
