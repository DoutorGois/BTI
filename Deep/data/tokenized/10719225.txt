We have studied the cellular and intracellular localization of NELL2, a neural thrombospondin-1-like protein. NELL2 protein was detected as doublet bands of 140 and 90 kDa with the use of the specific antibodies raised against the C-terminal region of NELL2 and was recognized only in the brain but not in the peripheral tissues. Within the brain, NELL2 was abundantly present in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, found moderately in the olfactory bulb and hypothalamus, and at a low level in the thalamus, cerebellum, and medulla. Immunocytochemically, NELL2 was seen only in neurons but not in glial cells or in the white matter. NELL2-immunoreactive cells were distributed throughout the brain with the highest density in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. NELL2 was mainly found in the cell bodies of neurons and the immunoreactivity was often seen as dots in the perikarya. The distribution of NELL2 immunoreactivity did not completely correspond to that of any subtypes of protein kinase C (PKC). Under electron microscopy, NELL2 protein was associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), especially with rough ER. NELL2 immunoreactivity was found in the restricted parts of the ER and found commonly inside the ER. These results suggest that NELL2 protein is synthesized by neurons and may be secreted from the neurons involved in certain neuronal functions.
