The regional distribution and cellular localization of cathepsin D immunoreactivity was demonstrated at the light microscopic level in the CNS of rat and man by use of unlabelled immunoenzyme technique. A wide but uneven distribution was substantiated for the rat brain. Furthermore, we present evidence that antiserum produced against rat liver enzyme is capable of recognizing cathepsin D in human brain.
