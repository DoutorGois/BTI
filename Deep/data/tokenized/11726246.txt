The effects of bilateral hippocampal aspiration lesions on later acquisition of eyeblink conditioning were examined in developing Long-Evans rat pups. Lesions on postnatal day (PND) 10 were followed by evaluation of trace eyeblink conditioning (Experiment 1) and delay eyeblink conditioning (Experiment 2) on PND 25. Pairings of a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) and periocular shock unconditioned stimulus (US, 100 ms) were presented in one of three conditioning paradigms: trace (380 ms CS, 500 ms trace interval, 880 ms interstimulus interval [ISI]), standard delay (380 ms CS, 280 ms ISI), or long delay (980 ms CS, 880 ms ISI). The results of two experiments indicated that hippocampal lesions impaired trace eyeblink conditioning more than either type of delay conditioning. In light of our previous work on the ontogeny of trace, delay, and long-delay eyeblink conditioning (Ivkovich, Paczkowski, & Stanton, 2000) showing that trace and long-delay eyeblink conditioning had similar ontogenetic profiles, the current data suggest that during ontogeny hippocampal maturation may be more important for the short-term memory component than for the long-ISI component of trace eyeblink conditioning. The late development of conditioning over long ISIs may depend on a separate process such as protracted development of cerebellar cortex.
