In anesthetized rats, injections of a 0.5 mM glutamate solution into the locus coeruleus (LC) reversibly increased the amplitude of the population spike evoked in CA1 by stimulation of the Schaffer-commissural fiber tract. This effect was absent in N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP-4)-treated, noradrenaline (NA)-depleted animals. The excitatory postsynaptic potential recorded in the stratum radiatum was unaffected following the glutamate injections. Systemic administration of the NA-uptake inhibitor desipramine also produced an increase in population spike amplitude. The findings demonstrate that activation of LC neurons increases pyramidal cell excitability in vivo.
