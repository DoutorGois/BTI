Using both in vitro (hippocampal synaptosomes in superfusion) and in vivo (microdialysis) approaches we investigated whether and to what extent beta amyloid peptide 1-40 (Abeta 1-40) interferes with the cholinergic modulation of the release of glycine (GLY) in the rat hippocampus. The nicotine-evoked overflow of endogenous GLY in hippocampal synaptosomes in superfusion was significantly inhibited by Abeta 1-40 (10 nM) while increasing the concentration to 100 nM the inhibitory effect did not further increase. Both the Choline (Ch; alpha7 agonist; 1 mM) and the 5-Iodo-A-85380 dihydrochloride (5IA85380, alpha4beta2 agonist; 10 nM)-evoked GLY overflow were inhibited by Abeta 1-40 at 100 nM but not at 10 nM concentrations. The KCl evoked [(3)H]GLY and [(3)H]Acetylcholine (ACh) overflow were strongly inhibited in presence of oxotremorine; however this inhibitory muscarinic effect was not affected by Abeta 1-40. The effects of Abeta 1-40 on the administration of nicotine, veratridine, 5IA85380, and PHA543613 hydrochloride (PHA543613; a selective agonist of alpha7 subtypes) on hippocampal endogenous GLY release in vivo were also studied. Abeta 1-40 significantly reduced (at 10 muM but not at 1 muM) the nicotine-evoked in vivo release of GLY. Abeta 1-40 (at 10 muM but not at 1 muM) significantly inhibited the PHA543613 (1 mM)-elicited GLY overflow while was ineffective on the GLY overflow evoked by 5IA85380 (1 mM). Abeta 40-1 (10 muM) did not produce any inhibitory effect on nicotine-evoked GLY overflow both in the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results indicate that (a) the cholinergic modulation of the release of GLY occurs by the activation of both alpha7 and alpha4beta2 nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) as well as by the activation of inhibitory muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) and (b) Abeta 1-40 can modulate cholinergic evoked GLY release exclusively through the interaction with alpha7 and the alpha4beta2 nAChR nicotinic receptors but not through mAChR subtypes.
