In order to show changes in the local cerebral glucose utilization during an avoidance task, dry-autoradiography with [14C]deoxyglucose was employed in the present work. The following regions showed increased radioactivity following the avoidance task: nucleus ventralis thalami of the pars medialis and lateralis thalami, corpus striatum, nucleus periventricularis hypothalami, paraflocculus, stratum lacuno-moleculare, and nucleus lateralis septi. Among other regions, the stratum lacuno-moleculare of area CA1 and CA2 of the hippocampus showed increased activity apparently related to the memory formation.
