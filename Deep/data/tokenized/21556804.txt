RATIONALE: Heavy binge drinking is increasingly frequent among adolescents, while ethanol (EtOH) is often used in combination with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). OBJECTIVES: The long-lasting effects of intermittent exposure to EtOH and MDMA during adolescence on motor activity, anxiety, and social behavior were evaluated in adult mice. The concentration of brain monoamines in the striatum, cortex, and hippocampus was measured following the behavioral test. METHODS: Adolescent OF1 mice were exposed to ethanol (1.25 g/kg) on two consecutive days at 48-h intervals over a 14-day period (from PND 29 to 42). A total of eight injections of MDMA (10 or 20 mg/kg) were administered twice daily at 4-h intervals over two consecutive days, and this schedule was repeated 6 days later (PND 33, 34, 41, and 42). Behavioral tests and analysis of brain monoamines took place on PND 64 to 67. RESULTS: Exposure to MDMA during adolescence increased the anxiogenic response in the elevated plus maze, with adult mice spending less time in the open arms of the maze and exhibiting lower concentrations of DA in the striatum. A pattern of ethanol administration modeling binge drinking during adolescence enhanced these effects and undermined the hyperthermic response induced by MDMA. Passive avoidance was affected only when EtOH was administered alone. CONCLUSIONS: Juvenile administration of MDMA and alcohol was found to cause a decrease in monoamine levels in adulthood, as well as changes in social interaction behaviors, locomotor activity, increase measures of anxiety in the elevated plus maze (EPM), and decrease step-through latencies in passive avoidance test.
