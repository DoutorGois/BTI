Activity-dependent local translation in the dendrites of brain neurons plays an important role in the synapse-specific provision of proteins necessary for strengthening synaptic connections. In this study we carried out combined fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunocytochemistry (IC) and showed that more than half of the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) mRNA clusters overlapped with or were immediately adjacent to clusters of PSD-95, a postsynaptic marker, in the dendrites of cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Treatment of the neurons with KCl increased the density of the dendritic eEF1A mRNA clusters more than two-fold. FISH combined with IC revealed that the KCl treatment increased the density of eEF1A mRNA clusters that overlapped with or were immediately adjacent to PSD-95 clusters. These results indicate that KCl treatment increases both the density of eEF1A mRNA clusters and their synaptic association in dendrites of cultured neurons.
