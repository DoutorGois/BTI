Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-varepsilon4 is associated with a deleterious outcome after ischemic brain injury, which may involve abnormal regulation of mitochondrial function. We have assessed the mitochondrial proteomic response of APOE-varepsilon3 and APOE-varepsilon4 transgenic mice to transient global ischemic injury in the hippocampus. A genotype-dependent increase in ApoE levels in mitochondria was observed after ischemia, with APOE-varepsilon4 mice showing significantly greater increases than APOE-varepsilon3 mice. Quantitative analysis of the mitochondria-enriched fractions was performed using liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry coupled to label-free analysis. Of the 1,067 identified proteins, 274 were mitochondria associated. Mitochondrial protein expression was significantly different between genotypes under basal conditions as well as in response to global ischemia. A total of 12 mitochondrial proteins (including respiratory chain proteins NDUFA11, NDUFS3, NDUF5B, ATP5J, as well as ETFA, CYB5B, ATP6V1A, HSPA1B, OXR1, GLUL, IARS2, and PHYHIPL) were significantly altered with respect to genotype, global ischemia, or their interaction (P<0.01). A compelling interactome, created using proteins found to be significantly modulated by global ischemia (P<0.05), involved proteins that regulate energy production and oxidative stress. Thus, APOE genotype has a differential effect on the mitochondrial protein expression in the absence and presence of an injury, which may underlie the differing genotype susceptibility.
