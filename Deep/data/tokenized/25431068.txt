By focusing a laser with short pulses to a diffraction-limited spot, single nerve axons can be precisely targeted and injured. Subsequent repair can be analyzed using various imaging and biochemical techniques to understand the repair process. In this chapter, we will describe a robotic laser microscope system used to injure nerve axons while simultaneously observing repair using phase and fluorescence microscopy. We provide procedures for controlled laser targeting and an experimental approach for studying axonal repair in embryonic rat hippocampus neurons.
