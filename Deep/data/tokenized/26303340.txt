A great body of evidence points toward a functional interaction between metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors (mGluR5) and NMDA receptors (NMDAR) that enhances synaptic plasticity and cognition. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this interaction remains unclear. Here, we show that co-activation of mGluR5 and NMDAR in hippocampal slices synergistically leads to a robust phosphorylation of NR2B (Tyr1472), which is Src kinase dependent and is enabled by endogenous adenosine acting on A2A receptors. As it is well known, NR2B (Tyr1472) phosphorylation anchors NR2B-containing NMDARs to the surface of post-synaptic membranes, preventing their internalization. This is supported by our electrophysiological experiments showing that co-activation of mGluR5 and NMDARs robustly enhances NMDAR-dependent neuronal excitability recorded in CA1 hippocampal region, which temporally coincides with the robust increase in NR2B (Tyr1472) phosphorylation, depends on Src kinases and is also permitted by A2A receptors. Thus, we strongly suggest that NR2B (Tyr1472) phosphorylation constitutes, at least to some extent, the molecular mechanism underlying the mGluR5-mediated enhancement of NMDAR-dependent responses, which is modulated by A2A receptors. A better understanding of the molecular basis of mGluR5/NMDAR interaction would elucidate their role in synaptic plasticity processes as well as in pathological conditions. We propose the following molecular mechanism by which metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 (mGluR5) potentiate ionotropic Glutamate N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) responses in rat hippocampus. Co-activation of mGLUR5/NMDAR activates Src kinases, leading to NR2B(Tyr1472) phosphorylation, which anchors NR2B-containing NMDAR to the plasma membrane, thus inducing a robust increase in the NMDA-dependent excitability. Interestingly, adenosine A2A receptors license the mGluR5-induced NR2B(Tyr1472) phosphorylation.
