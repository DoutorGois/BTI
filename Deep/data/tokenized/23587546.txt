Kainic acid (KA) is an excitatory and neurotoxic substance. The role of alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (alpha-CGRP) in the regulation of KA-induced hippocampal neuronal cell death was investigated in the present study. The intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration with KA (0.07 mug) increased hippocampal alpha-CGRP mRNA level in ICR mice. The alpha-CGRP mRNA level began to increase at 1h, reached at maximal level at 6 and 12h, and returned to the control level by 24h after i.c.v. administration with KA. In addition, KA-induced hippocampal CA3 neuronal death in C57BL6 (wild type) group was more pronounced compared to KA-induced hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cell death in alpha-CGRP knock-out (KO) group. Furthermore, sumatriptan, a CGRP releasing inhibitor, significantly protected the pyramidal cell death in CA3 hippocampal region induced by KA administered i.c.v. in ICR mice. Our results suggest that alpha-CGRP may play an important role in the regulation of KA-induced pyramidal cell death in CA3 region of the hippocampus.
