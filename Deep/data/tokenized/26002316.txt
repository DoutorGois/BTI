JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), also known as JNK stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1), is a scaffold protein mainly involved in the regulation of the pro-apoptotic signaling cascade mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Overexpression of JIP3 in neurons in vitro has been reported to lead to accelerated activation of JNK and enhanced apoptosis response to cellular stress. However, the occurrence and the functional significance of stress-induced modulations of JIP3 levels in vivo remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the expression of JIP3 in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in a kainic acid (KA)-induced mouse model of epileptic seizures, and determined whether down-regulation of JIP3 can decrease susceptibility to seizures and neuron damage induced by KA. We found that JIP3 was markedly increased in TLE patients and a mouse model of epileptic seizures; mice underexpressing JIP3 through lentivirus bearing LV-Letm1-RNAi showed decreased susceptibility, delayed first seizure and decreased seizure duration response to the epileptogenic properties of KA. Subsequently, a decreased activation of JNK following seizure induction was observed in mice underexpressing JIP3, which also exhibited less neuronal apoptosis in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, as assessed three days after KA administration. We also found that mice underexpressing JIP3 exhibited a delayed pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling seizure process.
