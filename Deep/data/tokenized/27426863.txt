Although various molecules have been found to mediate the processes of memory acquisition and consolidation, the molecular mechanism to maintain memory still remains elusive. In recent years, a molecular pathway focusing on protein kinase Mzeta (PKMzeta) has become of interest to researchers because of its potential role in long-term memory maintenance. PKMzeta is an isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) and has a related structure that influences its function in maintaining memory. Considerable evidence has been gathered on PKMzeta activity, including loss of function studies using PKMzeta inhibitors, such as PKMzeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP), suggesting PKMzeta plays an important role in long-term memory maintenance. This review provides an overview of the role of PKMzeta in long-term memory and outlines the molecular structure of PKMzeta, the molecular mechanism of PKMzeta in long-term memory maintenance and future directions of PKMzeta research.
