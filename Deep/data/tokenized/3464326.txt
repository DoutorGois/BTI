Tumor-promoting phorbol esters specifically activate protein kinase C and mimic the effects of neurotransmitters in certain systems. Treatment of hippocampal slices with phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of protein kinase C activity from cytoplasm to membranes. Experiments with carbachol, norepinephrine, glutamate, KCl, and LiCl failed to demonstrate a similar translocation. Translocation more readily provides an index of protein kinase C involvement for phorbol esters than for other agents in hippocampus.
