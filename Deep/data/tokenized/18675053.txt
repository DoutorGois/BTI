Episodic memory is commonly defined as the kind of memory that renders possible conscious recollection of personal happenings and events from one's personal past. Although it is classically assumed that episodic memory is subserved by a distinct neurocognitive system including mediotemporal cortex and hippocampus, recent evidence also supports the idea of a close relationship between episodic memory and frontal cortex. This view assumes that the frontal cortex plays a critical supervisory role in empowering encoding and retrieval episodic memory operations. In recent years, this view had significantly influenced research in the field of normal memory aging. Indeed, different data have highlighted that age-related cognitive differences, most particularly age-related memory differences, might be explained by the decline of executive-frontal functioning that accompanies aging. In this article, we provide studies on aging and episodic memory that, in support of the executive hypothesis of aging episodic memory, have provided evidence that age-related differences in strategies implemented at encoding and retrieval in this type of memory are mediated by the executive functioning difficulties of older adults.
