Soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) oligomers are considered to putatively play a critical role in the early synapse loss and cognitive impairment observed in Alzheimer's disease. We previously demonstrated that Abeta oligomers activate cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), which specifically releases arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. We here observed that cPLA(2) gene inactivation prevented the alterations of cognitive abilities and the reduction of hippocampal synaptic markers levels noticed upon a single intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta oligomers in wild type mice. We further demonstrated that the Abeta oligomer-induced sphingomyelinase activation was suppressed and that phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) was preserved in neuronal cells isolated from cPLA(2)(-/-) mice. Interestingly, expression of the Abeta precursor protein (APP) was reduced in hippocampus homogenates and neuronal cells from cPLA(2)(-/-) mice, but the relationship with the resistance of these mice to the Abeta oligomer toxicity requires further investigation. These results therefore show that cPLA(2) plays a key role in the Abeta oligomer-associated neurodegeneration, and as such represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
