Immunoreactivity of neuronal and glial marker proteins of reactive astrocytes around the electrically damaged pyramidal layer and stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region and corpus callosum was chronologically studied in electrically lesioned rat brains. A monoclonal antibody against calbindin-D28 k (CD28-Ab) and a polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP-Ab) were used for immunostaining. Immunoreactivity of CD28 and GFAP in the reactive astrocytes was detected in brains 1-6 weeks post-lesion but not in non-lesioned brains. The number of immunohistochemically stained reactive astrocytes around the electrically damaged areas were counted and then compared with the number of those in the same areas of non-lesioned brains. The number of CD28- and GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes began to increase around the lesion from 1-3 weeks following lesion in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampal CA1 region and from 1-4 weeks following lesion in the stratum radiatum of the hippocampal CA1 region and corpus callosum. These immunoreactive astrocytes could be observed for 6 weeks (the maximum survival time studies) in all areas of the lesioned brains studied. The increase in the number of reactive astrocytes might have been induced by the stimulatory effects of neurotrophic factors, or growth factors, produced around the lesioned site. The constancy in the number of reactive astrocytes after 3 and 4 weeks in the lesioned areas may have been due to the termination of the initial phase of the repair process, i.e. space-filling. Reactive astrocytes which were stained by GFAP-Ab were separated into two groups, based on the presence of CD28, i.e. CD28-positive and CD28-negative reactive astrocytes. The presence of CD28 might confer certain functions via calcium-mediated mechanisms on CD28-positive astrocytes in addition to the constructive role mediated by GFAP.
