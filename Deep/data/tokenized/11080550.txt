The present study investigated the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in phencyclidine (PCP)-induced place aversion and preference in the place conditioning paradigm. PCP-induced place aversion in naive mice was dose-dependently attenuated by administration of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, during the conditioning. The NOS activity and dopamine (DA) turnover in the hippocampus in mice showing PCP-induced place aversion were decreased, such changes being restored by administration of L-NAME during the conditioning. On the other hand, PCP-induced place preference in mice pretreated with PCP for 28 days was not attenuated by administration of L-NAME during the conditioning. Although NOS activity was not changed, the DA turnover in the cerebral cortex was increased in mice showing PCP-induced place preference. In mice pretreated with L-NAME and PCP for 28 days before the place conditioning paradigm, PCP neither induced place preference, nor changed the NOS activity or DA turnover. These results suggest that NO is involved in the acquisition of PCP-induced aversive effects, and in the development of PCP-induced preferred effects. Further, the functional change of the DAergic neuronal system mediated by NO in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex may be necessary for the expression of aversive effects and development of preferred effects, respectively, induced by PCP.
