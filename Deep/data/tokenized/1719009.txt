We have examined the distribution and time course of the microglial reaction in the rat dorsal hippocampus after 25-min transient forebrain ischemia (four-vessel occlusion model). Microglial cells were visualized in brain sections using lectin staining with the Griffonia simplicifolia B4-isolectin following intervals of reperfusion ranging from 20 min to 4 weeks. Increased staining of microglial cells was detected in the dentate hilus and area CA1 as early as 20 min after reperfusion. These same regions demonstrated more intense microglial staining after 24 h. The strongest microglial reaction was observed 4-6 days after reperfusion when reactive microglia were abundant throughout all laminae of CA1 and the dentate hilus. Following longer reperfusion intervals, the microglial reaction became less intense; however, it remained above normal levels until the end of the fourth week. At all time points examined, microglial reactivity in the CA3 pyramidal and dentate granule cell layers was considerably lower than that observed in CA1 and dentate hilus. Our results are consistent with the known serial pathological changes associated with cerebral ischemia, but, in addition, show that the examination of the microglial reaction provides an extremely sensitive indicator of subtle and morphologically nonapparent neuronal damage during the early stages of injury.
