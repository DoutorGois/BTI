Morphological changes of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampus at different intervals following transient forebrain ischemia were examined to determine the nature of post-ischemic cell death in these regions. In the CA1 region, swelling of small dendrites occurred at approximately 24 h reperfusion. At approximately 48 h reperfusion, swelling was found in large dendrites of many CA1 neurons and the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were dilated. A small portion of neurons showed chromatin aggregation and nuclear indentation without swelling signs. At approximately 60 h reperfusion, swelling of somata was evident in many neurons. Large dense chromatin clumps with round or ovoid contour were found in other neurons. At 72 and 96 h after ischemia, many large vacuoles and glias with active phagocytosis were observed. At 7 days after ischemia, the tissue was compact and many glias were found in the region. Most of the CA3 neurons had normal appearance after ischemia. A total of 5-10% CA3 neurons exhibited shrinking nuclei and chromatin aggregation at approximately 24 h reperfusion. The number of these neurons decreased overtime and disappeared at 72 h after ischemia. These results demonstrate the co-existence of necrosis and apoptosis in the CA1 region after transient forebrain ischemia. Most CA3 neurons remained intact after ischemia while a small portion of them showed apoptotic cell death.
