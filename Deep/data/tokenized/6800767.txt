Continuing earlier investigation Z. EEG-EMG, 1976, 7, 151-156 the authors have studied the electrical activity of the cortex and subcortical regions elicited by stimulating mesencephalic reticular formation, after injection i.p. of Kryptopyrrole. The changes of activity was tape recorded and subjected to an off-line computer analysis with the method of Fast Fourier. Power spectral densities as well as auto and cross correlograms were calculated. The threshold for desynchronisation following stimulation shows a characteristic form due to the effect of Kryptopyrrole: after temporary decrease there is a marked increase. After stimulation the effect on subcortical structures in strikingly different from that of the cortex.
