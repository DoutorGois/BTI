Free-radical lipid oxidation was studied in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of KHA and KLA rats (Koltushi High and Low Avoidance) during the development of post-stress depression. After unavoidable emotional-pain exposure, changes in the free-radical oxidation of lipids were phasic in nature and had a clear structural specificity in the early phases. During the maximum development of depression, the most marked impairments to lipid peroxidation were seen in KHA rats in the striatum and hippocampus, while the greatest changes in KLA rats were seen in the striatum and hypothalamus. These data support the important role of the initial behavioral strategy in the pathogenetic mechanisms forming post-stress psychopathology.
