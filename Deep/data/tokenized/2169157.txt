In the visual and sensorimotor areas of the neocortex and in the hippocampus of alert nonimmobilized rabbits, in response to combinations of light flashes with electrocutaneous limb stimulation an increase was observed of synchronization in the activity of the near-by neurones by activation by inhibitory type (coincidence of the presence and absence of impulse activity). In response to flashes against the light background--conditioned inhibitor--in the visual cortex synchronization of neurones increased by inhibitory type, and in the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus changes of synchronization appeared, similar to the action of pain reinforcement but considerably weaker. The increase of synchronization by the activation type took place mainly in the neurones pairs with unidirected increase of impulses frequency and by the inhibitory one--with its decrease. Along with this, in a considerable part of neurones pairs both changes of synchronization appeared at the impulses frequency changes of different direction.
