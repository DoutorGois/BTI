Application of several well characterized group II mGlu receptor ligands was found to induce a long-lasting depression of synaptic transmission in the medial perforant path of the dentate gyrus. These ligands were N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), which is a dipeptide located in the brain and possibly functioning as a neurotransmitter, two agents widely used previously as mGluR antagonists, (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), and (S)-alpha-ethylglutamate (EGLU), and the well characterized group II mGluR agonist (2S,1R,2R,3R)-2-(2S,1'R,2'R,3'R)-2(2'3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glyci ne (DCG-IV). It is postulated that all these ligands induced the long-lasting depression by an agonist/partial agonist action at group II mGlu receptor. The long-lasting depression induced by the ligands showed mutual occlusion with low frequency stimulation-induced long-term depression, demonstrating common induction or maintenance mechanisms. The induction of the long-lasting depression by the mGlu receptor ligands are suggested to occur postsynaptically as the induction was not associated with a change in paired pulse depression of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).
