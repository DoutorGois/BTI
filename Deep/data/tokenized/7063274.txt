The maturation of fibrous astrocytes was studied in the archicortex (hippocampus) of rats subjected to early postnatal malnutrition. A decrease in the number of protoplasmic processes and end-feet in fibrous astrocytes from the cortical molecular layer was observed. In animals refed after weaning the number of protoplasmic processes returned to normal while that of end-feet remained unchanged. The diameter of the perikaryon was reduced. It is postulated that early malnutrition, induced immediately after birth, impairs differentiation of astroglia in the archicortex of the rat brain, probably as a response secondary to altered neuronal and capillary development.
