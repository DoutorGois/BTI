Transgenic (TG) mice deficient in glucocorticoid receptors (GR) were used in order to study the effects of a reduced GR function on adrenocorticotropin hormone and corticosterone plasma levels and on serotonin metabolism in different brain areas under basal resting conditions, after a 30-min restraint stress and 60 min after the end of the restraint stress. There was no difference in basal or stress-induced levels of either adrenocorticotropin hormone or corticosterone in control and TG mice, but the return of adrenocorticotropin hormone to basal values after the end of the stress was delayed in TG mice. Under basal conditions, the ratio 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine was decreased only in the hippocampus of TG mice compared to controls. In the brain stem, the ratio 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine increased compared to basal values after a 30-min restraint stress and values were still high 60 min after the end of the restraint stress in both control and TG mice. In the hippocampus, the ratio 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/5-hydroxytryptamine increased at the end of the stress and returned to basal levels 60 min later in control mice, whereas there was no change at the end of the stress but an increase 60 min later in TG mice. Finally there was no change in serotonin metabolism in the cortex, striatum or hypothalamus in either group or situation. Our results support the hypothesis of a tonic activation of serotonin turnover by corticosterone through GR in the mouse hippocampus. Moreover, stress-induced stimulation of serotonin metabolism in the brain stem and hippocampus appears to be delayed in TG mice compared to control mice. These results are particularly relevant for mood disorders such as depression where alterations of serotoninergic transmission might be secondary to an impairment of GR functions.
