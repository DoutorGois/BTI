Immunoproteasome has been associated to neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases as a marker and regulator of inflammatory mechanisms. Its expression in the brain may occur upon neuroinflammation in different cell types and affect a variety of homeostatic and inflammatory pathways including the oxidized protein clearance and the self-antigen presentation. In the present study we investigated the immunoproteasome expression in hippocampi and cortex of patients affected by different histopathological forms of pharmaco-resistent mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We identified a pathology-specific pattern of immunoproteasome expression, which could provide insight into the complex neuroinflammatory pathogenic components of this disease.
