Functional and morphological analysis of changes in white rat CNS was made throughout 4 months after 12 minute interruption of circulation. Within 3 months after clinical death and resuscitation the rats' neurological status was normal except some abnormalities in emotions and motives especially noticeable under stress. Moreover, neurons in the hippocampus and cerebellum were destroyed. A single intranasal 0.05 mg/kg dose of kyotorphin--a peptide isolated from the brain of winter-sleeping animals--given 30 min after beginning of resuscitation increased survival, accelerated restoration of neurological status, normalized emotional reactivity, orientation and search behavior, prevented death of neurons in the hippocamp and cerebellum.
