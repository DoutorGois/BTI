The behavioral and extracellular hippocampal norepinephrine responses to audiogenic stress were concomitantly characterized in freely moving rats using in vivo microdialysis. Noise stimulation produced a rapid, but short-lived increase in norepinephrine release from the hippocampus during the first 20 min of noise presentation that declined to baseline levels for the duration of the noise stimulation and following noise offset. In contrast, the behavioral response persisted throughout the duration of the noise stimulation. In a separate group of similarly treated animals, neuroendocrine indices of stress were monitored during exposure to noise. Consistent with the behavioral response, corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone remained elevated for the duration of noise presentation. These findings support a dissociation between the hippocampal norepinephrine response and the behavioral and neuroendocrine response patterns and suggest that other systems may be involved in the regulation of behavioral responsiveness to aversive stimuli.
