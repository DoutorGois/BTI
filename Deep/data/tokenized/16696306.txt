To investigate the effects of ischemia-reperfusion on the levels of nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase isoforms (nNOS and iNOS), rat organotypic hippocampus slice were cultured in vitro and subjected to ischemia by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 30 min and then placed in the normal culture condition. The ischemia-reperfusion produced a time-dependent increase in nitrite levels in the culture medium. Reverse transcriptional-polymerase chain reaction showed augmented levels of mRNA for both nNOS and iNOS when compared with control at 12 h and remained increase at 36 h after OGD (P < 0.05). The protein levels of both nitric oxide synthase isoforms increased significantly as determined by Western Blot. OGD also caused neurotoxicity in this model as revealed by the elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) efflux into the incubation solution. The results suggest that organotypic hippocampus slice is a useful model in studying ischemia-reperfusion brain injury. NO and NOS may play a critical role in the ischemia-reperfusion brain damage in vitro.
