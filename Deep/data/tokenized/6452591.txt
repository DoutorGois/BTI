The postsynaptic effect of histamine and impromidine, an H2-receptor agonist on CA1 pyramidal and dentate granule cells in the hippocampal slice of the rat is a hyperpolarization. Depolarizations are indirectly mediated. It is suggested that the hyperpolarization is generated by a conductance increase to potassium ions in the dendrites.
