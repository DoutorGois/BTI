Cerebral neuroinflammation models were established by injecting 10 mug lipopolysaccharide into the hippocampus of male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of 120, 90, or 60 mg/kg oxymatrine daily for three days prior to the lipopolysaccharide injection. Twenty-four hours after model induction, the hippocampus was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, and the cerebral cortex was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot assay. The results of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the real-time quantitative PCR showed that the secretion and mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly decreased in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of model rats treated with oxymatrine. Western blot assay and real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that toll-like receptor 4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly decreased in the groups receiving different doses of oxymatrine. Additionally, 120 and 90 mg/kg oxymatrine were shown to reduce protein levels of nuclear factor-kappaB p65 in the nucleus and of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha in the cytoplasm of brain cells, as detected by western blot assay. Experimental findings indicate that oxymatrine may inhibit neuroinflammation in rat brain via downregulating the expression of molecules in the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway.
