The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a neural structure that sends strong efferent projections to the hippocampus. Output from the VTA can affect hippocampal-dependent neural processes that are critical for learning and memory, including long term potentiation and theta activity. However, no study to date has elucidated what role the VTA plays in mediating the different stages of learning and memory. Therefore, the current study was designed to assess how reversible inactivation of the VTA may affect the acquisition, consolidation and retrieval of memory in rats using an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task. In this experiment, rats with chronically implanted cannulae aimed at the VTA were trained on an inhibitory avoidance task. They received intra-VTA infusions of lidocaine or saline immediately before training, after training or before a memory retention test. The results indicate that inactivation of the VTA prior to the first acquisition session increased the number of trials rats required to reach the acquisition criterion. Similarly, inactivation of the VTA after acquisition training decreased the step-through latency and increased the amount of time spent in the dark compartment relative to the saline-treated group. However, inactivation of the VTA immediately prior to the memory retention test failed to alter either step-through latency or the amount of time spent in the dark compartment. Overall, these results suggest the VTA facilitates the acquisition and consolidation of IA learning and memory.
