Long-lasting effects of neonatal interference with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were investigated by measuring responses to micro-iontophoretically applied NMDA agonists/antagonist in hippocampal neurons of the adult rat. Rat pups were chronically treated with MK-801 from postnatal day 8 through 19 and tested at postnatal day 70-100. CA1 cell responses to glutamate were not affected by the neonatal treatment. However, a stronger suppression of the NMDA evoked response by the NMDA site antagonist amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) was measured, suggesting a long-lasting configurational change of the NMDA receptor. The NMDA evoked responses were equally strong suppressed by MK-801 in both groups, suggesting that channel sites were not affected by this treatment.
