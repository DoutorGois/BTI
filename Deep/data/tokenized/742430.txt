The authors describe a seventeen-years-old girl suffering from partial seizures with complex symptomatology. The neuroradiological studies demonstrated a slow-growing glial tumour seated deeply in the right temporo-occipital region. Scalp EEG demonstrated a bilateral asynchronous temporal focus without definite lateralization. Chronic depth electrodes recording allowed identification of a primary epileptogenic area in the right rhinencephalic structures. Radiofrequency lesions performed in the right amygdala and anterior third of right Ammon's horn abolished the seizures at ten months follow up.
