Quantitative autoradiographic analysis of [3H] 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) binding in vitamin D deficient mice provided evidence for high levels of specific binding in choroid plexus and, to a lesser extent, ventral hippocampus. Sucrose gradient analysis yielded a 3-4S peak of specific [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 binding in bovine choroid plexus, but not amygdala or hippocampus. Scatchard analysis of [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 binding in bovine choroid plexus yielded KD = 0.23 +/- 0.06 nM and Nmax = 43.5 +/- 0 fmol/g tissue (n = 5). This result indicates the presence of significant receptor-like [3H]1,25(OH)2D3 binding sites in the choroid plexus and, thus, suggests roles for this hormone in regulating the entry of calcium into the brain and/or in the central regulation of calcium homeostasis.
