Rat brain expresses two types of corticosteroid-binding proteins. The type I receptor binds corticosterone with high affinity and is structurally related to the kidney mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), while the type II or classical glucocorticoid receptor binds corticosterone with lower affinity and displays an in vivo preference for dexamethasone. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of a cDNA coding for the MR, from a rat hippocampus cDNA library, by low stringency hybridization to radiolabeled human glucocorticoid receptor cDNA. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence for rat hippocampal MR displays extensive homology to a MR cDNA isolated from human kidney, suggesting that they are orthologous genes. Southern analysis suggests that there is only one gene for the MR, and in vitro expression of the receptor generates a high affinity corticosterone-binding protein. These data provide evidence to support the contention that a single gene gives rise to the MR in renal tissues and type I receptors in the brain.
