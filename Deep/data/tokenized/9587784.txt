1. In brain areas of untreated guinea-pigs the highest activity of acetylcholinesterase was seen in the striatum and cerebellum, followed by the midbrain, medulla-pons and cortex, and the lowest in the hippocampus. The activity in diaphragm was seven-fold lower than in the hippocampus. 2. At 1 h after soman (27 micrograms/kg) administration the activity of the enzyme was dramatically reduced in all tissues studied. In muscle the three major molecular forms (A12, G4 and G1) showed a similar degree of inhibition and a similar rate of recovery and the activity had returned to normal by 7 days. 3. In the brain soman inhibited the G4 form more than the G1 form. The hippocampus, cortex and midbrain showed the greatest reductions in enzyme activity. At 7 days the activity in the cortex, medulla pons and striatum had recovered but in the hippocampus, midbrain and cerebellum it was still inhibited. 4. Thus the effects of soman administration varied in severity and time course in the different tissues studied. However the enzyme activity was still reduced in all tissues at 24 h when the overt signs of poisoning had disappeared.
