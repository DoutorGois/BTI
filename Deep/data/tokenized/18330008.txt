Basic research is mostly focused on the consequences of status epilepticus (SE) in terms of neuronal loss, behavior, epileptogenesis or disease-modifying effects such as preventing epilepsy or reducing seizure severity. Among the drugs tested, several were able to trigger neuroprotection but only a few had disease-modifying effects. At this point, many data are still missing, namely which drugs could efficiently stop SE or which mechanisms of action should be searched for to prevent the harmful consequences of SE.
