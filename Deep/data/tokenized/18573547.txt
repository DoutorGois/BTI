Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, is well known as a mediator in early stage inflammatory immune reactions. In recent years, accumulating evidence has shown that IL-6 is concomitant with the occurrence of major depression. However, the identification of the role of IL-6, as either an illness causation or immunotherapy in depression, remains to be further established. In the present study, 5-week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used along with the forced swim test (FST) and pharmacological techniques. The data show that rats subjected to 3-day intra-amygdala or intra-hippocampus, but not intra-frontal cortex, IL-6 treatments manifested a significant increase in the immobility time (IMT) in the FST. In addition, there was no obvious difference in body temperature between normal and 3-day IL-6 treated rats. Conversely, the rats receiving 3-day intra-amygdala or intra-hippocampus IL-6 inhibitor treatment expressed a significant reduction in IMT in the FST. Moreover, the 3-day IL-6 treated rats treated with SL 327, a blood-brain barrier penetrating MEK inhibitor, prior to the FST showed a significant decrease in the IL-6 elevated IMT. In addition, the results in the Western blot analysis were in parallel with those in the behavioral tests. Taken together, the results show that the immobile behavior of rats in the FST could be modulated by IL-6 via the amygdala or the hippocampus. Furthermore, the Erk1/2 activation in the amygdala or hippocampus seemed to play a role in the IL-6 mediated immobile behavioural alterations of rats in the FST.
