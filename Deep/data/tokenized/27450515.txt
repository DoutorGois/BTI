Clinical studies suggest that athletes with a history of concussion may be at risk for additional mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and repetitive exposure to mTBI acutely increases risk for more significant and persistent symptoms and increases future risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, symptoms of mTBI are managed with rest and pain medication; there are no drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that target the biochemical pathology underlying mTBI to treat or prevent acute and long-term effects of repetitive mTBI. Memantine is an FDA-approved drug for treating Alzheimer's disease, and also was shown to be neuroprotective in rodents following a single, moderate to severe TBI. Therefore, we investigated the potential for memantine to mitigate negative outcomes from repetitive mild stretch injury in organotypical hippocampal slice cultures. Samples received two injuries 24 h apart; injury resulted in significant cell death, loss of long-term potentiation (LTP), and astrogliosis compared with naive, uninjured samples. Delivery of 1.5 muM memantine 1 h following each stretch significantly reduced the effect of injury for all outcome measures, and did not alter those outcome measures that were unaffected by the injury. Therefore, memantine warrants further pre-clinical and clinical investigation for its therapeutic efficacy to prevent cognitive deficits and neuropathology from multiple mTBIs.
