Dynamics of single cells and large cell populations are the subject of investigation by using differently detailed models. Multicompartmental modeling techniques are used to systematically investigate the location-dependent effects of GABA-ergic inhibition on the firing patterns of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Appearance of stochastic resonance in a model of mitral and granule cells of the olfactory bulb is demonstrated by using a single-compartmental model approach. Spatial propagation of synchronized activities in hippocampal slices are studied by a model of large neural populations.
