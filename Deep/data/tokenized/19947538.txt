Individual features of cognitive behavior of rats induced by the administration of the aggregated amyloid beta3-peptide (25-35) (Abeta25-35) into the lateral ventricles of the brain were studied. A new approach to the estimation of individual differences in the effects of Abeta25-35 was applied. Navigation training was performed in one short session with a random position of a target; sessions were repeated with the intervals of a few days. It was found for the first time that, at the early stage of its action, Abeta25-35 did not disturb the cognitive behavior in 50% of rats. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase in the cortex and the hippocampus of animals both with and without disturbance of cognitive behavior was significantly decreased. We suggest that the differences in individual responses may be due to phenotypic features of the animals. At the early stage of its action, the aggregated Abeta may induce a compensatory response preventing the disturbance of cognitive processes.
