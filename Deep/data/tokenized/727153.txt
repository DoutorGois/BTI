Quantitative electron microscopic analysis of the supragranular zone of the dentate gyrus molecular layer has shown that the number and volume fraction of profiles of astroglial processes are significantly increased in senescent rat relative to young adults. These ultrastructural modifications, which are not associated with significant age-related changes in the number of astrocytes or in the width of the molecular layer, may result from a formation of new astroglial processes and/or elongation of existing ones. In either case, the increase in the number and volume fraction of astroglial process profiles is an indicator of age-related astroglial hypertrophy. Hypertrophy of astroglial procecesses, which seems to develop with advanced age as a response to partial deafferentation of neurons, may compensate for a decrease in the dendritic volume fraction, thereby preventing changes in the dimensions of the dentate gyrus molecular layer in senescence.
