Previous work done by our laboratory has demonstrated a reduction of the post-burst afterhyperpolarization (AHP) and accommodation following trace eyeblink conditioning in rabbit CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our laboratory has also demonstrated a reduction in the AHP in rat CA1 pyramidal neurons following spatial learning. In the current study we have extended our findings in rabbits by showing a reduction in both the AHP and accommodation in F344 X BN rat CA1 pyramidal neurons following acquisition of trace eyeblink conditioning. A component current of the AHP, I(M), was evaluated with a specific blocker of this current, and showed no apparent contribution to the learning-related increase in neuronal excitability. Rather, a reduction in an isoproterenol-sensitive component of the AHP, presumably sI(AHP), was observed to underlie the learning-specific change.
