Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive dementia disorder characterized by synaptic degeneration and amyloid-beta (Abeta) accumulation in the brain. Through whole-genome sequencing of 1345 individuals from 410 families with late-onset AD (LOAD), we identified three highly penetrant variants in PRKCA, the gene that encodes protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), in five of the families. All three variants linked with LOAD displayed increased catalytic activity relative to wild-type PKCalpha as assessed in live-cell imaging experiments using a genetically encoded PKC activity reporter. Deleting PRKCA in mice or adding PKC antagonists to mouse hippocampal slices infected with a virus expressing the Abeta precursor CT100 revealed that PKCalpha was required for the reduced synaptic activity caused by Abeta. In PRKCA(-/-) neurons expressing CT100, introduction of PKCalpha, but not PKCalpha lacking a PDZ interaction moiety, rescued synaptic depression, suggesting that a scaffolding interaction bringing PKCalpha to the synapse is required for its mediation of the effects of Abeta. Thus, enhanced PKCalpha activity may contribute to AD, possibly by mediating the actions of Abeta on synapses. In contrast, reduced PKCalpha activity is implicated in cancer. Hence, these findings reinforce the importance of maintaining a careful balance in the activity of this enzyme.
