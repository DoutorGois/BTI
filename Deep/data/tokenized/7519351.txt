The effect of chronic treatment with a tryptophan (TRP)-free diet on the free-running circadian wheel-running rhythm and the central serotonergic system was investigated in blinded male rats. The long-term TRP-free diet did not change periods of activity, but disordered their patterns. This seemed to be due to masking, entrainment, enhancement of the morning activity, and obscuring of the activity onset as well as appearance of some periodic activities within the subjective night. A long-term TRP-fre diet decreased the concentration of TRP, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in all brain regions tested: frontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, and pons. Density of 5-HT1A receptor binding was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus, whereas no significant change was observed in the density of 5-HT2 receptor binding in all regions. These results suggest that the period of primary circadian pacemaker is not affected, but its oscillation, as well as the coupling strength between the primary and secondary pacemakers, is weakened by the dysfunction of the serotonergic system caused by chronic TRP depletion.
