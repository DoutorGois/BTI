Post-ischemic administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a glucose antimetabolite, markedly reduces the occurrence of ischemia-induced delayed neuronal death (DND) in the gerbil hippocampus. This means that the reduction of energy dependent metabolism after ischemia prevents ischemia-induced damages of hippocampal neurons. In the present study, we demonstrated hyperthermia during ischemia fails to preserve neurons in hippocampal CA1 of 2-DG treated gerbil following transient forebrain ischemia.
