We have developed a novel method in which antisense DNA is selectively electroporated into individual adult neural progenitor cells. By electroporation of antisense oligonucleotides against signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) we demonstrate that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is an instructive signal for astroglial type 2 cell fate specifically mediated via activation of STAT3. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway induced only a transient increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and inhibition of this signaling pathway did not block the induction by CNTF of glial differentiation in progenitor cells. In addition we show that microelectroporation is a new powerful method for introducing antisense agents into single cells in complex cellular networks.
