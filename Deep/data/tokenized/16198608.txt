The well-known family of low-density lipoprotein receptors represents a collection of ancient membrane receptors that have been remarkably conserved throughout evolution. These multifunctional receptors, known to regulate cholesterol transport, are becoming increasingly interesting to the neuroscience community due to their ability to transduce a diversity of extracellular signals across the membrane in the adult CNS. Their roles in modulating synaptic plasticity and necessity in hippocampus-specific learning and memory have recently come to light. In addition, genetic, biochemical and behavioral studies have implicated these signaling systems in a number of human neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders involving loss of cognitive ability, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia and autism. This review describes the known functions of these receptors and discusses their potential role in processes of synaptic regulation and memory formation.
