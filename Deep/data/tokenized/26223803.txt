Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) have been used as a powerful ex vivo model for decades. They have been used successfully in studies of neuronal death, microglial activation, mossy fiber regeneration, neurogenesis, and drug screening. As a pre-animal experimental phase for physiologic and pathologic brain research, OHSCs offer outcomes that are relatively closer to those of whole-animal studies than outcomes obtained from cell culture in vitro. At the same time, mechanisms can be studied more precisely in OHSCs than they can be in vivo. Here, we summarize stroke and traumatic brain injury research that has been carried out in OHSCs and review classic experimental applications of OHSCs and its limitations.
