Learning and memory impairment is one of the most challenging complications of cirrhosis and present treatments are unsatisfactory. The exact mechanism of cirrhosis cognitive dysfunction is unknown. Pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) is an excitatory neurosteroid that acts as a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and GABAA receptor antagonist. In this study we evaluated the effect of intra CA1 infusion of PREGS on cirrhotic rats' memory function using the Y-maze test. Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression was also evaluated. Three weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL) surgery, rats were under stereotaxic surgery for insertion of two guide cannulas in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. After 1-week of recovery, PREGS was administered through CA1 cannulas in cirrhotic rats, while control or sham groups received vehicle. For evaluation of NMDA receptor role in memory-enhancing effects of PREGS, DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) which is a potent and competitive antagonist of NMDA receptor, co-administered with PREGS and for assessment of hippocampal BDNF mRNA expression, quantitative Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was used. Results showed that 28 days after BDL, cirrhotic animals' memory significantly decreased in comparison with control and sham groups, while PREGS infusion could restore memory impairment (P<0.05). PREGS effects on memory of cirrhotic rats were antagonized by DAP5. RT-PCR findings have shown that hippocampal relative BDNF mRNA expression was up-regulated in PREGS-treated groups in comparison with the BDL group (P<0.001). Our findings suggest that PREGS has a memory-enhancing effect in cirrhosis memory deficit in acute therapy and this effect may be through NMDA (glutamate) receptor involvement and BDNF mRNA expression.
