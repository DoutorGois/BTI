In 2-9 months dogs the influence was studied of ablation of the hippocampus dorsal area on formation and preservation of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), elaborated by combination of 30% sucrose solution with i.p. injection of 0.28 M LiCl solution. Lesion of the hippocampus dorsal area does not prevent acquisition after the first pairing of conditioned taste aversion in puppies and adult dogs. Heterogeneous influences are observed after hippocampus lesions on the process of CTA extinction in animals of different ages. Acquaintance with conditioned stimulus before CTA acquisition accelerates the process of its extinction in hippocampectomized indiviuals, but less than in animals with an intact hippocampus.
