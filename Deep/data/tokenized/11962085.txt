The action of P. cubensis mushroom extract, containing psilocybin (PCB) and psilocin, on spike activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was studied in in vitro rat brain slices. In 38 (76%) out of 50 investigated neurons spike activity was decreased, in 2 (4%) cells it increased. There was no response 10 (20%) neurons. Application of the extract caused short burst firing in 12 (24%) neurons. All neurons showing inhibition during PCB-containing extract application, were also inhibited by serotonin (5-HT). Usually inhibitory reaction did not last over 4-5 min upon 3 min extract application and could be prolonged up to 10-43 min up on serotonin application. Part of neurons were inhibited by serotonin and did not react to extract application. Inhibitory reactions induced by extract application were blocked by ritanserin in half of the tested units and were induced due to activation of 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. The extract suppressed excitative spike reactions caused by application of L-glutamic acid. It is concluded, that application of PCB-containing extract in most cases reduced spike activity in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and suppressed glutamate transmission.
