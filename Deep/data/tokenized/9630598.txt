Corticosteroids can facilitate or impair learning and memory processes. We found that the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU38486 injected locally into the dorsal hippocampus dose-dependently improved the performance of male Wistar rats in the water maze 24 h after treatment. This observation suggests a discrete specificity of hippocampal glucocorticoid receptors in facilitation of memory.
