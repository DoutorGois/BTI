The frequency of basket cells in the granule cell layer of the dentate fascia of Short Sleep (SS) and Long Sleep (LS) mice was determined following 3 months of ethanol exposure. These mice were bred for their differential susceptibility to the narcotic effects of acute doses of ethanol. The ethanol-insensitive SS mice were unaffected by the treatment while the ethanol-sensitive LS mice that received ethanol showed a significant decrease in basket cell frequency over their control group counterparts. These basket cells are thought to control the tonic level of activity of the granule cells. Thus, a decrease in basket cell frequency might lead to higher granule cell activity following chronic ethanol exposure. This effect could counteract the assumed stronger depressant effect of ethanol in the relatively ethanol-sensitive LS mice.
