High-frequency field potential activity between 50 and 400 Hz occurs throughout seizure-like events recorded from the CA3 region of juvenile rat hippocampal slices under low-[Mg(2+)] condition. Another (400-800 Hz) component occurred mainly during preictal paroxysmal spiking and the onsets of seizure-like events (97%) and less frequently during tonic and clonic phases (38% and 70%, respectively). Short epochs of oscillations in this range were associated with fast negative field potential deflections at the start of field potential transients. Voltage-clamp recordings from putative CA3 pyramidal cells showed the occurrence of synaptic inputs in the same frequency range at the onset of seizure-like events and the beginning of preictal or clonic paroxysmal spikes, while the frequency of action potentials never reached that range. The amplitude of fast negative field potential deflection, the rise time of membrane potential or voltage-clamp current changes and the mean phase coherence were consistent with an increase of synchronization towards the onset of a seizure-like event. Their parallel changes indicate the involvement of both synaptic and nonsynaptic mechanisms in the synchronization of neuronal activity and the development of seizure-like events in the low-[Mg(2+)] model of epilepsy.
