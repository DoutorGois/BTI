We have previously reported the differential involvement of synaptic proteins in Alzheimer's disease (AD). As AD is an aging-associated disease, in the present study we examined the developmental and aging-related changes in synaptic proteins such as synaptophysin, synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin, synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), syntaxin 1/HPC-1 and drebrin in the rat brain. Immunoblot analyses of brain extracts from embryonic day 19 (E19) to postnatal 96-week-old rats indicated that the protein level of synaptophysin and synaptobrevin increased after birth, being highest at 24 weeks, and then decreased with aging. Synaptotagmin was detected at E19, with levels increasing after birth to 96 weeks. SNAP-25 levels were highest at 4 weeks, and then decreased with aging. Syntaxin 1/HPC-1 levels were high at E19 and 1 week, decreasing rapidly from 2 weeks onwards, and drebrin levels were highest at E19 and 1 week, and decreased during aging. The present results suggest that the expression of each synaptic protein is differentially regulated in development and aging.
