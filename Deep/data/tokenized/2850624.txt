Extracellular Ca2+, synaptic transmission, and the activation of subsynaptic receptors are not required for the induction of long-term potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission at stratum radiatum-CA1 neuron junctions as long as sufficient depolarizations of the presynaptic terminals and the postsynaptic neurons co-occur.
