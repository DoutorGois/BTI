Studies on living slices of hippocampus-entorhinal cortex formation from adult rats were performed to investigate changes in responses in field CA3 to stimulation of mossy fibers in conditions of perforant path tetanization with different parameters. Tetanization of the perforant path at frequencies of 10 and 100 Hz induced depression of responses in CA3 on testing of this same path. Tetanization of the perforant path at a frequency of 10 Hz and an amplitude subthreshold for potentiating mossy fiber synapses in CA3 became threshold if preceded by tetanization of the perforant path at a frequency of 100 Hz. Tetanization of mossy fibers at 10 Hz resulted in potentiation of the input to CA3, while tetanization at 100 Hz induced depression. High-frequency tetanization of the perforant path (100 Hz) delivered in trains following at the frequency of the theta rhythm, led mainly to depression of field CA3 responses to stimulation of mossy fibers.
