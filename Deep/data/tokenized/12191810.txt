This study examined the antidepressant efficacy of the selective sigma(1) receptor agonists igmesine or PRE-084 in mice injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with beta(25-35)-amyloid peptide and submitted to the forced swim test. Beta(25-35) peptide-injected animals developed memory deficits after 8 days contrarily to controls injected with scrambled beta(25-35) peptide or vehicle solution. In the forced swim test, the i.c.v. treatment failed to affect the immobility duration, but the antidepressant effect of the sigma(1) agonists was facilitated in beta(25-35) animals. Igmesine reduced immobility duration at 30 versus 60 mg/kg in control groups. PRE-084 decreased immobility duration at 30 and 60 mg/kg only in beta(25-35) animals. Desipramine reduced the immobility duration similarly among groups and fluoxetine appeared less potent in beta(25-35) animals. The beta(25-35) animals exhibited decreased progesterone levels in the hippocampus (-47%). The behavioural efficacy of sigma(1) agonists is known to depend on neuro(active)steroids levels synthesised by glial cells and neurones, which are affected by the beta-amyloid toxicity. This behavioural study suggests that sigma(1) agonists, due to their enhanced efficacy, may allow to alleviate the depressive symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.
