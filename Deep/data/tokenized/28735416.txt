Although dopamine receptors D1 and D2 play key roles in hippocampal function, their synaptic localization within the hippocampus has not been fully elucidated. In order to understand precise functions of pre- or postsynaptic dopamine receptors (DRs), the development of protocols to differentiate pre- and postsynaptic DRs is essential. So far, most studies on determination and quantification of DRs did not discriminate between subsynaptic localization. Therefore, the aim of the study was to generate a robust workflow for the localization of DRs. This work provides the basis for future work on hippocampal DRs, in light that DRs may have different functions at pre- or postsynaptic sites. Synaptosomes from rat hippocampi isolated by a sucrose gradient protocol were prepared for super-resolution direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) using Bassoon as a presynaptic zone and Homer1 as postsynaptic density marker. Direct labeling of primary validated antibodies against dopamine receptors D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) with Alexa Fluor 594 enabled unequivocal assignment of D1R and D2R to both, pre- and postsynaptic sites. D1R immunoreactivity clusters were observed within the presynaptic active zone as well as at perisynaptic sites at the edge of the presynaptic active zone. The results may be useful for the interpretation of previous studies and the design of future work on DRs in the hippocampus. Moreover, the reduction of the complexity of brain tissue by the use of synaptosomal preparations and dSTORM technology may represent a useful tool for synaptic localization of brain proteins.
