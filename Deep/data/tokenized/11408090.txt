Although the cerebral cortical dopamine D(1) receptor is considered to play a role in normal and abnormal brain function, little information is available on its characteristics in human brain. We compared dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in homogenates of cerebral cortex (frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and cingulate cortex) of autopsied brain of neurologically normal subjects to that in striatum. Cerebral cortical AC activity was modestly and dose-dependently stimulated by dopamine (maximal 20-30%) with low microM EC50s and such stimulation was inhibited by the selective dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390. The magnitude of the maximal stimulation by dopamine was similar in autopsied and biopsied cerebral cortex. The extent of maximal stimulation was similar to that in dopamine-rich striatum (caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens), despite much lower density of dopamine D1 receptors in cerebral cortex vs. striatum. The EC50 for dopamine stimulation in cerebral cortex (approximately 1 microM) was lower than that for caudate and putamen (approximately 3 microM). No detectable dopamine stimulation was observed in cerebellar cortex, thalamus or hippocampus. Dopamine stimulation in both cerebral cortex and striatum was independent of calcium activation. We conclude that dopamine stimulated AC can be measured in cerebral cortex of human brain allowing for the possibility that this process can be examined in human brain disorders in which dopaminergic abnormalities are suspected.
