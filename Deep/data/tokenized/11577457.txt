Real advances in biotechnology made it possible to complete human whole genome sequencing within a short duration. Although the genome includes a huge amount of information about biological functions and the interest is now directed to the study using genomic information, the genomic strategy is not clearly understood. The following 4 studies were therefore presented and discussed about the strategy after the completion of the genomic sequence in the 74th Annual Meeting of Japanese Pharmacological Society: 1) Asthma and atopic dermatitis: models for genetic and genomic investigations of complex genetic diseases, by W.C.O. Cookson (University of Oxford, Asthma Genetics Group, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics); 2) Molecular classification by global gene expression profiling: application on oncogenomic research, by H. Aburatani (Genome Science Division, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Tokyo); 3) Functional genomic search of disease-related genes using microarrays with normalized rat cDNA library, by G. Tsujimoto, et al. (Department of Molecular, Cell Pharmacology, National Children's Medical Research Center: and 4) Acute ischemic change of mRNA expression in the hippocampus by GeneChip array analysis: a starting point for post-genome strategy, by S. Asai, et al.
