Dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) mechanisms have been implicated in several psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism, which are characterized by cognitive deficits. The cellular mechanisms are poorly understood but impaired neuronal synchronization within cortical networks in the gamma frequency band has been proposed to contribute to these deficits. A D4R polymorphism was recently linked to variations in gamma power in both normal and ADHD subjects, and D4R activation was shown to enhance kainate-induced gamma oscillations in brain slices in vitro. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of D4R activation on gamma oscillations in freely moving rats during natural behavior. Field potentials were recorded in the frontal, prefrontal, parietal, and occipital cortex and hippocampus. Gamma power was assessed before and after subcutaneous injection of a D4R agonist, A-412997, in several doses between 0.3 and 10.0 mg/kg. The experiments were also repeated in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, in which rats are prenatally treated with methylazoxymethanol (MAM). We found that the D4R agonist increased gamma power in all regions at short latency and lasted for ~2 h, both in normal and MAM-treated rats. The effect was dose dependent indicated by the significant difference between the effects after 3 and 10 mg/kg in pair-wise comparison, whereas 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg injections were ineffective. This study demonstrates the involvement of D4R in cortical gamma oscillations in vivo and identifies this receptor as potential target for pharmacological treatment of cognitive deficits.
