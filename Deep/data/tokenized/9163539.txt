We have investigated the relative contributions of oxygen and glucose deprivation to ischaemic neurodegeneration in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Cultures prepared from 10-day-old rats were maintained in vitro for 14 days and then deprived of either oxygen (hypoxia), glucose (hypoglycaemia), or both oxygen and glucose (ischaemia). Hypoxia alone induced degeneration selectively in CA1 pyramidal cells and this was greatly potentiated if glucose was removed from the medium. We have also characterised the effects of both pre- and post-treatment using glutamate receptor antagonists and the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX). Neuronal death following either hypoxia or ischaemia was prevented by pre-incubation with CNQX, MK-801 or tetrodotoxin. MK-801 or CNQX also prevented death induced by either hypoxia or ischaemia if added immediately post-insult, however, post-insult addition of TTX prevented hypoxic but not ischaemic damage. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures are sensitive to both NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor blockade and thus represent a useful in vitro system for the study of ischaemic neurodegeneration paralleling results reported using in vivo models of ischaemia.
