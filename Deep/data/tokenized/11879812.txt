To test whether moderate changes in brain temperature can influence electroencephalogram (EEG) frequencies in a significant way the behaviour of peak theta frequency (approximately 6 Hz) in the rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep EEG was investigated in the Djungarian hamster under influence of the spontaneous euthermic changes in brain temperature. In contrast to in vitro data, collected from hippocampal tissue, theta peak frequency shifted significantly when temperature changed between 33 and 37 degrees C. The results support the hypothesis that moderate changes in brain temperature can influence EEG power density spectra.
