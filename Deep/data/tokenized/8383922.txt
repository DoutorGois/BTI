The effect of long-term treatment with ethanol was investigated on the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. Rats were rendered ethanol-dependent by repeated forced administration of a 20% ethanol solution (12 to 18 g/kg/day po) for 6 days and tested while still intoxicated or at different time intervals after withdrawal. t-[35S]Butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding was increased by 30% in cortical homogenates of rats killed 1 to 3 hr after last ethanol administration, when compared with saline-treated animals. However, GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and its enhancement by flunitrazepam was decreased in the ethanol-treated animals. 35S-TBPS binding and 36Cl- influx measured 9 to 24 hr following the last ethanol injection, when withdrawal signs were present, were unmodified with respect to saline-treated rats. Moreover, the effects of both isoniazid and FG 7142 on 35S-TBPS binding were unchanged in ethanol-dependent rats tested at 1 to 3 and 9 to 24 hr, compared with controls. In contrast, ethanol-withdrawn rats tested at 9 to 24 hr showed a dramatic enhancement in their sensitivity to the convulsant action of isoniazid (50 to 250 mg/kg, sc). The same animals were also more susceptible to the convulsant action of NMDA (0.5 to 5 micrograms/5 microliters/rat intracerebroventricularly) and kainic acid (12 mg/kg, ip), and this effect was paralleled by an enhancement (+25%) in the density of 3H-MK 801 recognition sites in the hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
