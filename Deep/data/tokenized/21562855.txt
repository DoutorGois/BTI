Stress induces structural plasticity in neurons of the adult central nervous system (CNS) and alters the levels of cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and these changes might involve modifications of the antioxidant defense system. This study investigated whether acute stress altered the expression pattern of peroxiredoxin (Prx) III, which is an antioxidant enzyme that controls cytokine-induced peroxide levels. Prx III immunoreactivity was upregulated in the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus and in the motor neurons of the spinal cord in an acute immobilization stress (AIS) model. In addition, we tested whether the transcription factor Foxo3a was necessary for the expression of Prx III. The depletion of Foxo3a led to a marked reduction of Prx III and a compensatory enhancement of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) in PC12 cells. The results of this study suggest that Foxo3a mediates the neuronal levels of expression of Prx III and the levels of expression of Mn-SOD in mitochondria. These mechanisms may play an important role in neuroprotection against oxidative stress. Furthermore, Prx III upregulation might be an useful approach for the management of stress.
