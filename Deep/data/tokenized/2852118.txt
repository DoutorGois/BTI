The actions of the four isomers of 1-amino-1, 3-cyclopentane dicarboxylate (ACPD), a conformationally restricted analogue of glutamate, have been examined for their ability to displace radiolabelled kainate and glutamate from their binding sites on membranes prepared from rat brain. All four of the isomers reduced specific kainate binding, and all enhanced that of glutamate although one (D-(-)-cis-(1R,3R)-ACPD) was significantly more active in this respect than were the other three. The results are discussed in terms of the pharmacological effects of the isomers of ACPD on single neurones and the possible structural requirements of the NMDA and kainate receptors.
