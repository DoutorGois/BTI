Rat experiments have shown that intraperitoneal piracetam leads to formation of abundant coated vesicles in the neurons of the sensomotor cortex, hippocampus, and central gray matter. Concurrently, subsuperficial cisterns form under the plasmalemma of nerve cells. The interneuronal contacts are characterized by long-term excitation without destructive changes in synapses. It is suggested that piracetam is able to increase the number of synapses in some brain regions at the expense of sprouting.
