The present study employed intramuscular (i.m.) injections of the acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist scopolamine hydrobromide (0.10 mg/kg) to investigate the possible involvement of ACh in naturally occurring spatial navigation in homing pigeons (Columba livia). Control pigeons receiving injections of saline or scopolamine methylbromide, an ACh antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, were oriented in a homeward direction when released from a location 8 km from home. In contrast, pigeons injected with scopolamine hydrobromide (0.10 mg/kg, i.m.) were less well oriented and took more time to return home from the same location. These results suggest that homing pigeon navigation is regulated, in part, by central cholinergic mechanisms.
