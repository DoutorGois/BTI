Cannabis and 3,4 methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy") are the most frequently combined illegal drugs among young adults in western societies. This study examined the effects of chronic co-administration of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN) and MDMA on working memory and effort-based decision making in rats. Treatment consisted of MDMA (7.5 mg/kg), WIN (1.2 mg/kg), a combination of these substances (MDMA+WIN) or vehicle over a period of 25 days during puberty (PD40-65) or adulthood (PD80-105). Ten days after the last treatment, WIN reversed MDMA-induced working memory deficits in the object recognition test in animals treated during adulthood or puberty, but had no influence on impairment of adult rats in the effort-based T-maze task. No differences were observed between groups of pubertally treated rats in the decision making task. During a subsequent acute drug challenge MDMA and MDMA+WIN decreased high reward choices in both age groups, indicating MDMA-induced cost-aversive choice. Differential long-term interactions on the neuronal level in the hippocampus and MDMA-induced disturbances in cortico-limbic connections are suggested.
