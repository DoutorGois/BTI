Axosomatic synapses involving granule cells of the dentate gyrus were studied by means of quantitative electron microscopic analysis in young adult (3-month-old) and aged (25-month-old) rats. The number of axosomatic synapses per unit length of neuronal soma membrane was found to be significantly lower (by 15%) in aged animals than in young adults. This decrease in synaptic numbers is not associated with age-related changes in the size of neuronal soma profiles or in the length of their plasma membranes. The ratio between the total length of synaptic appositions and the membrane length of a neuronal soma profile was diminished by 22% in aged rats, whereas the mean length of synaptic apposition was 10% less in these animals than in young adults. These data, taken together, suggest that an absolute loss of axosomatic synapses occurs with advanced age. It appears, therefore, than not only the loss of axodendritic synapses, described previously, but also the loss of axosomatic synapses, found here, contributes to the process of age-related partial deafferentation of neurons in the rat dentate gyrus.
