The mitochondrial ATP synthase, subunit c, isoform 3 gene (Atp5g3) encodes subunit 9, the subunit of the multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. According to the Ensembl database, Atp5g3 in mice is located on chromosome 2 between 73746504 and 73749383 bp, within the genomic regions of two sets of quantitative trait loci - alcohol preference and body weight. Both of those traits are more influenced by epigenetic factors than many other traits are. Using currently available phenotype and gene expression profiles from the GeneNetwork database, we obtained correlations between Atp5g3 and alcoholism- and obesity-relevant phenotypes. The correlation in expression levels between Atp5g3 and each of its 12 partner genes in the molecular interaction are different in various tissues and genes. Transcriptome mapping indicated that Atp5g3 is differentially regulated in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and liver. Owing to a lack of known polymorphisms of Atp5g3 among three relevant mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6), DBA/2J (D2), and BALB/ cJ, the molecular mechanism for the connection between Atp5g3 and alcoholism and body weight requires further investigation.
