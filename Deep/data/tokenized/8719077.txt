Interpretations of ambiguous sentences were studied in patients with unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy or selective amygdalo-hippocampectomy. The sentences represented lexical and syntactic ambiguities. In both left- and right-sided groups, regardless of type of surgery, total mean score on the test was below normal. Left-sided cases, regardless of type of surgery, provided significantly fewer alternative interpretations than right-sided cases. The results suggest greater left than right hemisphere specialization in both lexical and syntactic processing, but also suggest right hemisphere involvement in resolution of lexical ambiguity.
