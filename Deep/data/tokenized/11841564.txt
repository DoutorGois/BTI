Recent studies indicate that the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease [tg(hAPP)] demonstrates disturbances in plasma glucose and neuroendocrine function reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alterations in any one of these systems can have a profound effect on hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) expression. Additionally, the recent discovery that amyloid beta 1-42 can induce the expression of CYP reductase in neuronal cultures further suggests that hepatic CYP-related metabolism may be affected by the expression of mutant human amyloid precursor protein in these tg(hAPP) mice. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the activity and protein content of several CYP isoforms in the livers and kidneys of aged (20-month-old) tg(hAPP) mice. tg(hAPP) mice exhibit significant elevations in hepatic CYP2B, CYP2E1-, CYP3A- and CYP4A-associated activities and CYP4A immunoreactive protein compared with wild-type. In contrast to the liver, a significant depression in renal CYP2E1- and CYP4A-associated activities were demonstrated in tg(hAPP) mice. The presence of the mutant hAPP protein was detected in the brain, kidney and livers of tg(hAPP) mice.
