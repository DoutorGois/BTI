Kainic acid (KA) caused an initial decrease and a subsequent rebound in hippocampal enkephalin (ENK) in rats exhibiting wet dog shakes (WDS) without behavioral convulsions. Antibody to methionine-enkephalin but not dynorphin A(1-8) injected into lateral ventricles attenuated KA-induced WDS, as did naloxone. Granule-cell destroying injections of colchicine into ventral but not dorsal hippocampus caused a 60% reduction of hippocampal ENK and a complete elimination of KA-induced WDS. These studies suggest that release of granule cell ENK, which is 3 times more concentrated in ventral than dorsal hippocampus, plays an important role in KA-induced WDS.
