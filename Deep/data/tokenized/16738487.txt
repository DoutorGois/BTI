The Nogo system has recently been implicated not only in regeneration but also in modulating plasticity. One reason for declining memory functions in aging may be altered plasticity in the aged hippocampus and cortex cerebri. Therefore, we have examined the levels of mRNA encoding Nogo, OMgp and MAG, as well as the receptor components NgR, Lingo-1 and Troy in cortex and hippocampus of young (4 months), middle aged (16 months) and old (24 months) Fisher 344 rats. No significant changes of receptor components or the ligands OMgp or MAG were observed. Nogo mRNA, however, was significantly decreased in hippocampal subregions of aged animals. The specific decrease of Nogo mRNA levels in hippocampus and possibly cortex cerebri may relate to age-dependent decline of brain plasticity.
