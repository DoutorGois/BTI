The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor may play a critical role in learning and memory. In the present study, a significant correlation was found between the number of NMDA-displaceable, Na+-independent L-[3H]glutamate binding sites in the hippocampus and neocortex of young rats and the mean number of errors during retention, but not acquisition, in a 14-unit T-maze.
