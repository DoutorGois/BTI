Clinical and experimental observations indicate that the hippocampus is critical in the formation of declarative memories. Interestingly, electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that the region also has a particularly low seizure threshold, where globally synchronous synaptic activity can occur. By using a detailed biophysical model of area CA3, it is shown how septal cholinergic modulation, through three distinct mechanisms, can interact with intrinsic and synaptic conductances to influence population behavior. A dissection of each mechanism demonstrates a variety of population firing activity ranging from fully synchronized behavior to a mixture of repetitive bursting and oscillations in reduced subsets of neurons, ideal for forming accurate associations during a learning and recall task.
