Sex steroid hormones are potent regulators of behavior and they exert their effects through influences on sensory, motor, and motivational systems. To elucidate where androgens and estrogens can act to regulate sex-typical behaviors in the tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus), we quantified expression of the androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) genes in the brains of male and females. To do so, we cloned tungara-specific sequences for AR, ERalpha, and ERbeta, determined their distribution in the brain, and then quantified their expression in areas that are important in sexual communication. We found that AR, ERalpha, and ERbeta were expressed in the pallium, limbic forebrain (preoptic area, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, septum, striatum), parts of the thalamus, and the auditory midbrain (torus semicircularis). Males and females had a similar distribution of AR and ER expression, but expression levels differed in some brain regions. In the auditory midbrain, females had higher ERalpha and ERbeta expression than males, whereas males had higher AR expression than females. In the forebrain, females had higher AR expression than males in the ventral hypothalamus and medial pallium (homolog to hippocampus), whereas males had higher ERalpha expression in the medial pallium. In the preoptic area, striatum, and septum, males and females had similar levels of AR and ER expression. Our results suggest that sex steroid hormones have sexually dimorphic effects on auditory processing, sexual motivation, and possibly memory and, therefore, have important implications for sexual communication in this system.
