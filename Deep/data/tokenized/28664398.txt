Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder characterized by impairing levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Oxidative and inflammatory parameters have been recognized among its multiple predisposing pathways, and clinical studies indicate that ADHD patients have increased oxidative stress. In this study, we aimed to evaluate oxidative (DCFH oxidation, glutathione levels, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities) and inflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-10) parameters in the most widely accepted animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Prefrontal cortex, cortex (remaining regions), striatum and hippocampus of adult male SHR and Wistar Kyoto rats were studied. SHR presented increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus. In SHR, glutathione peroxidase activity was decreased in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. TNF-alpha levels were reduced in the prefrontal cortex, cortex (remaining regions), hippocampus and striatum of SHR. Besides, IL-1beta and IL-10 levels were decreased in the cortex of the ADHD model. Results indicate that SHR presented an oxidative profile that is characterized by an increase in ROS production without an effective antioxidant counterbalance. In addition, this strain showed a decrease in cytokine levels, mainly TNF-alpha, indicating a basal deficit. These results may present a new approach to the cognitive disturbances seen in the SHR.
