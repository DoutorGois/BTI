Brain dystrophin is enriched in the postsynaptic densities of pyramidal neurons specialized regions of the subsynaptic cytoskeletal network, which are critical for synaptic transmission and plasticity. Lack of dystrophin in brain structures have been involved with impaired cognitive functions. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a regulator of neuronal survival, fast synaptic transmission, and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The present study investigated BDNF protein levels by Elisa analysis in prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum and cortex tissues from male dystrophic mdx (n=5) and normal C57BL10 mouse (n=5). We observed that the mdx mouse display diminution in BDNF levels in striatum (t=6.073; df=6; p=0.001), while a tendency of decrease in BDNF levels was observed in the prefrontal cortex region (t=1.962; df=6; p=0.096). The cerebellum (t=1.258; df=7; p=0.249), hippocampus (t=0.631; df=7; p=0.548) and cortex (t=0.572; df=7; p=0.586) showed no significant alterations as compared to wt mouse. In conclusion, we demonstrate that only striatum decreased BDNF levels compared with wild-type (wt) mouse, differently to the other areas of the brain. This dystrophin deficiency may be affecting BDNF levels in striatum and contributing, in part, in memory storage and restoring.
