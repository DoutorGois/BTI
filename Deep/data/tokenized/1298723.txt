Eighteen fully kindled rabbits, whose epilepsy had been produced by intrahippocampal (i.h.) injections of 2 microliters of diluted solution containing 0.32 or 0.55 micrograms of coriaria lactone (CL), were separated into three groups. One of them was used as the control group. For seizure, all animals were given CL (0.6-1 micrograms/2 microliter i.h.). Ten minutes later, the verapamil (VR) group of six rabbits was treated with VR (1.5 or 2 mg/kg i.m. 2.5 or 5 micrograms/2 microliters i.h.); the normal saline (NS) group (six rabbits) received 0.8 ml/kg (i.m., in the same volume as that of the VR 2 mg/kg injection) or 2 microliters (i.h.) of NS; the control group of six received neither VR nor NS. The experiments were made once every eight days. Hippocampal EEGs of all animals were recorded by telemetric method and their behavior after injection was observed continuously in 4-7 hours. The results of the experiment indicated that the i.h. administration of 2.5 or 5 micrograms/2 microliters of VR is effective on hippocampal kindled seizures induced by CL in rabbits, but the curative effects of the i.m. administration of 1.5 or 2 mg/kg of VR were less notable than those of the i.h. administration.
