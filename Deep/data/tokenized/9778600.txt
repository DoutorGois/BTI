Actions of the new antiepileptic drug lamotrigine (LTG) were characterized using extracellular and whole cell patch clamp recordings from rat CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells in vitro. The results suggest that LTG, beside its previously described effect on the fast sodium inward current, also modulates - presumably voltage-gated - calcium currents and the transient potassium outward current ID. These may be effective mechanisms to inhibit pathological excitation in epilepsy and may be of potential benefit in treating underlying cellular disturbances in bipolar disorder.
