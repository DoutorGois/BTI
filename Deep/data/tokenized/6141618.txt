The effects of tranylcypromine (TCP) HCl (4 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg i.p.) and phenelzine (PLZ) sulfate (10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg) on levels of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) and normetanephrine (NM) in mesencephalon-pons, diencephalon, corpus striatum and hippocampus of rat brain were investigated. Effects of TCP on concentrations of DA and NA varied, depending on the brain area investigated and the dosage used. PLZ either had no effect or increased the concentration of DA and NA in the areas studied. Both drugs increased the concentrations of 3-MT and NM in areas where those metabolites could be measured. Both MAO inhibitors resulted in significant increases in 5-HT in all areas studied.
