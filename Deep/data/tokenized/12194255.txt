The generation of theta in the limbic cortex is a prime example of rhythmical activity involving central mechanisms of oscillations and synchrony. It was demonstrated that bath perfusion of hippocampal slices with carbachol resulted in theta-like oscillations. A number of our experiments have provided a strong evidence that theta-like activity recorded in vitro replicates pharmacological and physiological properties of in vivo recorded theta.
