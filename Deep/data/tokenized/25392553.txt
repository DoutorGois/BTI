A 7-year-old castrated border collie dog was anesthetised for surgical resection of a hippocampal mass. Anesthesia was maintained using a previously unreported TIVA protocol for craniectomy consisting of alfaxalone and remifentanil. Recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged from hospital. We describe the anesthetic management of this case.
