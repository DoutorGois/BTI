There is great interest in understanding the mechanisms of expression underlying long-term potentiation (LTP). They are agreed to involve an increase in synaptic efficacy, which is described by three multiplicative parameters: p, the probability of neurotransmitter release; n, the number of active release sites; and q, the postsynaptic unit response to transmitter release. We report three new lines of evidence suggesting that increases in p contribute to LTP expression. (i) When the contributions to LTP by p, n, and q are maximized, and p alone is decreased, another high-frequency stimulation elicits additional LTP. The additional potentiation is only associated with decreases in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) suggesting an increase in p. (ii) There is an inverse relationship between baseline p [corrected] and the magnitude of LTP elicited, consistent with p [corrected] having more or less room to increase when p is smaller or greater. (iii) It has been shown that there is an inverse relationship between the magnitude of LTP induced and the associated changes in PPF. Now I find that decreasing p before inducing LTP moves the set-point for measuring those changes in PPF from before to after p is decreased, which would only occur if p contributes to LTP. Three lines of evidence, then, suggest that increases in p contribute to LTP expression, which is consistent with a presynaptic contribution to LTP. These experiments do not address potential postsynaptic contributions.
