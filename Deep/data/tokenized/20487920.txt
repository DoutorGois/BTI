The saturable and specific high-affinity uptake of [(3)H]serotonin ([(3)H]5HT) (5 x 10(?8) M) was studied in slices from the hippocampus, parietal cortex, septum-preoptic area, and hypothalamus of male 2, 6, 12 and 24-32 month old C57BL/6N mice. Hippocampal [(3)H]5-HT uptake showed a significant biphasic relationship to age, with lower values in the 2 and 24-32 month old mice compared to 6 month old mice. No significant age effects were seen in the other regions, or in [(3)H]norepinephrine high-affinity uptake in the hippocampus. Studies of the high-affinity uptake mechanism in synaptosomal preparations were made in a subgroup of 12 and 24 month old mice. A micro-assay using a tissue-harvester measured high-affinity uptake on 8-30 ?l of the P(2) suspension (crude-synaptosomal preparation). The high-affinity uptake was linear for 4 min at 37 degrees C and inhibited in both the adult and aged tissue by 10(?5) M cold 5-HT (83 and 78% respectively), 10(?5) M fluoxetine (85 and 82% respectively) and 10(?3) M NaCN (57 and 57% respectively). Kinetic analysis of the [(3)H]5HT high-affinity uptake in the hippocampus (3 min, 37 degrees C) revealed the same apparent K(m) for serotonin at both ages (6.7 x 10(?8) M), but a 44% decrease in V(max) in the aged hippocampal synaptosomal high-affinity uptake compared to adults (120 vs 215 pmol of 5-HT/g-tissue/3 min). These results are discussed in relationship to the reported age effects on the intrinsic neurons of the hippocampus.
