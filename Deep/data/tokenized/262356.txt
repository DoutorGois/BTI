Tactile perception and memory in epileptics with temporal EEG focus is studied. Out of a total of 24 patients: 12 had right and 12 had left EEG focus. All patients are severe epileptics, not controlled by medical therapy. The Milner and Taylor Model used in a study carried out in commissurotomized patients was followed. We arrived to the following conclusions: There exist disturbances of tactile memory in patients with temporal EEG focus. There is a learning capacity indicating at least a relative conservation of the intellectual capacity. Differences between patients with right and left EEG temporal focus have not been found in this group. Milner and Taylor suggest the normal participation of both hemispheres in this type of task, and that the left hemisphere would add some identifiable and memorable verbal element.
