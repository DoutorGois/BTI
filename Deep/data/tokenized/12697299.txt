Homocystinuria is an inherited metabolic disease biochemically characterized by tissue accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy). Mental retardation, ischemia and other neurological features, whose mechanisms are still obscure are common symptoms in homocystinuric patients. In this work, we investigated the effect of Hcy administration in Wistar rats on some parameters of energy metabolism in the hippocampus, a cerebral structure directly involved with cognition. The parameters utilized were 14CO2 production, glucose uptake, lactate release and the activities of succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Chronic hyperhomocysteinemia was induced by subcutaneous administration of Hcy twice a day from the 6th to the 28th day of life in doses previously determined in our laboratory. Control rats received saline in the same volumes. Rats were killed 12 h after the last injection. Results showed that Hcy administration significantly diminished 14CO2 production and glucose uptake, as well as succinate dehydrogenase and COX activities. It is suggested that impairment of brain energy metabolism may be related to the neurological symptoms present in homocystinuric patients.
