Alongside GABA, glycine is the major inhibitory transmitter in the central nervous system. Application of the glycine receptor blocker strychnine is known to evoke epileptiform phenomena. The present paper addresses the question whether postsynaptic calcium currents through L-type channels contribute to strychnine-induced epileptiform field potentials (EFP). To test for this, the antiepileptic effect of the specific L-type calcium channel blocker, verapamil, in hippocampal and neocortical slices was investigated. In parallel with this, the antiepileptic efficacy of the unspecific calcium channel modulator, flunarizine, was tested with respect to pharmacotherapy of epilepsies. In both preparations, the L-type calcium channel blocker, verapamil, was able to suppress EFP. In neocortical slices, EFP were blocked in all experiments, whereas in hippocampal slices, in 3 out of 11 experiments, no complete suppression occurred. Flunarizine acted in a similar way. It is concluded that L-type calcium channels are involved in strychnine-induced epilepsy, but to a greater extent in the neocortex than in the hippocampus.
