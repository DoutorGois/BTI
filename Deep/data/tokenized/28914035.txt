This paper was aimed to investigate the impact of the extraction from raspberry on the Alzheimer disease model protein expression. According to weight, the ovariectomized mice were randomly divided into shame operation group, model group, estrogen positive control group(0.1 g*L(-)(1)) and ethyl acetate extraction part control group(in dose of 18 g*kg(-)(1)). Each mouse in positive control group was subcutaneous injected of estradiol with 0.2 mL every two days. Raspberry effective parts group were given 0.01 mL*g(-)(1) raspberry ethylacetate extracts, model group and control group were given 0.01 mL*g(-)(1) saline once a day. The drug administration lasted for 32 days. Proteins from mice's hippocampus were extracted, then Nanol-ESI liquid-mass spectrometry system was used for detection and ProteinDiscovery software was used for identification to qualitative analysis different groups of hippocampal proteins by using the software of SIEVE. The results showed that model group compared with the mice of ethyl acetate extraction part control group have 66 differentially expressed proteins including heat shock protein, microtubule protein, protein involved in energy metabolism and protein of brain protection related proteins associated with AD. Those differences protein may be the target that Raspberry prevention and treatment of AD.
