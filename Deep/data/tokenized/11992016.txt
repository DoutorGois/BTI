Exposures to uncontrollable stress have been shown to alter ensuing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and interfere with hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in rats. The present study examined whether stress, which impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), also affects (nonspatial) hippocampal-dependent object-recognition memory, as tested on the visual paired comparison task (VPC) in rats. After undergoing an inescapable restraint-tailshock stress experience, rats exhibited markedly impaired recognition memory at the 3-h (long) familiarization-to-test phase delay but not at the 5-min (short) delay. In contrast, unstressed control animals showed robust recognition memory (i.e., they exhibited reliable preferences for novel over familiar objects) at both short- and long-delay periods. The impairing effect of stress on long-delay recognition memory was transient because 48 h after undergoing stress experience, animals performed normally at the long delay. Similar to stress, microinfusions of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that blocks LTP, into the dorsal hippocampus selectively impaired object-recognition memory at the long-delay period. Together, these results suggest that stress and intrahippocampal administration of APV affect recognition memory by influencing synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.
