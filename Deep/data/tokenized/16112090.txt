We examined the effect of the molarless condition on the dendritic spines of hippocampal pyramidal cells in SAMP8 mice in comparison to its effect on learning ability in a maze test. The molarless condition caused a decrease in the number of the spines of CA1 pyramidal cells only in the aged mice showing a reduced learning ability. The results suggest the involvement of the molarless condition in an attenuation of input activities in the hippocampal synapses.
