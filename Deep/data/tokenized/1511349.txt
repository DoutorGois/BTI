Nerve growth factor (NGF) was injected intraventricularly into aged (24 months) rats with unilateral fimbria transection. Controls received intraventricular injections of cytochrome c. A quantitative analysis of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive fibers was used to evaluate whether the NGF treatment can stimulate regeneration and reinnervation of the cholinergic axons in the septohippocampal system of aged rats with fimbria transection. A marked increase in the density of AChE-positive fibers was observed in the lateral septum, the dorsal fornix and the dorsal hippocampus of the NGF-treated animals, as compared to the controls. In the lateral septum, the increase was observed in the 2-month NGF-treated animals but not in the 15-day NGF-treated animals. In the dorsal fornix at the level of the dorsal hippocampus, the increase was observed on both the lesioned and unlesioned sides of both the 15-day and 2-month NGF-treated animals. In the denervated (lesioned side) hippocampus, the increase took place in the dorsal hippocampus but not in the ventral hippocampus of both the 15-day and 2-month NGF-treated animals. There was no recovery of AChE-positive fibers on the lesioned side of the fimbria distal to the lesion site even in the 2-month NGF-treated animals. These results demonstrate that intraventricular injections of NGF can stimulate collateral sprouting of intact cholinergic axons in the septohippocampal system and promote cholinergic reinnervation of the denervated hippocampus of aged rats with fimbria transection.
