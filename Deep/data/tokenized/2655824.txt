This study was designed to determine if dizocilipine maleate (MK-801), administered following 11 min of complete ischemia in dogs, could favorably alter neurologic outcome and hippocampal damage. Eighteen dogs were anesthetized and subjected to complete cerebral ischemia by temporary occlusion of the ascending aorta and the venae cavae via a thoracotomy. Five min postischemia, 9 dogs were given dizocilipine 150 micrograms/kg, followed by an infusion of 1.25 microgram/kg/min for 8 h. Control dogs were given equal volumes of placebo. Dogs were evaluated neurologically at 24, 48, and 72 h; thereafter, the brains were perfused, fixed and harvested. There was no significant difference in outcome between dizocilipine- and placebo-treated dogs: 5 of 9 given dizocilipine were normal, 1 was mildly injured and 3 were severely injured or dead. In the control animals given placebo, 3 of 9 were normal, 2 were mildly injured and 4 were moderately to severely injured. Histopathologic examination was limited to the hippocampus. CA1 and CA2,3,4 pyramidal neurons were graded according to degree of injury on a 5-point scale. There were no differences in histopathologic grades between the two groups. However, in both groups combined there was a significant correlation between neurologic outcome grade and histopathologic grade. The only notable systemic effect of dizocilipine appeared to be prolonged sedation which extended beyond 24 h postischemia but was not evident at 48 h postischemia. The authors conclude that more outcome studies in more sensitive models are needed.
