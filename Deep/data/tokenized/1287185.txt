Release of endogenous taurine by electrical stimulation of slices of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and medulla oblongata of the rat was studied and compared with that of alanine and/or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Electrical stimulation caused a calcium-dependent release of taurine from slices of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum but not from slices of the medulla oblongata. The stimulus-evoked release of taurine in the hippocampus was rapid in onset and declined to baseline fast, which was essentially similar to the time course pattern of the stimulus-evoked release of GABA. In addition, there were distinct regional differences in the relative amounts of taurine released. Electrical stimulation did not release alanine from any regions examined. These results support the hypothesis that taurine plays a neurotransmitter role in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex and cerebellum of the rat.
