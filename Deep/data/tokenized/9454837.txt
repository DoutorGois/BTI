Recent work has shown that D1/D5 dopamine receptors can enhance long-term potentiation (LTP). We investigated whether D1/D5 receptors also affect depotentiation, the reversal of LTP by low-frequency stimulation. D1/D5 agonists greatly reduced depotentiation, an effect that was inhibited by a D1/D5 antagonist. The D1/D5 effect appears to be mediated by adenylyl cyclase (AC) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), because it was mimicked by the AC activator forskolin and was inhibited by the AC and PKA inhibitors. In vivo studies show that dopamine is released when a reward occurs. Our results raise the possibility that the memory of events before reward might be retained selectively, because dopamine blocks their erasure.
