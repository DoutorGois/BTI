The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible neuroprotective effects of thymosin beta(4) in different models of excitotoxicity. The application of thymosin beta(4) significantly attenuated glutamate-induced toxicity both in primary cultures of cortical neurons and in rat hippocampal slices. In in vivo experiments, the intracerebroventricular administration of thymosin beta(4) significantly reduced hippocampal neuronal loss induced by kainic acid. These results show that thymosin beta(4) induced a protective effect in models of excitotoxicity. The mechanisms underlying such an effect, as well as the real neuroprotective potential of thymosin beta(4), are worthy of further investigations.
