A phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has been known to play multiple biological roles. However, role of PTEN in astrocyte activation is not clear yet. In the present study, the expression pattern of PTEN in the process of reactive gliosis was immunohistochemically examined in intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injected kainic acid mouse hippocampus. Mice were grouped into three; 30 min, 1 day and 7 days after kainic acid i.c.v. injection. Thirty minutes after kainic acid i.c.v. injection, astrocytes were activated and PTEN was weakly expressed in immature astrocytes. Seven days after kainic acid i.c.v. injection, PTEN expression was decreased in highly activated astrocytes showing extensively spindled shape. Immunofluorescence double labeling experiment showed that PTEN was expressed in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive astrocytes. These findings suggest that PTEN might have a role in early stage of reactive astrogliosis in vivo.
