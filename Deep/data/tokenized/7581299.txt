To improve our understanding of the mechanisms which regulate the formation and the functional maturation of synaptic contacts between neurons, we used hippocampal neurons maintained in primary cultures as experimental system. In this model, which offers several advantages for the study of neuronal development and synaptogenesis, we investigated some of the cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments.
