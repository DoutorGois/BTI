The effects of the polyamines, spermine, spermidine and putrescine, on long-term potentiation (LTP) of evoked potential were investigated in the dentate gyrus of anesthetized rats. Injection of 5 nmol spermine into the lateral ventricle did not influence the basal amplitude of the population spike, but significantly enhanced the potentiation induced by subthreshold tetanic stimulation (20 pulses at 60 Hz). The effect of spermine resulted in facilitation of LTP generation. Injection of the same dose of spermidine or putrescine affected neither the basal response nor the potentiation induced by subthreshold tetanus at all, indicating that the LTP-facilitating effect is specific to spermine. Furthermore, the LTP-facilitating effect of spermine was dose-dependent in the range of 0.5-50 nmol. When 5 nmol ifenprodil, an antagonist at the polyamine site of the NMDA receptor channel complex, was concomitantly injected, spermine could not facilitate the generation of LTP. Since injection of ifenprodil alone did not influence the generation of LTP, it is probable that ifenprodil specifically blocks the effect of spermine. These results suggest that spermine facilitates the generation of hippocampal LTP, probably through an ifenprodil-sensitive polyamine site associated with the NMDA receptor.
