We investigated whether mild hypothermia combined with sodium hydrosulfide treatment during resuscitation improves neuron survival following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury beyond that observed for the individual treatments. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven groups (n = 20 for each group). All rats underwent Pulsinelli 4-vessel occlusion. Ischemia was induced for 15 min using ligatures around the common carotid arteries, except for the sham group. Immediately after initiating reperfusion, the mild hypothermia (MH), sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), hydroxylamine (HA), MH + NaHS, MH + HA, and ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) control groups received an intraperitoneal injection of saline, sodium hydrosulfide, hydroxylamine, sodium hydrosulfide, hydroxylamine, and saline, respectively, and mild hypothermia (32 to 33 degrees C) was induced in the MH, MH + NaHS, and MH + HA groups for 6 h. The levels of NR2A, NR2B, p-Akt, and p-Gsk-3beta in the hippocampus of the MH, NaHS, and MH + NaHS groups were higher than those in the I/R control group, with the highest levels observed in the MH + NaHS group (P < 0.05). Treatment with hydroxylamine reduced the levels of these proteins in the HA and MH + HA groups, compared with the I/R control and MH groups, respectively. The apoptotic index of the CA1 region of the hippocampus was 45.2, 66.5, 63.5, and 84.8 % in the MH + NaHS, MH, NaHS, and I/R control groups, respectively (P < 0.05), indicating that the combination treatment shifted the NR2A/NR2B balance in favor of synaptic neuron stimulation and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling. The combination of mild hypothermia and sodium hydrosulfide treatment for resuscitation following ischemia-reperfusion injury was more beneficial for reducing hippocampal apoptosis and pathology than that of mild hypothermia or hydrogen sulfide treatment alone.
