The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is involved in the modulation of the cardiac baroreflex function. There is a wide expression of the NMDA and AMPA/Kainate receptors within the DH. Glutamate administration into the DH triggers both tachycardia and pressor responses. Moreover, GABAergic interneurons and endocannabinoid system play an important role in modulation of the activity of glutamatergic neurons within the DH. Therefore, the present work aimed to evaluate the involvement of the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and endocannabinoid neurotransmissions within the DH in cardiac baroreflex function in rats. We have used the technique of vasoactive drugs infusion to build both sigmoidal curves and linear regressions to analyze the cardiac baroreflex function. Bilateral injection into the DH of DL-AP7, a NMDA receptor antagonist (10 or 50 nmol/500 nL), or NBQX, an AMPA/Kainate antagonist (100 nmol/ 500 nL), reduced the cardiac baroreflex function. On the other hand, bilateral injection of Bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist (1 nmol/500 nL), or AM251, a CB1 receptor antagonist (10 or 100 pmol/500 nL), increased the cardiac baroreflex function. Furthermore, 1 nmol/500 nL of the NMDA receptor antagonist, when administrated alone, was ineffective to change baroreflex function, but it was able to inhibit the alteration in the cardiac baroreflex function elicited by the dose of 100 pmol/500 nL of the CB1 receptor antagonist. Taken together, these findings suggest that glutamatergic, GABAergic, and endocannabinoid neurotransmissions interact each other within the DH to modulate the cardiac baroreflex function.
