A study was made of the influence of ablation of the entorhinal cortex on conditioned reflexes to present and trace stimuli. Ablation resulted in a long-lasting and considerable disturbance of differentiation of time macrointervals. After the operation, elaboration or restoration of the conditioned reflex to time was delayed five or six times as compared with intact animals. There was no change in the state of motor alimentary conditioned reflex to different (single or complex) present stimuli regardless of whether the ablation was performed after or before the elaboration of conditioned reflexes. Similar results were obtained in animals of different phylogenetic groups (rats and dogs).
