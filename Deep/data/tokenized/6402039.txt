Experiments on rats with electrochemotrodes implanted in the left and right hippocamp have shown that in epileptogenic foci created by microinjections of met-enkephalin or D-ala-2-met-enkephalin into the hippocamp, acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) was diminished. It is assumed that reduction in AChE activity is an adaptive mechanism by which the excitability of hippocampal inhibitory basket cells, which are sensitive to acetylcholine, is increased.
