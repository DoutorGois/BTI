Ancient DNA technique was used to extract DNA from 5 species of Chinese traditional drugs Hippocampus. The 12S rRNA gene fragment and cytochrome b gene fragment were amplified from DNA extract using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and DNA sequence analysis were performed. The RFLP analysis method can identify 2 species of Hippocampus. The molecular genetic markers produced by DNA sequence method can identify all 5 species of Hippocampus. This method will be valuable for the identification of other animal drugs.
