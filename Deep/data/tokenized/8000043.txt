Chronic alcoholization by ethyl-alcohol inhalation was used to study the properties of a spin-trapping agent on different alcohol manifestations in rat. The spin-trapping agent, i.e. N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN), was given at the dose of 32 mg/kg twice a day during the whole alcoholization procedure. The blood alcohol level, the hypermotility which accompanied the ethanol withdrawal, the behavioral dependence as estimated by a free-choice program and the hypervascularization which is developed after a chronic pulmonary alcoholization were quantified. The rats treated with PBN differ from the control rats only by their higher blood alcohol level at the end of the chronic alcoholization while the other quantified alcohol-induced manifestations remained unchanged.
