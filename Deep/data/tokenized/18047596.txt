The mechanisms of memory delineated by the model of long-term potentiation (LTP) are similar to those underlying epileptogenesis by kindling. Memory is impaired by seizures and epilepsy. High frequency neural activity is important in both memory formation and seizures. Both kindling and LTP are most effectively induced by high-frequency stimuli, involve synaptic facilitation, and share overlapping molecular mechanisms, such as N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-induced calcium cascade and protein synthesis. The hippocampus contributes to both through its role in memory formation and its low seizure threshold.
