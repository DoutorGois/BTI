We have previously demonstrated that hypothalmic slices obtained from adult male rats accumulate 67Cu by two ligand-dependent, saturable processes: a high and low affinity process. To further establish the generality of these uptake processes, we defined the ligand requirements and the saturation kinetics of 67Cu uptake by tissue slices obtained from the newborn hypothalamus (HT); adult male hypothalamus, hippocampus, cortex, median eminence, and caudate nucleus; hypothalamus and hippocampus of castrated (14 days) males and of pregnant (19 days) and ovariectomized (14 days) females. It was found that ionic 67Cu2+ was poorly taken up by newborn HT and adult caudate, complexation with His enhanced 67Cu uptake 3-4-fold, and complexation with albumin inhibited 67Cu uptake. These ligand requirements are identical to those we have previously shown for the adult HT. When 67Cu uptake was evaluated under conditions optimal for the high or the low affinity process, for each process the dose response curves generated from these various tissues were very similar. In addition, we assessed the uptake of both components of the CuHis2 complex by incubating tissues with 67Cu3 H-His2 and found that the tissue ratio of 67Cu:3H was a sigmoidal function of the concentration of the Cu complex such that at greater than 5 microM, the ratio was about 3-fold greater than the medium ratio; indicating preferential uptake of 67Cu relative to 3H-His. The changes in isotope ratios were observed in newborn HT and adult HT, as well as caudate. These similarities in the ligand requirements and saturation kinetics of 67Cu uptake establish the generality of these two processes of in vitro uptake of copper in the rat brain.
