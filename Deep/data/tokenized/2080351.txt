Electrode grids were implanted subdurally in 28 patients with epilepsy. In 16 of the 28 patients, an epileptogenic area was located in the speech-dominant left temporal lobe. Recordings made with the grid revealed that the epileptogenic areas in the patients varied widely in extent: the area was confined within the first 10 mm of the temporal lobe in some patients or it was scattered throughout the entire anterior to posterior 80-mm extend in others. Resection of the epileptogenic area was adjusted accordingly in each case. In 6 of 16 patients who were left-hemisphere-dominant for language, up to 55-80 mm from the tip of the temporal lobe was removed, a measure that exceeds the conventional limit of 50 mm from the tip of the dominant hemisphere. In the remaining 12 of the 28 patients, epileptogenic areas were located in a combination of several lobes. In 7 of these 12 patients, the epileptogenic area encompassed the rolandic area; it was removed without deficit in 4 patients and with expected deficit in 3. Of the latter 3 patients, 1 patient underwent hemispherectomy, and a large portion of the epileptogenic rolandic cortex in the frontal and parietal lobes was removed from the other 2. There were 2 cases of grid-related infection, which cleared with antibiotic treatment; there were no lasting complications of grid implantation in any patient. There was no mortality. Electroencephalographic recording and functional mapping using subdural electrode grids allow a tailored, maximal resection of epileptogenic tissue with minimal injury to critical cortex.
