Previously, we found that aged rats showed a significant enhancement of hippocampal CA1 place cell spatial specificity, as well as a reduction of hilar place cell spatial specificity, during asymptote performance of a spatial memory task. Because such an age effect was not observed when animals performed a nonspatial task, the present study tested the hypothesis that the different patterns of spatial selectivity observed in memory and nonmemory tests reflected a redistribution of spatial representations that occurred in response to changing task demands. In the present experiment, after animals became familiar with the test environment and motor demands of performance on a radial maze, CA1 and hilar place cells were recorded as they learned a spatial memory task. CA1 place cells recorded from unimpaired old, but not impaired old or young, animals became more spatially selective as animals learned the task. Hilar spatial selectivity for both age groups was not significantly related to choice accuracy. These data support the hypothesis that at least a subpopulation of aged rats may benefit from reorganization of spatial representations in such a way that the normal age-related spatial learning deficit is attenuated.
