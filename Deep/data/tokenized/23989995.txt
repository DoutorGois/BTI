BACKGROUND: Surgery is superior over medicamentous treatment of pharmacoresistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy caused by hippocampal sclerosis. The armamentarium of surgical procedures comprises standard temporal lobectomy and more selective procedures. Selective amygdalohippocampectomy can be performed via transcortical, transsylvian or subtemporal approach. METHOD: Describe the selective amygdalohippocampectomy through the subtemporal approach CONCLUSION: After the detailed preoperative epilepsy evaluation, surgery can be offered to pharmacoresistant epilepsy patient with hippocampal sclerosis. Selective amygdalohippocampectomy can be safely performed through the subtemporal approach. The good knowledge of the mesial temporal lobe anatomy is necessary when performing this procedure.
