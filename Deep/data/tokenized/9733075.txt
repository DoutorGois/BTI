Seasonal changes in vertebrate brain function are pervasive, but annual cycles in the rates of neuronal incorporation are established only in songbirds. Although cell division continues in the subependymal and hippocampal subgranular zones of adult rodents, there exists no parallel evidence that seasonal plasticity in mammals extends to changes in neuronal or glial number. We examined the effect of photoperiod on incorporation of new neurons in the brain of the adult golden hamster, a long-day breeder. We administered the cell birth marker 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to males which had either been maintained in long days, transferred to short days for 10 weeks, or moved acutely from long to short or short to long days. The number of cells in specific brain regions immunoreactive (ir) for this thymidine analog was determined 7 weeks later. The number of BrdU-ir cells in the dentate gyrus and subependymal zone increased twofold in short days. Transfer between photoperiods 10 days before the BrdU injections produced intermediate numbers of BrdU-labeled cells in the dentate gyrus, but was as effective as long-term photoperiodic exposure in the subependymal zone. Photoperiod also had similar effects in the hypothalamus and cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, but not in the central gray or preoptic area. Double-label immunocytochemistry indicated that very few of the BrdU-ir cells were glia, but that a majority had neuronal phenotype. In the subependymal zone, short days significantly increased the number of BrdU-labeled neurons. We did not detect significant effects of photoperiod on the volume of either the granule cell layer of the hippocampus or the dentate gyrus as a whole. We conclude that short day lengths increase neuronal birth and/or survival in several brain regions of adult hamsters.
