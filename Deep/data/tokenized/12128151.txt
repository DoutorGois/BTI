Hippocampal theta activity accompanies behaviours such as running, swimming, head movements and spatially orientated responses in the rat. However, whether a relationship between this activity and information processing exists remains unclear. As place-learning depends on hippocampal integrity, whereas cue-learning does not, the hippocampal theta activity underlying each test was evaluated. Local CA1 hippocampal electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded over 6 days in a Morris maze for one place-learning test group of rats (n=10) and one cue-learning test group (n=8). The EEG of the corresponding test was taken during waking immobile, searching, and on-platform stages. The relative power (RP) values of EEGs were divided into 4-6.5Hz, 6.5-9.5Hz, and 9.5-12Hz frequency sub-bands. The place-learning training produced a separation of 4-6.5Hz and 6.5-9.5Hz sub-bands in searching and platform stages and a higher activity on the 6.5-9.5Hz sub-band during searching, compared with the basal record, while the cue-learning group did not show differences related either to the training or behavioural stage. As the motor activity and swimming velocity was similar in both groups, the results strongly suggest that the changes observed in theta activity reflect information processing by the hippocampus.
