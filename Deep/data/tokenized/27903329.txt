OBJECTIVES: Relatively few studies have investigated relationships between performance on clinical memory measures and indexes of underlying neuropathology related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigated predictive relationships between Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) cue efficiency (CE) and free-recall (FR) measures and brain amyloid levels, hippocampal volume (HV), and regional cortical thickness. METHODS: Thirty-one older controls without memory complaints and 60 patients presenting memory complaints underwent the FCSRT, amyloid imaging using [F18]-flutemetamol positron emission tomography, and surface-based morphometry (SBM) using brain magnetic resonance imaging. Three groups were considered: patients with high (Abeta+P) and low (Abeta- P) amyloid load and controls with low amyloid load (Abeta- C). RESULTS: Abeta+P showed lower CE than both Abeta- groups, but the Abeta- groups did not differ significantly. In contrast, FR discriminated all groups. SBM analyses revealed that CE indexes were correlated with the cortical thickness of a wider set of left-lateralized temporal and parietal regions than FR. Regression analyses demonstrated that amyloid load and left HV independently predicted FCSRT scores. Moreover, CE indexes were predicted by the cortical thickness of some regions involved in early AD, such as the entorhinal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to FR measures, CE indexes appear to be more specific for differentiating persons on the basis of amyloid load. Both CE and FR performance were predicted independently by brain amyloid load and reduced left HV. However, CE performance was also predicted by the cortical thickness of regions known to be atrophic early in AD. (JINS, 2016, 22, 991-1004).
