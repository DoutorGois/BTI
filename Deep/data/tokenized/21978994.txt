Synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease brains is thought to involve soluble Abeta42 peptide. Here, sterile incubation in PBS caused small Abeta42 oligomer formation as well as heterogeneous, 6E10-immunopositive aggregates of 80-100kDa. The high molecular weight aggregates (H-agg) formed in a time-dependent manner over an extended 30-day period. Interestingly, an inverse relationship between dimeric and H-agg formation was more evident when incubations were performed at 37 degrees C as compared to 23 degrees C, thus providing an experimental strategy with which to address synaptic compromise produced by the different Abeta aggregates. H-agg species formed faster and to higher levels at 37 degrees C compared to 23 degrees C, and the two aggregate preparations were evaluated in hippocampal slice cultures, a sensitive system for monitoring synaptic integrity. Applied daily at 80-600nM for 7days, the Abeta42 preparations caused dose-dependent and aggregation-dependent declines in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits as well as in presynaptic components. Unlike the synaptic effects, Abeta42 induced only trace cellular degeneration that was CA1 specific. The 37 degrees C preparation was less effective at decreasing synaptic markers, corresponding with its reduced levels of Abeta42 monomers and dimers. Abeta42 dimers decayed significantly faster at 37 degrees C than 23 degrees C, and more rapidly than monomers at either temperature. These findings indicate that Abeta42 can self-aggregate into potent synaptotoxic oligomers as well as into larger aggregates that may serve to neutralize the toxic formations. These results will add to the growing debate concerning whether high molecular weight Abeta complexes that form amyloid plaques are protective through the sequestration of oligomeric species.
