We examined the effects of generalized seizures on heat shock protein (hsp) mRNA induction in the rat brain using in situ hybridization. Seizures induced by electroconvulsive shock, electrical or cocaine kindling caused a selective induction of the constitutive hsp 73 gene in the dentate gyrus. In these seizure paradigms, not thought to induce widespread tissue damage, neither the heat-inducible hsp 72 gene nor a member of the hsp 90 family (hsp 84) were induced. Hsp 73 may play a role in the adaptation and/or in the maintenance of dentate granule cell integrity following seizures.
