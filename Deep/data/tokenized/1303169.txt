The cellular localization of the nerve growth factor-like immunoreactivity (NGF-LIR) has been studied in the septum and hippocampus of the rat brain 7 days following partial electrolytic lesion (2 mA, 30 s) of the septohippocampal pathways or after single intraventricular administration of 15 U of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). A double immunostaining technique which allowed a simultaneous localization of NGF-LIR and that of astroglia marker glial fibrillary acidic protein was used. Our data show that after both treatments, apart from neuronal localization of NGF-LIR typical for normal brain, many astrocytes both in the septum and hippocampus became NGF-like immunoreactive. Besides, NGF-LIR often formed a "halo" reaction around astrocytes. These results support the notion that activated in vivo brain astrocytes may, just as astrocytes growing in vitro, synthesize and secrete NGF-like molecules. Our findings may be of importance in considerations concerning trophic support to the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain nuclei whose impaired function is essentially responsible for some cognitive deficits in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease.
