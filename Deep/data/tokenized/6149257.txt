Kindling is an animal model of epilepsy. Previously somatostatin (SRIF) was implicated in seizure activity in the brain. Recently we reported a significant increase in brain SRIF content in the temporal cortices and cortices of kindled rats. Since the interaction between the neurotransmitter and the receptor eventually is responsible for the biological response, the present study was undertaken to examine evidence for the participation of SRIF receptor in the kindled state. In this study we present a procedure for detection of SRIF receptors using radiolabeled (D-Tyr8)-SRIF as a tracer. The present study indicates that in kindled rats there are no differences in the total number or affinity of the binding sites in the temporal cortex and a slight increase in the total number of binding sites in the cortex when compared with controls. These results, in view of our other observations, suggest that in kindled rat brain there may be an increased release of SRIF but no down-regulation of SRIF receptors in temporal cortex and cortex. There appears to be a significant decrease in the number of SRIF receptors in kindled hippocampus. The mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear.
