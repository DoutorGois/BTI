OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of psychological factor on asthma, the protective and therapeutic effects of Shugan Lifei Recipe on rats with asthma under stress and the mechanisms. METHODS: Allergy and stress-induced asthma models were established in rats by giving ovalbumin and restraining stress. Radioimmunoassay, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical method were used to detect plasma corticosterone, IL-4, IFN-gamma, expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA in hippocampus and adrenocorticotropic hormone corticoliberin (CRH) positive neuron in hypothalamus. Optical and electron microscopes were used to observe the morphological changes of pulmonary hilar and hippocampal tissues. RESULTS: Shugan Lifei Recipe (SGLFR) could reduce plasma corticosterone, decrease CRH positive neurons in paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, up-regulate the expression of GR mRNA in hippocampus and reduce the injury of hippocampal neuron. SGLFR had certain inhibitive effect on hyperfunction of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal cortex (HPA) axis in rats with asthma under stress and could also relieve the pathological changes of the pulmonary hilar tissue. The level of plasma IFN-gamma was increased while the level of plasma IL-4 was decreased in SGLFR-treated group. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of SGLFR in treating the rats with asthma under stress is probably to regulate the hyperfunction of HPA axis and the disorder of immuo-system.
