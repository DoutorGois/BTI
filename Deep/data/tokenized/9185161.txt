The levels of dynorphin A-like immunoreactivity (Dyn A-LI) and dynorphin B-like immunoreactivity (Dyn B-LI) were determined in various regions of brain, spinal cord and pituitary gland in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) as compared with the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs). SHRs had significantly lower levels of Dyn A-LI and Dyn B-LI in the neurointermediate pituitary lobe and in the hippocampus. Conversely, the levels of Dyn A-LI and Dyn B-LI were higher in the hypothalamus, striatum and periaqueductal gray of the SHRs.
