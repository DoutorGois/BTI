After pargyline treatment the turnover rates of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-3-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) has been measured in control and aged hippocampus of the rats. In addition, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and monoamine oxidase-A and monoamine oxidase-B activities have also been studied. The TH activity did not change in aged hippocampus as compared to controls. The monoamine oxidase-B: monoamine oxidase-A ratio increased in 26-month-old rats compared with controls. The turnover of DA, DOPAC and NA did not show significant changes while 5-HT synthesis, 5-HT accumulation rate and 5-HIAA turnover increased in aged rats. Serotonin fibers showed morphological dissimilarities between the hippocampus of young and aged rats using immunocytochemistry techniques. In aged rats aberrant serotoninergic fibers mainly appear in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and molecular of the hippocampal CA1. It is suggested that the aberrant morphology of 5-HT fibers may reflect the local degeneration of serotoninergic hippocampal afferents during aging. Increase of 5-HT turnover in aged might be a signal of degeneration.
