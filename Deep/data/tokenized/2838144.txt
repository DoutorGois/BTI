The [125I]iodotyrosyl derivative of atrial natriuretic factor [( 125I])ANF) apparently binds to a single class of high affinity sites in guinea pig brain membrane preparations. Ligand selectivity pattern reveals that the structural requirements of brain [125I]ANF binding sites are similar to those reported in most peripheral tissues. In vitro receptor autoradiographic studies demonstrate that the brain distribution of [125I]ANF binding sites is species dependent. In rat, high levels of binding are found in olfactory bulb, subfornical organ, area postrema, choroid plexus, and ependyma. In guinea pig, these regions are also enriched with [125I]ANF binding in addition to various thalamic nucleic, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum. In monkey, high densities of sites are seen in the cerebellar cortex. This suggests that brain ANF receptor sites could mediate ANF effects related to the central integration of cardiovascular parameters, as well as other actions not associated with these systems. As in the periphery, it appears that brain [125I]ANF binding sites are associated with guanylate cyclase. Moreover, the density of [125I]ANF receptor binding sites is altered in certain brain regions in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in cardiomyopathic hamsters, demonstrating the plasticity of brain ANF receptors. Thus, ANF and ANF receptors are complementary facets of a new neurotransmitter-neuromodulator system present in mammalian brain.
