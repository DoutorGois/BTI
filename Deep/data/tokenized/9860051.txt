The effect of ad libitum oral-administration of (-)catechin solution on ischemia-reperfusion-induced cell death of hippocampal CA1 in the gerbil was histologically examined. When (-)catechin solution instead of drinking water was orally administered ad libitum for 2 weeks, dose-dependent protection against neuronal death following by transient ischemia and reperfusion was observed. To evaluate the involvement of reduction of reactive-oxygen-species (ROIs) by the antioxidant activity of (-)catechin in this protection, the superoxide scavenging activity of the brain in catechin-treated gerbils was measured by ESR and spin-trapping using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO). The superoxide scavenging activities of the brains obtained from catechin-treated gerbils were significantly higher than those of catechin-untreated animals. From these results, it was suggested that orally administered (-)catechin was absorbed, passed through the blood-brain barrier and that delayed neuronal death of hippocampal CA1 after ischemia-reperfusion was prevented due to its antioxidant activities.
