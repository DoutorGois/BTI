General principles of intracerebral grafting are presented in overview. The development and use of the dissociated neuronal cell suspension method are described as a new method for neural transplantation. Experiments are described involving fetal dopamine cells transplanted to adult striatum and fetal cholinergic cells transplanted to the hippocampal formation, as primary examples. The main focus of this review is related to results of cell survival and axonal elongation.
