Neuronal loss and gliosis were detected in the rat hippocampus soon after unilateral intra-amygdala injection of kainate (KA) (2.5 nmol) while solid mossy fiber sprouting could be seen only fourteen days after this injection. Using this experimental model, we examined the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-induced inositol phosphate (IP) formation in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes and slices. In synaptoneurosomes prepared from ipsilateral hippocampi fourteen days following injection, there were no significant changes in mGluR- and carbachol(CARB)-stimulated IPs syntheses when sham-operated and KA-injected animals were compared. In the corresponding hippocampal slices, significant increases of the mGluR responses mediated by ibotenate (IBO) and aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylate (t-ACPD) were noted after KA application. The net stimulation values respectively expressed in a pair-wise fashion for buffer-injected control and KA-treated animals were IBO: 1,947 +/- 457 and 10,553 +/- 1,242; t-ACPD: 1,557 +/- 662 and 9,449 +/- 2,251 dpm/mg protein respectively. Significantly augmented mGluR responses in hippocampal slices were also measured at 7, 42 and 92 days after KA injection. There were, however, no significant increases in CARB-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the hippocampal slices at all time-intervals after KA administration. These findings show that there are differences between the mGluR responses in hippocampal synaptoneurosome and slice preparations, suggesting the presence of two distinct populations of mGluR in each of these two models. The large specific increases in certain mGluR activities after KA-induced status epilepticus in hippocampal slices could represent one of the molecular mechanisms which underlie the profound morphological changes, in particular gliosis or mossy fiber sprouting, which follow the KA-induced status epilepticus.
