The distribution of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was studied in the hippocampal formation of the Old World (Macaca fascicularis) and New World (Saimiri sciureus) monkeys. Series of coronal sections were processed by the unlabeled second antiserum method using primary antisera which recognize somatostatin-28 (S309) or somatostatin-28(1-12) (S320). Neuronal cell bodies were more readily stained with antiserum S309 and were observed throughout the hippocampal formation. The most prominent accumulations of stained neurons occur in the hilar region of the dentate gyrus, in strata oriens and pyramidale of regio inferior of the hippocampus, and in the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. Both antisera demonstrated extensive fiber systems which varied in density regionally in the hippocampal formation. Stained fibers were most prominent in the outer two-thirds of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus, in layer I of the presubiculum and in layers I, III, and V of the entorhinal cortex.
