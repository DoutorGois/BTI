The synthesis of [3H]acetylcholine in brain slices from adult and newborn guinea pigs were suppressed by anaerobiosis. The uptake and acetylation of [3H]choline in the newborn brain were very low, compared to findings in slices of the adult brain. The most sensitive tissue to hypoxia was the striatum followed by the hippocampus. There were significant differences in the case of the frontal cortex.
