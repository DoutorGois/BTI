The current study was aimed at comparing the behavioral and biochemical (5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels) effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, venlafaxine and imipramine) in sub-chronically forced swim stressed rats. At the given doses of 10, 20 and 30 mg/kg, among aforesaid antidepressants, the imipramine treatment alone caused significant decline in the immobility time of rats (IC(50) 20 mg/kg). In the hippocampus of rats, the imipramine treatment caused significant elevation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) whereas, the fluoxetine and venlafaxine elicited significant increase in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels. Likewise, in the plasma of rats, the imipramine treatment significantly increased the 5-HIAA levels whereas, the fluoxetine and venlafaxine treatment significantly elevate the 5-HT levels. It can therefore be inferred that the imipramine did not act like other monoamine reuptake inhibitors in biochemical study, which could possibly underlie its ability to be detected in forced swim test (behavioral study). Moreover, the re-uptake inhibition of 5-HT is not accountable for the antidepressant action exhibited in forced swim test.
