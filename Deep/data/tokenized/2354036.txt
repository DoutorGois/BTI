Noradrenergic (NA) involvement in acquisition (AQ) and retention (RET) of a shock-motivated 14-unit T-maze after intraperitoneal (ip) administration of DSP4, a neurotoxin that depletes forebrain NA, was evaluated in 2 experiments using 3-month-old male F-344 rats. Depletion of cortical NA level in DSP4-treated rats was verified by neurochemical assay and by latency to postdecapitation clonus reflex. In Experiment 1, DSP4 (50 mg/kg ip) rats did not differ from saline-treated (SAL) rats on any measure of maze performance (errors, alternation errors, run time, shock duration, or shock frequency) during AQ (DSP4 2 weeks prior to testing) nor during a RET test 2-3 weeks later (DSP4 immediately after the last AQ trial or 1 week after AQ). In Experiment 2, DSP4 and scopolamine (SCOP), a cholinergic (ACh) antagonist, were administered in combination to test for an NA-ACh interaction. DSP4 (50 mg/kg ip 2 weeks prior to AQ) again had no effect on AQ performance nor did DSP4 interact with either dose of SCOP (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg ip 30 min prior to AQ) to further impair performance. Similar to previous studies SCOP impaired all measures of maze performance except shock duration. These experiments provide further evidence for involvement of ACh systems in the learning of this task and in the age-related impairments previously observed, but they suggest that central NA systems may not be involved directly or interactively with ACh systems required for efficient performance in this maze.
