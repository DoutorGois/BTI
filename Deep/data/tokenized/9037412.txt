Veratridine blocks Na(+)-channel inactivation and causes a persistant Na(+)-influx. Exposure of hippocampal slices to 10 microM veratridine led to a failure of synaptic transmission, repetitive spreading depression (SD)-like depolarizations of increasing duration, loss of Ca(+)-homeostasis, a large reduction of membrane potential, spongious edema and metabolic failure. Normalization of the amplitude of the negative DC shift evoked by high K+ ACSF 80 min after veratridine exposure was taken as the primary endpoint for neuroprotection. Compounds whose mechanisms of action includes Na(+)-channel modulation were neuroprotective (IC50-values in microM): tetrodotoxin 0.017, verapamil 1.18, riluzole 1.95, lamotrigine > or = 10, and diphenylhydantoin 16.1. Both NMDA (MK-801 and PH) and non-NMDA (NBQX) excitatory amino acid antagonists were inactive, as were NOS-synthesis inhibitor (nitro-L-arginine and L-NAME) Ca(2+)-channel blockers (cadmium, nimodipine) and a K(+)-channel blocker (TEA). Lubeluzole significantly delayed in time before the slices became epileptic, postponed the first SD-like depolarization, allowed the slices to better recover their membrane potential after a larger number of SD-like DC depolarizations, preserved Ca2+ and energy homeostasis, and prevented the neurotoxic effects of veratridine (IC50-value 0.54 microM). A concentration of lubeluzole, which was 40 x higher than its IC50-value for neuroprotection against veratridine, had no effect on repetitive Na(+)-dependent action potentials induced by depolarizing current in normal ACSF. The ability of lubeluzole to prevent the pathological consequences of excessive Na(+)-influx, without altering normal Na(+)- channel function may be of benefit in stroke.
