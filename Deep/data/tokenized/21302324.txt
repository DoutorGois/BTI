BACKGROUND: Schisandra chinensis, commonly used in Asia for tea material and traditional Chinese medicine, is presumed to enhance mental and intellectual functions. In this study, the effects and signalling mechanisms of a purified compound schisandrin, one of the lignan of Schisandra chinensis, on primary cultured hippocampal neurons were investigated. RESULTS: Schisandrin treatment enhanced total dendritic length and branching complexity, both of which were significantly suppressed in the presence of specific blockers for calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon), and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). Moreover, schisandrin induced calcium influx, and phosphorylation of CaMKII, PKCepsilon, and MEK. Inhibition of CAMKII and PKCepsilon attenuated the schisandrin-induced phosphorylation of PKCepsilon and MEK, and the phosphorylation of MEK, respectively. Moreover, schisandrin also stimulated the phosphorylation of cyclic AMP responsive-element binding protein (CREB) at Ser-133, an effect that was blocked by KN93. In addition to its neuritogenic effects, schisandrin increased the numbers of postsynaptic density-95-positive and FM1-43-positive puncta in dendrites and synaptic boutons, respectively. CONCLUSION: In hippocampal neurons, schisandrin exhibits neurotrophic properties that are mediated by the CaMKII-PKCepsilon-MEK pathway.
