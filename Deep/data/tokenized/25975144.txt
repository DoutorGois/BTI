Catalepsy usually is caused by imbalance of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) systems of brain. The aim of our work was to verify if this imbalance plays an important role in the mechanism of hereditary catalepsy in mice. Maintenance of DA, 5-HT and their main metabolites--5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanilic acid was determined in cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra and nuclei raphes in catalepsy-resistant AKR/J mice strain and catalepsy-prone CBA/LacJ mice strain and recombinant mice AKR/J.CBA-D13Mit76 (D13) strain. The latest strain was selected by transferring of a fragment of the chromosome 13 from CBA/LacJ carrying the main gene of hereditary catalepsy to AKR/J genome. There were no interstrain differences in concentration of biogenic amines and their metabolites in all brain regions. As a result of our work the hypothesis about the important role of 5-HT and/or DA systems of brain in the mechanism of hereditary catalepsy in mice was denied.
