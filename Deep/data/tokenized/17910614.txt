Typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs have different clinical and behavioural profiles. It is well described that inhibition of creatine kinase activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, especially in the brain. In this work, we evaluate the effect of haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine or aripiprazole chronic administration on creatine kinase activity in brain of rats. Adult male Wistar rats received daily injections of haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg), clozapine (25 mg/kg), olanzapine (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg) or aripiprazole (2, 10 or 20 mg/kg). Our results demonstrate that haloperidol did not affect the enzyme activity in brain of rats. Clozapine inhibited the enzyme activity only in cerebellum and prefrontal cortex of rats. Aripiprazole did not affect creatine kinase in hippocampus, cerebellum and prefrontal cortex. The administration of 2.0 mg/kg aripiprazole did not alter creatine kinase activity, but 10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg aripiprazole activated the enzyme in striatum and cerebral cortex. Finally, the higher dose of olanzapine (10.0 mg/kg) activated the enzyme in striatum of rats. In hippocampus and cerebral cortex, we could not verify any effect of olanzapine on creatine kinase activity. The inhibitory effect of clozapine and olanzapine on creatine kinase activity in cerebellum and prefrontal cortex suggest that these drugs may impair energy metabolism in these brain areas.
