The effects of amygdaloid kindling on the regional levels and distribution of enkephalin-like and dynorphin-A (DN)-like immunoreactivity (LI) were examined. One day after completion of kindling, radioimmunoassay revealed a 71% decrease in DN1-8-LI and a 43% increase in [Met5]-enkephalin-LI in the hippocampus. Immunostaining revealed a depletion of DN1-17-LI in the hippocampal mossy fiber pathway and an increase in [Leu5]-enkephalin-LI in the temporoammonic pathway. Four weeks after completion of kindling, the levels and immunostaining intensity of dynorphin and enkephalin in the hippocampus had returned to control values.
