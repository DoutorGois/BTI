The distribution of neuron-specific (NSE) and non-neuronal (NNE) isoforms of glycolytic enzyme enolase (EC 4.2.I.II.) in the human brain was studied using immunoenzyme assay. The maximum NSE concentration was measured in the frontal and occipital brain cortex, hippocampus, limbic cortex and hypothalamus (12-14 micrograms/mg of water-soluble protein), the minimum level was observed in the brain stem structures (3-6 micrograms/mg). The maximum NNE content was determined in thalamus (34 micrograms/mg). The data can prove useful for the study of enolase isoform distribution in the brain of neurological and psychiatric patients.
