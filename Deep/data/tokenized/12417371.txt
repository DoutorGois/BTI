Common to all subtypes of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), and those associated cerebrovascular disease (CVD), Lewy body pathology and Parkinson's disease, is degeneration of cholinergic neurotransmission. The cholinergic hypothesis of AD is based on evidence of reduced cholinergic markers and decreased numbers of cholinergic neurons and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the hippocampus and cortex of the brain-both areas associated with memory, learning and executive function impairments characteristic of cognitive decline in AD. There is growing evidence for the involvement of the cholinergic system in vascular dementia (VaD). Attention has, therefore, recently turned to the use of cholinergic treatments such as galantamine (Reminyl), which has demonstrated broad-spectrum and long-term efficacy in AD, for the treatment of patients with VaD or AD with CVD. Galantamine is both a moderate, reversible, competitive acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and an allosteric modulator of nAChR. Recent evidence suggests that the unmatched efficacy of galantamine in cognitive as well as behavioral and functional symptoms in patients with AD, as well as those with VaD or AD with CVD, may at least partly result from its unique dual cholinergic mode of action. Here, the rationale for using galantamine to treat dementia related to CVD is discussed. In particular, some interesting findings are covered which indicate the potential of galantamine to modulate other neurotransmitter systems (e.g. serotonergic, dopaminergic), which may be of specific relevance in the behavioral symptoms of dementia related to CVD.
