The cytoarchitecture of the entorhinal cortex was examined in the brains of six patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and in 16 controls. All six brains of schizophrenic patients showed abnormalities of the rostral and intermediate portions of the entorhinal cortex. The abnormalities included aberrant invaginations of the surface, disruption of cortical layers, heterotopic displacement of neurons, and paucity of neurons in superficial layers. These changes suggest disturbed development. Because the entorhinal cortex is pivotal for neural systems that mediate corticohippocampal interactions, early disruption of its structure could lead to important neuropsychological changes during development and in adult life and could contribute to the symptomatology of schizophrenia.
