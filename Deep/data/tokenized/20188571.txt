Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is conventionally surgically treated by anterior temporal lobectomy. Temporal disconnection surgery has been proposed to minimize the complications associated with standard temporal lobectomy with comparable seizure control. We report a patient with seizures secondary to hippocampal herniation treated successfully with lateral temporal lobectomy and hippocampal disconnection.
