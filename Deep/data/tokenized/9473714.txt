The distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) glutamate receptor subunits was examined in the hippocampus and temporal cortex of adult ovariectomized female rhesus macaques, some of which received estradiol replacement. In situ hybridization revealed a generalized overlap of NR1, GluR1, and GluR2 subunit mRNAs, but no effect due to estradiol treatment. However, regional differences in expression were noted for each subunit.
