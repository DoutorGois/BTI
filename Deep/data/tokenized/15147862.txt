The present study was carried out to investigate the potential involvement of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in the mobilization of calcium induced by NMDA-receptors (NMDA-R). We herein provide evidence that agents interfering with plasma membrane cholesterol (namely, filipin and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (Cdex)) inhibit the NMDA-stimulated influx of calcium in hippocampal cells in culture. Filipin-treated cells maintained their morphology and were able to respond with a calcium influx to high K(+) challenge, whereas Cdex altered both cellular parameters. These results suggest that the NMDA-R can be located in cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains or alternatively that the mechanisms coupling their dynamics in the post-synaptic membrane are dependent on the integrity of the microdomains.
