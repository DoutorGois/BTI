The goal of this study was to determine whether propofol has protective effect against kainic acid (KA)-induced excitotoxicity. Administration of propofol (25 mg kg-1 i.p.) was done 2 h before KA (10 mg kg-1 i.p.), immediately after, and 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, and 12 h after the KA, and twice daily for an additional three days. Neuronal cell death in CA1 and CA3 subsector of hippocampus was evaluated quantitatively four days after KA. The KA and propofol-injected rats had a greater number of surviving neuronal cells than did KA (and vehicle)-injected rats. Our results suggest that propofol holds potential for the protection of neuronal cells against KA induced excitotoxicity.
