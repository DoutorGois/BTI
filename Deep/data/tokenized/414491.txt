The paper compares the structural reorganization of reticular formation of the brain stem with the cortical structures of the limbic system--hippocamp and limbic cortex in the mammalian comparative order (a hedgehog, a rabbit, a cat, a dog, a dolphin, a monkey, a man). In all the studied links of the limbico-reticular system the author revealed general regularity: the main trend of a structural development is expressed in the intensification of their structural heterogeneity: nuclei are divided in subnuclei, areas in subareas, layers in sublayers. In all structures these features are expressed more vividly in their phylogenetic new parts. Besides, changes of the brain caudal sections--reticular formation are relatively less expressed than the rostral sections, i.e. hippocamp and limbic cortex.
