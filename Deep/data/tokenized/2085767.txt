Nerve growth factor (NGF) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity levels were measured in 7 different brain regions in young (3-month-old) and aged (2-years-old) female Sprague-Dawley rats. Prior to analysis the spatial learning ability of the aged rats was assessed in the Morris' water maze test. In the aged rats a significant, 15-30%, increase in NGF levels was observed in 4 regions (septum, cortex, olfactory bulb and cerebellum), whereas the levels in hippocampus, striatum and the brainstem were similar to those of the young rats. The NGF changes did not correlate with the behavioral performance within the aged group. Minor 15-30%, changes in ChAT activity were observed in striatum, brainstem and cerebellum, but these changes did not correlate with the changes in NGF levels in any region. The results indicate that brain NGF levels are maintained at normal or supranormal levels in rats with severe learning and memory impairments. The results, therefore, do not support the view that the marked atrophy and cell loss in the forebrain cholinergic system that is known to occur in the behaviorally impaired aged rats is caused by a reduced availability of NGF in the cholinergic target areas. The results also indicate that the slightly increased levels of NGF are not sufficient to prevent the age-dependent atrophy of cholinergic neurons, although they might be important for the stimulation of compensatory functional changes in a situation where the system is undergoing progressive degeneration.
