In 3-, 9-, 24-, and 30-month-old male rats (Fischer 344), the nuclear perimeter and the density and diameter of nuclear pore complexes in the granule cells of the dentate fascia were studied. Whereas the nuclear perimeter and the diameter of nuclear pore complexes did not change as a function of age, there was a significant loss of them at 24 months (20%), compared with the third month. This change suggests that the nucleocytoplasmic communication may be impaired with age which would adversely affect protein synthesis, and could explain the loss of the postsynaptic sites of the dentate fascia of aged rats.
