The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of FeSO(4) on the behavior of adult Wistar rats. Rats were treated with moderate doses of iron (1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days, and the effects of iron supplementation on emotional behavior were studied. One group of rats was tested in elevated plus-maze and in open field, and other group was tested for learning abilities in water maze and for motor skills in rotarod task. Iron level in the brain was measured in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, basal ganglia and hippocampus. The effects of the iron treatment (in particular, a dose of 3.0 mg/kg) on emotional behavior in the elevated plus maze and in the open field were significant. The effects of iron on spatial learning were less pronounced, but significant impairments due to the treatment were observed during the probe test. Motor skills and procedural learning in the rotarod task were not significantly affected by the treatment. These behavioral impairments were associated with significant iron accumulations in the hippocampus and basal ganglia of rats treated with 3.0 mg/kg iron and are discussed in terms of possible neuronal impairments of these structures. Thus, FeSO(4) administration at 3.0 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days in adult rats overcomes the mechanisms that shield the brain from iron intoxication and leads to behavioral impairments, in particular with respect to emotional behavior.
