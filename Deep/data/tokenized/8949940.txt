The structurally related Aconitum alkaloids aconitine, lappaconitine, and 6-benzoylheteratisine inhibited the orthodromic and antidromic population spike in hippocampal CA1 area in a frequency-dependent manner. Aconitine (1 microM) completely suppressed epileptiform activity induced by omission of Mg2+ as well as normal neuronal activity, whereas lappaconitine (10 microM) and 6-benzoylheteratisine (10 microM) diminished epileptiform activity by sparing normal neuronal activity.
