Previously we reported that prenatal exposure to morphine twice daily during gestation decreases proenkephalin levels in adult progeny within the brain, including the dentate gyrus, and alters mu and delta opioid receptors in the hippocampal CA3 region. The lateral aspect of the perforant path contains and releases enkephalin-derived opioid peptides, and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in lateral perforant path projections to both the dentate gyrus and the hippocampal CA3 region is blocked by antagonists of opioid receptors. Thus LTP induction at these synapses involves opioid receptor activation mediated by the release of proenkephalin-derived opioid peptides with lateral perforant path activation. Here we show in adult behaving animals, neither LTP induction nor the early phase of LTP (E-LTP) maintenance is altered by prenatal morphine exposure in the lateral perforant path projections to the dentate gyrus and the CA3 region. However, maintenance and longevity of late LTP (L-LTP), as reflected in the magnitude of LTP over days, was attenuated in animals prenatally exposed to morphine. In contrast, in medial perforant path projections to the dentate gyrus and CA3 region, both LTP induction and the maintenance of E- and L-LTP were unaffected by prenatal morphine treatment. Thus a brief prenatal exposure to the opiate morphine produces sustained, and possibly permanent, alterations in L-LTP in the opioidergic lateral perforant path projection. This suggests that prenatal morphine exposure disrupts LTP via disruption of opioid mechanisms involved in LTP maintenance or via disruption of opioid receptor activation during LTP induction, which can subsequently alter LTP maintenance.
