Scrutiny of the data from these studies reveals that the C58/J alcohol-preferring mice have significantly lower baseline methionine-enkephalin levels in both the corpus striatum and hypothalamus compared to C3H/CHRGL/2 non-alcohol-preferring mice. In other brain regions in these two strains, specifically, pituitary, amygdala, midbrain, and hippocampus, analysis of methionine-enkephalin levels did not show any significant differences. This suggests that the hypothalamus may indeed be a specific locus involved in the regulation of alcohol intake, via the molecular interaction between neuroamines, opioid peptides, as they are influenced by genetics and environment.
