Ovariectomy is known as 'surgical menopause' with decreased levels of oestrogen in female rodents and its reported risks and adverse effects include cognitive impairment. In the brain, oestrogen exerts effects through its receptors, oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta). However, the role of ERalpha or ERbeta in ovariectomy-induced cognitive impairment needs further investigation. Here, we observed that bilaterally ovariectomized 3-month-old rats showed obvious spatial learning and memory deficits in the Morris water maze with significant loss of neurons and synapses in the hippocampus. In addition to the rapid decline in serum oestradiol levels, the expression of ERalpha, but not ERbeta, was decreased in the hippocampus starting 1 wk after ovariectomy. Prompt 4,4',4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) treatment (1 mg/kg.d), an agonist of ERalpha, improved the spatial learning and memory ability of ovariectomized rats and rescued ovariectomy-induced neuron loss by up-regulating the level of BCLxl, an important anti-apoptosis protein. Furthermore, PPT treatment also improved ovariectomy-induced hippocampal synapse loss and up-regulated the levels of synaptic proteins (synapsin I, NR2A and GluR1) and the activates of CaMK Pialpha, ERK and Akt. Thus, these results demonstrated that ERalpha plays an important role in neuroprotection and that prompt ERalpha rescue is effective to improve hippocampal-dependent cognition deficit after long-term ovariectomy.
