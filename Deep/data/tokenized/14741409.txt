Fluid percussion injury (FPI) and in situ hybridisation were used to evaluate the expression of NT-3 mRNA in the hippocampus after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adrenal-intact and adrenalectomised rats (with or without corticosterone replacement). FPI and adrenalectomy independently significantly reduced the expression of NT-3 mRNA in the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA2 region. The effects of adrenalectomy in the CA2 region were partially reversed with corticosterone. In adrenalectomised animals undergoing FPI, a further significant decrease in NT-3 mRNA was observed in the DG, but this was not reversed by corticosterone. Glucocorticoids may, therefore, play a role in the basal regulation of NT-3 in the hippocampus, but the role of glucocorticoids in the modulation of the NT-3 response to TBI is unclear.
