The ability of intraventricular infusion of apolipoprotein E (apoE) to reduce neuronal damage after global cerebral ischemia was investigated in apoE-deficient and wild-type mice. ApoE (5 microg/mL lipid-conjugated derived from human plasma; 1 microL/h, continuous infusion) significantly reduced neuronal damage in the caudate nucleus and CA2 pyramidal cell layer by approximately 50% in apoE-deficient mice after global ischemia compared to vehicle infusion. In wild-type mice infused with apoE, there was a trend for ischemic neuronal damage to be reduced. ApoE-infused mice had a marked reduction in 4-hydroxynonenal immunoreactivity, as a marker of lipid peroxidation. The results show that the presence of apoE at or after the time of injury can be neuroprotective, possibly via an anti-oxidant mechanism.
