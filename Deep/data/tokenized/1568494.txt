Responses of hypothalamic neurons to single (1/s, 20 impulses) stimulation of the prefrontal (area 8), cingulum (area 24), periamygdaloideus (RPA) cortex and hippocampus (field CA3) were studied on experimental cats anesthetized with ketamine. The routine elaborated for IBM PC/AT 386 provided: 1) selection of such neurone reaction with the latent period variation less than its length per the set value (5-20%); 2) selection of repeated neurone reactions with the same variability of latent periods from 20 cortical stimuli; 3) ranging of neurone reactions according to these indices. Quantitative estimation of the priority ranges made it possible to determine the profundity of the functional relations between the cerebral structures.
