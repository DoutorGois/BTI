Resveratrol (trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural phytoalexin found in grape skin, and has been suggested to be an antioxidant agent, an anticancer agent and a cardioprotective agent. In particular, recent experimental evidence has demonstrated that resveratrol exhibits neuroprotective effects in various assay systems. During the study on the resveratrol derivatives, we found that (4-methoxybenzylidene)-(3-methoxyphenyl)amine (MBMPA), which has blocked free phenolic groups, strongly protects neuronal cells against ischemic damage on a higher activity than resveratrol. The MBMPA potently reduced the level of neuronal cell death in an oxygen and glucose deprivation-exposed rat organotypic hippocampal slice culture. In addition, ATP depletion following the onset of oxygen and glucose deprivation in an adult hippocampal slice was blocked by the MBMPA treatment. These results suggest that MBMPA has a neuroprotective effect on an in vitro ischemia model, and may be useful for treating stroke.
