OBJECTIVE: To study the inhibitory effects of Panax Notoginseng Saponins(PNS) on apoptosis induced by hypoxia/hypoglycemia and reoxygenation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. METHOD: Apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry, intracellular free calcium concentration([Ca2+]i) was measured with confocal laser scanning microscopy, morphological changes and neuronal necrosis were observed with fluorescence microscope, and meanwhile the leakage of lactic dehydrogenase(LDH) was measured. RESULT: Hypoxia/hypoglycemia cultures for 5 hours and reoxygenation induced neuronal apoptosis and necrosis, and significantly increased neuronal [Ca2+]i and the leakage of LDH. The effects were increased with the extending time of reoxygenation. PNS has could significantly decrease the percentage of neuronal apoptosis and necrosis, and reduce neuronal [Ca2+]i and the leakage of LDH. CONCLUSION: PNS has inhibitory effect on neuronal apoptosis. This effect might be related to its effect of decreasing intracellular free calcium concentration.
