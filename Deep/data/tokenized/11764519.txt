In rat hippocampal slices, synaptic transmission from Schaffer collaterals to CA1 neurons was studied by assessment of the effects of cessation of low-frequency testing stimulation to the population spike amplitude. A positive correlation between the duration of the stimulation interruption period (from 10 to 120 min) and the increment of the population spike amplitude (from 30 to 100% above baseline level). The "deprivational" potentiation (DP) offers a property of summation and is able to persist for long (testing was continued up to one hour). Prior induction of the long-term posttetanic potentiation (LPTP) that for 1-3 hours prevents the development of the late rather than the short-term LPTP phase, in our experiments also suppressed the DP induction after 60-min stimulation interruption interval. The same results were obtained in the presence of polymixin B (20 mcM), which is an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC-dependent phase of the LPTP. This finding provides support for the earlier assumption about the similarity of the mechanisms responsible for the development of the DP and PKC-dependent LPTP phase related with protein phosphorylation.
