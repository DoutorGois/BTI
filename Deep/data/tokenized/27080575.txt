We examined the effects of intensity-modulated radiation therapy with dose-sparing and avoidance technique on a pediatric patient with localized intracranial germinoma. We also reviewed the literature regarding modern irradiation techniques in relation to late neurocognitive sequelae. A patient with a localized intracranial germinoma in the third ventricle anterior to the pineal gland received a dose-sparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy. The planning was compared to the radiation oncologist's guide of organs at risk and dose constraints for dosimetric analyses. The patient received radiation therapy alone. The total dose was 54Gy delivered in 2.0Gy fractions to the primary tumour and 37Gy in 1.4Gy fractions to whole ventricles using a dose-sculpting plan. Dosimetry analyses showed that dose-sparing intensity-modulated radiation therapy delivered reduced doses to the whole brain, temporal lobes, hippocampi, cochleae, and optic nerves. With a follow-up of 22 months, failure-free survival was 100% for the patient and no adverse events during radiation treatment process. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy with dose sparing and avoidance technique can spare the limbic circuit, central nervous system, and hippocampus for pineal germ cell tumours. This technique reduces the integral dose delivered to the uninvolved normal brain tissues and may reduce late neurocognitive sequelae caused by cranial radiotherapy.
