Research aimed at developing a network model of the hippocampus based on electrophysiological and anatomical data is described. Simulations are used to examine the relationships between experiments on single cells and pairs of cells and experiments on populations of thousands of cells. The neuron model on which the network model is based is examined. The simulation methods are then discussed. Results for a series of models of progressively increasing complexity of the CA3 region are presented.
