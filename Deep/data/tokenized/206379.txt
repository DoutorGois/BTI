Electrolytic lesions of the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum aimed at the locus coeruleus (LC) were performed bilaterally in 13 chronically implanted Rats. Following lesions, transient alterations of characteristic components of theta rhythm appeared. No shortening of duration of paradoxical sleep (PS) was observed. These results do not support the hypothesis that neurons of LC are directly involved in the production of theta rhythm during PS; moreover they seem not to be necessary to the normal appearance of this state of sleep.
