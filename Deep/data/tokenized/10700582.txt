Neurons are continually added at a low rate to the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus during adulthood in rats. The functional significance of this unusual feature is not completely understood, although recent studies suggest continued granule cell neurogenesis is essential for normal learning and memory. We report here that, in the adult rat, stimulation of the granule cell mossy fibers sufficient to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) increases the number of newly formed granule cells in the dentate gyrus, indicating that granule cell neurogenesis is regulated by efferent activity and, possibly, the induction of LTP.
