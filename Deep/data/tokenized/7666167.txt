1. Two independent Schaffer collateral pathways converging to the same pyramidal cell were alternately stimulated by 2-Hz trains (900 pulses) offset by a 150-ms interval in adult rat hippocampal slices. The second input underwent an immediate and persistent long-term depression (LTD). Depression in the first input was smaller than the second input. A narrower interpulse interval (20 ms) failed to induce LTD in either input. 2. Neither the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid nor the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxylphenyl-glycine blocked this associative LTD. However, coapplication of these two antagonists blocked LTD. 3. Associative LTD was blocked by prior injection of the Ca2+ chelator bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid into the postsynaptic cell and by bath-applied L-NG-nitroarginine, a nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor. 4. We propose that temporally confined, asynchronous synaptic activity weakens the efficacy of naive synapses in slices from the adult hippocampus.
