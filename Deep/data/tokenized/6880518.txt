Chronic experiments on conscious rabbits demonstrated that benzonal suppresses the spontaneous bioelectrical activity of the motor division of the cortex of large hemispheres while failing to affect the spontaneous biorhythms of the nonspecific nuclei of the thalamus, caudate nucleus, dorsal hippocamp and the basolateral nuclei of the tonsil. The drug decreased the electroexcitability of the motor cortex and caudate nucleus, exerted a mild depressant action on the reticular formation of the midbrain, tonsil, and hippocamp and had no effect on the excitability of nonspecific nuclei of the thalamus.
