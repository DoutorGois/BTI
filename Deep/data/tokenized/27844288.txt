The study of the long-term neurological consequences of early exposure with methylphenidate (MPH) is very important since this psychostimulant has been widely misused by children and adolescents who do not meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of early chronic exposure with MPH on amino acids profile, glutamatergic and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase homeostasis, as well as redox and energy status in the hippocampus of juvenile rats. Wistar male rats received intraperitoneal injections of MPH (2.0 mg/kg) or saline solution (controls), once a day, from the 15th to the 45th day of age. Results showed that MPH altered amino acid profile in the hippocampus, decreasing glutamine levels. Glutamate uptake and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity were decreased after chronic MPH exposure in the hippocampus of rats. No changes were observed in the immunocontents of glutamate transporters (GLAST and GLT-1), and catalytic subunits of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase (alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3), as well as redox status. Moreover, MPH provoked a decrease in ATP levels in the hippocampus of chronically exposed rats, while citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, respiratory chain complexes activities (II, II-III, and IV), as well as mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane potential were not altered. Taken together, our results suggest that chronic MPH exposure at early age impairs glutamate uptake and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity probably by decreasing in ATP levels observed in rat hippocampus.
