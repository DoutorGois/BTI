The activity of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) was determined as an index of myelin in the post-mortem brain samples of 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of 14 controls. The CNPase activity was mildly increased in the temporal, hippocampal and parietal cortex in AD subjects pointing to a relative sparing of myelin as compared to the neuron loss within cortex in AD. In the hippocampus the CNPase activity was decreased in AD patients indicating loss of myelin and thus myelinated axons in this area in AD.
