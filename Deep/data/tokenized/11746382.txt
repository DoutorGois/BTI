Neurofilament (NF) proteins are expressed in the majority of neurons in the central nervous system, and play a crucial role in the organization of neuronal shape and function. In the present study, we have used immunoblotting and immunocytochemical methods to study the light (NF-L), medium (NF-M ), and heavy (NF-H) molecular weight NF proteins in cultured organotypic hippocampal slices during the in vitro maturation and the changes after kainic acid (KA) treatment. In control cultures at 11 DIV throughout 25 DIV, CA3 pyramidal neurons and their proximal dendrites were heavily labeled with the antibodies against all three NF proteins. In CA1 pyramidal neurons, no staining was detected in any age group. A few weakly NF-L positive granule cells with fibers were detected in each age group, whereas NF-M and NF-H positive granule cells first appeared in the older cultures. The application of KA (5 microM) to the cultures for 48 hr, induced a pronounced cell death in the CA3 cell layers, and also moderately damaged granule cells. After the treatment, the immunoblot signal of NF-L and NF-M markedly decreased, whereas that of NF-H almost completely disappeared. The amount of NF-L positive fibers, however, dramatically increased in the molecular and hilar regions of the dentate gyrus in both age groups. Our results show the cellular heterogeneity in the distribution of NF protein triplet in cultured organotypic hippocampal slices. Kainic acid treatment induced changes, which mimicked those observed in the hippocampal region of epileptic animals.
