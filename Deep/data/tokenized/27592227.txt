SH3 and multiple ankyrin (ANK) repeat domain 3 (SHANK3) is a synaptic scaffolding protein enriched in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. SHANK3 plays an important role in the formation and maturation of excitatory synapses. In the brain, SHANK3 directly or indirectly interacts with various synaptic molecules including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor. Previous studies have shown that Autism spectrum disorder is a result of mutations of the main SHANK3 isoforms, which may be due to deficit in excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. Recently, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that overexpression of SHANK3 could induce seizures in vivo. However, little is known about the role of SHANK3 in refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Therefore, we investigated the expression pattern of SHANK3 in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy and in pilocarpine-induced models of epilepsy. Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis were used to locate and determine the expression of SHANK3 in the temporal neocortex of patients with epilepsy, and in the hippocampus and temporal lobe cortex of rats in a pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. Double-labeled immunofluorescence showed that SHANK3 was mainly expressed in neurons. Western blot analysis confirmed that SHANK3 expression was increased in the neocortex of TLE patients and rats. These results indicate that SHANK3 participates in the pathology of epilepsy.
