INTRODUCTION: BK (big potassium) channels are Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels widely expressed in mammalian cells. They are extensively distributed in the CNS, the most abundant level being found in brain areas largely involved in epilepsy, namely cortex, hippocampus, piriform cortex, and other limbic structures. BK channels control action potential shape/duration, thereby regulating membrane excitability and Ca(2+) signaling. AREAS COVERED: The potassium channel superfamily represents a rich source of potential targets for therapeutic intervention in epilepsy. Some studies have identified alterations in BK channel function, therefore, supporting the development of drugs acting on these channels for epilepsy treatment. EXPERT OPINION: The actual sketch is intriguing and controversial, since mechanisms altering the physiological role of BK channels leading to either a loss- or gain-of-function have both been linked to seizure onset. Not many studies have been performed to unravel the efficacy of drugs acting on these channels as potential antiepileptics; however, paradoxically, efficacy has been demonstrated for both BK channel openers and blockers. Furthermore, their potential usefulness in preventing epileptogenesis has not been investigated at all. Substantial data on risks and benefits of modulating these channels are urgently needed to draw a definitive conclusion on whether BK channels are a viable future target for the treatment of epilepsy.
