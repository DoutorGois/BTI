Hyperglycemia has been shown to worsen the outcome of brain ischemia in several animal models but few experimental studies have investigated impairments in cognition induced by ischemic brain lesions in hyperglycemic animals. The Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat naturally develops type 2 diabetes characterized by mild hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. We hypothesized that GK rats would display more severe cerebral damage due to hyperglycemia-aggravated brain injury and, accordingly, more severe cognitive impairments. In this study, recovery of motor and cognitive functions of GK and healthy Wistar rats was examined following extradural compression (EC) of the sensorimotor cortex. For this purpose, tests of vestibulomotor function (beam-walking) and combined tests of motor function and learning (locomotor activity from day (D) 1 to D5, operant lever-pressing from D14 to D25) were used. EC consistently reduced cerebral blood flow in both strains. Anesthesia-challenge and EC resulted in pronounced hyperglycemia in GK but not in Wistar rats. Lower beam-walking scores, increased locomotor activity, impairments in long-term habituation and learning of operant lever-pressing were more pronounced and observed at later time-points in GK rats. Fluoro-Jade, a marker of irreversible neuronal degeneration, revealed consistent degeneration in the ipsilateral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus at 2, 7 and 14 days post-compression. The amount of degeneration in these structures was considerably higher in GK rats. Thus, GK rats exhibited marked hyperglycemia during EC, as well as longer-lasting behavioral deficits and increased neurodegeneration during recovery. The GK rat is thus an attractive model for neuropathologic and cognitive studies after ischemic brain injury in hyperglycemic rats.
