A clinicopathological investigation was conducted on a case of an 89-year-old man with a 10-year history of progressive dementia who also suffered strokes, apathy, aphasia, dysarthria, weakness of both legs, and walking difficulties. At autopsy, we found an obvious atrophy of the frontal and temporal cortex. Lewy bodies (LBs) could be seen in brain stem, amygdala, and neocortex. Argyrophilic grains were observed in hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, neocortex, amygdala, and pons, as well as neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. The case presented here is a rare case of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with accumulation of argyrophilic grains and Lewy bodies.
