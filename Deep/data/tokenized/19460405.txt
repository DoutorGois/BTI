Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CMS), an animal model of depression, downregulates hippocampal CB1 receptors in adult male rats. Given that endocannabinoids are implicated in modulating stress and anxiety and that women are vulnerable to stress-related disorders, we tested the effects of CMS on both female and male rats. Gonadectomized (gndx) and gonadally intact male and female rats were exposed to a three-week chronic stress protocol. Following CMS, CB1 receptor and fatty-acid-amide-hydrolase (FAAH) expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by western blot analysis. CMS reliably produced a downregulation of CB1 receptors ( approximately 50%) in the hippocampus of both gndx and intact males. This effect was more robust in the dorsal than in the ventral hippocampus. Conversely, CMS produced an upregulation of CB1 receptors ( approximately 150%) in the hippocampus of both gndx and intact females. This upregulation was only observed in the dorsal hippocampus of female animals. CMS produced an upregulation of FAAH levels in both male and female animals. In non-stress control animals, males were observed to have higher CB1 levels than females, but no differences in FAAH were found. These findings suggest that the endocannabinoid (eCB) system is preferentially organized in male and female animals to respond differentially to chronic stress. These sex differences in the eCB system may help development of novel treatments for stress and depression that are designed specifically for women and men.
