Neuroinflammation may be central in epileptogenesis. In this study we analysed inflammatory reaction markers in brain tissue of Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with Hippocampal Sclerosis (MTLE-HS) patients. TLR4, IL-1beta and IL-10 gene expression as well as the presence of activated HLA-DR+ microglia was evaluated in 23 patients and 10 cadaveric controls. Inflammation characterized by the presence of HLA-DR(+) microglia and TLR4, IL-1beta overexpression was evident in hippocampus and anterior temporal cortex of MTLE-HS patients. Anti-inflammatory IL-10 was also overexpressed in MTLE-HS patients. Our results show that hippocampal neuroinflammation extends beyond lesional limits, as far as the anterior temporal cortex.
