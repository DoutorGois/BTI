Declarative memory refers to a spatial strategy using numerous sources of sensory input information in which visual and vestibular inputs are assimilated in the hippocampus. In contrast, procedural memory refers to a response strategy based on motor skills and familiar gestures and involves the striatum. Even if vestibular loss impairs hippocampal activity and spatial memory, vestibular-lesioned rats remain able to find food rewards during complex spatial memory task. Since hippocampal lesions induce a switch from declarative memory to procedural memory, we hypothesize that vestibular-lesioned rats use a strategy other than that of hippocampal spatial response to complete the task and to counterbalance the loss of vestibular information. We test, in a reverse T-maze paradigm, the types of strategy vestibular-lesioned rats preferentially uses in a spatial task. We clearly demonstrate that all vestibular-lesioned rats shift to a response strategy to solve the spatial task, while control rats use spatial and response strategies equally. We conclude that the loss of vestibular informations leading to spatial learning impairments is not offset at the hippocampus level by integration process of other sense mainly visual informations; but favors a response strategy through procedural memory most likely involving the striatum, cerebellum, and motor learning.
