Homing pigeons (Columba livia) were trained to locate a goal in one corner of a rectangular arena by either its shape (geometry) or the left-right configuration of colored features located in each corner (feature structure). Control and hippocampal-lesioned pigeons learned at a similar rate, but the control birds made proportionally more geometric errors during acquisition. On conflict probe trials, the control birds preferred geometrically correct corners, whereas the hippocampal-lesioned birds displayed a greater preference for the correct corner defined by feature structure. On geometry-only probe trials, both groups demonstrated an ability to identify the goal location. Hippocampal lesions do not interfere with goal recognition by the feature structure of local cues but diminish the salience of arena shape.
