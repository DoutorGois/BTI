The densities of the glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI), neuronal inclusions (NI), and abnormal neurons were studied in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and areas of the pons and medulla in 10 cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA). GCI density was greater in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus compared with the frontal cortex and hippocampus. Abnormal neurons were most abundant in the frontal cortex, substantia nigra, and inferior olivary nucleus. NI and abnormal neuron densities were positively correlated in the globus pallidus but negatively correlated in the hippocampus. The NI and GCI were only positively correlated in the pons. GCI in the pons and inferior olivary nucleus, NI in the substantia nigra, and abnormal neurons in the frontal cortex varied significantly between cases. The MSA cases did not cluster according to disease subtype. The data suggest that: 1) the greatest densities of pathological changes occur in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, 2) density of the GCI is unrelated to that of the NI, and 3) there is overlapping pathology between the various subtypes of MSA.
