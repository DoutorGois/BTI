The present study uses immunocytochemistry to investigate the behavior of the calretinin (CR)-containing neuronal subpopulation (interneurons) of the rat hippocampus in neurodegenerative processes induced by the neurotoxicant trimethyltin. Cell counts of CR-immunolabeled interneurons indicated that these cells are spared by the neurotoxicant-induced degeneration, characterized by a generalized neuronal loss, as shown by quantitative analysis after cresyl violet staining.
