Cognitive-neuropsychological evaluations were performed on a 12-year-old girl with memory disorder to study the higher brain function of this patient. The cerebral blood flow (r-CBF) was also studied. The results showed that the auditory-verbal memory of this patient were impaired. The regional cerebral blood flow was reduced in the left hippocampus which reportedly cause memory disorder. The disturbance of visual cognition and disability of construction in this patient seem to be related to reduced cerebral blood flow in the left parietal region.
