Current and voltage in a brain slice are considered, taking into account the boundary conditions at the surface to an electrolyte bath and at the substrate of an electron conductor. A sheet conductor model is introduced with ohmic leak conductance to the bath and capacitive coupling to the substrate. It assigns a current-source density of neuronal activity to extracellular field potentials recorded by planar contacts, and it relates the current of planar capacitive contacts to the field potential that elicits neuronal activity. Two examples are analytically solved: the recording across a layered brain slice and the stimulation by a circular electrode. The study forms the basis for neurophysical experiments with brain slices or retinae on microelectronic chips.
