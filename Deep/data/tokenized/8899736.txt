The sparse-fur (spf) mouse, with an X-linked hepatic ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC, E.C.2.1.3.3) deficiency, exhibits significantly lower levels of arginine in the brain as compared to normal controls. In the present study, the effect of a sustained lower metabolic arginine was studied by measuring the levels of several arginine-related guanidino compounds in brain. The concentrations of gamma-guanidinobutyric acid (gamma-GBA), N-alpha-acetylarginine (N-alpha-AA), argininic acid (Arg-A), guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), and creatine were significantly lower in spf mice as compared to controls. Since arginine is the precursor for nitric oxide, we also measured the activity of nitric oxide synthase which was significantly reduced in cerebellum, striatum, hippocampus and cerebral cortex of spf mice. The changes seen in cerebral guanidino compound and nitric oxide metabolism of spf mice could be due to a sustained deficiency of arginine, caused by a metabolic block in the area cycle.
