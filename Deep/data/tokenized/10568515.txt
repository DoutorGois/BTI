Glutamate receptor-mediated responses have been reported to be enhanced in the postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons before the appearance of delayed neuronal death, and the enhancement has been thought to be one of crucial factors leading postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons to irreversible neuronal injury. In the present study, we examined what changes in functional properties of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) channels are responsible for the enhanced postischemic glutamate receptor-mediated responses. Gerbils were subjected to 5-min ischemia to induce the enhancement of glutamate receptor-mediated responses and the hippocampal slices were prepared 3 h after ischemia. Single channel activities evoked by NMDA and AMPA were recorded from outside-out patches excised from the postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons. The main conductance levels of NMDA and AMPA channels in the postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons were not significantly different from those in control CA1 pyramidal neurons. The mean open time and the open-state probability of NMDA and AMPA channels significantly increased in the postischemic CA1 pyramidal neurons (NMDA channels: mean open time, 1.4-fold increase; open-state probability, 1.5-fold increase) (AMPA channels: mean open time, 1.3-fold increase; open-state probability, 1.8-fold increase). These findings indicate that the increases in the mean open time and the open-state probability of NMDA and AMPA channels are responsible for the enhancement of postischemic NMDA and non-NMDA receptor-mediated responses.
