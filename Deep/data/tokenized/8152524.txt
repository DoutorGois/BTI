The effects of exposure to chronic noise and vibration, produced by construction work, on the release and uptake of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) and [14C]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([14C]GABA) from rat amygdaloid and hippocampal slices were investigated. Noise-exposure resulted in increased release, with no significant change in uptake, of [14C]GABA from amygdaloid slices. In hippocampal slices, [14C]GABA release was also increased, but the changes in release were dependent upon the marked decrease in uptake of [14C]GABA into these slices. There was an increase in peak K(+)-evoked release of [3H]5-HT from hippocampal slices, but no other changes in [3H]5-HT release or uptake in either region were observed following noise-exposure. These findings may have important practical implications for the research carried out in laboratories exposed to construction noise and vibrations.
