In experiments on dogs with local neurosis-continuous flexion of the foreleg-changes were revealed in the beta-rhythm amplitude and the frequency of mean unit activity in the motor cortex, and the appearance and increased amplitude of the theta-rhythm in the hippocampus. Specific activity of Na+-K+-activated, and Mg2+-dependent ATPase decreases in subcortical fractions of the experimental animals' cerebral cortex by 55.0% in the synaptic membranes and 2 to 2.5 times in light and heavy synaptosomes, respectively. In similar fractions of the dorsal hippocampus, the activity of the enzyme decreases by 30.0% in the synaptic membranes and increases by 16.6% in the light synaptosomes and by 6.6% in the heavy ones.
