Clinical data have shown women are more susceptible to depression. This study was performed to identify differentially regulated proteins from hippocampus in chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS)-exposed male and female young rats. After 7 weeks of CUMS, depressed male (M-D) and female rats (F-D) and unstressed male (M-C) and female controls (F-C) were studied. By proteomics analysis, 74 differential proteins in F-C/M-C, 79 in F-D/M-D, 77 in F-D/F-C, and 32 in M-D/M-C were found. Further, the synapse-related proteins, cytoskeleton protein tau, and stress-related kinases in hippocampus were assayed by Western blotting. F-C rats were found to have lower levels of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) and mGluR2 and higher levels of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B), synapsin1, total tau, and dephosphorylated tau than M-C rats. Both F-D and M-D rats had lower levels of glutamate transporter SLC1alpha2, mGluR1, and mGluR2, and higher levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau than their controls. Compared with their controls, M-D rats had lower NR1 and higher NR2B, and F-D rats had lower NR2A, NR2B, PSD95, and synapsin1. F-C rats had higher JNK and lower phosphorylation levels of ERK at Thr202/Thr204, JNK at Thr183/Thr185, and GSK-3beta at Ser9 than M-C ones. Both M-D and F-D rats had decreased phosphorylation of ERK at Thr202/Thr204 and GSK-3beta at Ser9, and increased JNK phosphorylation at Thr183/Thr185 compared with their controls. All these data illustrate the biochemical complexity behind the genders, and may also aid in the development of more accurate treatment strategies for depression.
