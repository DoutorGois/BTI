Some central effects of cocaine administration seem to be related to angiotensin II (Ang II) or its metabolites. Nonetheless, it is still an open question whether or not the levels of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), the main Ang II generating enzyme, are modified by cocaine administration. To evaluate the effect of acute and subchronic cocaine administration on ACE activity and mRNA expression, male rats were randomly assigned to saline or cocaine group. Acute and subchronic cocaine administration induced a significant increase in ACE activity and mRNA expression in the frontal cortex and striatum but not in the hippocampus. These results suggest that some of the Ang II related effects of cocaine upon the central nervous system can be mediated by changes on the expression and activity of ACE in the striatum and frontal cortex.
