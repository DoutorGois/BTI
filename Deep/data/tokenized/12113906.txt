We investigated the relationship among neuroanatomical, neurochemical and genetic variables in 44 subjects with age-related memory impairment. Hydrogen magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to determine N-acetyl/creatine (NAA/Cr) concentrations in basal ganglia and medial temporal regions. Volumetric measures were obtained for caudate nucleus and hippocampus. Genetic polymorphisms examined included apolipoproteins (APO) E and CI, angiotensin converting enzyme and dopamine D2 receptor TaqI genes. Age was found to be negatively correlated with hippocampal and basal ganglia volumes, but not with neurochemical values. Multiple regression analyses showed that the APOC1 polymorphism was the only variable which predicted NAA/Cr values in basal ganglia. NAA/Cr metabolites in the medial temporal lobe but not in the basal ganglia region were related with lower performance in verbal memory.
