RDC8 (correction of RCD8), a recently cloned new putative member of the G protein-coupled receptor family protein, is exclusively present in the medium-sized neurons of the striatum. This restricted localisation mimics the major striatal dopamine D1 receptor localisation and is of major importance for the understanding of basal ganglia physiology and degenerative diseases pathogeny such as Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. RDC7, another putative G protein-coupled receptor chemically closely related to RDC8 (correction of RCD8), is mainly distributed in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus and the claustrum, and in the amygdala, and may represent the minor extra-striatal variant of the D1 receptor.
