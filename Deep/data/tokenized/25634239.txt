The snake neurotoxin alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-Bgtx) is a competitive antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and is widely used to study their function and cell-surface expression. Increasingly, alpha-Bgtx is also used as an imaging tool for fluorophore-labelling studies, and given the structural conservation within the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family, we assessed whether alpha-Bgtx could bind to recombinant and native gamma-aminobutyric type-A receptors (GABAARs). Applying fluorophore-linked alpha-Bgtx to recombinant alphaxbeta1/2gamma2 GABAARs expressed in HEK-293 cells enabled clear cell-surface labelling of alpha2beta1/2gamma2 contrasting with the weaker staining of alpha1/4beta1/2gamma2, and no labelling for alpha3/5/6beta1/2gamma2. The labelling of alpha2beta2gamma2 was abolished by bicuculline, a competitive antagonist at GABAARs, and by d-tubocurarine (d-Tc), which acts in a similar manner at nAChRs and GABAARs. Labelling by alpha-Bgtx was also reduced by GABA, suggesting that the GABA binding site at the receptor beta-alpha subunit interface forms part of the alpha-Bgtx binding site. Using whole-cell recording, high concentrations of alpha-Bgtx (20 muM) inhibited GABA-activated currents at all alphaxbeta2gamma2 receptors examined, but at lower concentrations (5 muM), alpha-Bgtx was selective for alpha2beta2gamma2. Using alpha-Bgtx, at low concentrations, permitted the selective inhibition of alpha2 subunit-containing GABAARs in hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells, reducing synaptic current amplitudes without affecting the GABA-mediated tonic current. In conclusion, alpha-Bgtx can act as an inhibitor at recombinant and native GABAARs and may be used as a selective tool to inhibit phasic but not tonic currents in the hippocampus.
