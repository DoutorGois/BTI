We compared the allele and genotype frequencies of SCN1A SNP rs3812718 between patients with MTLE-HS of south Indian ancestry with and without febrile seizures (FS) and with ethnically matched controls. While we observed no significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies of rs3812718 between MTLE-HS patients with and without FS, A allele and AA genotype were overrepresented in MTLE-HS patients when compared to controls. We conclude that in the population studied, although rs3812718 polymorphism increases the susceptibility to MTLE-HS, this is not by increasing the susceptibility to FS.
