In chronical experiments the ERG of 5 rabbits were recorded before and after stimulation of the hippocampus. Stimulation of the hippocampus causing short generalized afterdischarge produced changes of the b-wave amplitude. Immediately after the stimulation the b-wave amplitude was larger than the amplitude in the control series. If the intensity of hippocampal stimulation was lower (no generalized afterdischarges) changes of b-wave amplitude were also produced, though being less pronounced. The results suggest that retinal processes are influenced by hippocampus.
