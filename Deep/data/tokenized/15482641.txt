Twenty agonists and nine antagonists were evaluated for their ability to compete for [3H]-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]-8-OH-DPAT) binding to the cloned human serotonin-1A (ch-5-HT1A) receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and for their ability to alter adenylyl cyclase activity in the same cells. The most potent full agonists of high affinity included N,N-dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine (pEC50=9.6 +/- 0.1), MDL 73005EF (pEC50=9.3 +/- 0.2), 5-methyl-urapidil (pEC50=9.2 +/- 0.1), 5-carboxamidotryptamine (pEC50=9.1 +/- 0.2), R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (pEC50=8.6 +/- 0.1) and BMY-7378 (pEC50=8.6 +/- 0.1). WB-4101 (pEC50=8.3 +/- 0.2; IA=79%), clozapine (pEC50=8.1 +/- 0.3; IA=29%), (buspirone (pEC50=7.6 +/- 0.2; IA=79%), quipazine (pEC50 <5; IA=45%) and R-DOI (pEC50 < 5; IA=31%) were weaker agonists with partial agonist properties. The most potent antagonists were WAY-100,635 (pKi=10.2 +/- 0.1), methiothepin (pKi=8.8 +/- 0.2), spiperone (pKi=8.7 +/- 0.2) and NAN-190 (pKi=8.5 +/- 0.2). The receptor affinities and functional potencies were well correlated (r=0.88; P <0.0001). Our binding data correlated well with the pharmacology of endogenous 5-HT1A receptors in the rabbit iris-ciliary body (r=0.91; P <0.001) and rat hippocampus (r=0.93, P <0.0001). Our functional cAMP data correlated well with other cAMP accumulation data (r=0.8, P <0.01 vs calf hippocampus) but less so with [35S]-GTPgammaS binding to the ch-5-HT(1A) receptor as a functional activity read-out (r=0.58, P <0.05). The present study provides a detailed pharmacological characterization of the ch-5-HT1A receptor using binding and functional assays.
