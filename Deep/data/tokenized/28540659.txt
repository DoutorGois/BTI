The progressive decline of neurological functions, such as learning and memory, is an unavoidable consequence of aging. Our previous work suggested that the combination of physical exercise and a diet supplemented with diphenyl diselenide improves age-related memory decline in rats. The present study investigated the effects of physical exercise and a diet supplemented with diphenyl diselenide on the levels of proteins involved in the hippocampal neuroprotection to figure out the mechanisms related to the beneficial effects of this intervention in aged rats. Male Wistar rats (27 months old) were fed daily with standard chow supplemented with 1 ppm of diphenyl diselenide and subjected to swimming training with a workload (1% of body weight, 20 min/day) for 4 weeks. The hippocampus was dissected from the brain and used for the western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. The results of this study demonstrate that the association of diphenyl diselenide-supplemented diet and swimming exercise increased the levels of proteins involved in neuroprotection and decreased the activation of those related to apoptosis and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of old rats. This study suggests that physical exercise and a diet supplemented with (PhSe)2 promoted neuroprotection in the hippocampus of aged rats.
