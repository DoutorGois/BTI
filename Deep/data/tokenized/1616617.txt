Electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex (AC) was used as a conditioned stimulus (CS) in the rabbit conditioned eyeblink preparation to trace the functional anatomical connections between the AC and the circuitry underlying this conditioned response. Conditioning was shown to be dependent on the cerebellar interpositus nucleus and the pontine nuclei (PN), structures that are essential for conditioning using a peripheral CS. The results suggest that the cerebellum and associated brain stem circuitry are a necessary part of the memory trace circuit for the conditioned eyeblink response, even when the cerebral cortex is artifically engaged as a CS by electrical stimulation. The results also suggest that the PN are a site of convergence between the CS circuit subserving classical conditioning for peripheral stimuli and the AC, and may therefore be a site where the AC can modulate more elaborate forms of conditioning.
