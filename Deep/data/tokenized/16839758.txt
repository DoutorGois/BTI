Animal navigation is a complex process involving the integration of many sources of specialized sensory information for navigation in near and far space. Our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of near-space navigation is well-developed, whereas the neural mechanisms of long-distance navigation are just beginning to be unraveled. One crucial question for future research is whether the near space concepts of place cells, head direction cells, and maps in the entorhinal cortex scale up to animals navigating over very long distances and whether they are related to the map and compass concepts of long-distance navigation.
