The effects of chronic treatment with imipramine or lithium on serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes were analyzed in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and choroid plexus of rat brain by quantitative receptor autoradiographic procedures, using radioligands [3H]-5-HT, [3H]-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([3H]-8-OH-DPAT), [125I]-iodocyanopindolol ([125I]-CYP), [3H]-mesulergine and [125I]-7-amino-8-iodo-ketanserin ([125I]-ketanserin) or [3H]-spiperone. Chronic i.p. administration of imipramine (20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) decreased the densities of 5-HT1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and choroid plexus. Lithium (2 mEq/kg/day for 21 days) also decreased the densities of 5-HT1, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites in the frontal cortex, and the densities of those including 5-HT1A sites in the hippocampus and choroid plexus. Imipramine and lithium very markedly decreased the density of 5-HT1C sites in the choroid plexus. We propose that methods employing quantitative receptor autoradiographic analysis can be used to characterize and understand the local effects of these drugs on 5-HT receptor subtypes.
