Apoptosis in cultured rat hippocampal neurons was induced using the nitric oxide donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine, and cells were treated with the chloride channel blocker, 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. Results showed that the survival rate of neurons was significantly increased after treatment with 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, and the rate of apoptosis decreased. In addition, the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase-1 and apoptosis-inducing factor were significantly reduced. Our experimental findings indicate that the chloride channel blocker 4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid can antagonize apoptotic cell death of hippocampal neurons by inhibiting the expression of the apoptosis-related proteins poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)polymerase-1 and apoptosis-inducing factor.
