Microapplication of arecoline, nicotine, methamizil, and beta-ethydiphazil in unanesthetized immobilized rabbits through chemotrodes implanted into the head of nucleus caudatus, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, reticular formation and frontal cortex revealed inhibitory and activating effects of arecoline and nicotine. Specific antagonism between the effects of M- and N-cholinomimetics and between corresponding M- and N-cholinoblockers, was shown. Existence of M- and N-cholinoreactive biochemical systems with reciprocal relations is supposed in different zones of the striatum.
