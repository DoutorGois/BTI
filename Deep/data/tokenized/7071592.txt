Morphine administered intravenously causes immediate and complete abolition of a simple learned response (classically conditioned nictitating membrane extension in rabbit) and of the associated learning-induced increase in hippocampal neuron activity. Both effects are completely reversed by low doses of naloxone. Morphine has no effect at all on behavioral performance of the unconditioned reflex response.
