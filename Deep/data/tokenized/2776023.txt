The effect of a serotonin S2 antagonist, naftidrofuryl, on ischemic neuronal damage was examined in the gerbil. Naftidrofuryl was injected i.p. 5 min prior to a single 5-min forebrain ischemia or immediately after each of three 2-min forebrain ischemic insults at 60-min intervals. In both groups the number of intact hippocampal CA1 neurons were significantly higher than in the saline-treated group. These results indicate that serotonin S2 antagonists have a protective effect against ischemic neuronal damage.
