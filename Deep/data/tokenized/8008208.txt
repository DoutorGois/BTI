Postnatal development of ingrowing cholinergic and serotonergic fiber patterns were studied in the rat hippocampus and parietal cortex employing a histochemical procedure for acetylcholinesterase as a cholinergic fiber marker, and immunocytochemistry of serotonin for serotonergic fiber staining. The rat pups were killed at postnatal days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 20. The development of cholinergic and serotonergic innervation was described and the fiber density quantified under normal conditions and after long-term prenatal anemic hypoxia induced by chronic exposure to sodium nitrite. Furthermore, a third group was studied in which the nitrite hypoxia was combined with a simultaneous treatment with the Ca(2+)-entry blocker nimodipine to test the neuroprotective potential of this drug. Quantitative measurement of fiber density from postnatal day 1 to day 20 yielded the following results: (i) both neurotransmitter systems revealed an age-dependent and an anatomically-organized developmental pattern; (ii) the serotonergic innervation of the dorsal hippocampus preceded that of cholinergic afferentation in postnatal days 1-3; (iii) prenatal hypoxia induced a transient delay in the innervation of parietal neocortex and dentate gyrus for both neurotransmitter systems, but left the innervation of the cornu ammonis unaffected; and (iv) the hypoxia-induced retardation of cholinergic and serotonergic fiber development was prevented by concomitant application of the Ca(2+)-antagonist nimodipine during the hypoxia. The results indicate that prenatal hypoxia evokes a temporary delay in the cholinergic and serotonergic fiber outgrowth in cortical target areas in a region-specific manner. The hypoxia-induced growth inhibition is prevented by the calcium antagonist nimodipine, which supports the importance of the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis of cells and growth cones in regulating axonal proliferation.
