Adult mammalian brains are capable of some structural plasticity. Although the basic cellular mechanisms underlying learning and memory are being revealed, extrinsic factors contributing to this plasticity remain unspecified. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) are particularly well suited to investigate brain plasticity because they show marked seasonal changes in structure and function of the hippocampus induced by a distinct environmental signal, viz., photoperiod (i.e. the number of hours of light/day). Compared to animals maintained in 16 h of light/day, exposure to 8 h of light/day for 10 weeks induces several phenotypic changes in P. leucopus, including reduction in brain mass and hippocampal volume. To investigate the functional consequences of reduced hippocampal size, we examined the effects of photoperiod on spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze, and on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, a leading candidate for a synaptic mechanism underlying spatial learning and memory in rodents. Exposure to short days for 10 weeks decreased LTP in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway of the hippocampus and impaired spatial learning and memory ability in the Barnes maze. Taken together, these results demonstrate a functional change in the hippocampus in male white-footed mice induced by day length.
