We analyzed the effect of a new volatile anesthetic, sevoflurane (2%-5% in oxygen) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the neocortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), and brainstem reticular multiunit activity (R-MUA) in cats. Sevoflurane suppressed the background activity of the neocortex more than the amygdala and hippocampus. With increasing concentration of sevoflurane, the cortical EEG progressed from high-amplitude slow waves to a suppression-burst pattern, which was followed by an isoelectric pattern and then spikes with isoelectricity. The amplitude of the SEP was augmented and the R-MUA was suppressed by sevoflurane in a dose-related manner. Repetitive peripheral electrical stimulation induced generalized seizures at 5% sevoflurane in 2 of 13 cats. These results suggest that sevoflurane suppresses the background central nervous system electrical activities in a dose-related manner, leaving the reactive capabilities facilitated at deep anesthesia.
