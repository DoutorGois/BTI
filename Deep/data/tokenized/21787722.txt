The effects of aging and an ovariectomy operation on the brain-disrupting actions caused by prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) were studied in mice. In the young DES-exposed female mice, the level of hippocampal phosphorylated CaM kinase II (pCaMKII) was not changed. However, at 8 months, the level of hippocampal pCaMKII in the DES-exposed female mice significantly increased compared to control. Moreover, the ovariectomy significantly increased the level of pCaMKII in the hippocampus but not the cortex of DES-exposed female mice. These findings suggest that the influence of prenatally-exposed DES on the hippocampal pCaMKII may be affected by the endogenous female sex hormones such as estrogen.
