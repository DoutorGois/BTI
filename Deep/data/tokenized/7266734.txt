Young (4 to 7 years) and aged (18 to 28 years) rhesus monkeys were sacrificed and various neuromorphometric analyses performed to determine age differences in gross topography, cell population and patterns of cellular degeneration. Two brain regions implicated for their role in age-related cognitive disturbances, the hippocampus and the gyri bordering the principal sulcus in the frontal cortex were selected for these comparisons. Reliable morphometric differences between age groups were observed in both neural areas. One significant difference observed in the hippocampus was a reduced mean depth of the pyramidal layer of the CA-1 zone in the aged monkeys. Also, the mean number of neurons per transverse section in the CA-1 zone of the pyramidal layer was significantly less in the aged monkeys, and in certain instances cell gaps were observed in this region. In the lateral principal gyrus of the frontal cortex, the number of neurons in full-depth "cores" was lower in the old monkeys, glial count was higher and the ratio of neurons to neuroglia, therefore, lower in the older monkeys. Further, the mean area of the principal gyri, measured planimetrically from the apex of the medial gyrus to that of the lateral gyrus was significantly smaller in the aged monkeys. These findings indicate that significant age-dependent cellular differences occur in brain areas thought to be functionally involved in the particular cognitive behaviors most severely impaired in aged monkeys. These differences in brain morphology may, therefore, help provide some leads into the types of neurological changes contributing to the severe cognitive disorders suffered by the elderly.
