The present paper studied the effect and mechanism of neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) on spontaneous glutamate release using electrophysiological and biochemical methods combined with a pharmacological approach. The results suggested that PREGS had a selective enhancing effect on spontaneous glutamate release in the prelimbic cortex and the hippocampus but not in the striatum. The effect of PREGS in the prelimbic cortex appeared to be via modulation of alpha1-adrenergic and sigma1 receptors, but in the hippocampus it might be dependent on sigma1 receptors only. The activation of alpha1-adrenergic receptors synergized sigma1 receptor activation in the prelimbic cortex. Intracellular calcium released from the endoplasmic reticulum, protein kinase C, adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A played a key role in the effect of PREGS. Intracellular calcium, protein kinase C and adenylyl cyclase might be upstream events in the activation of protein kinase A after PREGS.
