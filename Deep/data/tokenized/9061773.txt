1. The MPCD method in freely moving rats is a new neuroscience technique. It is able to detect the location-specific firing of hippocampal place cells, and to deliver, via microdialysis, various drug solutions into the extracellular environment of the detected neurons. Place cells are critical elements of the neural system in brain which governs cognitive processes. It is emphasized in this article that effective cognition enhancer drugs must selectively and significantly affect the firing of these cells. 2. By using MPCD, it is possible to recognize drug combinations which can increase the location-specific firing of place cells to an optimal level. This paper proposes that such pharmacological action facilitates engram-creation in extrahippocampal cortical areas, improving cognitive functions. Thus, an MPCD-based research strategy may lead to the rational development of a new generation of cognition enhancer drugs for the treatment of learning and memory disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).
