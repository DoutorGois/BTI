To investigate the role of the head direction (HD) cell circuit in spatial navigation, rats with bilateral, neurotoxic lesions to the postsubiculum (PoS; Experiment 1) or the anterior dorsal nucleus of the thalamus (ADN; Experiment 2) were compared to sham controls on 2 tasks that could be solved using directional heading. Rats were first trained on a direction problem in a water T maze where they learned to travel either east or west from 2 locations in the experimental room. ADN lesioned rats were impaired relative to sham controls on the first block of 8 trials, but not on the total trials taken to reach criterion. This transient deficit was not observed in rats with lesions to the PoS. In the food-foraging task, rats were trained to leave a home cage at the periphery of a circular table, find food in the center of the table, and return to the home cage. Both PoS and ADN lesioned rats showed impairments on this task relative to sham rats, making more errors on the return component of the foraging trip. The spatial deficits produced by lesions to the PoS and the ADN, downstream structures in the HD cell circuit, are not as severe as those observed in earlier studies in rats with lesions to the dorsal tegmental nucleus.
