Non-pyramidal neurons in cat Ammon's horn were shown to send their axons to the supramammillary regions (SMR), i.e. the supramammillary nucleus and its vicinities including the supramammillary nucleus and the lateral, posterior and dorsal hypothalamic areas: wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injection into Ammon's horn resulted in labeling of presumed axon terminals in the SMR; and after injecting HRP into the SMR, retrogradely labeled non-pyramidal neurons were seen in Ammon's horn.
