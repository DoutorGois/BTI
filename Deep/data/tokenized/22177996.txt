Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neurodegenerative disease that involves cognitive decline and dementia. To model the hippocampal neurodegeneration and memory-related behavioral impairment that occurs in FTLD and other tau and TDP-43 proteinopathy diseases, we used an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector to induce bilateral expression of either microtubule-associated protein tau or transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) in adult rat dorsal hippocampus. Human wild-type forms of tau or TDP-43 were expressed. The vectors/doses were designed for moderate expression levels within neurons. Rats were evaluated for acquisition and retention in the Morris water task over 12 weeks after gene transfer. Neither vector altered acquisition performance compared to controls. In measurements of retention, there was impairment in the TDP-43 group. Histological examination revealed specific loss of dentate gyrus granule cells and concomitant gliosis proximal to the injection site in the TDP-43 group, with shrinkage of the dorsal hippocampus. Despite specific tau pathology, the tau gene transfer surprisingly did not cause obvious neuronal loss or behavioral impairment. The data demonstrate that TDP-43 produced mild behavioral impairment and hippocampal neurodegeneration in rats, whereas tau did not. The models could be of value for studying mechanisms of FTLD and other diseases with tau and TDP-43 pathology in the hippocampus including Alzheimer's disease, with relevance to early stage mild impairment.
