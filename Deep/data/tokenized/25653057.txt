Accurate positioning of primary mouse hippocampal neurons on electrodes enables the recording from and stimulation of specified individual neurons on a multi-electrode array (MEA). In this work, positive dielectrophoresis (DEP) is applied to actively recruit hippocampal neurons to the electrodes of a MEA, whereas microstructures such as chambers and trenches are created to effectively define a patterned neuronal network. We present here the effective pretreatment methods, to improve cytocompatibility of cured thin SU-8 epoxy, commonly used in the fabrication of MEAs. The functionality of our novel MEA is proven by the successful recording of spontaneous and stimulated neuronal potentials from primary hippocampal neurons, including the propagation of evoked neuronal bursts between electrodes.
