The incidence of ischemic stroke is significantly increased in postmenopausal women. However, the neuroprotective effects of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) against stroke remain controversial, and the role of astrocytes in ERT has rarely been explored. In this study, we investigated the effects of estrogen and selective estrogen receptor (ER) agonists on astrocytes activation and neuronal apoptosis in mice under conditions of cell culture oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD-R), and global cerebral ischemia (GCI). We demonstrated that hippocampal astrocytes primarily express ERbeta. In astrocytes, 2.5-20 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2) or 10 nM DPN (ERbeta agonist) not 10 nM PPT (ERalpha agonist), significantly increased GFAP expression. And 10 nM E2, DPN or E2+MPP (ERalpha antagonist), but not PPT or E2+PHTPP (ERbeta antagonist), significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis following the subjection of astrocyte and neuronal cocultures to OGD-R. We also found that either 50 mug/kg E2 or 8 mg/kg DPN replacement (3 weeks) significantly increased GFAP expression and reduced GCI-induced neuronal apoptosis in hippocampal CA1 region of ovariectomized mice. These results indicate that estrogen-induced neuroprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury involves activation of astrocytes via ERbeta. Thus, the discovery and design of astrocyte-selective ERbeta modulators may offer a new strategy for ERT of ischemic stroke.
