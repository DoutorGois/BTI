PURPOSE: To evaluate the antiepileptic and neuroprotective properties of topiramate (TPM) alone and with coadministration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist budipine in a rat model of refractory status epilepticus. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats had electrodes implanted into the perforant path and dentate granule cell layer of the hippocampus under halothane anesthesia. Approximately 1 week after surgery, the perforant path of each animal was electrically stimulated for 2 h to induce self-sustaining status epilepticus. Successfully stimulated rats were given intraperitoneally vehicle (n = 6), TPM (20-320 mg/kg; n = 28), budipine (10 mg/kg; n = 5), or budipine (10 mg/kg) and TPM (80 mg/kg; n = 6) 10 min after the end of the stimulation and monitored behaviorally and electroencephalographically for a further 3 h. The animals were killed 14 days later, and histopathology was assessed. RESULTS: Neither budipine alone nor TPM at any dose terminated status epilepticus. Despite this, TPM resulted in various degrees of neuroprotection at doses between 40 and 320 mg/kg. Coadministration of budipine with TPM terminated the status epilepticus in all rats. This combination also significantly improved the behavioral profile and prevented status-induced cell death compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Budipine and TPM are an effective drug combination in stopping self-sustained status epilepticus, and TPM alone was neuroprotective, despite the continuation of seizure activity.
