In human temporal lobe epilepsy, a dispersion of dentate granule cells is frequently described in adults who had an early risk factor. To elucidate the role of glia in this phenomenon, we investigated neuronal dispersion, astrocyte organization and expression of intermediate filaments of mature and immature astrocytes (i.e. glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, respectively) in seven subjects with early febrile seizures (F(+)) and five subjects with other etiologies than febrile seizures (F(-)). Compared to F(-) patients, a majority of F(+) subjects showed neuronal dispersion and vimentin expression in radial glia. However, in two patients with the maximal dispersion, radial processes expressed only GFAP. We suggest that granule cell migration that occurs in adult epileptic focus results from the transient occurrence of immature-like glia throughout the granular layer.
