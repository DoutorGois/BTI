A single drug-free experience in the elevated plus-maze is well documented to reduce the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines (BZs) in subsequent tests. To ascertain the possible role of altered BZ receptor binding to in this phenomenon, rats received a 5-min exposure to the elevated plus maze and were immediately sacrificed. Receptor autoradiography revealed that [3H]flunitrazepam binding was significantly elevated in several amygdaloid and hippocampal nuclei (range: 13-23%); [3H]muscimol binding in adjacent sections was not significantly altered. These results suggest that BZ receptors can change very rapidly in response to anxiogenic conditions. However, the unexpected finding that [3H]flunitrazepam binding is increased by maze exposure suggests that the subsequent loss of BZ anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze is probably unrelated to alterations in BZ binding in brain.
