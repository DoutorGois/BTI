Glutamate (Glu) is associated with excitotoxic cell damage. Memantine modulates the glutamate induced excitotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). No information is available as to the influence of memantine on in vivo brain glutamate levels. Hippocampal Glu levels were measured in cognitively impaired and normal individuals (n=10) before and after 6 months of memantine treatment, using three dimensional high spatial resolution (0.5 cm(3) voxels) proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T. These measurements were also repeated in a non-treated cognitively normal group (n=6). Treatment with memantine decreased Glu/Cr (creatine) ratio in the left hippocampal region. Memantine reduced hippocampal glutamate levels, which may be consistent with its anti-excitotoxic property.
