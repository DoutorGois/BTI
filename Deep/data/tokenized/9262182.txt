The salicylate-trapping method was used to detect hydroxyl radicals by measurement of stable adduct dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA). Ten minutes of forebrain ischemia followed by reperfusion induced the increase in DHBA in rat hippocampal perfusates. Postischemic treatment with a free radical scavenger, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (MCI-186), significantly reduced the increase in DHBA and suppressed delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region.
