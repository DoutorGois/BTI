The present study found expressions of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on hippocampal slices and hippocampal astrocytes using double immunofluorescence stainings. Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein in the cultured hippocampal slices and hippocampal astrocytes significantly increased, and levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, RANTES, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased in the supernatant of cultured astrocytes following exposure to 200 nM amyloid beta protein 1-42. Preconditioning of 10 muM nicotine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, could attenuate the influence of amyloid beta protein 1-42 in inflammatory mediator secretion of cultured astrocytes. Experimental findings indicated that alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was expressed on the surface of hippocampal astrocytes, and activated alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was shown to inhibit inflammation induced by amyloid beta protein 1-42.
