Nerve growth factor is a neurotrophic protein which is known to act on sympathetic and sensory neurons and on the magnocellular cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. We quantified nerve growth factor in human tissue and body fluids by two methods, a rapid and sensitive two-site immunoenzymometric assay and a bioassay using dissociated chick dorsal root ganglion neurons. The two-site immunoenzymometric assay detects nerve growth factor in concentrations as low as 0.5-2.5 ng/l. Using a monoclonal antibody to mouse nerve growth factor, we found that the signal of the antibody for recombinant human nerve growth factor is about 60-90% of the signal for mouse nerve growth factor. As a control for the specificity of our data, a bioassay for nerve growth factor was performed and the results showed a good correlation. The highest nerve growth factor concentrations were found in sciatic nerve (2.5 ng/g wet weight), cardiac atrium muscle (1.5 ng/g wet weight) and in the central nervous system in the hippocampus (1.9 ng/g wet weight). Lower nerve growth factor concentrations were measured in human sera (0.2 ng/g wet weight). No nerve growth factor was detectable in cerebrospinal fluid. The distribution of human nerve growth factor-rich tissues is similar to that reported for rat tissues.
