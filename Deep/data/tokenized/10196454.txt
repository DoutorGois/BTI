The effects of a low or high concentration of glucose in the perfusion medium on synaptic activity and plasticity were studied in hippocampal slices from rats. Low-glucose medium depressed the field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP) significantly, whereas high-glucose medium had little effect on the fEPSP. Tetanization of the afferent fibres elicited significant potentiation (LTP) of synaptic activity irrespective of the glucose concentration in the medium. This may indicate that LTP induction does not depend on optimal neural transmission. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) experiments showed that the medium glucose concentration did not significantly influence potentiation of the second response.
