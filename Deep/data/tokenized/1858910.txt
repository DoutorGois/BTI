Microvascular bed structure and functions are known to vary throughout the brain. Microvascular responses to high doses of pentobarbital sodium might therefore differ among brain areas. This possibility was examined by measuring local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) with [14C]iodoantipyrine in 52 brain areas at 5, 10, 25, and 60 min after intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). From 5 to 60 min, LCBF was significantly lowered in 17 of 25 forebrain gray matter areas but in only 1 of 18 hindbrain gray matter structures, the pontine nuclei. Smaller, shorter duration lowering of LCBF was also observed in ten other brain areas. In both control and treated rats, LCBF was found to vary within individual brain structures. The pattern of these LCBF variations was columnar in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus but was patchy in the caudate-putamen, thalamus, and inferior colliculus. These results indicate that pentobarbital anesthesia more strongly alters LCBF in the forebrain than in the hindbrain and produces different patterns of changes in LCBF than in local cerebral glucose utilization, which was measured with 2-deoxyglucose in a companion study.
