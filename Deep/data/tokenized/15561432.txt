Like estrogens in female rats, androgens can affect dendritic spine density in the CA1 subfield of the male rat hippocampus [J Neurosci 23:1588 (2003)]. Previous light microscopic studies have shown that androgen receptors (ARs) are present in the nuclei of CA1 pyramidal cells. However, androgens may also exert their effects through rapid non-genomic mechanisms, possibly by binding to membranes. Thus, to investigate whether ARs are at potential extranuclear sites of ARs, antibodies to ARs were localized by light and electron microscopy in the male rat hippocampal formation. By light microscopy, AR immunoreactivity (-ir) was found in CA1 pyramidal cell nuclei and in disperse, punctate processes that were most dense in the pyramidal cell layer. Additionally, diffuse AR-ir was found in the mossy fiber pathway. Ultrastructural analysis revealed AR-ir at several extranuclear sites in all hippocampal subregions. AR-ir was found in dendritic spines, many arising from pyramidal and granule cell dendrites. AR-ir was associated with clusters of small, synaptic vesicles within preterminal axons and axon terminals. Labeled preterminal axons were most prominent in stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. AR-containing terminals formed asymmetric synapses or did not form synaptic junctions in the plane of section analyzed. AR-ir also was detected in astrocytic profiles, many of which apposed terminals synapsing on unlabeled dendritic spines or formed gap junctions with other AR-labeled or unlabeled astrocytes. Collectively, these results suggest that ARs may serve as both a genomic and non-genomic transducer of androgen action in the hippocampal formation.
