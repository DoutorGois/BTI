Kindled seizures developed in rats following repeated electrical stimulation of the left CA1 region of the hippocampus. Two weeks after the final kindled seizure, the densities of dopamine (DA) D2 receptors were assayed in the left and right amygdaloid area, nucleus accumbens, and nucleus caudatus. A significant increase (107%) in the density of DA D2-receptors in the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens occurred. This finding may help to define the long-term neurochemical consequences of kindling.
