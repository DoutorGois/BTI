Studies have shown that the protective effect of carbamazepine (CBZ) on seizure-induced neuronal injury. However, its precise mechanisms remain unknown. Here, to investigate the neuroprotective mechanism of CBZ against seizure-induced neuronal cell death, we identified the change of gene expressions by CBZ in the hippocampus of kainic acid (KA)-treated mice using microarray method, and studied the involvement of candidate gene in neuroprotective action of CBZ. KA (15 mg/kg) and/or CBZ (30 mg/kg, 0.5 h after KA exposure) were injected intraperitoneally into mice. Through microarray analysis, we found that signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) gene expression was upregulated in the hippocampal CA3 region, 24 h after KA injection (15 mg/kg), and that CBZ further elevated Stat3 expression in KA-treated mice. KA also increased the protein level and phosphorylation of Stat3, and CBZ further increased the Stat3 phosphorylation, without changing Stat3 protein level in KA-treated mice. In particular, phospho-Stat3 immunoreactivity (IR) by KA was shown in astrocytes rather than in neurons; whereas phospho-Stat3 IR by CBZ in KA-treated mice was observed predominantly in neurons, and also in neuroprotective protein Bcl-xL-expression cells. These results indicate that Stat3 may play an important role in neuroprotective action of CBZ on seizure-induced neuronal injury.
