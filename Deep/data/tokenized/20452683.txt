We investigated the correlation between memory impairment and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in adult rats submitted to experimental meningitis (Streptococcus pneumoniae) in the neonatal period. Sixty days after inoculation the animals were submitted to the behavior tasks and hippocampal BDNF protein were evaluated. In the meningitis group, there was impairment in habituation and avoidance memory and a decrease in the BDNF levels. The decrease in hippocampal BDNF levels correlated to impairment in memory in adult animals submitted to experimental meningitis in the neonatal period.
