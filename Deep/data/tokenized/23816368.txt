OBJECTIVE: Accumulating evidence indicates that curcumin potently protects against beta-amyloid (Abeta) due to its oxygen free radicals scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties. However, cellular mechanisms that may underlie the neuroprotective effect of curcumin in Abeta-induced toxicity are not fully understood yet. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms involved in neuroprotective effects of curcumin, particularly involving Wnt/beta-catenin and PI3K pathways. METHODS: Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were treated with curcumin and exposed to Abeta1-42 for 48 hours. Synaptic dysfunction, cell death, ROS formation, neuroinflammation and beta-catenin, Akt, and GSK-3beta phosphorylation were measured to determine the effects of curcumin against Abeta toxicity. RESULTS: Curcumin significantly attenuated Abeta-induced cell death, loss of synaptophysin, and ROS generation. Furthermore, curcumin was able to decrease IL-6 release and increase IL-10 release, and prevented glial activation. The phosphorylation of beta-catenin was avoided and the levels of free beta-catenin were increased by curcumin to promote cell survival upon treatment with Abeta. Curcumin, in the presence of Abeta, activated Akt which in turn phosphorylates GSK-3beta, and resulted in the inhibition of GSK-3beta. The presence of LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K pathway, blocked the pro-survival effect of curcumin. DISCUSSION: These results reinforce the neuroprotective effects of curcumin on Abeta toxicity and add some evidence that its mechanism may involve beta-catenin and PI3K signaling pathway in organotypic hippocampal slice culture.
