The origin of hippocampal afferent projections was studied after horseradish peroxidase injections into the hippocampal formation. Labeled cells were found in the dorsal and ventrolateral aspects of the interpeduncular nucleus and in the ipsilateral portion of the nucleus reuniens thalami. In addition, neurons containing HRP were observed in the cortical, hypothalamic and brain stem areas reported by previous investigators.
