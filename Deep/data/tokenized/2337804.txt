Intrahippocampal injections of colchicine selectively destroy dentate granule cells. Wet dog shaking elicited by perforant path stimulation is unaffected by bilateral destruction of dorsal dentate granule cells but virtually eliminated by bilateral destruction of ventral dentate granule cells. This implies that ventral dentate granule cells are essential for the generation of perforant path stimulation-induced wet dog shakes.
