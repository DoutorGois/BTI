Rat cortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells were immunocytochemically investigated using the TU-01 monoclonal antibody recognizing alpha-tubulin. The isotypic specificity of this antibody is distinct from that of other available alpha-tubulin antibodies; therefore, an intracellular heterogeneity among neuronal microtubules could be revealed by observing intensely immunostained apical dendritic microtubules in the complete absence of staining of the microtubules in the basal dendrites and perikarya of the same pyramidal cells.
