Intrathecal (IT) recombinant human alpha-l-iduronidase (rhIDU) has been shown to reduce mean brain glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) to normal levels in mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) dogs. In this study, we examined storage in neuroanatomical regions of the MPS I dog brain, including frontal lobe, cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampal formation, and brainstem, to determine the response of these functional regions to treatment with IT rhIDU. GAG storage in untreated MPS I dogs was significantly different from normal dogs in all examined sections. GAG levels in normal dogs varied by region: frontal lobe (mean: 2.36 +/- 0.54 mug/mg protein), cerebellum (2.67 +/- 0.33), basal ganglia and thalamus (3.51 +/- 0.60), hippocampus (3.30 +/- 0.40), and brainstem (3.73 +/- 1.10). Following IT treatment, there was a reduction in GAG storage in each region in all treatment groups, except for the brainstem. Percent reduction in GAG levels from untreated to treated MPS I dogs in the deeper regions of the brain was 30% for basal ganglia and thalamus and 30% for hippocampus, and storage reduction was greater in superficial regions, with 61% reduction in the frontal lobe and 54% in the cerebellum compared with untreated MPS I dogs. Secondary lipid storage in neurons was also reduced in frontal lobe, but not in the other brain regions examined. Response to therapy appeared to be greater in more superficial regions of the brain, particularly in the frontal lobe cortex.
