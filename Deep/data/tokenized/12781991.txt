We have examined the expression of the immunophilin FKBP12 in adult rat intrinsic CNS neurons stimulated to regenerate axons by the implantation of segments of autologous tibial nerve into the thalamus or cerebellum. After survival times of 3 days to 6 weeks, the brains were fresh-frozen. In some animals the regenerating neurons were retrogradely labelled with cholera toxin subunit B 1 day before they were killed. Sections through the thalamus or cerebellum were used for in situ hybridization with digoxygenin-labelled riboprobes for FKBP12 or immunohistochemistry to detect cholera toxin subunit B-labelled neurons. FKBP12 was constitutively expressed by many neurons, and was very strongly expressed in the hippocampus and by Purkinje cells. Regenerating neurons were found in the thalamic reticular nucleus and deep cerebellar nuclei of animals that received living grafts. Neurons in these nuclei upregulated FKBP12 mRNA; such neurons were most numerous at 3 days post grafting but were most strongly labelled at 2 weeks post grafting. Regenerating neurons identified by retrograde labelling were found to have upregulated FKBP12 mRNA. No upregulation was seen in neurons in animals that received freeze-killed grafts, which do not support axonal regeneration. We conclude that FKBP12 is a regeneration-associated gene in intrinsic CNS neurons.
