The generation of new neurons within the dentate gyrus of the mature hippocampus is critical for spatial learning, object recognition and memory, whereas new neurons born in the subventricular zone (SVZ) contribute to olfactory function. Adult neurogenesis is a multistep process that begins with the activation and proliferation of a pool of stem/precursor cells. Although the presence of self-renewing and multipotent neural precursors is well established in the SVZ, it is only recently that the existence of such a precursor population has been demonstrated in the hippocampus, the region of the brain involved in learning and memory. Determining how this normally latent pool can be activated therefore offers considerable potential for the development of targeted neurogenic-based therapeutics to ameliorate the cognitive decline associated with hippocampal dysfunction in several neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we summarize the effects of neural activity, various molecular factors and pharmaceutical agents, as well as voluntary exercise, in activating endogenous neural precursors in the two neurogenic niches of the adult brain, and highlight the role of activation-driven enhancement of neurogenesis for the treatment of psychiatric illness and aging dementia.
