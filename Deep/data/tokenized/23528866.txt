Excitotoxicity is involved in neurodegenerative conditions. We investigated the pathological significance of a surge in prostaglandin production immediately after kainic acid (KA) administration [initial phase], followed by a sustained moderate elevation in prostaglandin level [late phase] in the hippocampus of juvenile rats. Numerous pyknotic hippocampal neurons were observed 72 h after KA treatment; this number remained elevated on days 10 and 30. Gross hippocampal atrophy was observed on days 10 and 30. Pre-treatment with indomethacin ameliorated neuronal death on days 10 and 30, and prevented hippocampal atrophy on day 30. Microglial response was moderated by the indomethacin pre-treatment. Blockade of only late-phase prostaglandin production by post-treatment with indomethacin ameliorated neuronal death on day 30. These findings suggest a role for initial-phase prostaglandin production in chronic progressive neuronal death, which is exacerbated by late-phase prostaglandin production. Blockade of prostaglandin production has therapeutic implications in preventing long-term neurological sequelae following excitotoxic brain damage.
