OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the CNS of adult rhesus monkey. METHODS: Frozen sections were incubated in specific polyclonal anti-EGF antibody by the immunohistochemical SP method. RESULTS: The EGF immunopositive reaction was observed in the plasma of neurons. The neurons with strong positive immuno-reaction signals were detected in cerebral cortex, cerebellar Purkinje cells, cerebellar nuclei, pyramidal neurons of hippocampus, caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus, claustrum, nuclei in diencephalons, substantia nigra, cranial nerve nuclei, reticular formation in brain stem, pontine nuclei, red nucleus, superior and inferior olivary nucleus, gracile nucleus, cuneate nucleus, also the ventral horn, lateral horn, dorsal horn and the central gray matter in spinal cord. Furthermore, a few EGF immunopositive glias and fibres were observed in some white matter of central nervous system. CONCLUSION: EGF immunoreactive material was extensively distributed in the CNS of the adult rhesus monkey. The results suggest that EGF may be concerned with various types of neurons and other cells.
