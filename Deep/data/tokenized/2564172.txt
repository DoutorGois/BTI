The relationship between long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission and the release of endogenous glutamate and aspartate has been investigated in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and in the fascia dentata of the anaesthetized rat. A high-frequency train of electrical stimulation of afferent pathways produced a long lasting (greater than 2 h) enhancement of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential in CA1 and of the population spike in the fascia dentata. In both regions, this was not associated with a significant long lasting increase in the release of glutamate and aspartate. It is concluded that the maintenance of long-term potentiation is not associated with a sustained increase in the release of excitatory amino acids.
