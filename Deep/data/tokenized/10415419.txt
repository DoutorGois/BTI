Recent evidence indicates that the hippocampus uses input from the vestibular system in order to accomplish its spatial computational functions. At present, there are few data on the neurochemical basis of the interactions between the vestibular system and the hippocampus. The aim of this study was to determine levels of noradrenaline (NA), serotonin (5-HT) and the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in the CA1, CA2 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi, at 10 h following deafferentation of the peripheral vestibular nerve (UVD) in guinea pig, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection (ECD). There were no significant differences in NA levels in the ipsilateral or contralateral CA1 following UVD. However, there was a significant increase in NA levels in the contralateral CA2 following UVD, compared to both the sham and intact anesthetic control conditions (p<0.05). No such change was seen in the ipsilateral CA2. In the contralateral DG, there was a significant increase in NA levels in both the UVD and sham conditions, compared to the intact anesthetic controls (p<0.05). No significant changes in 5-HT or 5-HIAA levels were seen in the ipsilateral or contralateral CA1, CA2 or DG following UVD. This study provides the first evidence that UVD may cause an increase in NA levels in the CA2 region of the contralateral hippocampus.
