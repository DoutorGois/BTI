A pressing clinical question is how acute ethanol exposure might alter the outcome of a simultaneous transient ischemic attack (TIA), since ethanol is known to dysregulate key intermediary metabolites post-ischemia. Mongolian gerbils were administered ethanol (1 or 4 g/kg, s.c.) 1 hour before induction of transient ischemia, via bilateral carotid occlusions of 5 minutes duration. A control group was administered isotonic saline and rendered ischemic. All animals were maintained normothermic during the ischemic procedure. Subjects underwent behavioral assay of acquisition to the water maze 7 days after recovery from the surgery, and neuropathological examination 1-month after the ischemic brain insult. There were no behavioral or neuropathological between-group differences suggesting that mechanisms other than adverse ethanol-induced perturbations of ischemic processes predominate in mediating epidemiological findings of elevated stroke morbidity with high ethanol consumption.
