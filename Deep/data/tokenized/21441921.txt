Amyloid-beta(1-42) (Abeta) is thought to be a major mediator of the cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. The ability of Abeta to inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation provides a cellular correlate of this action, but the underlying molecular mechanism is only partially understood. We found that a signaling pathway involving caspase-3, Akt1 and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta is an important mediator of this effect in rats and mice.
