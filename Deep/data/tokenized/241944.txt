In mice, Arecoline in vivo dose-dependently increased the cGMP concentrations of the cerebellum and the "cereberum" (= parts of cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum and midbrain) without influencing thecAMP levels. The cholinesterase inhibitors paraoxon and physostigmine caused an elevation only in "cerebrum", whereas the cGMP content of the cerebellum even decreased. Pretreatment with atropine prevented the rise in cGMP levels as well as the symptoms of cholinergic stimulation elicited by arecoline or paraoxon. Diazepam reduced cGMP levels below control values and blocked the effect of arecoline, while typical symptoms due to arecoline, e.g., tremor and salivation remained unaffected. The tripeptide prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (MIF) had no effect on either cGMP values or the peripheral signs of cholinergic stimulation elicited by arecoline. The results show that elevation of cGMP in the central nervous system caused by cholinomimetic agents can be prevented not only by cholinolytics, blocking muscarinic receptors but also by influencing other mechanisms to be discussed.
