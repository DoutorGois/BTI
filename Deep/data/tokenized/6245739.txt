The effect of hydrocortisone and DOCA on the cAMP content in the hypothalamus, hippocampus and striate body of the rat brain was investigated. Single (determined after 1 and 24 hours) and repeated (7 days) hydrocortison administration in a dose of 5 mg/100 g body weight was accompanied by an increase in the cAMP concentration in the brain structures under study. Single administration of DOCA in a dose of 0.5 mg/100 g body weight did not produce any changes in the cAMP level in the structures of the rat brain limbic system; however, the dose of 2.5 mg raised the cAMP level. Prolonged administration of the hormone in the above doses dod not change the cAMP level in the brain structures. Only the hippocampus showed a 210% increase in the cAMP level during DOCA administration in a dose of 0.5 mg.
