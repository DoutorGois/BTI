The regional distribution of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB)/chloride-insensitive L-[3H]glutamate binding sites in the rat central nervous system was compared with that of APB/chloride-sensitive and with sodium-dependent binding sites. The distribution of APB-sensitive and APB-insensitive sites was not correlated, but the latter was identical to that of the sodium-dependent sites. The pharmacological specificity of the APB-insensitive sites was not consistent with that of an N-methylaspartate-preferring receptor, and was also different from the specificity determined for the sodium-dependent sites. The APB-insensitive sites appear to be unrelated to any other previously described excitatory amino acid binding site.
