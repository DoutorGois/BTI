The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play critical roles in neuronal transmission and modulation. Among the diverse nAChRs, the alpha7 subtype has been considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating cognitive deficits associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Although a number of mechanisms including neurotransmitter and biochemical effects linking alpha7 nAChR activation and cognitive function are beginning to be described, the underlying molecular processes especially following repeated administration remain unclear. To address this, we have performed gene expression analysis in rats treated with nicotine and a selective alpha7 nAChR agonist, PNU-282987. Our results showed significant overlap in gene expression changes induced by PNU-282987 and nicotine, suggesting convergent pathways triggered by these compounds. Treatment with nicotine also resulted in regulation of a number of genes that were not regulated by PNU-282987, consistent with the interaction of nicotine with other nAChRs beyond the alpha7 subtype. Interestingly, these gene expression changes were observed 24 h post-dose, suggesting that both nicotine and PNU-282987 cause protracted changes in gene expression. Overall, our results identify gene expression changes that may contribute to further defining the roles of nAChR activation in cognitive function.
