Double-stranded RNA-binding proteins function in regulating the stability, translation, and localization of specific mRNAs. In this study, we have demonstrated that the neuron-specific, calcium-binding protein, visinin-like protein (VILIP) contains one double-stranded RNA-binding domain, a protein motif conserved among many double-stranded RNA-binding proteins. We showed that VILIP can specifically bind double-stranded RNA, and this interaction specifically requires the presence of calcium. Mobility shift studies indicated that VILIP binds double-stranded RNA as a single protein-RNA complex with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of 9.0 x 10(-6) M. To our knowledge, VILIP is the first double-stranded RNA-binding protein shown to be calcium-dependent. Furthermore, VILIP specifically binds the 3'-untranslated region of the neurotrophin receptor, trkB, an mRNA localized to hippocampal dendrites in an activity-dependent manner. Given that VILIP is also expressed in the hippocampus, these data suggest that VILIP may employ a novel, calcium-dependent mechanism to regulate its binding to important localized mRNAs in the central nervous system.
