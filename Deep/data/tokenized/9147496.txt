Previous research has found structural and functional abnormalities in the temporal lobes of schizophrenic patients, often with greater impairment on the left side. This study applied proton MRS to both right and left temporal lobes of schizophrenic patients and normal control subjects. Reductions in the NAA/Cr ratio were found bilaterally for schizophrenic patients as compared to normal controls, and may be associated with reduced neuronal integrity. These results strengthen the evidence for biochemical abnormalities in the temporal lobes in schizophrenia.
