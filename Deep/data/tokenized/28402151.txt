We aimed to investigate the effect and mechanisms of tanshinone (TSN) IIA in cerebral infarction. The cerebral infarction rat model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After pretreatment with TSN, cerebral infarct volume, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits score were evaluated, as well as cell apoptosis in hippocampus and cortex of the brain was examined with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In addition, rat primary neuronal cells were isolated and cultured in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions. After pretreatment with TSN, cell viability and apoptosis were observed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expressions of Bax and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting. Compared with untreated cerebral infarction rat, TSN treatment significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits score ( P < 0.05). Cell apoptosis as well as the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP in hippocampus and cortex of cerebral infarction rat were inhibited after pretreatment with TSN ( P < 0.05). Furthermore, TSN remarkably increased cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis ratio ( P < 0.05) in OGD-induced rat neuronal cells. Besides, TSN significantly downregulated the expression of Bax and upregulated Bcl-2 ( P < 0.05). TSN IIA has a preventive effect on cerebral infarction by inhibiting neuronal cell apoptosis and inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo.
