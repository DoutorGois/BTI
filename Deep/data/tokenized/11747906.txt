The present study generated a polyclonal antibody (AP86/3) that recognises a peptide sequence of the h5-HT(3B) receptor subunit. Western blot analysis of homogenates prepared from cell lines expressing either homomeric (h5-HT(3A)) or heteromeric (h5-HT(3A/3B)) receptors, as well as immunocytochemical studies with the same cell lines, indicated that AP86/3 recognised, selectively, the 5-HT(3B) subunit. Immunohistochemical labelling was also apparent in cells in the rat hippocampus that displayed the distribution and morphology of interneurones.
