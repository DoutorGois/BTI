Aim. To determine whether Zuogui Jiangtang Jieyu prescription (ZGJTJY) has hypoglycemic and antidepressant effects which are mediated by corticosterone through adjustment of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) and glucocorticoid (GR) levels. Materials and Methods. The diabetes-related depression rats were randomly divided into four groups: the model group, metformin (1.8 mg/kg) combined with fluoxetine (10.8 mg/kg) group, and ZGJTJY high and low dose groups. Four weeks after modeling, blood glucose, behavior, and cognitive function of depression were detected. The expressions of 11beta-HSD1 and GR in hippocampus were measured by western blotting and immunohistochemical experiments. Results. We found that (1) the treatment with ZGJTJY (10.26 g/kg) increases the motor activities and improves cognition ability. (2) ZGJTJY (10.26 g/kg) significantly relieves the disorder in blood and the relative indexes. (3) ZGJTJY (10.26 g/kg) can reduce hippocampal corticosterone expression levels and further improve hippocampus pathological changes. (4) ZGJTJY increased the expression of GR accompanied with decreasing 11beta-HSD1 in hippocampus. Conclusions. ZGJTJY inhibits the expression of 11beta-HSD1 and increases GR in hippocampus and subsequently modulates blood glucose levels, and therefore it is potential property that ZGJTJY could be of benefit for the treatment of behavior and cognitive function of diabetes-related depression.
