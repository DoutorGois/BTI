The question that we deal with in this commentary is the need to clarify the synergistic role of different non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages (stages 2 and 3-4) with REM and while awake in elaborative encoding of episodic memory. If the assumption is that there is isomorphism between neuronal and cognitive networks, then more detailed analysis of NREM sleep and dreams is absolutely necessary.
