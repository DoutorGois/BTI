Carbon monoxide (CO) is considered to be a novel neuronal messenger in the brain, similar to nitric oxide. The ontogeny of CO formation in transverse hippocampal slices of the guinea pig was elucidated at selected prenatal and postnatal ages, and the effect of in vitro ethanol exposure on hippocampal CO formation was determined. There was a higher rate of hippocampal CO formation in the fetus at gestational day (GD) 50 and GD 62 (term, about GD 68) compared with the adult. In vitro ethanol exposure (50 and 100 mM) decreased hippocampal CO formation in the GD 62 fetus, which was prevented by incubation with 500 microM L-glutamate.
