Rats with experimental Parkinson's syndrome induced by seven-day intraperitoneal administration of rotenone at a dose of 2.75 mg/kg have an increased activity of prolylendopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26, PREP) in blood serum and a decreased activity of adenosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.4, ADA) in serum and in the prefrontal cortex. PREP and ADA activity in other brain structures (in the striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus) did not change; dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity (EC 3.4.14.5, DPP-4, CD26) also remained constant in serum and in all the brain structures investigated. Afobazole and levodopa, which exhibit antiparkinsonian activity in this model of Parkinson's syndrome, decrease elevated PREP activity in serum and increase reduced ADA activity in the prefrontal cortex of rats with the experimental pathology. Meanwhile, treatment with the study drugs was associated with a decrease of ADA activity in the other brain structures.
