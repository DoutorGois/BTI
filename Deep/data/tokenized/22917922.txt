The present study showed a wide presence of CCL28 in mouse CNS, including cerebral, cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. In hippocampus, the expression of CCL28 at both mRNA and protein level was clarified. The CCL28 expression was mainly localized in pyramidal cells of CA area, granular cells of dentate gyrus and some interneurons in CA area and hilus. Double-labelling immunocytochemistry revealed that most of calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin immunopositive neurons expressed CCL28. During and after pilocarpine induced status epilepticus (SE), a down-regulated expression of CCL28 in hippocampal interneurons in the CA1 area and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus was demonstrated. The present study may, therefore provide evidence that CCL28 may have a novel role in CNS and may be involved in the loss of hippocampal interneurons, and subsequent disinhibition of pyramidal neurons.
