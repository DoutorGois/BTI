The diverse effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are mediated through interaction with G-protein coupled receptors. Pharmacological analysis suggests the Y1 receptor mediates several of NPY's central and peripheral actions. We sought to determine the distribution of Y1 protein throughout the rat central nervous system by means of indirect immunofluorescence using the tyramide signal amplification method and a novel, amino terminally-directed Y1 antisera. This antisera was verified as specific for Y1 by solution-phase competition ELISA, Western blot and in situ blocking experiments. High concentrations of Y1 immunoreactivity were found in the claustrum, piriform cortex (superficial layer), arcuate hypothalamic nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, paratrigeminal nucleus, and lamina II of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and entire spinal cord. Moderate levels of Y1 immunoreactivity were found the in the main olfactory bulb, dorsomedial part of suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventral nucleus of lateral lemniscus, pontine nuclei, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, external cuneate nucleus, area postrema, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Low levels of Y1 immunostaining were distributed widely throughout layers II-III of the cerebral cortex (i.e., orbital, cingulate, frontal, parietal, insular, and temporal regions), nucleus accumbens core, amygdalohippocampal and amygdalopiriform areas, dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA2 fields of hippocampus, principal and oral divisions of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, islands of Calleja and presubiculum. These findings are discussed with reference to previously reported receptor autoradiography, immunohistochemistry and mRNA analyses to further support the role of Y1 in NPY-mediated biology.
