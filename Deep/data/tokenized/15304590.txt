Hippocampal sclerosis dementia (HSD) is a disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis. To determine whether HSD cases could be reclassified as variants of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a heterogeneous group of disorders, 18 brain autopsy cases previously diagnosed as HSD were re-evaluated. In 11 cases, ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions, similar to those of motor neuron disease inclusion dementia (MNDID), were found. Brain levels of soluble and insoluble tau were normal. Most patients with pathologic findings of HSD may actually have the MNDID variant of FTD.
