Survival of cultured rat hippocampal neurons was estimated 4, 24, and 48 h after 15-min exposure to the toxic effect of glutamate under conditions of pre- or coincubation with 10 nM thrombin. Thrombin inhibited glutamate-induced apoptosis in neurons 24 and 48 h after treatment, but had no effect on necrosis. Selective peptide agonist of proteinase-activated type 1 receptors simulated, but receptor antagonist suppressed the neuroprotective effect of thrombin. Our results suggest that peptide antagonist of type 1 receptors play a role in the mechanisms of neuronal protection from glutamate toxicity.
