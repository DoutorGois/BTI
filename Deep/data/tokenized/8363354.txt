In 6 patients, depth electrodes revealed differential evoked responses to familiar versus novel faces. These differential responses were obtained in the amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal neocortex but not in the dorsolateral frontal or cingulate cortex. The limbic and temporal structures that differentiated novel from familiar faces did not respond differentially to variations in luminance. Limbic structures and temporal cortex thus appear to participate in face recognition and in encoding the familiarity of visual experiences.
