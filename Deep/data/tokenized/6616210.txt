A lesion of the septum or a transection of the fimbria-fornix diminishes most, but not all, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in the hippocampal formation. The residual AChE is located in the outer part of the molecular layer of the hippocampal CA1 zone and adjacent subicular field (zone 31). We report that following combined lesions of the septum and entorhinal cortex, the residual hippocampal AChE staining pattern expands and occupies the zone innervated normally by perforant pathway terminals from the entorhinal cortex.
