Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) neurometabolite abnormalities have been detected widely in subjects with and at risk for schizophrenia. We hypothesized that such abnormalities would be present both in patients with schizophrenia and in their unaffected twin siblings. We acquired magnetic resonance spectra (TR/TE=3000/30 ms) at voxels in the mesial prefrontal gray matter, left prefrontal white matter and left hippocampus in 14 twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia (2 monozygotic, 12 dizygotic), 13 healthy twin pairs (4 monozygotic, 9 dizygotic) and 1 additional unaffected co-twin of a schizophrenia proband. In the mesial prefrontal gray matter voxel, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine+phosphocreatine (Cr), glycerophosphocholine+phosphocholine (Cho) and myo-inositol (mI) did not differ significantly between patients with schizophrenia, their unaffected co-twins or healthy controls. However, glutamate (Glu) was significantly lower in patients with schizophrenia (31%, percent difference) and unaffected co-twins (21%) than in healthy controls (collapsed across twin pairs). In the left hippocampus voxel, levels of NAA (23%), Cr (22%) and Cho (36%) were higher in schizophrenia patients compared with controls. Hippocampal NAA (25%), Cr (22%) and Cho (37%) were also significantly higher in patients than in their unaffected co-twins. Region-to-region differences in metabolite levels were also notable within all three diagnosis groups. These findings suggest that (1)H MRS neurometabolite abnormalities are present not only in patients with schizophrenia, but also in their unaffected co-twins. Thus, reduced mesial prefrontal cortical Glu and elevated hippocampal NAA, Cr and Cho may represent trait markers of schizophrenia risk and, when exacerbated, state markers of schizophrenia itself.
