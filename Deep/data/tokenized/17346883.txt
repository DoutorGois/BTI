Numerous epidemiology studies have shown protective effects of hormone therapy (HT) on chronic neurological diseases. We have proposed that some of the neuroprotective effects of estrogen are mediated by apolipoprotein E (apoE). Polymorphisms of receptors for apoE modify the risk for dementia. To our knowledge, no reports exist showing CNS effects of estrogen replacement on members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. The current study focused on the effect of estradiol-17beta (E2) replacement on protein expression of two members of the receptor family, the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-r) and low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP) in ovariectomized mice. Five days of E2 replacement significantly increased LRP expression in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb and neocortex but not in cerebellum. In contrast, E2 treatment decreased LDL-r protein expression in olfactory bulb. HT modification of both apoE and LRP could have wide-spread effects on cellular function given LRP's manifold signaling functions.
