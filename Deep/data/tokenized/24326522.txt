Cognitive dysfunction occurs in patients with diabetes mellitus. The objective of this study was to examine whether bilateral intrahippocampal CA1 (intra-CA1) injection of aminoguanidine (AG) can either affect the Bcl-2 family gene expression or reduce the diabetic imposing abnormalities of passive avoidance learning (PAL) and memory. Rats were divided into five groups: control (C), control treated with normal saline (CS), control treated with AG (S-AG), diabetics (D), and diabetics treated with AG (D-AG). Diabetes mellitus was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg). AG (30 mug/rat) or vehicle was administered intra-CA1 bilaterally at the onset of hyperglycemia. PAL was assessed 7 weeks later. Animals were killed, and hippocampus was dissected following the behavioral test. The expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl mRNAs were measured using semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. The result of passive avoidance task showed that AG significantly improved the cognitive performance in diabetic rats. Moreover, AG treatment decreased the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expressions in diabetic group. The ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-xL decreased significantly in AG-treated diabetic animals. In conclusion, initial treatment with AG by intra-CA1 micro-injection improves the impaired passive avoidance task in STZ-induced diabetic rats which may be related to the decreased Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-xL ratios.
