Tob (transducer of ErbB2) is a negative cell cycle regulator with anti-proliferative activity in the periphery. Using a behavioral screening paradigm to look for novel gene functions in the brain, we identified Tob as a brain-expressed protein involved in learning and memory. Behavioral training of fear-conditioning triggered a transient elevation of Tob protein, which preceded the formation of long-term memory. Functional perturbation of Tob by intra-CA1 infusion of antisense oligonucleotides in rats impaired spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze and long-term memory for contextual fear conditioning, two behavioral paradigms that require the hippocampus. Furthermore, long-term potentiation was suppressed by Tob antisense infusion into the CA1 region. Together, these results indicate that the negative cell cycle regulator Tob is a multifunctional protein involved in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.
