The medial septum and diagonal band of Broca (MSDB) influence hippocampal function through cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic septohippocampal neurons. Non-selective damage of the MSDB or intraseptal scopolamine impairs classical conditioning of the eyeblink response (CCER). Scopolamine preferentially inhibits GABAergic MSDB neurons suggesting that these neurons may be an important modulator of delay CCER, a form of CCER not dependent on the hippocampus. The current study directly examined the importance of GABAergic MSDB neurons in acquisition of delay CCER. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received either a sham (PBS) or GABAergic MSDB lesion using GAT1-saporin (SAP). Rats were given two consecutive days of delay eyeblink conditioning with 100 conditioned stimulus-unconditioned stimulus paired trials. Intraseptal GAT1-SAP impaired acquisition of CCER. The impairment was observed on the first day with sham and lesion groups reaching similar performance by the end of the second day. Our results provide evidence that GABAergic MSDB neurons are an important modulator of delay CCER. The pathways by which MSDB neurons influence the neural circuits necessary for delay CCER are discussed.
