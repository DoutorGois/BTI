Understanding neuronal network function requires multi-site recording. An optical imaging method using voltage-sensitive dyes (VSD) is one such suitable method. It is also important to complement this technique with methods that measure other physiological parameters of neuronal network activity. We aimed to develop a multi-channel electrode method that would easily permit the simultaneous optical imaging of neural activity in vitro. There are several multi-electrode systems; some of these are commercially available, but they are not easy to use and are also expensive. We developed a novel, less expensive, stainless steel inline electrode array that utilizes the standard etching method of circuit board manufacturing. This method, along with widely available computer drawing software, allowed us to produce electrode arrays with uniform quality in electrical characteristics and shapes. The electrode array was designed so that it could easily substitute for single electrode systems without modifying the conventional set-up used for electrophysiological measurements and optical recordings. Simultaneous measurement of evoked neural activities in area CA1 of the rat hippocampal slice with our optical imaging method using the VSD Di-4-ANEPPS is demonstrated in this paper. The electrode array was also used as a stimulating electrode, and the evoked response was measured by the optical recording method. The results demonstrate the advantages of simultaneous recordings obtained by these complementary multi-site recording methods in vitro.
