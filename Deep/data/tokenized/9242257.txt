Fiber volleys (FVs) from the stratum lucidum of rat hippocampal area CA3 were recorded extracellularly from in vitro slices in the presence of 10 mM kynurenic acid. In agreement with previous work, bulk stimulation of the dentate gyrus (DG) near the hilar border leads to an asynchronous FV. Transection of the stratum lucidum between the DG stimulation site and the CA3 recording site reduced or eliminated the early components of the asynchronous FV, indicating that they are of mossy fiber (MF) origin. In contrast, moving the stimulating electrode away from the hilus toward the hippocampal fissure reduced or eliminated the late components of the FV. Subsequently, we found that bulk stimulation on the DG/hilar border induces an antidromic population spike in CA3 pyramidal cells. Finally, the MFs and associational collaterals have different conduction velocities (0.51 and 0.37 m/s, respectively; temperature = 33 degrees C). From these data, we conclude that the late components of the asynchronous FV are due to antidromic activation of CA3 collaterals that have been shown to be present in the DG and hilus. A corollary of these findings is that bulk stimulation on the DG/hilar border can lead to at least two different monosynaptic inputs to CA3 pyramidal cells: the MFs and the antidromically activated associational collaterals. We suggest that when MF synaptic responses are being evoked with the use of bulk stimulation, stimulating electrodes should be placed in the outer molecular layer of the DG to prevent the activation of hilar-projecting associational collaterals. This procedure should be added to the previously proposed criteria for preventing polysynaptic contamination of the intracellularly recorded evoked MF synaptic response.
