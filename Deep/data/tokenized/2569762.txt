In an electrographic model of seizures in the hippocampal slice, both of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid and 5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo(a,d)cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) prevented the progressive development of seizures but did not block previously induced seizures. Thus, a process dependent on the NMDA receptor-ionophore complex establishes a long-lasting, seizure-prone state; thereafter the seizures depend on non-NMDA receptor-ionophore mechanisms. This suggests that there is an important distinction between epileptogenesis and seizure expression and between antiepileptogenic and anticonvulsant pharmacological agents.
