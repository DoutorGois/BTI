The effect of intracerebroventricular administration of Substance P fragment and met-enkephalin on the excitability of two generators of hippocampal theta rhythm was investigated in the experiments performed on chronic rabbits. Substance P had a strong facilitatory effect on the threshold of the generator of the hippocampal theta rhythm of the frequency 4-7 c/s and an inhibitory effect on the threshold of the generator of the 7-12 c/s frequency evoked by stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation. These effects were dose dependent. The effects of met-enkephalin were opposite. They increased the threshold of the 4-7 c/s hippocampal generator and decreased the threshold of the other generator. The effect of these two compounds was evaluated according to the energy of electrical trains of pulses maintaining the continuous arousal pattern in the hippocampus.
