OBJECTIVE: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of neurotrophins family that plays a pivotal role in memory and learning. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor mediates health benefits of physical activity both in humans and animals. The nerve damage and cognitive impairment in diabetic rats are thought to be the result of reduced BDNF levels. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of short- and long-term moderate forced exercise on BDNF levels in the hippocampus of type 1 diabetic rats. METHODS: A total of 40 male Wistar rats have been divided into four groups [control group, sedentary diabetic (SD) group, diabetic group with 2 week exercise, and diabetic group with 8 week exercise]. Exercised groups were treated with moderate treadmill running for 60 minutes per day on a rat treadmill. The animals were tested in a Morris water maze (MWM) for spatial memory and the BDNF levels in the hippocampus were assessed by ELISA kit. RESULTS: The Spatial memory test showed a significant improvement in exercised groups in comparison to sedentary groups. Based on the running protocol no significant difference was found on BDNF levels between groups. DISCUSSION: It was shown that spatial memory was improved by the exercise protocol, while the BDNF levels did not change significantly in any group. As a BDNF secretion in the brain is dependent on running paradigm factor, the protocol chosen might not be intensive or long enough to increase the BDNF levels. Exercise may improve spatial memory in type 1 diabetic rats in a way that BDNF is not included.
