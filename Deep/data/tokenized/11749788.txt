AIM: To study the effect of jujuboside A (JuA), one constituent of Chinese herbal medicine Ziziphus jujuba Mill Var spinosa (Bunge) Hu,on the penicillin sodium induced hyperactivity in rat CA1 neurons in vitro. METHODS: Hippocampal slices were obtained from the Sprague-Dawley rat brain and populational signals were measured from CA1 neurons of hippocampal slices using the extracellular recording technique. RESULTS: Penicillin sodium of 500, 1000, and 2000 kU/L were found to excite hippocampal CA1 neurons in a concentration-dependent manner in vitro. This excitatory effect of penicillin sodium could be inhibited by phenobarbital sodium of 0.02 - 0.05 g/L and JuA of 0.05 - 0.10 g/L. CONCLUSION: A high dose of JuA can inhibit the hyperactivity of hippocampal CA1 area induced by penicillin sodium. The inhibition of the amplitude of the first population spike (PS) and the latency of PS are more pronounced than the slope of the field excitatory post-synaptic potential.
