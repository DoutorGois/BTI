Chronic exposure to heroin is known to cause cognitive deficits. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. It has been suggested that opiate-induced neurotoxicity as well as impaired plasticity and regeneration may be relevant. One of the target regions where regeneration still can be observed in the adult brain is the hippocampus. Since polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule is regarded as one of the key players involved in plasticity and regeneration of neural tissue, we analyzed polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule expression in the fascia dentate hilus of the human hippocampus of 29 lethally intoxicated heroin addicts and matched controls. Immunohistochemistry with an antibody directed against polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule revealed its expression in differently sized cells which could be identified as neurons and glial cells. We observed an increase in the percentage of polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule positive neurons in hippocampal hilus of heroin addicts compared with controls (P = 0.001).Interestingly, we also observed polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule expression in glial cells as evidenced by double immunofluorescence with glial fibrillary acidic protein and polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The fraction of polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule positive glial cells was also higher in heroin addicts compared with controls (P = 0.009). In addition, within the group of addicts morphine blood concentrations showed a positive correlation with the percentage of polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule positive neurons (P = 0.04; r = 0.547). In conclusion, we observed an increase in polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule positive neurons and glial cells in hippocampi of heroin addicts. This might reflect an attempt to repair cell damage due to heroin exposure.
