Synucleins have attracted much attention because of their involvement in several neurodegenerative disorders. In a screening for genes differentially expressed after high-dose cocaine exposure, we found gamma-synuclein as a major upregulated candidate in the tegmentum. Overexpression of both alpha- and gamma-synuclein after drug treatment was confirmed by means of microarrays, yielding an increase in the hippocampus, the striatum and the tegmentum (2.65 x, 1.96 x and 3.5 x, respectively, for alpha-synuclein vs. 2.7 x, 1.96 x and 7.16 x for gamma-synuclein), but no change in the nucleus accumbens. Investigation of the distribution of mRNA (by in situ hybridization) and of the proteins (by immunocytochemistry) shows in both cases a clearly distinct pattern of expression for alpha- and gamma-synuclein. alpha-synuclein displays a very characteristic distribution, confined to specific nuclei, whereas gamma-synuclein is more widely expressed throughout the brain. mRNA of both alpha- and gamma-synucleins display a complementary pattern of expression all over the cortex. In contrast to gamma-synuclein, alpha-synuclein is neuronal, being only found in NeuN-expressing cells, and is expressed in the basal ganglia (faintly) and in the substantia nigra compacta where it is highly correlated with tyrosine hydroxylase. Immunocytochemistry shows that gamma-synuclein generally colocalizes with glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing cells and is abundant in the red nucleus, the substantia nigra reticulata and the anterior commissure, while gamma-synuclein mRNA labels the matrix compartments of the caudate-putamen. The role of synucleins in relation to cocaine-induced plasticity or neurotoxicity is discussed.
