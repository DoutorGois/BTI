Many types of injury such as seizure, ischemia, and oxidative stress cause upregulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) in brain neurons, where it promotes apoptosis, however the mechanism by which p75(NTR) is regulated under these conditions is not well understood. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) are highly produced under these injury conditions and, in particular, are expressed rapidly in the rat hippocampus after seizure. IL-1beta is known to increase neuronal vulnerability under many conditions, although it does not directly induce neuronal death. Recently, we have shown that these cytokines regulate p75(NTR) induction both in neurons and astrocytes in vitro. Here, we show that IL-1beta infusion into the brain induces p75(NTR) in neurons of the CA1 area of the hippocampus. While IL-1beta induction of p75(NTR) is not sufficient to induce cell death, we demonstrate that IL-1beta primes the neurons by recruiting p75(NTR) and its coreceptor sortilin to the cell surface, making the neurons more vulnerable to subsequent challenge by proNGF. These results suggest a mechanism by which IL-1beta exacerbates neuronal death following injury.
