The effects of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), an aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) inhibitor, L-canaline, an ornithine aminotransferase inhibitor, and gamma-acetylenic GABA and gabaculine, both gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T) inhibitors, on the release of aspartate from slices of rat medulla oblongata and hippocampus were studied. The slices were superfused and electrically stimulated. There was a Ca2(+)-dependent stimulus-evoked release of endogenous aspartate. AOAA (10(-4) and 10(-3) M) decreased the evoked release of aspartate in the medulla oblongata but not in the hippocampus. In addition, AOAA produced a decrease in the spontaneous efflux and tissue content of aspartate in the medulla oblongata. L-Canaline (5 x 10(-5) M), gamma-acetylenic GABA (10(-4) M) and gabaculine (10(-5) M) did not affect the evoked release of aspartate in the medulla oblongata, while these agents produced a decrease in spontaneous efflux and tissue content of aspartate. These findings suggest that AAT participates in the synthesis of transmitter aspartate in the medulla oblongata of the rat. It appears that there are the pools of transmitter aspartate and non-transmitter aspartate in the rat medulla oblongata.
