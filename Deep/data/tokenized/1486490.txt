In the striatum and hippocampus, there is a loss of sensitivity to muscarinic agonists with age which has been traced to events early in the signal transduction pathway. Our laboratory has therefore focussed on investigations at this level. The current experiments investigate the effects of age on G-protein/receptor interactions by using competitive binding assays to measure the ability of GppNHp to decrease the proportion of receptors bound to G-proteins in the absence and the presence of added Mg2+. L-[3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate was used as a nonselective ligand and [3H]pirenzepine as an M1 selective ligand. We find that: (1) muscarinic receptors and G-proteins in the striatum appear to become loosely coupled with age, with no change in Mg2+ sensitivity. (2) M1-receptor/G-protein complexes in the hippocampus display increased sensitivity to the presence of Mg2+ with age, with those from old but not young tissue requiring added Mg2+ in order to uncouple. This effect, however, may not be M1 specific.
