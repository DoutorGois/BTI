In this study we evaluated the effect of donepezil on the neurodegeneration and behavioral impairments induced by mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that is used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil was given orally to rats subjected to MTBI. Treatment with a single oral dose of donepezil (12mg/kg) immediately after injury significantly attenuated MTBI-induced neuronal death and cognitive impairment as measured by preservation of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and a water maze test respectively. However, these neuroprotective effects were prevented by concomitant injection of mecamylamine, a nicotinic acetylcholine-receptor (nAChR) antagonist, indicating that protection is mediated by nAChR activation.
