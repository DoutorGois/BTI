Oxidative stress induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). The Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway is one of the most important antioxidative stress pathways. To explore whether NBP (DL-3-n-butylphthalide) could alleviate VCI induced by CCH via activating the Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway and modifying the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAO) and treated either with vehicle or NBP (applied in two doses, 40mg/kg and 80mg/kg) while sham operated animals were treated with vehicle. Treatments were administered daily for 28days. The obtained results indicate that both administrated doses of NBP significantly ameliorated the spatial learning and memory impairments as indicated by the Morris water maze test while Hematoxylin-Eosin staining revealed that morphological defects in the CA1 area of hippocampus were improved. Moreover, NBP reversed the BCCAO-induced downregulation of investigated oxidative stress-related proteins (p-Akt, t-Nrf2, n-Nrf2 and HO-1) along with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecule, Bax and reduction of the expression of anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. According to presented results, NBP may have a protective effect against cognitive and morphological impairments induced by CCH via activation of Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway and inhibition of apoptotic cascade.
