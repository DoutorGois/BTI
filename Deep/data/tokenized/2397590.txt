The ontogeny of the expression of prepro-neurotensin/neuromedin N messenger RNA (prepro-NT/NN mRNA) in the rat posterior cingulate cortex (retrosplenial cortex) and the hippocampal formation was investigated using in situ hybridization histochemistry. In the primordium of the posterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampal formation, prepro-NT/NN mRNA was first expressed on embryonic day 17, and was found in the subiculum, layers II-III in areas 29a and 29b, and layer VI in the posterior cingulate cortex at birth. Expression was also observed in the CA1 field. In the adult rat, the expression of prepro-NT/NN mRNA was reduced in the posterior cingulate cortex, and only a few positive cells were seen here. However, the CA1 field and the subiculum still contained numerous positive cells.
