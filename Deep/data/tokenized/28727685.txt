Genetic variants of Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its neuronal tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB4 are associated with risk for schizophrenia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and dopamine (DA) dysfunction. To date, most ErbB4 studies have focused on GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus and neocortex, particularly fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells. However, NRG has also been shown to modulate DA levels, suggesting a role for ErbB4 signaling in dopaminergic neuron function. Here we report that ErbB4 in midbrain DAergic axonal projections regulates extracellular DA levels and relevant behaviors. Mice lacking ErbB4 in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons, but not in PV+ GABAergic interneurons, exhibit different regional imbalances of basal DA levels and fail to increase DA in response to local NRG1 infusion into the dorsal hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum measured by reverse microdialysis. Using Lund Human Mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells, we show that NRG/ErbB signaling increases extracellular DA levels, at least in part, by reducing DA transporter (DAT)-dependent uptake. Interestingly, TH-Cre;ErbB4(f/f) mice manifest deficits in learning, spatial and working memory-related behaviors, but not in numerous other behaviors altered in PV-Cre;ErbB4(f/f) mice. Importantly, microinjection of a Cre-inducible ErbB4 virus (AAV-ErbB4.DIO) into the mesencephalon of TH-Cre;ErbB4(f/f) mice, which selectively restores ErbB4 expression in DAergic neurons, rescues DA dysfunction and ameliorates behavioral deficits. Our results indicate that direct NRG/ErbB4 signaling in DAergic axonal projections modulates DA homeostasis, and that NRG/ErbB4 signaling in both GABAergic interneurons and DA neurons contribute to the modulation of behaviors relevant to psychiatric disorders.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 20 July 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.132.
