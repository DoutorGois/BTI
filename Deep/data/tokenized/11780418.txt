OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia encephalopathy, we studied the expression of the c-fos gene and its relationship with delayed neuronal death in a rat model. METHODS: Cerebral hypoxia-ischemia was produced in 7-day-old SD rats using the Rice model. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) were used to detect the expression of c-fos gene and cell apoptosis in the hippocampus. RESULTS: The selective expression of c-fos and delayed cell apoptosis were observed in the hypoxia-ischemia hippocampus. Expression of the c-fos gene was seen in the CA4 and cingulate sulcus neurons, and apoptosis was observed in the CA1 neurons. CONCLUSION: Transient expression of the c-fos gene may induce cerebral cell apoptosis, and may have complex relations with delayed cell death.
