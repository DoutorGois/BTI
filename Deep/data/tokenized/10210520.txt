Males from two substrains of C57BL/6J mice, which have been found to differ for open-field exploration, radial-maze learning, and the sizes of their hippocampal intra- and infra-pyramidal mossy fibre (IIPMF) terminal fields, were compared for offensive aggression, thermoregulatory nest-building, and their behaviour in the Light-Dark choice test. The substrain with the smaller IIPMF showed higher aggression and more nest-building behavior than the one with the larger IIPMF, whereas only tentative differences were found in the Light Dark choice test. These findings confirm and expand on previously found genetic links between the IIPMF and behaviours in mice. These substrains provide a powerful tool to localise the gene involved and subsequently investigate the pathway leading from gene to behaviour.
