5-Hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors have been visualized at the electron microscopic level in selected areas (dorsal raphe nucleus, hippocampus, septum) of the rat brain using specific anti-peptide antibodies. 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity was found almost exclusively in the somatodendritic compartment of neurons and was very rarely observed within processes possibly belonging to glial cells. The immunoenzymatic reaction product was associated exclusively with dendritic spines in the dorsal hippocampus, whereas in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the septal complex, immunoreactivity was found in both dendritic processes and somata. Although some immunolabeling was observed within the cytoplasm of cell bodies, 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity was essentially confined to the plasma membrane where it was unevenly distributed. It was frequently associated with synapses (except in the dorsal raphe nucleus), but was also found extrasynaptically in both somata and dendrites. These data suggest that the action of serotonin via 5-HT1A receptor could occur through junctional as well as nonjunctional transmission.
