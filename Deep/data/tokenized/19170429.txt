Two experiments examined the effect of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, dizocilpine maleate (MK-801), on spatial working memory during development. Rats were trained on spatial delayed alternation (SDA) in a T-maze after ip administration of 0.06 mg/kg MK-801, 0.1 mg/kg MK-801, or saline on postnatal days (P) P23 and P33 (Experiment 1), or following bilateral intrahippocampal administration of 2.5 or 5.0 microg per side MK-801 or saline on P26 (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, MK-801 dose-dependently impaired SDA learning at both ages. Because the same doses of systemic MK-801 have no effect on T-maze position discrimination learning, impairment of SDA by MK-801 likely reflects disruption of spatial working memory. Both doses of MK-801 abolished acquisition of SDA performance in Experiment 2. Disruption of hippocampal plasticity may account for the effects produced by systemic MK-801 administration. These results confirm and extend earlier lesion studies by implicating plasticity of hippocampal neurons in the ontogeny of spatial delayed alternation.
