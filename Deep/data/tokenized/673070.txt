In automatically controlled experiments on rabbits the spectral and correlation characteristics of sensorimotor, visual and hippocampal potentials were analyzed during the elaboration of conditioned defensive reflex to light stimuli. The conditioning to light was performed at definite frequency of septum stimulation (2,4,7 or 9 Hz). Rhythmical 7 Hz, 9 Hz electrical stimulation of the septum accelerated the conditioning. Rhythmical 2 Hz electrical stimulation of the septum delayed the conditioning. A conclusion is made that changing of the frequency of electrical septum stimulation can influence the process of learning.
