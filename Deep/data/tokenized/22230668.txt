Although there are many studies on ischemic brain damage in the gerbil, which is a good model of transient cerebral ischemia, studies on neuronal damage according to the duration of ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) time are limited. We carried out neuronal damage in the gerbil hippocampus after various durations of I-R (5, 10, 15 and 20 min) using Fluoro-Jade B (F-J B, a maker for neuronal degeneration) histofluorescence as well as cresyl violet (CV) staining. The changes of CV positive ((+)) neurons were well detected in the hippocampal CA1 region, not in the other regions. F-J B histofluorescence staining showed apparent neuronal damage in all the hippocampal subregions. In the CA1, most of the pyramidal neurons of the stratum pyramidale (SP) were stained with F-J B (about 100/mm(2) in a section), and F-J B(+) neurons in the other ischemia-groups were not changed. In the CA2, a few F-J B(+) neurons were detected in the SP of the 5 min ischemia-group, and F-J B(+) neurons were gradually increased with the longer time of ischemia: in the 20 min ischemia-group, the mean number of F-J B(+) neurons was about 85/mm(2) in a section. In the CA3, some F-J B(+) neurons were observed only in the SP of the 20 min ischemia-group. In the dentate gyrus, some F-J B positive neurons were detected only in the polymorphic layer (PL) of the 5 min ischemia-group, and the number of F-J B(+) neurons were gradually increased with the longer ischemic time. Our findings indicate that F-J B histofluorescence showed a very high quality of neuronal damage in all the hippocampal subregions.
