PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of proton MR spectroscopy for determining the biochemical abnormalities in acute episode of depression and after regression of the disease in course of unipolar depressive disorder. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty one patients (age 18-55 years) with known unipolar depressive disorder (a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale of 16 or greater) were evaluated by the means of HMRS during acute episode of depression and after positive therapeutic response (at least 50% reduced Hamilton score for at least 4 consecutive weeks). All patients underwent single-volume 1H MRS (TR=1500 ms, TE=35 ms) using a 1.5T scanner. Four brain areas were analyzed: both frontal lobes and both hippocampi. RESULTS: In the acute fase of the disease patients had statistically significant increases in Cho/Cr levels in right hippocampus area and increases in ml/Cr levels in left frontal lobes relative to controls. After positive therapeutic response no significant abnormalities were found. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that abnormal increased brain metabolites should reverse after treatment. In the time of new imaging technics we hope that in the future 1H MRS may be helpful for determining the accuracy of the diagnosis and can improved prediction of therapeutic response in unipolar depression.
