Epigenetic modifications through methylation of DNA and acetylation of histones modulate neuronal gene expression and regulate long-term memory. Earlier we demonstrated that scopolamine-induced decrease in memory consolidation is correlated with enhanced expression of hippocampal DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in mice. DNMT1 and HDAC2 act together by recruiting a co-repressor complex and deacetylating the chromatin. The catalytic activity of HDACs is mainly dependent on its incorporation into multiprotein co-repressor complexes, among which SIN3A-HDAC2 co-repressor is widely studied to regulate synaptic plasticity. However, the involvement of co-repressor complex in regulating memory loss or amnesia is unexplored. The present study examines the role of co-repressor SIN3A in scopolamine-induced amnesia through epigenetic changes in the hippocampus. Scopolamine treatment remarkably enhanced hippocampal SIN3A expression in mice. To prevent such increase in SIN3A expression, we used hippocampal infusion of SIN3A-siRNA and assessed the effect of SIN3A silencing on scopolamine-induced amnesia. Silencing of SIN3A in amnesic mice reduced the binding of HDAC2 at neuronal immediate early genes (IEGs) promoter, but did not change the expression of HDAC2. Further, it increased acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 at neuronal IEGs (Arc, Egr1, Homer1 and Narp) promoter, prevented scopolamine-induced downregulation of IEGs and improved consolidation of memory during novel object recognition task. These findings together suggest that SIN3A has a critical role in regulation of synaptic plasticity and might act as a potential therapeutic target to rescue memory decline during amnesia and other neuropsychiatric pathologies.
