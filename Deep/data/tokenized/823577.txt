Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded from hippocampus and neocortex of rabbits. It was found that movement, movement-related 6-12 Hz rhythmical slow activity (RSA), and movement-related neocortical desynchronization were unaffected by intravenous atropine sulfate but depressed by ethyl alcohol (ethanol). Slower 4-8 Hz immobility-relate- RSA and immobility-related neocortical desynchronization produced by sensory stimulation (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular) were relatively unaffected by ethanol even at high (0.1-0.2 g-%) blood alcohol levels, but were abolished by atropine sulfate. The results provide evidence for the idea of two pharmacologically separable cortical activating systems and suggest that ethanol has a greater effect on non-cholinergic than cholinergic systems.
