Neuroprotection strategies are of great importance in the treatment of ischemic brain injury. Screening of our in-stock coumarin derivatives identified compound 1 as exhibiting neuroprotective activity. Subsequently, a structural optimization was carried out, which led to the discovery of the potent compound 20. This compound significantly attenuated the damage in a cell line derived from a pheochromocytoma of the rat adrenal medulla induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. Furthermore, compound 20 exhibited clear neuroprotection in middle cerebral artery occlusion rats by reducing infarct size and brain-water content, improving neurological function, and suppressing neuronal loss and neuropathological changes in the cortex and hippocampus. Pharmacokinetic evaluation indicated that compound 20 could penetrate the blood-brain barrier of rats.
