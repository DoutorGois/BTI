The effect of morphine tolerance dependence and protracted abstinence on the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in discrete brain regions, spinal cord, pituitary gland and peripheral tissues was determined in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Of all the tissues examined, the highest level of dynorphin (1-13) was found to be in the pituitary gland. Among the brain regions and spinal cord examined, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in descending order were: hypothalamus, spinal cord, midbrain, pons and medulla, hippocampus, cortex, amygdala and striatum. The descending order for the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in peripheral tissues was: adrenals, heart and kidneys. In morphine tolerant rats, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) increased in amygdala but were decreased in pons and medulla. In morphine abstinent rats, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) were increased in amygdala, hypothalamus and hippocampus. The levels of dynorphin (1-13) were increased in pituitary but decreased in spinal cord and remained so even during protracted abstinence. The levels of dynorphin (1-13) in the peripheral tissues of morphine tolerant rats were unaffected. However, in the heart and kidneys of morphine abstinent rats, the levels of dynorphin (1-13) were increased significantly. It is concluded that both morphine tolerance and abstinence modify the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in pituitary, central and peripheral tissues. Morphine abstinence differed from non-abstinence process in that there were additional changes (increases) in the levels of dynorphin (1-13) in brain regions (hypothalamus and hippocampus) and peripheral tissues (heart and kidneys) and may contribute to the symptoms of the morphine abstinence syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
