We examined the role of anterior and posterior cingulate cortical muscarinic receptors in water maze spatial learning and passive avoidance. Pretraining and posttraining trial scopolamine (a mixed a muscarinic acetylcholine antagonist) infusions into the anterior cingulate cortex dose dependently (3 no effect; 10 and 30 micrograms impaired) impaired passive avoidance performance. Pretesting infusion into the anterior cingulate had no effect on passive avoidance. Scopolamine infusion into the anterior cingulate did not impair spatial navigation. On the contrary, scopolamine (3 micrograms no effect, 10 and 30 micrograms impaired) infusions into the posterior cingulate before daily training trials impaired water maze navigation to a hidden platform, but did not affect navigation to a visible escape platform or passive avoidance. Posttraining and pretesting infusion into the posterior cingulate did not impair WM spatial navigation. The present results indicate that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist may modulate passive avoidance performance via cholinergic receptors located in anterior cingulate cortex and the ability to develop a spatial navigation strategy via muscarinic receptors located in posterior cingulate.
