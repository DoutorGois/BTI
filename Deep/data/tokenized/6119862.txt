Effects of a single intraventricular injection of kainic acid (KA) in a dose of 0.1 microgram per rat on the activity of different brain neurotransmitter systems were investigated. A decreased level of norepinephrine at 3 and 24 h and acceleration of its utilization at 3 h after application of KA were observed. These changes were also accompanied by a decreased level of dopamine at 24 h, increased utilization of dopamine at 3 h, increased levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid at 3 and 24 h, as well as by shortened time of the turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine. No disturbances in the function of the aminergic systems were noted at 120 h after injection of KA. Lowered activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase in the striatum, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum was observed at 24 h after administration of KA. At 480 h following application of KA, this lowering persisted in the hippocampus only. The most prominent changes in the level of gamma-aminobutyric were observed at 120 h in the striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum. A decreased level of gamma-aminobutyric acid was found in the striatum and cerebellum at 480 h following injection of KA. The observed changes in the dynamic equilibrium between various neurotransmitter systems may be a consequence of the direct or indirect influence of KA.
