It is thought that changes in gene expression in the brain mediate chronic ethanol-induced complex behaviors such as tolerance, dependence, and sensitization, and also relate to ethanol-induced brain toxicity. Using high-density filter-based cDNA microarrays (GeneFilters), we analyzed the expression of over 5000 genes in the dorsal hippocampus of rats treated with 12% ethanol or tap water for 15 months. Ethanol-induced changes in gene expression were particularly prominent in two groups of genes. One group consisted of oxidoreductases, including ceruloplasmin, uricase, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, P450, NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase, which may be related to ethanol-induced oxidative stress. The other group of genes included ADP-ribosylation factor, RAS related protein rab10, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, dynein-associated polypeptides, and dynamin-1, which seem to be involved in membrane trafficking. The results may reveal some of the pathways involved in ethanol-induced pathophysiological changes.
