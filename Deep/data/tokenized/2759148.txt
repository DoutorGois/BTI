The effects of naftidrofuryl on postischemic neuronal damage and on local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were examined in a rat model of forebrain ischemia (occlusion of carotid arteries and hypotension). Ischemia was induced for 10 min. LCBF was measured after 2 and 10 min of recirculation. A histological evaluation of cell loss in the hippocampal areas was performed 7 days after ischemia. Naftidrofuryl (10 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 15 min before ischemia. The drug reduced the percentage of necrotic neurons in the CA1 and CA4 sector of the hippocampus, while the LCBF of these hippocampal sections was not significantly altered. Thus, naftidrofuryl is suggested to protect hippocampal neurons against ischemic damage mainly by a direct effect on brain parenchyma.
