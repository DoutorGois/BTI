OBJECTIVES: Anorexia nervosa (AN), a disorder of unknown etiology, has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Drawing the brain metabolic pattern of AN may help to target the core biological and psychological features of the disorder and to perfect the diagnosis and recovery criteria. In this study, we used 18F-FDG PET to show brain metabolic network for AN. METHODS: Glucose metabolism in 6 AN patients and 12 age-matched healthy controls was studied using 18F-FDG PET. SPM2 was used to compare brain metabolism in AN patients with that in healthy controls. Four of 6 AN patients took deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeted in nucleus accumbens (NAcc). About 3 to 6 months after the surgery, the 4 AN patients took another 18F-FDG PET scan to assess the change in brain glucose metabolism. RESULTS: The SPM (statistical parametric mapping ) analysis showed hypermetabolism in the frontal lobe (bilateral, BA10, BA11, BA47), the limbic lobe (bilateral, hippocampus, and amygdala), lentiform nucleus (bilateral), left insula (BA13), and left subcallosal gyrus (BA25). It also showed hypometabolism in the parietal lobe (bilateral, BA7, BA40). The hypermetabolism in frontal lobe, hippocampus, and lentiform nucleus decreased after NAcc-DBS. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in brain glucose metabolism illustrated the brain metabolic pattern in AN patients. Furthermore, the pattern can be modulated by NAcc-DBS, which confirmed specificity of the pattern. The regions with altered metabolism could interconnect to form a network and integrate information related to appetite. Our study may provide information for targeting the potential candidate brain regions for understanding the pathophysiology of AN and assessing the effects of existing and future treatment approaches.
