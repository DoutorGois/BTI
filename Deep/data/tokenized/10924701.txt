Treatment of rats for 4 days with the antiparkinsonian drugs, talipexole and pramipexole, markedly increased Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in neuronal dendritic processes in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but treatment for 1 day with either of these drugs did not. Repeated administration of talipexole or pramipexole may have neuroprotective effect in neurodegenerative disorders.
