Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) disease is a progressive and fatal neurological disorder characterized by accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in peripheral tissues and that of glycosphingolipids in the brain. A C57BL/KsJ-npc1(spm) mutant strain is a genetically authentic model of NP-C. This study investigated neuronal cell loss and lipid accumulation in the npc1(spm) mouse brain. Nissl-staining revealed abundant swollen neurons in the neocortex, piriform cortex, hippocampus and basal ganglia at 3-4 wk of age. In addition to loss of the Purkinje cells, we found a conspicuous cell loss in the ventral posterial lateral (VPL) and medial (VPM) nuclei of thalamus, which became apparent after 4-5 wk. Biochemical analyses revealed no increase of cholesterol in the lipid extracts whereas a substantial accumulation of cholesterol was detectable in most of the large neurons by filipin staining in the brain of homozygous mice. In contrast to the diffuse staining pattern in normal brains, the neuropils of the neurons in the brain of homozygous mice were stained in a punctate pattern. The ubiquitous accumulation excludes a direct role of cholesterol in the progressive neuronal loss in the Purkinje cell layer and in the VPL and VPM of the thalamus.
