Parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing basket cells provide two parallel, functionally distinct sources of perisomatic inhibition to postsynaptic cells. We show that exogenously applied CCK enhances the output from rat parvalbumin-expressing basket cells, while concurrently suppressing GABA release from CCK-expressing neurons through retrograde endocannabinoid action. These results indicate that CCK may act as a molecular switch that determines the source of perisomatic inhibition for hippocampal principal cells.
