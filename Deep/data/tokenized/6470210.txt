The anterior eye chamber was used as a model environment to study, in isolation, the interaction of embryonic area dentata transplants with transplants of one of three important sources of in situ innervation: entorhinal cortex, locus coeruleus or septal nuclei. None of these brain regions significantly affected the morphogenesis or in oculo growth of area dentata transplants. All three brain regions innervated the area dentata transplant. Entorhinal cortical transplants sent nerve fibers into a limited, and apparently specific, region of area dentata that was adjacent to the entorhinal transplant. This light innervation contrasts to the predominant innervation of area dentata by entorhinal cortex in situ. The fluorescent, noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus provided the area dentata transplant with an abundance of fine varicose nerve fibers. Given about 100 noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus transplant and 4 to 6 months joint survival, the area dentata transplant was noradrenergically hyperinnervated. The cholinergic neurons of the septal nuclei transplant had a prolific ingrowth of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive nerve fibers to the area dentata transplant. There appeared to be a mutual exclusion between the extrinsic AChE-positive fibers and the intrinsic Timm's-positive granule cell mossy fibers in the area dentata transplant. We conclude that isolated replicas of the coeruleo-, septo-, and entorhinal cortico-dentate pathways can be made through sequential intraocular double grafting. The nature of the in oculo connectivity between these replicates offers clues as to the mechanisms that might account for the regulation of nerve growth.
