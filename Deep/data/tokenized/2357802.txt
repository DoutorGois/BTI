In rats 14-28 days of age, high-frequency stimulation of the perforant path granule cell synapse in the dentate gyrus produced long-term potentiation of the population spike that was comparable in magnitude (150-250% of baseline) and duration (120 min) to that produced in adult animals with the same stimulation paradigm. In contrast, potentiation of the excitatory postsynaptic potential occurred inconsistently.
