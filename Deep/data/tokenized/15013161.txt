The expression of the human micro-opiate receptor (MOR1) in post mortem human brain tissue was examined using real-time PCR technology. Tissue samples from 11 fatalities due to opiate overdose and five normal subjects with different causes of death were analysed in order to elucidate whether chronic opiate abuse is followed by a regulation of MOR1 expression. In each case nine selected brain regions (thalamus, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, ventral tegmentum, hippocampus, amygdala, frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, putamen) were evaluated. The MOR1-mRNA level was determined relative to the housekeeping gene beta2-microglobulin. While in most regions the MOR mRNA levels in the brain of addicts were not different from the control group-with varying levels between 0 and 15% of housekeeping gene level-in the brains of three drug-related fatalities an enormous increase was encountered in the thalamus where the MOR-mRNA level amounted for up to 10,000% of the measured housekeeping gene level. The results obtained by toxicological hair analysis in the group of drug-related fatalities indicate that the enormous thalamic MOR1-expression is primarily found in individuals who died from acute heroin overdose but did not show signs of a substantial chronic administration of the drug. Further studies have to be performed to evaluate if the observed MOR1-mRNA up-regulation in the thalamus in a subpopulation of acute lethal intoxications mirrors a state of functional hypersensitivity associated with the occurrence of death.
