Arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin in various portions of rat brain were determined by radioimmunoassays. The hormones were extracted from tissue samples into 0.1 N HCl and then purified partially with acetone-petroleum ether extraction. The non-equilibration method was used for the assays. In this method recovery rates of arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin were 73.0 +/- 4.4% and 75.0 +/- 3.8%, respectively. Sensitivities of the assays were 1 pg of arginine-vasopressin and 0.75 pg (0.3 microU) of oxytocin per assay tube. The higher concentrations of arginine-vasopressin and oxytocin were confirmed in the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system, where these hormones are synthesized, transported and stored. Relatively high concentrations of these hormones, especially oxytocin, were detected in spinal cord. Amygdala, hippocampus, limbic forebrain and pineal body contained a certain amount of arginine-vasopressin (2-20 pg/mg protein). Oxytocin (1-7 pg/mg protein) was also detected in amygdala, pons and medulla oblongata, pineal body and midbrain. The low concentrations of these hormones were also found in cerebral cortex and cerebellum.
