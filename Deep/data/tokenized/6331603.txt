We have made intracellular recordings from the dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) in a rat brain slice. DLSN neurons fire short tetrodotoxin (TTX) sensitive action potentials followed by an after-hyperpolarization. The action potential is followed by either a Ca2+-dependent depolarization or a Ca2+-dependent after-hyperpolarization. Stimulation of medial septum results in antidromic invasion of DLSN neurons while stimulation of the fimbria/fornix results in orthodromic EPSPs or action potentials.
