The present study was undertaken to determine whether release of glutamate is capable of influencing dendritic morphology in a developing network of rat hippocampal neurons in vitro. Control cultures developed a dense network of fibers and evinced spontaneous electrical activity from the third day in vitro. Dendrites were examined in cultures maintained for 2 weeks in vitro: the experimental group grown in medium containing the glutamate receptor antagonists AP-5 and DNQX. Dendritic extensions were analyzed as a function of time (days in vitro) using a number of morphometric parameters, vis. the number of processes, the number and length of intermediate and terminal segments, as well as the total length of all segments. We found that the effect of age and treatment was most prominently reflected in the length of the terminal segments. Chronic addition of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists from day 2 in culture arrested all dendrite parameters at the prefunctional level. The results suggest that glutamate release is crucial for the onset of dendritic morphological development in hippocampal neurons.
