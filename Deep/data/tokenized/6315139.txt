Slices of rat brain hippocampus were tetanized in the perforant path fibers. In individual slices long-term changes of the electrophysiological parameters were determined simultaneously with post hoc endogeneous phosphorylation of proteins in a lyzed crude mitochondrial/synaptosomal fraction. A quantitative relation between the electrophysiological parameters and the degree of phosphorylation of a 52K protein was found to follow a non-linear function.
