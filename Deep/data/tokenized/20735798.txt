The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is one of the major stress hormone systems, and glucocorticoids (GCs) play a pivotal role in homeostatic processes throughout the body and brain. A dysregulation of the HPA axis, leading to an aberrant secretion of GCs, is associated with affective disorders such as major depression. In the present study, three mouse lines selectively bred for high (HR), intermediate (IR) or low (LR) stress reactivity were used to elucidate the temporal dynamics of intrahippocampal corticosterone (CORT) in response to a standardised stressor. In particular, we addressed the question of whether the distinct differences in HPA axis reactivity between the three mouse lines, as determined by plasma CORT measurements, are present in the central nervous system as well, and if the respective endophenotype is brought about by alterations in blood-brain barrier (BBB) functionality. We applied in vivo microdialysis in the hippocampus, demonstrating that the concentrations of CORT released from the adrenals in response to restraint stress are not only distinctly different in the plasma, but can also be found in the central nervous system, although the differences between the three mouse lines were attenuated, particularly between IR and LR animals. Additionally, a time lag of approximately 60 min was observed in all three lines regarding intrahippocampal peak concentrations of CORT after the onset of the stressor. Furthermore, we showed that the penetration and clearance of CORT in the hippocampal tissue was not affected by differences in BBB functionality because the multidrug resistance 1 P-glycoprotein (Mdr1 Pgp) was equally expressed in HR, IR and LR mice. Furthermore, we could exclude surgical damage of the BBB because peripherally-injected dexamethasone, which is a high affinity substrate for the Mdr1 Pgp and therefore restricted from entering the brain, could only be detected in the plasma and was virtually absent in the brain.
