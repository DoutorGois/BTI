The transcription factors AP-2alpha and AP-2beta are implicated to play an important role during embryonic development of different parts of the brain, and in targeted regulation of gene expression in the adult brain. Several monoaminergic genes have binding sites for AP-2 in regulatory regions. We have in the present study, analysed the association between AP-2 levels in the brainstem of rats (n=9) and monoamine levels in the frontal cortex, septum and hippocampus. Several regionally specific correlations were found between AP-2alpha and AP-2beta and specific monoamines in the rat forebrain. The data support our notion that the transcription factor AP-2 family is involved in the regulation of the monoaminergic systems and, therefore, might be involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders.
