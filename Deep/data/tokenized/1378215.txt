In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1PC) and dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGC) we compared the expression of currents which could cause differences in discharge behaviour. Negative current injections cause a uniform hyperpolarization in DGGC whereas in CA1PC the initial hyperpolarization is followed by a repolarization towards resting membrane potential. The underlying inward current can be classified as IQ. It is sensitive to CsCl, activated at -80 mV, and it has a mean amplitude of -109.8 pA and a mean activation time constant of 187 ms with voltage jumps from -40 to -120 mV. We conclude that some of the differences in response properties of DGGC and CA1PC upon repetitive stimulation can be attributed to differences in the expression of IQ.
