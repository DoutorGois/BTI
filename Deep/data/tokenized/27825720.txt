AIMS: Previous study demonstrated that Ginsenoside Rd. (GS-Rd) could improve cognitive and memory function in animal model of Alzheimer's disease. This study was aimed to investigate whether GS-Rd could improve non-amyloidogenic pathway by activating estrogen receptor (ER). MAIN METHODS: 10mg/kg GS-Rd in ovariectomy (OVX)+GS-Rd group and equivalent volume of saline in sham operated group and OVX group were administrated intraperitoneally for two months, respectively. The Morris Water Maze was used to examine cognitive function of rats, with sAPPalpha and Abeta levels in the hippocampi measured. The culture medium of HT22 hippocampal neuronal cells were incubated with GS-Rd, ER antagonist ICI182.780, MAPK inhibitor PD98059, or PI3Kinhibitor LY294002, respectively. sAPPalpha levels was measured, and expression of alpha-secretase, sAPPalpha, beta-secretase, Abeta, phosphorylation form of AKT (p-AKT), total AKT, p-ERK, total ERK, p-ERalpha, total ERalpha, p-ERbeta and total ERbeta were examined by Western blot to explore the estrogenic-like activity of GS-Rd. KEY FINDINGS: GS-Rd attenuate cognitive and memory impairment, increased levels of sAPPalpha and reduced extracellular Abeta of OVX rats. In HT22, GS-Rd could upregulate sAPPalpha level, which can be inhibited by inhibitor of MAPK and PI3K pathway. In addition, inhibitor of estrogen receptor prevented GS-Rd triggered release of sAPPalpha and activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways. GS-Rd could increase expression of alpha-secretase and sAPPalpha, while decrease expression of beta-secretase and Abeta. Besides, GS-Rd promoted phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha at Ser118 residue. SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings show that GS-Rd enhances learning and memory function of OVX rats by activating estrogen-like activity.
