The mathematical model of the neuron function is known to rely on space summing of excitement. The spikes contribute to the inner state of the neuron the farther from cell soma the synapses are located. The difference between excitatory and inhibitory effect results in spike firing if only neural firing threshold is achieved. The values of spike flux have been estimated on the basis of the model of CA3 sector of the Hippocampus and were found to be 15 divided by 35 imp/s.
