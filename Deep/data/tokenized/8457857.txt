Kainic acid evokes behavioral convulsions and causes lesions in hippocampal pyramidal cell layers in rats. The effects of ZnCl2 pretreatments on these events were examined. Rats were given ZnCl2 (35 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)) 15 min prior to kainic acid administration (12 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)). Another group of animals was given an additional dose of ZnCl2 (35 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h prior to the s.c. ZnCl2 and i.p. kainic acid. All rats that received kainic acid, whether saline controls or ZnCl2 pretreated, experienced wet dog shakes (WDS) and convulsions. No significant differences were seen between groups in number or latency of WDS or convulsions. Two days after behavioral data were collected, the brains were perfused and the extent of lesioning among hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells was quantified. A single dose of ZnCl2 had either no effect or a slight protective effect on cell lesioning induced by kainic acid. However, lesioning was more pronounced in animals treated twice with zinc. It is concluded that zinc, co-administered with kainic acid, augments kainate cytotoxicity when the dose and timing of zinc exposure are within a critical period.
