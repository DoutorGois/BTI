We observed temporal changes in NACP (precursor protein of non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid), a presynaptic protein a.k. a. alpha-synuclein, in the hippocampus after 5 min ischemia. Intense NACP immunoreactivity was seen transiently around cerebral blood vessels in the CA1 subfield on day 4, and NACP-positive unusual tubal and chain-like structures developed on month 6. We suggest that the changes in NACP may play an important role in the ischemic pathogenesis.
