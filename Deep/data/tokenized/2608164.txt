The effects of postnatal methotrexate (MTX) exposure on the development of synapses in the developing rat hippocampus were examined. The density of E-PTA-stained synaptic junctions per unit area was significantly reduced by MTX exposure either during day 1-5 or 6-10 post partum. It was suggested that administering MTX during the critical period affected the development of synapses in the developing rat brain.
