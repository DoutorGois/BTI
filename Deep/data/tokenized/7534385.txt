The effect of cyanide on NMDA-activated ion current and MK801 binding was studied in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In microfluorometric analysis using fura-2, removal of extracellular Mg2+ resulted in a five-fold increase in NMDA-induced peak of [Ca2+]i. One mM NaCN enhanced the peak NMDA responses in the presence, but not in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. Cyanide enhanced the immediate rise in [Ca2+]i produced by NMDA, followed over a 1-5 min period by a gradual increase of [Ca2+]i. Similar results were obtained in whole-cell patch clamp recordings from hippocampal neurons. One mM KCN enhanced the NMDA-activated current in the presence, but not in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. This effect was independent of cyanide-mediated metabolic inhibition since the recording pipette contained ATP (2 mM). In binding assays NaCN (1 mM) increased the binding affinity of [3H]MK-801 to rat forebrain membranes in the presence of Mg2+, whereas in the absence of Mg2+, NaCN did not influence binding. These results indicate that cyanide enhances NMDA-mediated Ca2+ influx and inward current by interacting with the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor. The effect of cyanide can be explained by an initial interaction with the Mg2+ block of the NMDA receptor/ionophore which appears to be energy-independent, followed by a gradual increase in Ca2+ influx resulting from cellular energy reserve depletion.
