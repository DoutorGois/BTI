Late onset Alzheimer disease's (LOAD) main risk factor is aging. Although it is not well known which age-related factors are involved in its development, evidence points out to the involvement of an impaired amyloid-beta (Abeta) clearance in the aged brain among possible causes. Glial cells are the main scavengers of the brain, where Scavenger Receptor class A (SR-A) emerges as a relevant player in AD because of its participation in Abeta uptake and in the modulation of glial cell inflammatory response. Here, we show that SR-A expression is reduced in the hippocampus of aged animals and APP/PS1 mice. Given that Abeta deposition increases in the aging brain, we generated a triple transgenic mouse, which accumulates Abeta and is knockout for SR-A (APP/PS1/SR-A(-/-)) to evaluate Abeta accumulation and the inflammatory outcome of SR-A depletion in the aged brain. The lifespan of APP/PS1/SR-A(-/-) mice was greatly reduced, accompanied by a 3-fold increase in plasmatic pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced performance in a working memory behavioral assessment. Microglia and astrocytes lacking SR-A displayed impaired oxidative response and nitric oxide production, produced up to 7-fold more pro-inflammatory cytokines and showed a 12-fold reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines release, with conspicuous changes in lipopolysaccharide-induced glial activation. Isolated microglia from young and adult mice lacking SR-A showed a 50% reduction in phagocytic activity. Our results indicate that reduced expression of SR-A can deregulate glial inflammatory response and potentiate Abeta accumulation, two mechanisms that could contribute to AD progression.
