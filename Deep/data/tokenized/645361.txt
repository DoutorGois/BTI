A man aged 70, showed early disorientation, memory defects, delusions and rages at 66, later mental deterioration with muteness and dysphagia. He died of cardiac failure. The postmortem examination revealed macroscopically and light microscopically the neuropathological findings of atypical senile dementia. Moreover, it is the interesting characteristic in the presented case that there are electron microscopically two types of filaments making the neurofibrillary tangles. One showed the so-called "paired helical filaments", which were observed in the cerebral cortex. The other showed paralled "straight filaments". These "straight filaments" were found in the bilateral hippocampi.
