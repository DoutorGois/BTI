Growth arrest specific 1 (GAS1) is a signaling mediator for the development of the central nervous system that works as a co-receptor for sonic hedgehog (SHH) to induce the amplification of neural progenitors during the patterning of the mammalian neural tube and establishing granular cells in the cerebellum. Recently, we confirmed that Gas1 is also expressed by neural progenitors of the developing cortex and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The presence of GAS1 in progenitor stages indicates that one of its principal roles is the maintenance of these cells during neurogenic events. However, the signals responsible for the expression of Gas1 in progenitor cells are unknown, an aspect that is relevant to understand its functions during neurogenesis. Here, we focused on elucidating the mechanisms of the transcriptional regulation of Gas1 and using comparative genomics methods found two highly conserved E-boxes in the Gas1 promoter which mediate its up-regulation by NeuroD1. Additionally, we found that GAS1 and NeuroD1 co-localize in the neocortex, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the external granular layer of the cerebellum, suggesting a previously unsuspected regulatory relationship. Our data indicate that Gas1 is a direct target of NeuroD1 during the induction of the neurogenic program.
