NFATc4 has recently been identified as playing an important role in variety of activity-dependent neuronal processes, including hippocampal plasticity, axonal growth, neuronal survival, and apoptosis. However, a systematic study examining the distribution of NFATc4 within the nervous system has yet to be conducted. With this in mind, we sought to determine the regional localization of NFATc4 within the adult mouse brain. Interestingly, NFATc4 was expressed broadly, but not uniformly, throughout various brain structures. The highest levels of NFATc4 expression were localized to the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and various hypothalamic nuclei. Other brain regions that expressed NFATc4 included the cerebellum, striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, neocortex, and brainstem nuclei. Given NFATc4's widespread expression, these results are consistent with the notion that NFATc4 may underlie activity-dependent neuronal plasticity throughout the adult brain.
