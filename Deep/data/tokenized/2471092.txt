Age-related changes in the content of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in anterior cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum of the rat have been investigated using HPLC with electrochemical detection. A significant decrease in HVA was observed in the striatum and hippocampus of the aged (27 months) animals, as compared to the controls (2.4 to 2.6 months). A significant decrease in DA levels was also observed in the hippocampus but not in the striatum. In contrast, the level of DA in the cerebral cortex was markedly increased in the aged animals. A concomitant increase in 3-MT level was observed. Finally the level of 5-HIAA was significantly increased in striatum and hippocampus.
