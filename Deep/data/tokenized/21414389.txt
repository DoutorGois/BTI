A nucleotide analog 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) is a genotoxic compound. Previous studies have demonstrated that prenatal treatment of rodents with BrdU affects the development of cortical neurons, reduces dopamine levels, and elevates serotonin (5-HT) levels in the striatum in adult male offspring from BrdU-treated dams. Moreover, prenatal BrdU-treated rats show locomotor hyperactivity in both males and females. This study investigated sexual dimorphism in the effect of prenatal BrdU on monoamine metabolism. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with BrdU on gestational days 9-15 (50mg/kg, i.p.) and monoamine metabolism was examined in female rats at 10 weeks of age. The influence of pre-pubertal gonadectomy on the effects of BrdU was also investigated. BrdU-treated females showed elevations of dopamine and 5-HT levels in the striatum; reductions in dopamine, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, or homovanillic acid (HVA) in the hypothalamus or the midbrain; and elevated HVA and 5-HT in the hippocampus. Pre-pubertal gonadectomy had a suppressive effect on striatal dopamine levels in prenatal BrdU-treated females. The present data indicate sexual dimorphic effects of prenatal BrdU-treatment in striatal dopamine metabolism but not in serotonergic metabolism and suggest a contribution of the increasing gonadal hormones that accompany puberty to this sex difference.
