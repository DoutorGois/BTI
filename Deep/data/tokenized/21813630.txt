BACKGROUND: beta3 containing gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) mediate behavioral end points of IV anesthetics such as immobility and hypnosis. A knockout mouse with targeted forebrain deletion of the beta3 subunit of the GABA(A)-R shows reduced sensitivity to the hypnotic effect of etomidate, as measured by the loss of righting reflex. The end points of amnesia and immobility produced by an inhaled anesthetic have yet to be evaluated in this conditional knockout. METHODS: We assessed forebrain selective beta3 conditional knockout mice and their littermate controls for conditional fear to evaluate amnesia and MAC, the minimum alveolar concentration of inhaled anesthetic necessary to produce immobility in response to noxious stimulation, to assess immobility. Suppression of conditional fear was assessed for etomidate and isoflurane, and MAC was assessed for isoflurane. RESULTS: Etomidate equally suppressed conditional fear for both genotypes. The knockout showed resistance to the suppression of conditional fear produced by isoflurane in comparison with control littermates. Controls and knockouts did not differ in isoflurane MAC values. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that beta3 containing GABA(A)-Rs in the forebrain contribute to hippocampal-dependent memory suppressed by isoflurane, but not etomidate.
