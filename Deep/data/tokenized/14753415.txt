Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a member of the heat shock protein family (HSP-32). It responds to thermal stress in cultured glial cells. To our knowledge. nothing is known about the expression and response of the HO-1 in cerebral ischemia. Therefore, we show here the induction of HO-1 in the brain of mice after global cerebral ischemia. HO-1-like immunoreactivity was detected at 12, 24, and 48 hours after ischemia recirculation. The HO-1-like immunoreactive cells were observed in astrocytes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1. The peak level of HO-1-like immunoreactivity was found 48 hours after the recirculation. HO-1-like immunoreactivity was observed in GFAP-positive astrocytes by use of a double immunostaining method. These results provide direct evidence for the induction and localization of HO-1 immunoreactivity in vivo in a mouse cerebral ischemia. We suggest that HO-1, produced in astrocytes after ischemia-recirculation, may directly affect neurons to protect from cell death.
