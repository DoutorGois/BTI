Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinases (DYRKs) and cdc2-like kinases (CLKs) are implicated in the onset and progression of Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). DYRK1A has emerged as a possible link between amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Tau, the major pathological proteins in AD. We here assessed the neuroprotective potential of a novel inhibitor of DYRKs/CLKs. The Leucettine L41, acting preferentially on DYRK1A, was tested in Abeta25-35-treated mice, a nontransgenic model of AD-like toxicity. We co-injected intracerebroventricularly oligomeric Abeta25-35 peptide and L41 in Swiss male mice. After 7 days, they were submitted to behavioral tests addressing spatial and non-spatial, short- and long-term memories. The oxidative stress, apoptotic markers, kinases involved in Tau phosphorylation, and synaptic integrity were analyzed by Western blot and ELISA in the hippocampus. L41, tested at 0.4, 1.2, 4 microg, prevented the Abeta25-35-induced memory deficits in the Y-maze, passive avoidance and water-maze tests, with the most active dose being 4 microg. The inhibitor prevented the Abeta25-35-induced oxidative stress, as revealed by measures of lipid peroxidation levels and reactive oxygen species accumulation, and abolished Abeta25-35-induced expression of pro-apoptotic markers. L41 prevented the Abeta25-35-induced decrease of AKT activation and increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) activation, resulting in a decrease of Tau phosphorylation. Finally, L41 restored Abeta25-35-reduced levels of synaptic markers. The novel DYRK1A-preferential inhibitor L41 therefore prevented Abeta25-35-induced memory impairments and neurotoxicity in the mouse hippocampus. These in vivo data highlighted particularly DYRK1A as a major kinase involved in Abeta pathology and suggested therapeutic developments for DYRK1A inhibitors in AD.
