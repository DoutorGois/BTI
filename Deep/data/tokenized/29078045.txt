It has been known for over a century that the hippocampus, the center for learning and memory in the brain, is selectively vulnerable to ischemic damage, with the CA1 being more vulnerable than the CA3. It is also known that leucine enkephalin, or YGGFL, is neuroprotective. We hypothesized that the extracellular hydrolysis of YGGFL may be greater in the CA1 than the CA3, which would lead to the observed difference in susceptibility to ischemia. In rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we estimated the Michaelis constant and the maximum velocity for membrane-bound aminopeptidase activity in the CA1 and CA3 regions. Using electroosmotic push-pull perfusion and offline capillary liquid chromatography, we inferred enzyme activity based on the production rate of GGFL, a natural and inactive product of the enzymatic hydrolysis of YGGFL. We found nearly 3-fold higher aminopeptidase activity in the CA1 than the CA3. The aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin significantly reduced hydrolysis of YGGFL in both regions by increasing apparent Km. Based on propidium iodide cell death measurements 24 h after oxygen-glucose deprivation, we demonstrate that inhibition of aminopeptidase activity using bestatin selectively protected CA1 against delayed cell death due to oxygen-glucose deprivation and that this neuroprotection occurs through enkephalin-dependent pathways.
