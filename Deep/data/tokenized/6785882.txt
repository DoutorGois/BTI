Rats with lesions of the hippocampus or mammillary bodies were impaired in learning reversal problems in a T-maze. Test trials given after learning each reversal disclosed little forgetting in the mammillary body group but rapid forgetting in the hippocampal group. These findings resemble those recently reported in patients with amnestic syndromes.
