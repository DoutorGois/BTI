The distribution of the two major cyclooxygenase products prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) in 7 different regions of the brain (medulla, cerebellum, hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus and cerebral cortex) was studied. Basal levels were highest in hypothalamus and cortex. Following convulsions elicited by environmental stress prostaglandin concentrations increased in all areas, with largest increases (10-20-fold) in hippocampus and cortex, reaching 70 ng/g PGD2 in hippocampus and 115 ng/g PGD2 in cortex. These results demonstrate that, during spontaneous seizures, there is a greater increase in prostanoid production in those areas involved in the convulsive process.
