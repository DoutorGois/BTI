Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration may be used to induce an in vivo model for neuroinflammation or neurodegeneration. We examined the regional distribution of inflammatory markers induced by LPS in the brain of young mice. Criteria for inflammation included measures of cytokines and microglial activation. Levels of IL-1beta mRNA increased in the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum following systemic treatment with LPS. Levels of SRA mRNA increased in the frontal cortex and striatum and levels of TLR2 and TLR4 mRNAs increased in the frontal cortex and cerebellum. Iba1-positive microglial cells increased in the striatum, medial septum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus after LPS treatment. In addition, glutathione (GSH) levels decreased and mitochondrial complex II/III activities increased after systemic LPS injection. Although LPS treatment did not significantly alter cellular ATP levels, these levels correlated with levels of IL-1beta and TLR4 in the LPS-treated mice. The region-specific inflammatory response to LPS in the brain may serve to create a model for studies of neurodegenerative disease.
