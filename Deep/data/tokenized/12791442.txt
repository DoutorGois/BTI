Based on the results of recent electrophysiological and anatomical studies, we argue that the classical division of the entorhinal cortex (EC) into a superficial layer input station and deep layer output station is no longer tenable. We point out that the anatomical data suggest that the medial and lateral divisions of EC are separate, and recent studies of the propagation of signals originating in the lateral olfactory tract and perirhinal cortex to the EC [J. Neurophysiol. 83 (2000) 1924-1931; Biella and de Curtis, 2000) indicate that the lateral division is the input station, and the medial division the output station for information processed in the hippocampus and subiculum.
