A series of constrained pentapeptide analogues of the fragment Abeta(31-35) has been prepared using solid phase synthesis protocols. The results of conformational studies and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments seem to indicate that the affinity of these constrained analogues for immobilized Abeta(25-35) peptide could be related to their ability to adopt a Leu34N-Ile31O beta-turn-like folded conformation.
