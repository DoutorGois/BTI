RC3 (neurogranin; BICKS) is a neuron-specific calmodulin-binding protein kinase C substrate. Thus far, immunohistochemical studies on the localization of RC3 revealed its presence in all neuronal phenotypes, which were restricted to specific areas in the neostriatum, the neocortex, and the hippocampus. RC3 was mostly found in cell bodies and dendrites, with some infrequent presence in axonal profiles, i.e. in the internal capsule. Until now, RC3 expression was reported to be absent in the adult rat spinal cord. RC3 might, however, act as an intermediate of protein kinase C-mediated signaling pathways during synaptic development and plasticity. We hypothesized a role for this 78-amino-acid protein in dendritic plasticity occurring after spinal cord injury. To our surprise, an immunohistological analysis of the uninjured adult rat spinal cord revealed the presence of RC3-positive cell bodies and dendrites in specific regions in the gray matter. Interestingly, axon-containing structures, such as the dorsal and ventral corticospinal tract, were also found to be RC3-positive. This axonal labeling was confirmed by preembedding electron microscopy. In conclusion, we demonstrate here that RC3 is present in the adult rat spinal cord in pre- and postsynaptic structures.
