The rapid hydrolysis in vivo of IDRA21 to 2-amino-5-chlorobenzensulfonamide has been demonstrated by microdialysis experiments. The IDRA21 metabolite possess in vitro a biological activity similar to that of IDRA21 itself. Taking 2-amino-5-chlorobenzensulfonamide as lead compound, a novel class of AMPAR positive allosteric modulators has been prepared.
