A novel microtubule associated protein (MAP) was identified with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) among rat brain microtubule (MT) proteins. This MAP, which is found in a heat-stable MAP fraction, is co-polymerized with tubulin from rat brain homogenates both in cycled and in taxol-driven assembly purifications. When the heat-stable fraction of MT proteins and purified tubulin are assembled in vitro without taxol, 205 kDa MAP is identified in the MT pellet. Immunofluorescent studies using the mAb against this MAP on sections of a rat spinal cord, hippocampus, retina and cerebellar cortex, showed that 205 kDa MAP was localized in not only neural cell bodies, dendrites, and axons, but also in glial cells. This 205 kDa MAP is clearly distinct from previously reported MAPs as to molecular mass, heat stability, immunoreactivity, distribution among tissues or within a neuron, and the developmental aspect of the postnatal cerebellar cortex. As for development, the 205 kDa MAP has already been seen to appear at postnatal day 3. Throughout the postnatal development of the cerebellar cortex, 205 kDa MAP is expressed in developing Purkinje cells, with the staining reaction being particularly intense in the more superficially positioned parallel fiber profiles. This points out the possible important functions of 205 kDa MAP in the morphogenesis of parallel fiber axons.
