Glutathione plays an essential role in maintaining cellular redox balance, protecting cells from oxidative stress and detoxifying xenobiotic compounds. Glutathione depletion has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Cells of neuronal origin are acutely sensitive to glutathione depletion, providing an avenue for studying the mechanisms invoked for neuronal survival in response to oxidant challenge. We investigated the changes in mRNA profile in HT22 hippocampal cells following administration of homocysteic acid (HCA), a glutathione-depleting drug. We report that HCA treatment of HT22 murine hippocampal cells increases the levels of the mRNAs encoding at least three proteins involved in protection from oxidant injury, the mRNAs encoding heavy (H) and light (L) ferritin and glutathione S-transferase (GST).
