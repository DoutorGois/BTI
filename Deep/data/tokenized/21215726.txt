Glutamate delta-1 receptors (GluRdelta1) are expressed in the adult hippocampus and inner ear and have recently been shown to be important for high-frequency hearing. Similar to the closest homolog glutamate delta-2 receptor (GluRdelta2), no agonist-induced currents are observed from GluRdelta1 receptors. In an effort to understand the function of the GluRdelta1 subunit, we probed the conserved transmembrane 3 (TM3) region of the GluRdelta1 subunit, where the GluRdelta2 lurcher mutation is localized. Four mutations in the TM3 domain A650C, L652A, A654C, and F655A resulted in spontaneously open GluRdelta1 channels suggesting that GluRdelta1 receptors can form homomeric receptors. The leak currents were partially blocked by pentamidine but showed negligible inhibition by NASP. It has been demonstrated that extracellular Ca(2+) binds and stabilizes the ligand binding domain (LBD) dimer interface leading to potentiation of currents through GluRdelta2(Lc) channels. We found that extracellular Ca(2+) potentiated the spontaneous currents through GluRdelta1F655A suggesting that extracellular Ca(2+) may interact with the conserved residues at GluRdelta1 LBD dimer interface. A recent study suggested that d-serine and glycine bind to the GluRdelta2 LBD and reduce spontaneous currents through the GluRdelta2(Lc) channels. d-Serine and glycine produced only a modest reduction of spontaneous currents through GluRdelta1F655A and had no effect on the spontaneous current through GluRdelta1L652A. However, spontaneous currents in a chimeric GluRdelta1-delta2(Lc) were robustly inhibited by d-serine. These results suggest that the activation gate is conserved in GluRdelta1 receptors. Moreover, the conformational changes induced by d-serine and extracellular Ca(2+) are conserved among GluRdelta1 and GluRdelta2 receptors.
