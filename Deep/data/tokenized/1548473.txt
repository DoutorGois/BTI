The cytosol fraction from a thoroughly irrigated canine cerebrum was subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody against porcine leukocyte 12-lipoxygenase. Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase eluted from the column with some retardation. The enzyme, with a specific activity of 9 nmol/min/mg of protein, converted arachidonic acid to 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. The enzyme was active not only with arachidonic acid, but also with linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids. In contrast, 12-lipoxygenase of canine platelets was almost inactive with linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and the platelet enzyme was also distinguished from the cerebral enzyme in terms of reactivity with the anti-12-lipoxygenase antibody. 12-Lipoxygenase activity was also detected in the cytosol fractions of other parts of canine brain: basal ganglia, hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and medulla oblongata.
