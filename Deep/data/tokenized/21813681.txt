Long-lasting, experience-dependent changes in synaptic strength are widely thought to underlie the formation of memories. Many forms of learning-related plasticity are likely mediated by NMDA receptor activation and plasticity-related gene expression in brain areas thought to be important for learning and memory, including the hippocampus. Here, we examined the putative role of activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc), an immediate-early gene (IEG) whose expression is tightly linked to the induction and maintenance of some forms of neuronal plasticity, in hippocampus-dependent and hippocampus-independent forms of learning. The extent to which learning-induced Arc expression may depend on NMDA receptor activation was also assessed. First, we observed an increase in Arc gene and protein products in both dorsal hippocampus (DH) and ventral hippocampus (VH) of male Sprague Dawley rats after hippocampus-dependent trace and contextual fear conditioning, but not after hippocampus-independent delay fear conditioning. Specific knockdown of Arc using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) in DH or VH attenuated the learning-related expression of Arc protein, and resulted in a dramatic impairment in trace and contextual, but not delay, fear conditioning. Finally, pretraining infusions of the NMDA receptor antagonist APV into the DH or VH blocked the learning-induced enhancement of Arc in a regionally selective manner, suggesting that NMDA receptor activation and Arc translation are functionally coupled to support hippocampus-dependent memory for fear conditioning. Collectively these results provide the first evidence suggesting that NMDA receptor-dependent expression of the IEG Arc in both DH and VH likely underlies the consolidation of a variety of forms of hippocampus-dependent learning.
