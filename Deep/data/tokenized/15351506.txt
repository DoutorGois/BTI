Prenatal administration of synthetic estrogens in humans as well as lower mammals was reported to alter behavior in adulthood. The alterations remain to be characterized according to specific pathophysiological hypotheses. In this study, three common behavioral models of schizophrenia were tested, i.e., latent inhibition (LI), prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) and hyperlocomotion under amphetamine. Female Long-Evans rats were injected i.p. with a solution of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (15 microg kg(-1)) everyday from day 9 to 14 of pregnancy, and behavioral characteristics of their offspring, raised by Wistar foster mothers, were compared to those of rats born from dams injected with the vehicle only, over the same gestation period. LI was tested in a conditioned taste aversion and a conditioned passive avoidance paradigm followed by a parametric study of PPI and an evaluation of locomotion in an open field under saline or amphetamine (1.5 mg kg(-1)). Histological brain measurements were also carried out in a subset of the same rats. Neither LI nor PPI was altered using methods that had proven sensitive in previous pharmacological studies. Treated rats' locomotion was impaired, but amphetamine did not elicit a differential enhancement. A thinner Amon's horn layer was observed in their hippocampus. This indicates that standard models of schizophrenia did not fit to the behavioral abnormalities found by others and confirmed in this study. They were not due to the abnormal maternal care to pups elicited by the treatment.
