Ibotenic acid was injected into 3 parts of the lateral rat hippocampus. The animals were sacrificed 100 days after treatment, and studied immunohistochemically. The lesioned side of the hippocampus was highly atrophic with extensive neuronal loss and gliosis. Although silver staining revealed no particular structures such as neurofibrillary tangles or senile plaques, globular and granular depositions of amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP) immunoreactivity was observed by immunostaining in the lesion with the monoclonal antibody (clone 22C11). Increased immunoreactivities of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin were found in the lesioned area, while the immunoreactivities of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and 200 kDa neurofilament subunit protein (NF-H) were diminished. The results indicate that APP deposition is formed in the lesioned area where neuronal degeneration is produced by ibotenic acid in rat hippocampus.
