BACKGROUND: We investigated the neuroprotective properties of levosimendan, a novel inodilator, in an in vitro model of traumatic brain injury. METHODS: Organotypic hippocampal brain slices from mouse pups were subjected to a focal mechanical trauma. Slices were treated after the injury with three different concentrations of levosimendan (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 muM) and compared to vehicle-treated slices. After 72 hrs, the trauma was quantified using propidium iodide to mark the injured cells. RESULTS: A significant dose-dependent reduction of both total and secondary tissue injury was observed in cells treated with either 0.01 or 0.1 muM levosimendan compared to vehicle-treated slices. CONCLUSION: Levosimendan represents a promising new pharmacological tool for neuroprotection after brain injury and warrants further investigation in an in vivo model.
