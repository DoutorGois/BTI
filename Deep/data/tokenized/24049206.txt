CONTEXT: The neurobiological effect of yoga on the cortical structures in the elderly is as yet unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven healthy elderly subjects received yoga intervention as an add-on life-style practice. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained before and 6 months later. Voxel-based-morphometric analyses compared the brains before and after the yoga. RESULTS: Yoga group was found to have increases in hippocampal, but not in occipital gray matter. CONCLUSION: Yoga has potential to reduce neuro-senescence. Small sample size and absence of the control group prevent generalization of the findings limiting its translational value.
