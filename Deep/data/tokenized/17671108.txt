We have previously shown that fear extinction is accompanied by an increase of synaptic efficacy in inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and that disrupting these changes to mPFC synaptic transmission compromises extinction processes. The aim of this study was to examine whether these extinction-related changes undergo further plasticity as the memory of extinction becomes more remote. Changes in synaptic efficacy in both vHPC-mPFC and MD-mPFC inputs were consequently analyzed when the memory was either 1 d or 7 d old. Increases of synaptic efficacy in the vHPC-mPFC pathway were observed when the memory was 1 d old, but not 7 d after initial extinction. In contrast, potentiation of synaptic efficacy in the MD-mPFC pathway increased over time. In rats that received low-frequency vHPC stimulation immediately after extinction, both vHPC-mPFC and MD-mPFC inputs failed to develop potentiation, and the recall of extinction (both recent and remote memories) was impaired. These findings suggest that post-extinction potentiation in vHPC-mPFC inputs may be necessary for both the recall of recent memory and post-extinction potentiation in the MD-mPFC inputs. This late potentiation process may be required for the recall of remote extinction memory.
