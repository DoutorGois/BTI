This study aims to evaluate the impact of neonatal arthritis on adult pain threshold, sleep and general behaviours in rats and their lactating dams. Male pups were injected in the hind paw with complete Freund's adjuvant or saline on postnatal day (PN) 1. After weaning, dams were tested for anxiety, sleep recording or hormone profiling (ACTH, corticosterone and prolactin) and brain sampling (pineal melatonin and hippocampus serotonin). At adulthood (PN90), distinct subgroups of neonatal arthritic (AR) and control rats (CR) were also assessed for anxiety and pain thresholds, sleep recording, and blood/brain sampling. Compared to their respective controls at PN12, dams of arthritic rats (DAR) showed a longer latency in expressing pup retrieval and dam-pup interaction. DAR and AR showed a lower pain threshold, anxiety-like behaviour, and sleep fragmentation. Compared to controls, DAR displayed longer sleep latency, reduced paradoxical sleep latency and sleep efficiency, a decrease in prolactin and serotonin levels and increased melatonin levels. This model of unilateral hindpaw inflammation has a wide range of long-term effects in both lactating dams and their adult offspring.
