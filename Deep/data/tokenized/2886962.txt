Micropressure injection of glutamate onto the apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells usually produces a fast rising, brief depolarization. However, hyperpolarizing responses with longer durations (300-500 ms) can be produced over a range of drug electrode locations. These hyperpolarizations can be reversed with intracellular injection of hyperpolarizing current. Localized application of glutamate in the stratum radiatum produces a depolarizing response in intracellularly recorded CA1 interneurons. Previous studies have shown that the dendrites of GABA-ergic basket cell interneurons extend into the stratum radiatum and are involved in mediating feedforward inhibition of pyramidal neurons. The glutamate-induced hyperpolarizations observed in pyramidal neurons are probably due to direct excitation of dendrites of interneurons, which in turn produce a synaptic inhibition in pyramidal cells.
