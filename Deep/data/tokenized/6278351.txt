Actions of the central angiotensin system on brain cAMP concentrations were studied after intraventricular injection of renin. Biosynthesis of endogenous brain angiotensin II was stimulated by 0.1 U renin and the blood pressure was elevated 40 min after the application. Stimulation of the brain angiotensin system affected cAMP metabolism in several brain areas, mostly expressed as decreased cAMP levels. Significant decreases in cAMP concentrations were found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, various hypothalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, central grey matter and in the locus coeruleus. The unchanged cAMP levels in the nucleus of the solitary tract might indicate that intraventricular injection of renin induced an acute blood pressure elevation which is not associated with changes in the cAMP system in the primary baroreceptor area.
