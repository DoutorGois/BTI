Long-term forms of synaptic plasticity that may underlie learning and memory have been suggested to depend on changes in the number of synapses between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Here we have investigated a form of synaptic plasticity in cultures of hippocampal CA3 and CA1 neurons related to the late phase of long-term potentiation, which depends on cAMP and protein synthesis. Using the fluorescent dye FM 1-43 to label active presynaptic terminals, we find that a membrane permeable analog of cAMP enhances the number of active presynaptic terminals and that this effect requires protein synthesis.
