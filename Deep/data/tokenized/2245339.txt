The influence of the environment on the endogenous levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the cortex, hippocampus and septum was examined in adult (82 days old) and juvenile (51 days old) rats. Animals were reared/housed for 30 days in an enriched, standard or isolated environment prior to analysis. In addition, another group of rats were given behavioural tests (4 days) after differential rearing/housing before measurements of NGF. We found complex variations in the level of NGF both in juvenile and adult hippocampus after differential environmental rearing/housing. Rearing/housing in an enriched environment improved performance in the Morris maze and decreased spontaneous motor activity. Exposure to behavioural tests caused alterations in adult hippocampus and septum NGF levels. The results show that testing in a novel environment causes small but significant changes in the hippocampal and septal NGF levels depending upon the environmental history of the animal. In view of the purported involvement of the septohippocampal pathway and NGF in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, our finding suggests that lack of adequate environmental stimulation might be of importance in age-related behavioural and neurochemical deficits.
