There is often little correspondence between human and animal examples of nondeclarative memory. The serial reaction time task (SRT) is a sequence learning example of human nondeclarative memory that may be suitable for development as an animal model. The SRT is believed to be impaired by basal ganglia, not limbic system damage, but there is uncertainty whether limbic system pathology does in fact leave the SRT unimpaired. We therefore developed a new rat model that closely approximated the human SRT, using intracranial self-stimulation to promote rapid continuous responding to four adjacent nose pokes in a single test session. Intact rats that experienced repeated sequences demonstrated robust interference effects when switched to a random sequence of cued responses (at 4-, 8-, and 12-sequence lengths), unlike intact controls that experienced the random sequences only. The interference effect in the human task is a key measure for nondeclarative sequence learning. Rats with dorsal caudate lesions that experienced massed sequence repetitions showed an interference effect at the four-sequence length only. By contrast, rats with dorsal hippocampal lesions showed an interference effect at all sequence lengths. This new rat SRT model clarifies the basal ganglia-limbic system dichotomy suggested by human work.
