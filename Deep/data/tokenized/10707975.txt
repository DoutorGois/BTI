The relationship between adhesive interactions across the synaptic cleft and synaptic function has remained elusive. At certain CNS synapses, pre- to postsynaptic adhesion is mediated at least in part by neural (N-) cadherin. Here, we demonstrate that upon depolarization of hippocampal neurons in culture by K+ treatment, or application of NMDA or alpha-latrotoxin, synaptic N-cadherin dimerizes and becomes markedly protease resistant. These properties are indices of strong, stable, enhanced cadherin-mediated intercellular adhesion. N-cadherin retained protease resistance for at least 2 hr after recovery, while other surface molecules, including other cadherins, were completely degraded. The acquisition of protease resistance and dimerization of N-cadherin is not dependent on new protein synthesis, nor is it accompanied by internalization of N-cadherin. By immunocytochemistry, we found that high K+ selectively induces surface dispersion of N-cadherin, which, after recovery, returns to synaptic puncta. N-cadherin dispersion under K+ treatment parallels the rapid expansion of the presynaptic membrane consequent to the massive vesicle fusion that occurs with this type of depolarization. In contrast, with NMDA application, N-cadherin does not disperse but does acquire enhanced protease resistance and dimerizes. Our data strongly suggest that synaptic adhesion is dynamically and locally controlled, and modulated by synaptic activity.
