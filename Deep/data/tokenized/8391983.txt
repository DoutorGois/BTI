We used combinations of NMDA and quisqualate/kainate (Q/K) receptor antagonists and low Mg2+ (0.1 mM) solutions to study the respective roles of these receptors during in vitro kindling of interictal bursts in the CA3 area of rat hippocampal slices. Intracellular and extracellular recordings in CA3 showed that Q/K receptors were not necessary for the induction of kindling once the Mg2+ block of NMDA was alleviated, but that the expression of bursts kindled via NMDA-driven mechanisms was Q/K-dependent.
