The physiological regulation of food intake is a critical factor in both the rate at which an animal grows and its reproductive activity. Recently, progress has been made in elucidating a complex system in which insulin, leptin, and neuropeptide Y function to monitor an animal's energy balance and regulate feed intake and fertility. RNA was extracted from ovine hypothalamic, anterior pituitary, pancreas, and adipose tissue. Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. cDNAs were cloned and sequenced for leptin (350 base pairs [bp], GenBank accession number U62123 and 441 bp, GenBank accession number U84247), NPY-Y1 receptor (350 bp, GenBank accession no. U62122) and NPY-Y2 receptor (440 bp, GenBank accession no. U83458). Probes generated from these clones were used to detect mRNA expression within tissues thought to be involved in the coregulation of feed intake and reproduction. Leptin was found to be expressed in sheep adipose tissue. The ovine NPY-Y1 receptor mRNA was detected within the arcuate nucleus and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and in pancreatic, anterior pituitary, and adipose tissues. Expression of ovine NPY-Y2 receptor mRNA was detected in the hippocampus and within pancreatic tissue. These observations provide evidence of potential mechanisms that exist for mediating communication between peripheral and central tissues within the insulin-leptin-NPY pathway.
