Brief neonatal ethanol exposure (3.0 g/kg/dose, twice daily; postnatal day (PN) 4 to PN8) resulted in cholinergic neurochemical alterations in the cerebellum, but not the hippocampus of rats assayed on PN20. Analysis revealed that the binding affinity of cerebellar muscarinic receptors for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate was decreased by ethanol, but only in female pups. Other gender-specific but treatment-independent cerebellar differences were identified as well, including lower levels of choline acetyltransferase activity and S1-level (1,000 x g) crude protein in males and females, respectively. No evidence of ethanol-induced cholinergic change was noted in the hippocampus of the same pups on PN20. However, collapsed across treatment, male hippocampi were found to contain less S1-level protein than their female counterparts. Neither muscarinic receptor density nor acetyl cholinesterase activity were found to differ between treatments or genders, in either brain region. Consistent with the developmental timetables for regional cholinergic synaptogenesis in the rat, observations on PN20 confirm a hypothesis of cerebellar cholinergic vulnerability and hippocampal cholinergic resilience to neonatal ethanol insult.
