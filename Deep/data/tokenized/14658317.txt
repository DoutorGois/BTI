Incubation of hippocampal slices with Z-DEVD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, elicits a time dependent decrease in long-term potentiation (LTP). After 4 hours or later after the incubation with Z-DEVD-FMK the tetanization fails to induce LTP. However, Z-DEVD-FMK does not affect basal indices of synaptic plasticity and short-term plasticity (population spike amplitudes and paired pulse facilitation). The results are the first evidence for the involvement of caspase-3-mediated mechanisms in long-term potentiation phenomenon.
