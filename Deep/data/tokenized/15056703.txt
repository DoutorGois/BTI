Eyeblink conditioning has been hypothesized to engage two successive stages of nonspecific emotional (fear) and specific musculature (eyelid) learning, during which the nonspecific component influences the acquisition of the specific component. Here we test this notion by investigating the relative contributions of the cerebellum, the amygdala, and the hippocampus to the emergence of conditioned eyelid and fear responses during delay eyeblink conditioning in freely moving rats. Periorbital electromyography (EMG) and 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalization (USV) activities were measured concurrently from the same subjects and served as indices of conditioned eyeblink and fear responses, respectively. In control animals, conditioned EMG responses increased across training sessions, whereas USV responses were initially robust but decreased across training sessions. Animals with electrolytic lesions to their cerebellum (targeting the interpositus nucleus) were completely unable to acquire conditioned EMG responses but exhibited normal USV behavior, whereas animals with lesions to the amygdala showed decelerated acquisition of conditioned EMG responses and displayed practically no USV behavior. In contrast, hippocampal lesioned rats demonstrated facilitated acquisition of conditioned EMG responses, whereas the USV behavior was unaffected. The amygdalar involvement in eyeblink conditioning was examined further by applying the GABA(A) agonist muscimol directly into the amygdala either before or immediately after training sessions. Although pretraining muscimol infusions impaired conditioned EMG responses, post-training infusions did not. Together, these results suggest that, even during a simple delay eyeblink conditioning, animals learn about different aspects associated with the behavioral task that are subserved by multiple brain-memory systems that interact to produce the overall behavior.
