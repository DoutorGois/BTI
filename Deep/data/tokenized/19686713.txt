The effects of chronic morphine exposure on synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region of the hippocampal slice preparation using extracellular recordings of the population spike (PS) evoked in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation were studied. High frequency stimulation (HFS; 1X100 Hz) and theta pulse stimulation (TPS; 5 Hz trains for 3 min) were used as patterned activities. The results showed that in rats chronically treated with morphine (dependent group), TPS induced long-term depression (LTD) of PS in CA1 in the absence of in vitro morphine. This TPS-induced PS LTD was blocked in the presence of either AP5 (NMDAR antagonist) or CPX (A1 adenosine receptor antagonist) alone, but was not blocked when AP5 and CPX were co-applied. This TPS-induced PS LTD was also blocked in the presence of either 8-PT (a selective A1 adenosine receptor antagonist) or MRS1220 (a specific A3 receptor antagonist). Additionally, when TPS was applied prior to HFS, PS long-term potentiation (LTP) was blocked. However, when TPS was applied after HFS, there was no reversal of PS LTP in slices from dependent rats in contrast to controls which displayed reversal of LTP. Both the PS LTD and the absence of PS LTP reversal were blocked by in vitro application of morphine. It is concluded that morphine withdrawal was associated with greater depression of CA1 PS elicited by natural stimulus induced activity pattern. This effect was associated with changes in NMDA and adenosine receptors due to chronic morphine administration. Such an in vitro preparation could provide a novel paradigm to investigate withdrawal effects on synaptic plasticity.
