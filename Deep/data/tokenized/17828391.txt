Previously, we reported an elevation in the power of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) local field potential spontaneous gamma-band (40-100 Hz) after long-term depression (LTD) but not long-term potentiation (LTP) in the rat ventral hippocampus CA1 (vCA1)-PFC pathway. In the present study, we analyzed the PFC local field potential before and after the induction of posterior dorsal hippocampus CA1 (pdCA1)-PFC LTP/LTD in vivo. In contrast with vCA1-PFC, the present study found that gamma-band power elevation was associated with pdCA1-PFC LTP but not LTD, although we observed a correlation between LTD and the gamma-band power change. The differences between vCA1- and pdCA1-PFC pathways might be related to differences in synaptic plasticity and behavioral functions. Since the neural connection of the hippocampus and PFC is believed to be involved in the function of the working memory, sustained gamma-band power elevation in the PFC might be related to this function.
