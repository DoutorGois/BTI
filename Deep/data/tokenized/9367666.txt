Calcium ionophore A23187 or phenylephrine injected i.p. in doses of 0.05-0 .25 mg kg-1 and 0.1-1 mg kg-1, respectively, induced translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) from the cytosol to the membrane fraction of the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus. The action of A23187 was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by nifedipine and verapamil. The phenylephrine induced translocation of PKC was blocked by prazosin and in a dose-dependent manner by nifedipine and verapamil. In contrast, pre-treatment with a small, ineffective by itself, dose of A23187 (0.02 mg kg-1) potentiated the alpha1-adrenoceptor induced translocation of PKC. Thus, it seems that the influx of calcium ions through an L-type calcium channel is probably necessary for a full alpha1-adrenoceptor mediated activation and translocation of PKC.
