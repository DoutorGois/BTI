FK506, originally classified as an immunosuppressant, may also be implicated in some events in the central nervous system. FK506 elicits both neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects in vitro. FK506 is neuroprotective for focal cerebral ischemia, but it is not clear whether FK506 has neuroprotective effects for other brain diseases. In this study, we investigated possible neuroprotective effects of FK506 in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) induced by kainic acid (KA) or trimethyltin (TMT). In rat models, we observed marked protection against seizures, abnormal behaviors, and accompanying delayed neuronal damage in the hippocampus by the systemic injection of FK506.
