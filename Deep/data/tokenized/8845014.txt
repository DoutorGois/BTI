The effects of single (1mg/kg) and repeated (1mg/kg 2* daily for 4 days) diazepam administration are investigated on brain regional 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration in rats. Daily treatment decreased food intakes but body weights did not decrease. Administration of diazepam (1mg/kg) to 4 day saline injected rats on the 5th day decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and increased it in the hypothalamus. 5-HIAA levels were increased in the striatum and decreased in the hypothalamus 4 day diazepam injected rats injected with saline on the 5th day also exhibited similar changes of 5-HT and 5-HIAA. Cortical levels of 5-HIAA were also smaller in these rats. Administration of diazepam to 4 day diazepam injected rats again decreased 5-HT in the hippocampus and 5-HIAA in the hypothalamus. 5-HT and 5-HIAA were both decreased in the striatum. Regionally specific effects of diazepam on brain serotonin metabolism are discussed in relation to their possible functions.
