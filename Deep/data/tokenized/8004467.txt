The distribution of cholecystokinin B (CCK-B) receptors in the Mastomys brain was studied using Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization technique. By Northern blot analysis using 32P-labeled cDNA probe, the cortex had the highest hybridization signal of CCK-B receptor mRNA in the brain. The olfactory bulb and hippocampus showed a moderate level of signals. In situ hybridization using 35S-labeled cRNA probes revealed a wide and region-specific distribution of CCK-B receptor mRNA in the telencephalon. Throughout the cerebral cortex, labeled cells were found in all layers, with higher intensities in layers II, V and VI. Pyramidal cells of the layer II of the piriform cortex showed the highest level of signals in the brain. In the hippocampus, most of the pyramidal cells of the Ammon's horn were labeled, although labeled cells were not detected in other layers. Distinct signals were also detected in the various amygdaloid nuclei, caudate-putamen, reticular thalamic nucleus, hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus and inferior colliculus. This distribution pattern may further support the prominent existence of CCK-B receptors in the brain particularly in the telencephalon.
