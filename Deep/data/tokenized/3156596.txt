In order to determine whether or not atrial natriuretic polypeptides (ANPs) exist in the brain, we have studied extracts from the rat brain using a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) for alpha-atrial natriuretic polypeptide. The presence and widespread distribution of alpha-rat ANP-like immunoreactivity (alpha-rANP-LI) have been demonstrated in the rat brain. The highest concentration of alpha-rANP-LI (20-22 ng/g) is in the hypothalamus and the septum. Moderate concentrations of alpha-rANP-LI (2-8 ng/g) are also found in the midbrain, cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, thalamus, pons-medulla and hippocampus. High performance gel permeation chromatography coupled with the RIA revealed that alpha-rANP-LI found in the rat brain consists of three components eluting at the positions of gamma-rat ANP (gamma-rANP), beta-rat ANP (beta-rANP) and alpha-rANP, respectively. Among these a low molecular weight form of alpha-rANP-LI emerging at the elution position corresponding to alpha-rANP is predominant in the rat brain. This is in contrast to the finding that gamma-rANP, a high molecular weight form of 13k daltons is the dominant form of alpha-rANP-LI in the rat atrium. These results clearly show that there exists a widespread neural system containing ANPs in the brain.
