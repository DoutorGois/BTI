INTRODUCTION: Although mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis is mainly based on cognitive assessment, reliable estimates of structural changes in specific brain regions, that could be contrasted against normal brain aging and inform diagnosis, are lacking. This study aimed to systematically review the literature reporting on MCI-related brain changes. METHODS: The MEDLINE database was searched for studies investigating longitudinal structural changes in MCI. Studies with compatible data were included in the meta-analyses. A qualitative review was conducted for studies excluded from meta-analyses. RESULTS: The analyses revealed a 2.2-fold higher volume loss in the hippocampus, 1.8-fold in the whole brain, and 1.5-fold in the entorhinal cortex in MCI participants. DISCUSSION: Although the medial temporal lobe is likely to be more vulnerable to MCI pathology, atrophy in this brain area represents a relatively small proportion of whole brain loss, suggesting that future investigations are needed to identify the source of unaccounted volume loss in MCI.
