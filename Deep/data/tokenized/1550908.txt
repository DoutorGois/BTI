The pharmacokinetic profiles of biperiden (BP) in blood and in specific brain regions were investigated in rats after acute i.v. administration. The regional brain-to-blood unbound concentration ratios (Kpf) were also determined after 16 h intravenous infusion of BP. The Kpf values ranged from 30 to 75 in the different brain regions and showed decreasing concentrations in the following order: pons + medulla oblongata, basal ganglia, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, mesencephalon, bulbus olfactorius + septum, hippocampus, frontal cortex, occipital cortex, cerebellum. The relationship between BP and acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations in the brain regions was examined. ACh levels in the various brain regions ranged from 8 to 44 ng g-1 tissue. There was a significant correlation between the Kpf values of BP and the levels of ACh in the brain regions except for the pons + oblongata. BP concentrations in the brain regions after BP administration were predicted based on the physiological pharmacokinetics. There was reasonable agreement between the model predictions and the observed data.
