Western blot analyses reveal that calcineurin A (CNA), which is present in the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, parietal cortex, and MPOA of virgin males and females, is undetectable only in the MPOA of primiparous females regardless of whether they had postpartum pup contact or not. In contrast, CNB was expressed at unchanging levels in the PC and MPOA. Similarly, G(alphao) and PKA(RI) were expressed at high levels in all of the brain regions of virgin males, virgin females, and primiparous females, supporting the concept that this loss of CNA is a specific event. Understanding how and why the expression of CNA, the sole neuronal Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, is down-regulated specifically in the MPOA of primiparous females may yield some insight into the signal transduction events that mediate the onset of mammalian maternal behavior.
