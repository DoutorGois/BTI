BACKGROUND: SAPAP1 was originally identified as a protein interacting with the guanylate kinase domain of PSD-95. SAPAP1 also interacts with various proteins, including neurofilaments, synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM), nArgBP2, dynein light chain and Shank through different regions. RESULTS: We expressed various regions of SAPAP1 in hippocampal neurones. The synaptic targeting of SAPAP1 was mediated by the N-terminal region and did not depend on the interaction with PSD-95 or S-SCAM. SAPAP1 was not involved in the synaptic localization of PSD-95 or S-SCAM, but affected that of Shank. The synaptic targeting of SAPAP1 was not suppressed by blocking NMDA or AMPA receptors. Fluorescent recovery after a photobleaching study revealed that SAPAP1 was immobile at synapses. CONCLUSION: SAPAP1 is a component of the static core of PSD, and its dynamics are different from those of the other PSD components, PSD-95, S-SCAM and BEGAIN.
