Most current methods of gene delivery for primary cultured hippocampal neurons are limited by toxicity, transient expression, the use of immature neurons and/or low efficiency. We performed a direct comparison of seven serotypes of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for genetic manipulation of primary cultured neurons in vitro. Serotypes 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9 mediated highly efficient, nontoxic, stable long-term gene expression in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons aged 0-4 weeks in vitro; serotypes 5 and 6 were associated with toxicity at high doses. AAV1 transduced over 90% of all cells with approximately 80% of the transduced cells being neurons. The method was readily adapted to a high-throughput format to demonstrate neurotrophin-mediated neuroprotection from glutamate toxicity in cultured neurons at 2 weeks in vitro. These vectors should prove highly useful for efficient overexpression or downregulation of genes in primary neuronal cultures at any developmental stage.
