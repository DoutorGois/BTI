D-myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6), one of the most abundant inositol phosphates within cells, has been proposed to play a key role in vesicle trafficking and receptor compartmentalization. In the present study, we used in vitro receptor autoradiography, subcellular fractionation, and immunoblotting to investigate its effects on alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of 3H-AMPA binding indicated that incubation of frozen-thawed brain sections with InsP6 at 35 degrees C enhanced AMPA receptor binding in several brain regions, with maximal increases in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Moreover, saturation kinetics demonstrated that InsP6-induced augmentation of AMPA binding was due to an increment in the maximal number of AMPA binding sites. At the immunological level, Western blots performed on crude mitochondrial/synaptic (P2) fractions revealed that InsP6 (but not InsP5 and InsP3) treatment increased glutamate receptor (GluR)1 and GluR2 subunits of AMPA receptors, an effect that was associated with concomitant reductions in microsomal (P3) fractions. Interestingly, the InsP6-induced modulation of AMPA receptor binding was blocked at room temperature, and pretreatment with heparin also dampered its action on both AMPA receptor binding and GluR subunits. These effects of InsP6 appear to be specific to AMPA receptors, as neither 3H-glutamate binding to NMDA receptors nor levels of NR1 and NR2A subunits in P2 and P3 fractions were affected. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that InsP6 specifically regulates AMPA receptor distribution, possibly through a clathrin-dependent process.
