OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and apolipoprotein E4(apoE4) on choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) in hippocampus and to explore possible the synergistic effect of both Abeta and apoE4. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control group, Abeta group, apoE4 group and Abeta + apoE4 group. Rats in different group received injection of normal saline, Abeta1-40, apoE4 and Abeta1-40 + apoE4, respectively, into bilateral hippocampus CA1 regions under the control of a brain stereotaxic apparatus. The learning-memory ability with the escape latency and the times of passing platform and the expression of ChAT in hippocampus CA1 regions were documented. RESULTS: The escape latency at fifth day and the times of passing platform and ChAT mRNA PU values were obtained for the control group (10.75 s +/- 2.44 s, 4.13 +/- 0.64, and 28.90 +/- 4.43), apoE4 group (23.88 s +/- 4.32 s, 2.38 +/- 0.52, and 20.85 +/- 3.98), Abeta group (43.50 s +/- 9.78 s, 1.38 +/- 0.52, and 16.96 +/- 2.53), and Abeta + apoE4 group (70.63 s +/- 10.04 s, 0.75 +/- 0.71, and 13.01 +/- 2.21). Through 5 days of training all animals acquired learning-memory ability with the gradually shortened escape latency, although injection of Abeta1-40 and apoE4 all induced learning-memory damage, due to a significantly prolonged the escape latency at fifth day (P < 0.01) and markedly decreased the times of passing platform (P < 0.01) in both Abeta and apoE4 group than in control group. An interaction between Abeta and apoE4 also was observed, with further prolonged escape latency(P < 0.01). ChAT mRNA PU values were significantly lower in the Abeta group and apoE4 group than in the control group (P < 0.01). Abeta and apoE4 demonstrated interaction in lowering ChAT mRNA level(P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both Abeta and apoE4 induce an injury to hippocampal cholinergic system and its learning-memory ability, in which Abeta and apoE4 have a synergistic effect in the initiation of such injury.
