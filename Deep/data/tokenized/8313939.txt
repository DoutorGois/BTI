Immature cells transplanted into an adult host must adapt to their new environment. In the present study we have shown the dendritic development of dentate granule cells following transplantation. The adult host granule cells were lesioned by a fluid injection into the infragranular cleavage plane of the dentate gyrus. Few, if any, granule cells survived the lesion and the molecular layer (ML) shrank. When allogeneic neonatal granule cells were included in the fluid, the host granule cells were simultaneously killed and replaced. In order to visualize the dendrites, the granule cells were filled with Lucifer yellow (LY) in fixed sections and subsequently immunoreacted with an antibody to LY. The granule cell dendrites in the transplant were shorter in length, had a greater cross-sectional area, had more spines, and were more coiled and bent than control granule cell dendrites. The dendrites in the transplant formed functional synapses as indicated by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and the transplant prevented xc03some of the ML shrinkage. Acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) xkreaction product increased both in lesioned and in transplant groups. The laminar pattern of ACHE in the control ML was not seen after the lesion and did not return in animals with successful transplants. We conclude that (i) the dendrites of neurons in the transplant adapted to the adult host environment and a shrinking ML with remarkable structural plasticity; (ii) the transplant prevented some of the shrinkage of the ML; (iii) the transplant could not reverse some of the lesion-induced changes in host organization, such as the organization of ACHE inputs to the ML; and (iv) a phenotypically specific population of transplanted neurons can replace traumatically lesioned neurons of the same type even if the host conditions continue to change.
