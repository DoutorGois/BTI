Behavioral and neural correlates of latent inhibition (LI) during eyeblink conditioning were studied in 2 experiments. In Experiment 1, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were conditioned after 8 days of tone conditioned stimulus (CS) presentations or 8 days of context-alone experience. LI was seen in the CS-preexposed rabbits when a relatively intense (5 psi) airpuff unconditioned stimulus was paired with the CS. In Experiment 2, rabbits were given 0, 4, or 8 days of CS preexposures or context-alone experience. Hippocampal activity was monitored from the 8-day CS- or context-exposure rabbits. The LI effect was seen only in rabbits given 4 days of CS preexposure, thus suggesting that LI depended largely on the rate of acquisition in the context-preexposed control group. The neural recordings showed that the hippocampus was sensitive to the relative novelty of the stimuli and the overall context, regardless of whether exposure to stimuli and context promoted LI.
