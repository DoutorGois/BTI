Rabbits with substantial neocortical lesions were given trace conditioning of the nictitating membrane response over a range of interstimulus intervals (ISIs). Unlike hippocampal lesioned animals, which show deficits in such conditioning, the decorticates were not impaired and they gave greater numbers of conditioned responses at longer ISIs than did sham-operated controls. These results suggest that a neocortical-entorhinal input to the hippocampus may not be crucial for trace conditioning.
