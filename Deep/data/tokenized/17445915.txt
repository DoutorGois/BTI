An important area of the brain aversive circuitry is the lateral septum (LS), together with its principal connections to diverse Hippocampal regions. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether the LS-Hippocampus network participates in the increased anxiety-like behavior produced by a previous defeat experience. The neural activation of different regions of the Hippocampus was assessed by the number of Fos positive cells in animals previously defeated. A notable elevation in the expression of this protein was observed in CA1, CA2, CA3, and Dentate Gyrus, for both dorsal and ventral Hippocampus. The local administration of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR or type II) antagonist, but not of a mineralcorticoid receptor (MR or type II) antagonist, into the LS before the stressful stimuli prevented a rise in the number of Fos positive cells, especially in the ventral portion of the Hippocampus. Furthermore, to evaluate the role of these hippocampal portions in the modulation of the emotional sequelae induced by defeat, the dorsal or the ventral Hippocampus were inactivated by lidocaine at different times following the social confrontation, with the anxiety-like behavior being assessed in the elevated plus maze the next day. Only the inactivation of the ventral region attenuated the excessive anxiety exhibited by defeated animals. The infusion of lidocaine, 1h after the confrontation, did not affect this behavioral response. These data suggest a preferential participation of the LS and its connections to the ventral Hippocampus in the emotional sequelae induced by the social defeat. Moreover, the GR localized within the LS played an essential role in the modulation of this emotional state.
