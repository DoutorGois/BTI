The gene occ1 is preferentially expressed in the primary visual cortex in an activity-dependent and developmentally regulated manner. In this report, we show the characteristic distribution of occ1 transcripts in the CA2 subfield of the hippocampal formation in adult monkeys. occ1 mRNA signals were observed selectively in the pyramidal cell layer of CA2. In addition to these signals, a relatively sparse distribution of occ1 was found in the stratum oriens and, occasionally, in the outermost regions of the pyramidal cell layers of both CA1 and CA2. A few labeled cells were detected in CA3. The elevated expression of occ1 in the CA2 subfield provides a new approach for investigating the function of this subregion, whose role has still not been well clarified.
