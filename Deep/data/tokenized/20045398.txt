AD pathology is often seen in cortical biopsies of NPH patients. It remains unclear whether these findings are coincidental or causally related. In an aged animal model of NPH, we quantify Abeta and pTau accumulation and describe its temporal and spatial distribution. One-year-old male Sprague-Dawley rats had hydrocephalus induced by cisternal kaolin injection. Immunohistochemistry (IMHC) for AbetaPP, Abeta40, Abeta42 and pTau (epitope pT231) and ELISA for Abeta40, Abeta42 and pT231 were performed on controls and after 2, 6 and 10 weeks of hydrocephalus. Rats had double-label fluorescence IMHC for localization of Abeta42 and pT231. IMHC showed no change in neuronal AbetaPP expression following hydrocephalus. Abeta42 appeared earliest in CSF clearance pathways, p<0.05, and also showed significant rises in perivascular spaces and in cortical parenchyma. Mean ELISA values for Abeta40 and Abeta42 increased three- to four-fold in hydrocephalic rats at 6 and 10 weeks. Abeta40 increased between 2 and 6 weeks (p=0.0001), and remained stable at 10 (p=0.0002); whereas Abeta42 was elevated at 2 weeks (p<0.04) and remained at 6 (p=0.015). PTau at 6 and 10 weeks showed AD-like increased neuronal somatic staining and loss of dendritic staining. ELISA demonstrated increased pT231 in hydrocephalic rats at 10 weeks (p<0.0002). Double-label fluorescence for Abeta42 and pT231 revealed intraneuronal co-localization. Hydrocephalus in the elderly rat, therefore, can induce both Abeta and pTau accumulation. As distinct from brain injury models, no increase in AbetaPP expression was demonstrated. Rather, altered CSF dynamics appears to impair Abeta clearance in this NPH model.
