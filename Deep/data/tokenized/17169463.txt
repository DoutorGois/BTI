The function of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a key molecule in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown. Among the proteins that interact with the APP cytoplasmic domain in vitro and in heterologous systems is Disabled-1, a signaling molecule of the reelin pathway. The physiological consequence of this interaction is unknown. Here we used an in vitro model of hippocampal neurons grown on a reelin substrate that inhibits neurite outgrowth. Our results show that an excess of APP cytoplasmic domain internalized by a cell permeable peptide, is able to antagonize the neurite outgrowth inhibition of reelin. The APP cytoplasmic domain binds Disabled-1 and retains it in the cytoplasm, preventing it from reaching the plasma membrane and sequesters tyrosine phosphorylated Disabled-1, both of which disrupt reelin signaling. In the context of AD, increased formation of APP cytoplasmic domain in the cytosol released after cleavage of the A beta peptide, could then inhibit reelin signaling pathway in the hippocampus and thus influence synaptic plasticity.
