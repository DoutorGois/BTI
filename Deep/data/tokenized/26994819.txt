ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Recently, the focus on neuroinflammation is intensified as its complex pathophysiological role has emerged in multiple central nervous system(CNS) disorders. Chotosan (CTS), known as a traditional herbal formula, is often utilized to treat relevant nervous system diseases in China. It was demonstrated effectively to alleviate cognitive deficit associated with aging, diabetes, hypoperfusion and cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of CTS on Abeta1-42-induced cognitive dysfunction remain unclear. Here, we further investigated the effects of chotosan on memory performance, neuroinflammation and apoptotic responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The learning and memory ability is evaluated by Morris water maze (MWM) task and Y-maze test following intrahippocampal infusion of aggregated Abeta1-42. The expression level of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), NF-kappaB p65, Bcl-2 and Bax was examined by Western blot. TLR-4 level is also assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to determine the generation of inflammatory mediators. The caspase-3 activity is analyzed by commercial kits. RESULTS: The repeated treatment with CTS (750mg/kg or 375mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks significantly restored Abeta1-42-induced memory impairment in mice. Meanwhile, this treatment also remarkably reduced TLR-4 and NF-kappaB p65 expression accompanying with the diminished release of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in hippocampus. The neuronal apoptosis is also inhibited as evidenced by increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and decrease in pro-apoptotic protein caspase-3 activity compared to that of the model mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show for the first time that chotosan can ameliorate Abeta1-2-induced memory dysfunction via inhibiting neuroinflammation and apoptosis at least partially mediated by TLR-4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
