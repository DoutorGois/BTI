Ischemia-induced progenitor cell proliferation is a prominent example of the adult mammalian brain's ability to regenerate injured tissue resulting from pathophysiological processes. In order to better understand and exploit the cell signaling mechanisms that regulate ischemia-induced proliferation, we examined the role of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade effector ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) in this process. Here, using the endothelin-1 ischemia model in wild type mice, we show that the activated form of RSK is expressed in the progenitor cells of the subgranular zone (SGZ) after intrahippocampal cerebral ischemia. Further, RSK inhibition significantly reduces ischemia-induced SGZ progenitor cell proliferation. Using the neurosphere assay, we also show that both SGZ- and subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived adult neural stem cells (NSC) exhibit a significant reduction in proliferation in the presence of RSK and MAPK inhibitors. Taken together, these data reveal RSK as a regulator of ischemia-induced progenitor cell proliferation, and as such, suggest potential therapeutic value may be gained by specifically targeting the regulation of RSK in the progenitor cell population of the SGZ.
