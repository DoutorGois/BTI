The expression of the FMR-1 gene, which is implicated in fragile-X syndrome was investigated in human fetuses by in situ hybridization. In 8 and 9 week-old fetuses, FMR-1 mRNAs are expressed in proliferating and migrating cells of the nervous system, in the retina, and in several non-nervous tissues. In the brain of 25 week-old fetuses, FMR-1 mRNAs are produced in all nearly differenciated structures, with the highest level in cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and in pyramidal neurons of hippocampus. The early transcription of FMR-1 gene and the distribution of FMR-1 mRNAs in human fetuses suggest that alterations of FMR-1 gene expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of fragile-X syndrome and especially the mental retardation.
