1. Effects of lithium, carbamazepine, sodium valproate and baclofen on GABA receptors were examined in several regions of the rat brain. 2. [3H]Muscimol (MUS) and [3H] (-)baclofen (BAC) were used to label GABAA and GABAB receptors, respectively, in synaptic membranes from rat brain. 3. Single treatment with lithium chloride, carbamazepine or sodium valproate did not change [3H]MUS or [3H]BAC binding in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and thalamus. 4. Following chronic treatment with lithium, carbamazepine or sodium valproate, [3H]BAC binding was significantly increased in the hippocampus but not in the frontal cortex, thalamus or striatum. 5. [3H]Muscimol binding did not change in any region examined after chronic treatment with lithium, carbamazepine or sodium valproate. 6. Single and chronic administration of baclofen did not change [3H]MUS or [3H]BAC binding. 7. One common mechanism of action of mood stabilizers may be mediated by GABAB receptors in the hippocampus.
