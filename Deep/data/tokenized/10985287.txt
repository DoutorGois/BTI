A distributed network of brain regions supports memory retrieval in humans, but little is known about the functional interactions between areas within this system. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), subjects retrieved real-world memories: autobiographical events, public events, autobiographical facts, and general knowledge. A common memory retrieval network was found to support all memory types. However, examination of the correlations (i.e., effective connectivity) between the activity of brain regions within the temporal lobe revealed significant changes dependent on the type of memory being retrieved. Medially, effective connectivity between the parahippocampal cortex and hippocampus increased for recollection of autobiographical events relative to other memory types. Laterally, effective connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and temporal pole increased during retrieval of general knowledge and public events. The memory types that dissociate the common system into its subsystems correspond to those that typically distinguish between patients at initial phases of Alzheimer's disease or semantic dementia. This approach, therefore, opens the door to new lines of research into memory degeneration, capitalizing on the functional integration of different memory-involved regions. Indeed, the ability to examine interregional interactions may have important diagnostic and prognostic implications.
