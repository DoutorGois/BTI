Supported phospholipid bilayers constitute a biomimetic platform for cell behavior studies and a new approach to the design of cell culture substrates. Phosphocholine bilayers are resistant to cell attachment, but can be functionalized with bioactive molecules to promote specific cell interactions. Here, we explore phosphocholine bilayers, functionalized with the laminin-derived IKVAV pentamer, as substrates for attachment, growth, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (AHPs). By varying peptide concentration (0-10%), we discovered a strongly nonlinear relationship between cell attachment and IKVAV concentration, with a threshold of 1% IKVAV required for attachment, and saturation in cell binding at 3% IKVAV. This behavior, together with the 10-fold reduction in cell attachment when using a jumbled peptide sequence, gives evidence for a specific interaction between IKVAV and its AHP cell-surface receptor. After 8 days in culture, the peptide-functionalized bilayers promoted a high degree of cell cluster formation. This is in contrast to the predominant monolayer growth, observed for these cells on the standard laminin coated growth substrates. The peptide-functionalized bilayer did not induce differentiation levels over those observed for the laminin coated substrates. These results are promising in that peptide-functionalized bilayers can allow attachment and growth of stem cells without induction of differentiation.
