Following intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of ACTH1-24 significant decreases in 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake were observed in frontal cortex and pyriform cortex, and an increase in thalamus. No such changes were observed following ICV MSH/ACTH4-10. Regional changes in 2DG uptake in olfactory bulb, pyriform cortex, thalamus and cerebellum were significantly correlated with the excessive grooming induced by ACTH1-24. Grooming behavior not induced by ACTH1-24 was not correlated with 2DG changes in any of these regions. Naloxone treatment did not significantly alter the regional pattern of 2DG uptake. In naloxone-pretreated mice ACTH1-24 did not induce significant changes in regional 2DG uptake. Following a series of footshocks, 2DG uptake increased in the hypothalamus, tectum and hippocampus. This pattern of changes is different from that observed following ICV ACTH1-24 and cannot therefore be attributed to ACTH secretion during the stress.
