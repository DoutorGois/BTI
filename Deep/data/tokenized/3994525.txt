As a result of selection of rats possessing a high threshold of neuro-muscular exitability in comparison with rats possessing a low threshold of neuro-muscular exitability, certain changes take place in the structures that are connected with the learning process: the visual cortex is wider, volumes of the pyramidal cells in the fields CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus are increased, density of the glial elements in the fornix is essentially increased and that of neurons in the septal nucleus is decreased.
