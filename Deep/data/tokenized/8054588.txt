Effect of intracerebral allotransplantation of neocortex, hippocampus, septum, cerebellum, substantia nigra embryonic nerve tissue have been studied in white non-inbred, Wistar and Krushinski-Molodkina rats with phenotypically (portal destruction of hippocampus, gyrus serratus, corpus amygdaloideum and cerebral hypoxia) and genotypically conditioned by the low threshold of convulsive cerebral activity (TCCA). In focal cerebral affection transplants with monoergic neurones increase TCCA, while polyergic neurones of embryonic neocortex increase TCCA in diffuse cerebral affection. Phenotypically conditioned low TCCA increases in 4-6 days after transplantation and genotypically one--in 39-44 days because of the more complicated mechanisms of cerebral epileptization.
