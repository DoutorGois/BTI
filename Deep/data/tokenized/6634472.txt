A population of neurons in the hippocampus and subiculum contains cholecystokinin (CCK). Following transection of the dorsal fornix, a major afferent pathway of the hippocampus and associated structures. CCK levels were reduced in the septum and hypothalamus. A microdissection analysis indicated that the loss of CCK occurred in nuclei receiving direct projections from the hippocampus and subiculum, suggesting that CCK-containing neurons in the hippocampus and subiculum project to extrahippocampal regions.
