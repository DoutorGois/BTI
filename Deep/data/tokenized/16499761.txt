PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the epileptogenicity of supratentorial medullary venous malformation (MVM). Special consideration was given to any associations with intracerebral hemorrhage with or without other vascular malformations, including cavernous angioma (CA). METHODS: In total, 10 patients with angiographically or histologically verified MVMs were examined. The patients were divided into two groups with or without intracerebral hemorrhage, and their clinical, neuroradiologic, and interictal and ictal EEG findings were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Although three of five patients in the nonhemorrhagic group had epilepsy, no topographic concordance was found between the MVM location and the EEG focus. On the contrary, in four of five patients in the hemorrhagic group, epilepsy developed, and topographic concordance between the hemorrhagic MVM location and the EEG focus was noted. One patient with a hemorrhagic MVM and an associated CA in the hippocampus had electroclinical pictures of intractable medial temporal lobe epilepsy on this side. CONCLUSIONS: Although a supratentorial MVM itself is not epileptogenic, the development of an intracerebral hemorrhage may cause epilepsy. In particular, an associated CA may be highly epileptogenic.
