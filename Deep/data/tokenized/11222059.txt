Feeding rats high-fat diets for 3 months produces a widespread cognitive deficit that affects performance on a wide range of learning and memory tasks. The present study tested the hypothesis that this effect is related to a fat-induced impairment in glucose metabolism. Following 3 months of dietary intervention (20% by weight fat diets, composed primarily of either beef tallow or soybean oil versus standard laboratory chow), male Long-Evans rats were tested on a variable interval delayed alternation (VIDA) task that measures learning and memory functions that differentially involve specific brain regions. Relative to rats fed chow, rats consuming the high-fat diets were impaired on all aspects of VIDA performance. Following baseline testing, rats were maintained on their respective diets and the effect of glucose administration (100 mg/kg BW; i.p.) was examined. For the next 6 days, animals alternately received injections of saline or glucose 30 min prior to VIDA testing. Glucose treatment improved performance, with the effect being most pronounced at the longer intertrial intervals where task performance is sensitive to hippocampal impairment. Importantly, the beneficial effect of glucose were confined to those animals consuming the high-fat diets and were not observed in rats fed chow. These results demonstrate that glucose administration can overcome those deficits associated with hippocampal function in rats fed high-fat diets and are consistent with the hypothesis that high-fat diets, in part, mediate their effect through the development of insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.
