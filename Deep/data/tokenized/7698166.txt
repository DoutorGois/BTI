Reactivity of the hippocampal system to stimulation of its main afferent, the perforant path, was studied in the intact, anesthetized rat. Parentral administration of fenfluramine caused a marked elevation of population spike response to perforant path stimulation. An injection of atropine before, but not after fenfluramine, blocked the potentiating effect of fenfluramine. The atropine blockade was dose-dependent and not mimicked by the peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonist methyl atropine. This effect of fenfluramine was also prevented by an injection of the 5-HT receptor antagonist spiperone. The effect of fenfluramine was mimicked by the anticholinesterase physostigmine, which was not affected by spiperone pretreatment. It is proposed that release of 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) by fenfluramine potentiates reactivity to afferent stimulation by interacting with cholinergic terminals in the hippocampus.
