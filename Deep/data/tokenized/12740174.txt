AIM: To investigate the effects of phenytoin (DPH) on morphological and structural changes of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA3 of rats induced by chronic stress. METHODS: Using Nissl staining, Golgi staining, and electron microscope, the morphology and structure of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA3 of rats were observed. RESULTS: Chronic stress resulted in loss of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neuron from 39+/-4 to 35+/-4, shortening of total length of apical dendrite (from 196 microm+/-35 microm to 156 microm+/-33 microm, P<0.05), and ultrastructural degenerations of neurons. DPH markedly inhibited the decreases in number of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neuron (38.4+/-2.2) and total length of apical dendrite (198 microm+/-36 microm, P<0.05), meanwhile, improved neuron ultrastructural degenerations caused by chronic stress. CONCLUSION: Chronic stress does damage to hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons and DPH protects hippocampus from damage induced by chronic stress.
