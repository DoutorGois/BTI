Behavioral and histopathological characteristics were studied in mice treated repeatedly with hypertonic saline. In passive avoidance response using a step-through-type shuttle box, the mice treated with hypertonic saline showed shorter latency than control mice. No changes were observed in active avoidance response using a two-way-type shuttle box, spontaneous motor activity or motor function. Histopathological examination revealed marked and frequent degeneration and loss of neurons in the hippocampus as compared with animals after single treatment. The animals with severe hippocampal lesions showed impairment of passive avoidance response. The present brain lesions resulting from repeated treatment with hypertonic saline in mice are considered to be a possible model for memory disorders caused by hippocampal lesions in humans.
