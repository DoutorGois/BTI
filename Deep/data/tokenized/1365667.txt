Muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide (PI) turnover in rat brain slices was assessed after chronic administration of nicotine (12 mg/kg/day) or haloperidol decanoate (1.5 mg/kg/day), either alone or in combination, for 6 weeks. Nicotine alone did not significantly alter carbachol-induced inositol monophosphate (IP1) accumulation in the frontal cortex, but did result in a significant increase in the hippocampus, and in a decrease in the striatum. Haloperidol alone attenuated carbachol-stimulated IP1 accumulation in all three brain regions. Chronic treatment with combined nicotine and haloperidol resulted in no significant change in carbachol-sensitive IP1 accumulation in either the frontal cortex or hippocampus but did result in a decrease in the striatum. The results suggest significant cross-talk between cholinergic and dopaminergic systems in affecting PI metabolism.
