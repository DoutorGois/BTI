We have studied the effects of prenatal protein malnutrition on development of the hippocampal and frontal cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Using power spectral analyses in rats of several age groups we found that protein malnutrition, instituted prenatally and continued postnatally, produces marked alterations in power spectral measures, i.e., alterations in peak theta frequency in the hippocampus during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Peak theta frequency was found to be significantly retarded in malnourished animals, especially during the preweaning period of development. Protein malnutrition, therefore, appears to affect mechanisms responsible for generating the tonic component of theta activity.
