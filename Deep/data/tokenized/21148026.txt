The role of the amygdala in the mediation of fear and anxiety has been extensively investigated. However, how the amygdala functions during the organization of the anxiety-like behaviors generated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) is still under investigation. The basolateral (BLA) and the central (CeA) nuclei are the main input and output stations of the amygdala. In the present study, we ethopharmacologically analyzed the behavior of rats subjected to the EPM and the tissue content of the monoamines dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and dorsal striatum (DS) of animals injected with saline or midazolam (20 and 30 nmol/0.2 microL) into the BLA or CeA. Injections of midazolam into the CeA, but not BLA, caused clear anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM. These treatments did not cause significant changes in 5-HT or DA contents in the NAc, DH, or DS of animals tested in the EPM. The data suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam in the EPM also appear to rely on GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms in the CeA, but not BLA, and do not appear to depend on 5-HT and DA mechanisms prevalent in limbic structures.
