The neuroprotective effect of six aqueous extracts and one alcoholic extract prepared from seven medicinal plants that have been recorded as having therapeutic effects for stroke in Korean traditional medicine were studied using both in vitro and in vivo cerebral ischemia models. Among the extracts tested, the aqueous extracts of Acorus gramineus, Chrysanthemum indicum, and Pinus densiflora and the alcoholic extract of Vitis vinifera significantly increased the cell viability of SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (P < .05). Following two-vessel occlusion in gerbils, extracts of P. densiflora and V. vinifera significantly increased the number of surviving cells/mm(2) of the CA1 region by 2.1-2.2-fold (P < .01). Oral or intraperitoneal administration of S-allyl cysteine, as a positive control, also markedly increased cell survival up to about 3.3-fold at the dosage of 300 mg/kg of body weight (P < .01). These results indicate that P. densiflora and V. vinifera exert neuroprotective effects against ischemic insults in both the in vitro and in vivo cerebral ischemia models and prompted us to further characterize the detailed mechanism of action and elucidate the active principles.
