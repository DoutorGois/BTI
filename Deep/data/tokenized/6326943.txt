The viability and stability of the in vitro rat hippocampal slice preparation were assessed using electrophysiological and electron microscopical means. Slices exhibited lifetimes of 6-19 h. Correlation between the duration of electrical activity and changes in ultrastructure of these slices was found. Possible reasons for the wide variability in lifetime of the hippocampal slice are suggested.
