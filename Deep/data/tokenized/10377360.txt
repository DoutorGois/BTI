Recent studies in rodents have implicated the hippocampal formation in "path integration": the ability to use self-motion cues (ideothesis) to guide spatial behavior. Such models of hippocampal function assume that self-motion information arises from the vestibular system. In the present study we used the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B, the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine, and standard extracellular recording techniques to investigate whether the hippocampal formation [which consists of the hippocampus proper and the area parahippocampalis (Hp/APH) in pigeons] receives information from the accessory optic system (AOS). The AOS is a visual pathway dedicated to the analysis of the "optic flow fields" that result from self-motion. Optic flow constitutes a rich source of ideothetic information that could be used for navigation. Both the nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) and nucleus lentiformis mesencephali of the AOS were shown to project to the area ventralis of Tsai (AVT), which in turn was shown to project to the Hp/APH. A smaller direct projection from the nBOR pars dorsalis to the hippocampus was also revealed. During extracellular recording experiments, about half of the cells within the AVT responded to optic flow stimuli. Together these results illustrate that the Hp/APH receives information about self-motion from the AOS. We postulate that this optic flow information is used for path integration. A review of the current literature suggests that an analogous neuronal circuit exists in mammals, but it has simply been overlooked.
