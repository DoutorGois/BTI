Socially housed mice with cytotoxic lesions of the hippocampus do not exhibit social recognition memory 30 min following exposure to a juvenile mouse, however the social recognition memory of singly housed rats is unimpaired. The present study tests the hypothesis that social housing of rats could render social recognition memory hippocampally dependent as seen for mice. Rats were housed with juveniles or with adults. Two social recognition one-animal tests paralleling those used with mice were carried out. Seven social discrimination two-animal tests were also given. Sham operated and hippocampally lesioned rats had normal social memory at 30 min whether socially housed for 24, 48 h, 7 or 8 days prior to testing. These findings support other results indicating the hippocampus proper is not required for normal social memory in rats. In a final experiment, rats socially housed in groups of three since weaning, were tested for 30 min and 24 h social memory. Unlike mice, rats socially housed throughout life exhibited social memory only at 30 min, but not at 24 h. Manipulations that extend social memory in rats may be required to render social memory hippocampally dependent or rats and mice may differ in the neural mediation of social memory.
