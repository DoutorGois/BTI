N-Acetylsuccinimidylglutamate [(asu)NAAG], a cyclic form of the peptide N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) in which the aspartyl residue is linked to glutamate via the alpha- and beta-carboxylates, was identified and quantified by HPLC in the murine and bovine CNS. In the rat, the highest concentrations of (asu)NAAG were detected in the spinal cord (1.83 +/- 0.15 pmol/mg of wet tissue weight) and brainstem (1.16 +/- 0.08 pmol/mg wet weight), whereas the levels were below the limit of detection in cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. (Asu)NAAG was also detected in significant amount in the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus (1.17 +/- 0.05 and 0.82 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg we weight, respectively). Although the tissue content of (asu)NAAG was about three orders of magnitude lower than that of NAAG, levels of both peptides were positively correlated among different CNS regions (r=0.74, p<0.003). In the rat spinal cord, (asu)NAAG levels progressively increased from week 2 to month 12 after birth. In bovine spinal cord, the contents of (asu)NAAG and NAAG were comparable in gray and white matter as well as in the dorsal and ventral horns. These results suggest that NAAG and (asu)-NAAG are closely related metabolically and raise the question of the physiological significance of such a cyclic peptide.
