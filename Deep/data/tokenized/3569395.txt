Neurotensin immunoreactivity (NT-IR) is significantly reduced in striatum, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus but not in frontal cortex, hypothalamus and septum of 24-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Neurotensin binding in cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus shows a rather uniform decline with age. The changes in NT-IR content in striatum and nucleus accumbens are of particular interest in view of the existence of a functional relationship between dopamine and neurotensin.
