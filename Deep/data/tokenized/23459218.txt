BACKGROUND: Sevoflurane preconditioning improves recovery after hypoxia. Sevoflurane administered before and during hypoxia improved recovery and attenuated the changes in intracellular sodium, potassium, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during hypoxia. In this study, the authors examine the effects of sevoflurane applied only before hypoxia on sodium, potassium, and ATP. METHODS: Hippocampal slices from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with 4% sevoflurane, washed, and then subjected to hypoxia (n>/=8 animals/group). The cornus ammonis 1 regions of the hippocampal slices were micro-dissected and sodium, potassium, and ATP concentrations measured. RESULTS: Pretreatment with sevoflurane for 15 or 60 min did not attenuate the increase in intracellular sodium or the decrease in intracellular potassium during hypoxia. After 60 min of preconditioning and 5 min of hypoxia, sodium increased 57% (vs. nonpreconditioned hypoxia 54% increase) and potassium decreased 31% (vs. 26%). These changes were not statistically significant versus untreated hypoxia. The 60-min sevoflurane preconditioning group had statistically significant higher ATP levels at 5 min of hypoxia (3.8 nmol/mg dry wt.) when compared to untreated hypoxic tissue (2.1 nmol/mg). There was no significant difference in ATP levels between the sevoflurane preconditioned and the untreated tissue before hypoxia (8.9 vs. 8.5 nmoles/mg, respectively). CONCLUSION: Preconditioning with sevoflurane for 60 min before hypoxia does not alter changes in intracellular sodium and potassium during hypoxia but does attenuate the fall in intracellular ATP levels during hypoxia. Thus, there are differences between anesthetic preconditioning and when anesthetics are present before and during hypoxia.
