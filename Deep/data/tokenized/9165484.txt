Comparison of astroglial immunoreactivity in mesencephalon, cerebellum, and hippocampus of 25-d-old rat pups exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) through the mother's milk was made using a quantitative immunohistochemical analysis. A glial reaction was detected at the level of serotonergic nuclei and extreme astrogliosis in the hippocampus and cerebellum. A quantitative analysis of reactive astrocytes was performed by using GFAP and S-100 protein as specific markers. The study showed a significant increase in their number, size, number of processes, and density of immunostaining in 2,4-D-exposed animals. Exposure to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid on the first days of life modifies the astroglial cytoarchitecture in parallel to previously described neuronal changes.
