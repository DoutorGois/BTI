The distribution of putative receptors for the peptide galanin was studied in the normal post-mortem human brain by using 125I-galanin (0.5 nM) in combination with in vitro receptor autoradiography. Specific binding of 125I-galanin was found in a large number of brain areas throughout the neuraxis. Highest binding densities occurred in the basal forebrain and hypothalamus, while the basal ganglia, major parts of the thalamus and the tectum were found to be poor in binding sites. All cortical areas harboured 125I-galanin binding, and in the visual cortex a laminated pattern was present. In the hippocampus, 125I-galanin binding occurred in layer 2 of the entorhinal cortex, in the uncus and in the hippocampal-amygdala area. In the brain-stem, 125I-galanin binding was found in serotoninergic noradrenergic cell groups as well as in the reticular formation and in the parabrachial nuclei. Galanin receptors may, thus, mediate the response of galanin in numerous structures in the human brain.
