Three-week administration of sertraline or imipramine to rats (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, twice a day) increased ex vivo cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity in the soluble but not in the particulate fraction of the frontal cortex. However, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity was not affected in either fraction of the parietotemporal cortex and hippocampus. Neither antidepressant altered protein kinase C activity in the soluble and particulate fractions or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity in the frontal cortex. Therefore, sertraline and imipramine both selectively enhance cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity in the frontal cortex. This enhancement might be involved in their biochemical mechanisms.
