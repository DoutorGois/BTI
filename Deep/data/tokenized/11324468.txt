AIM: To study the effects of fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) on delayed cerebral injury in mice from subacute carbon monoxide (CO) exposure. METHODS: Mice were exposed to CO (100 mL/kg i.p.) once a day, continouUsly for 7 d. After 7-d CO-exposure, mortality of mice, changes in learning ability and memory using passive avoidAnce test, the pathomorphologic observation of brain tissue slices, and changes in monoamine oxide (MAO)-B activities in cerebral tissue were studied. FDP was administrated 30 min before CO-exposure every time. RESULTS: The preadministration of FDP markedly decreased the mortality of mice, almost reversed the impairment of learning and memory function, prevented the cells from delayed death in hippocampal neurons and blunted the rise in MAO-B activity after subacute CO poisoning of mice. CONCLUSION: FDP pretreatment markedly prevented mice from delayed encephalopathy after CO poisoning.
