A method for the detection and characterization of GABA(A) receptors of neurons has been developed, which is based on the measurement of the activity of potential-dependent calcium channels using the fluorescence of the two-wavelength calcium-sensitive probe Fura-2. The method makes it possible to detect the ligands of GABA(A) receptors and determine the constants of activation and inhibition as well as the type of inhibition. The object of investigation was a young (two- to four-day-old) rat hippocampal cell culture in which GABA induces the depolarization and a transient increase in Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol of neurons due to the activation of potential-dependent calcium channels. It was shown that a short-time application of GABA induces a decrease in the amplitude of calcium responses to subsequent addition of the depolarizing agents GABA or KCl. However, at low amplitudes of calcium responses to the addition of GABA, this reducing effect on the subsequent addition of KCl was insignificant. It was found that the amplitudes of calcium responses to KCl and GABA are linearly dependent on the angular coefficient b = 3.41. This enabled one to develop a method of normalizing calcium signals, which makes it possible to compare experiments performed on different days and different cultures. By using this normalization technique, the values of EC50 = 2.21 +/- 0.14 ?M and the Hill coefficient = 1.9 +/- 0.2 were estimated. The blocker of potential-dependent calcium channels nifedipine suppressed simultaneously the amplitudes of calcium responses to the addition of KCl and GABA. In this case, the linear relationship between the amplitudes of calcium responses to the addition of KCl and GABA was retained. To verify the validity of the method, the constant of inhibition of a calcium signal and the type of inhibition for known noncompetitive and competitive antagonists of GABA(A) receptors were determined.
