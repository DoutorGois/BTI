We used quantitative fluorescence imaging of vesicles labeled with membrane-soluble dyes to determine rates of undocking and spontaneous exocytosis of vesicles docked to the active zone of hippocampal synapses in culture. Individual vesicles undock about once per two minutes and spontaneously exocytose about once per eight minutes. Thus, not only does undocking occur, but it is over threefold faster than spontaneous fusion.
