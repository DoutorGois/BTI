Elevated beta-amyloid (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent evidence has suggested that the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a key target for Abeta-induced perturbation in AD, and blockade of RAGE significantly alleviates synaptic injury. Our previous study has suggested that beta-asarone could reduce neuronal apoptosis and improve memory deficits in beta-amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic AD-model mice. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of beta-asarone on amyloidosis in APP/PS1 mice. We found that the survival of neurons of APP/PS1 mice was improved by beta-asarone, meanwhile, beta-asarone decreased Abeta deposition and down-regulated Abeta1-42 levels in cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice brain. Interestingly, the level of RAGE was also significantly down-regulated by beta-asarone. Our findings suggest that beta-asarone might be effective for the treatment of AD, and the decreasing effects of beta-asarone on Abeta might associate with its down-regulation of RAGE.
