Extensive experimental data are available on the neural activity and behavioral correlates of specific networks in the locust and in the cat and rabbit. Two networks were selected for comparison, one involving visual movement detector interneurons in the locust and the second a hippocampal network in mammals. Both networks receive inputs correlated with motor activity. Each network was simulated using CSMP, a Continuous Systems Modeling program developed initially by IBM. Signals along the two simulated networks were calculated when similar inputs were applied. In addition, approaches toward relating behavior to neural activity were compared in the two networks.
