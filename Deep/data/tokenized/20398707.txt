Antifreeze proteins (AFP) are associated with protection from freezing. We measured the effect of type I antifreeze protein on spontaneous bursting of mixed neuronal/glial cultures using a multi-electrode array culture system. Antifreeze protein (10mg/ml) reversibly depressed bursting activity without inhibiting mitochondrial oxidative capacity. The effect of antifreeze protein on cold/re-warming injury was investigated in rat hippocampal slice cultures. Compared to bovine serum albumin at a similar concentration, antifreeze protein protected hippocampal neurons from 8h of profound hypothermia at (4 degrees C) followed by re-warming. The protection observed is believed to be associated with the inhibitory effect of antifreeze protein.
