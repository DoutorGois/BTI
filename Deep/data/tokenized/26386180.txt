Presenting stimuli again after presentation of intervening stimuli improves their retention, an effect known as the spacing effect. However, using event-related potentials (ERPs), we had observed that immediate, in comparison to spaced, repetition of pictures induced a positive frontal potential at 200-300 ms. This potential appeared to emanate from the left medial temporal lobe (MTL), a structure critical for memory consolidation. In this study, we tested the behavioral relevance of this signal and explored functional connectivity changes during picture repetition. We obtained high-density electroencephalographic recordings from 14 healthy subjects performing a continuous recognition task where pictures were either repeated immediately or after 9 intervening items. Conventional ERP analysis replicated the positive frontal potential emanating from the left MTL at 250-350 ms in response to immediately repeated stimuli. Connectivity analysis showed that this ERP was associated with increased coherence in the MTL region--left more that right--in the theta-band (3.5-7 Hz) 200-400 ms following immediate, but not spaced, repetition. This increase was stronger in subjects who better recognized immediately repeated stimuli after 30 min. These findings indicate that transient theta-band synchronization between the MTL and the rest of the brain at 200-400 ms reflects a memory stabilizing signal.
