uinea pig antiserum specific to the purified bovine choline acetyltransferase was used to demonstrate the localization of this enzyme in rabbit forebrain by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistochemical method. Choline acetyltransferase was localized in olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, olfactory tubercle, piriform cortex, septum, diagonal band, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, subthalamus, habenula, cerebral cortex, hippocampal region, corpus callosum, internal capsule, fornix, longitudinal striae and other areas. The findings reflect the distribution of cholinergic axons and, possibly, their terminals. These observations correlate well with biochemical determinations of choline acetyltransferase and with previously proposed cholinergic pathways.
