We obtained 2D magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopic images (MRSI) and MRI volumetric measurements (MRIV) of amygdala and hippocampus in 30 consecutive patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) being evaluated for surgical treatment. Both MRSI and MRIV lateralization showed good agreement with the current gold standard of clinical-EEG lateralization. Each exam separately correctly lateralized 25 out of 30 patients with no false lateralization. Combining both exams, lateralization could be achieved in 28 out of 30 patients. The two patients with no significant asymmetry had bitemporal EEG abnormalities, and bilateral damage on both MRIV and MRSI. There was a good correlation between the magnitude of the MRSI and MRIV asymmetry (Pearson coefficient = 0.83; p < .0001). Both MRSI and MRIV were normal in our patients with seizures originating outside the temporal lobes. Both MRIV and MRSI can lateralize TLE in 83% of patients. Combination of the two modalities allows lateralization in 93% of patients. Patients who cannot be lateralized generally have symmetrical bitemporal abnormalities; they are not incorrectly lateralized. The structural and chemical pathologic abnormalities seen in TLE seem to be associated with the seizure focus, and may be as, or even more, reliable than a few recorded seizures in predicting the side from which most seizures originate.
