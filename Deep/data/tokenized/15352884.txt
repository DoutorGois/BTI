Calbindin D-28k (CB), a calcium-binding protein, containing neurons in the hippocampus plays an important role in hippocampal excitability in epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated changes of CB immunoreactivity after adrenalectomy (ADX) in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus of the seizure sensitive gerbil, which is susceptible to seizure to identify roles of CB in epileptogenesis. The changes of the CB immunoreactivity after ADX were significant in the hippocampal CA1 region. By 24 h after ADX, CB-immunoreactive CA1 pyramidal cells and CB immunoreactivity increased. At this time, well-stained dendrites projected to the stratum radiatum. Thereafter, the CB immunoreactivity decreased time dependently by 96 h after ADX. In the dentate gyrus, the changes of CB-immunoreactive neurons were mainly observed in the granule cell layer. The number and immunoreactivity of CB-immunoreactive neurons was high at 24 h after ADX, thereafter, those decreased by 96 h after ADX. These results suggest that glucocorticoid has an important role in modulating the seizure activity and CB serves an inhibitory function, which regulates the seizure activity and output signals from the hippocampus.
