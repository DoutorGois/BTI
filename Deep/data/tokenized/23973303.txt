The Schaffer collaterals are among the major glutamatergic inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons, the primary output of the hippocampus, which also receive sparse recurrent inputs from pyramidal neurons in the CA1 field. Although tonically active alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been shown to sustain spontaneous glutamate transmission to CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices under resting conditions, it remains to be determined whether these receptors are those expressed by CA3 or CA1 pyramidal neurons. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the CA3 field of the hippocampus is a significant source of alpha7 nAChR-sustained glutamatergic transmission to CA1 pyramidal neurons. To this end, spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded from CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons in intact rat hippocampal slices as well as from CA1 pyramidal neurons in CA3-ablated slices under various experimental conditions. Surgical removal of the CA3 region from the slices reduced by 20% the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons. This finding is in agreement with the concept that the CA3 field contributes significantly to the maintenance of spontaneous glutamatergic synaptic activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons. In addition, the alpha7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA, 10nM) reduced the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons by 30% in intact slices and 12% in CA3-ablated slices. Taken together, these results demonstrate that tonically active alpha7 nAChRs in CA3 pyramidal neurons and/or in the Mossy fibers that innervate the CA3 pyramidal neurons do in fact contribute to the maintenance of glutamatergic synaptic activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices under resting conditions.
