During embryonic development of brain laminated structures, the protein Reelin, secreted into the extracellular matrix of the cortex and hippocampus by Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells located in the marginal zone, contributes to the regulation of migration and positioning of cortical and hippocampal neurons that do not synthesize Reelin. Soon after birth, the CR cells decrease, and they virtually disappear during the following 3 weeks. Despite their disappearance, we can quantify Reelin mRNA (approximately 200 amol/ g of total RNA) and visualize it by in situ hybridization, and we detect the translated product of this mRNA by immunocytochemistry preferentially in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons of adult rat cortex and hippocampus. In adult rat cerebellum, Reelin is expressed in glutamatergic neurons (granule cells). The translated product of this mRNA is readily exported from the granule cell somata to the parallel fibers, where it has been detected by electron microscopy in axon terminals located presynaptically to Purkinje cell dendrites.
