Recent studies have suggested that the neuronal damage during human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis (HIVE) might be mediated by increased intracellular calcium. Since in vitro studies have shown that calcium-binding proteins protect neurons from calcium-mediated toxicity, we hypothesized that calbindin-expressing neurons might be resistant to HIV1-mediated damage. We compared patterns of calbindin immunoreactivity in the cortex and subcortex of autopsied AIDS cases with and without HIVE. Calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in the neocortex were significantly reduced in HIVE (one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001), while these neurons in the basal ganglia and hippocampus were unaffected. The loss of calbindin-immunolabeled neurons in the neocortex was correlated with viral burden (r = -0.45, p < 0.001). Differential loss of calbindin-immunoreactive neurons in HIVE suggests that neuronal damage in different regions of the CNS may be mediated by different pathogenic mechanisms.
