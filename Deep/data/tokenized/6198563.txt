A method for silver impregnation of cell bodies is detailed. It is based on Gallyas' physical development procedure, and adds a silver stain for cell bodies to the list of histological elements stainable with high contrast by means of physical development. Its black pigment on a clear background aids visibility, localization of cytoarchitectonic boundaries, and photographic reproduction. It also stains regions of tissue damage, such as tracks from micropipettes or electrodes. A manipulation for enhancement of dendritic staining is also described.
