This report concerns the distribution of the hippocampal cholinergic neurostimulating peptide (HCNP) in tissues and organs of 11-day-old Wistar rats. HCNP, originally isolated and purified from the hippocampus of young rats, is an undecapeptide (acetyl-Ala-Ala-Asp-Ile-Ser-Gln-Trp-Ala-Gly-Pro-Leu). HCNP distribution was investigated by using immunohistochemical techniques, employing an affinity-purified rabbit antibody that specifically recognizes HCNP and its 21-kDa precursor protein. Positively stained cells were detected in a variety of tissues and organs, including salivary gland, small intestine, colon, pancreas, bronchiole, adrenal gland, testis, as well as several others. The nerve fibres around blood vessels of almost all organs expressed HCNP. Our results suggest that HCNP or its precursor, or both, may have a specific function not only in the central nervous system, but also in the peripheral nervous system, and possibly in certain specialized duct and gland cells as well.
