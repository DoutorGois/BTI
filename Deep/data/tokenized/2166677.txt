The effect of recombinant human interleukin 1-beta (IL-1 beta) on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the mossy fiber-CA3 pathway of mouse hippocampal slice preparations was investigated. IL-1 beta significantly inhibited LTP in concentrations as low as 2.9 pM (50 pg/ml). This effect of IL-1 beta was blocked by concurrent application of 100 nM Lys-D-Pro-Thr, a tripeptide analogue of IL-1 beta. This is the first evidence that IL-1 beta can regulate LTP of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.
