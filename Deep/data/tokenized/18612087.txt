The discovery of newborn neurons in the adult brain has generated enormous interest over the past decade. Although this process is well documented in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, the possibility of neuron formation in other brain regions is under vigorous debate. Neurogenesis within the adult hippocampus is suppressed by factors that predispose to major depression and stimulated by antidepressant interventions. This pattern has generated the hypothesis that impaired neurogenesis is pathoetiological in depression and stimulation of newborn neurons essential for effective antidepressant action. This review critically evaluates the evidence in support of and in conflict with this theory. The literature is divided into three areas: neuronal maturation, factors that influence neurogenesis rates, and function of newborn neurons. Unique elements in each of these areas allow for the refinement of the hypothesis. Newborn hippocampal neurons appear to be necessary for detecting subtle environmental changes and coupling emotions to external context. Thus speculatively, stress-induced suppression of neurogenesis would uncouple emotions from external context leading to a negative mood state. Persistence of negative mood beyond the duration of the initial stressor can be defined as major depression. Antidepressant-induced neurogenesis therefore would restore coupling of mood with environment, leading to the resolution of depression. This conceptual framework is provisional and merits evaluation in further experimentation. Critically, manipulation of newborn hippocampal neurons may offer a portal of entry for more effective antidepressant treatment strategies.
