RATIONALE: Recent studies have demonstrated that mTORC1 activation may be related to antidepressant action. However, the relationship between mTORC1 signaling activation and currently prescribed antidepressants remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to determine whether alterations in mTORC1 signaling are observable following treatment with tianeptine under toxic conditions induced by B27 deprivation. Additionally, we investigated whether this drug affects synaptic proteins, neurite outgrowth, and spine density via mTORC1 signaling. METHODS: Using Western blotting, we measured the phosphorylation levels of mTORC1, 4E-BP-1, p70S6K, Akt, and ERK in rat primary hippocampal neurons. Changes in BDNF, dendritic outgrowth, spine density, and synaptic proteins (PSD-95, synaptophysin, and GluR1) were measured. RESULTS: Tianeptine significantly increased the phosphorylation of mTORC1, 4E-BP-1, p70S6K, Akt, and ERK. The increase in mTOR phosphorylation was blocked by the PI3K, MEK, and mTORC1 inhibitors. Tianeptine increased BDNF, dendritic outgrowth, spine density, and synaptic proteins; all of these effects were blocked by the mTORC1 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrated that tianeptine activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway and increases dendritic outgrowth, spine density, and synaptic proteins through mTORC1 signaling under toxic conditions in rat primary hippocampal neurons.
