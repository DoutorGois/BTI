RNA expression of lamprey gonadotropin-releasing hormone (lGnRH)-I, -II, and -III was demonstrated in the brains of larval, parasitic phase and adult sea lampreys, Petromyzon marinus, using a highly sensitive triple-label in situ hybridization technique. In female larval lampreys, lGnRH-I and-II were co-expressed in the same neurons throughout the olfactory bulbs, preoptic area (POA), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain); lGnRH-I, -II and -III were triple co-expressed in the hypothalamus and in the paranuclear region of neuronal somas in the rhombencephalon. In female parasitic phase lampreys, lGnRH-I and -II were co-expressed in the POA, thalamus, and preoptico-neurohypophyseal tract (PNT); lGnRH-III was minimally triple co-expressed with lGnRH-I and -II in the hypothalamus. In adult female lampreys, lGnRH-I and -III were co-expressed in the hypothalamus; lGnRH-I was also expressed in the neurohypophysis (NH). In adult male lampreys, lGnRH-I and-III were co-expressed in the primordial hippocampus, POA, thalamus, hypothalamus, NH, and PNT; lGnRH-I was also expressed in the epithalamus. In summary, we provide the first study using in situ hybridization of all three lGnRHs (lGnRH-I, -II, and -III) at three major life stages (larval, parasitic, and adult) of lampreys, which strongly supports previous immunohistological studies and suggests that lGnRH-I and -II are the predominant lGnRHs in larval and parasitic phase lampreys, and that lGnRH-I and -III are the predominant lGnRHs in adult female and male lampreys. Therefore, our results show that lGnRH-I, -II, and -III have different localization and co-expression in the development and sexual maturation of lampreys, which may suggest unique physiological roles at each life stage and sex in the developing and mature lamprey brain.
