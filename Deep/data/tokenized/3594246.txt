A major concern in epilepsy research is the relationship between ictal (seizure) electrophysiological activity and interictal (between seizure) activity. Much research is carried out in vitro using brain slice models. Although they allow detailed electrophysiology, the events recorded are generally more similar to interictal than ictal activity. We have described an in vitro model of epileptiform activity in the hippocampal slice (exposure to artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing no added magnesium) in which the events closely resemble those seen in vivo during seizures. However, this model is limited by the brief period during which this ictaform activity occurs before it is replaced by interictal-like activity. We now report that as the frequency of the interictal activity is suppressed by the GABAB agonist baclofen, the ictal activity returns. Moreover, when frequent interictal activity is reinduced, the ictal activity again is suppressed. These results suggest that interictal activity may decrease the probability of a seizure. Furthermore, they suggest that substances which may be shown to inhibit interictal activity in various models of epilepsy may not necessarily inhibit ictal activity.
