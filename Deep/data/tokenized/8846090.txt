High levels of neurotensin/neuromedin N precursor mRNA, but few if any NT-positive perikarya have been detected in the dorsal subiculum of the adult rat or human hippocampus. This apparent discrepancy was tentatively ascribed to a lack of precursor mRNA translation or to a poor precursor posttranslational processing in neurons of the hippocampus. Another hypothesis is that in long neuronal pathways, maturation of neuropeptide precursors and derived peptides occurs during axonal transport to terminals, a process which accounts for the lack of peptide detection in cell bodies. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed surgical transection of the fornix to interrupt axonal transport of putative NT/NN products arising from the dorsal hippocampus and measured NT and NN levels in different brain regions. In the mamillary bodies, the main projection area of the dorsal subiculum, NN and NT levels were highly reduced 4 or 14 days after the septo-hippocampal transection which was correlated with a slight increase in NN and NT levels in the dorsal hippocampus and the retrosplenial cortex of 4 days lesioned animals. An increase in hypothalamic NN levels was also detected 14 days after the lesion. These data suggest that the peptide precursor processing can take place during the axonal transport, as shown here for neurotensin and neuromedin N from subicular neurons to their efferent brain areas such as the mamillary bodies.
