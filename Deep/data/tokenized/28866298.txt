BACKGROUND: Graph theoretical analyses have identified disrupted functional topological organization across the brain in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the relationship between brain topology and short-term treatment responses in patients with MDD remains unknown. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with MDD and 63 cognitively normal (CN) subjects were recruited at baseline and underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Graph theory analysis was used to examine group differences in the whole-brain functional topological properties. The association between altered brain topology and the early antidepressant response was examined. RESULTS: Patients with MDD showed lower normalized clustering coefficients, lower small-worldness scalars and increased nodal efficiencies in the default mode network and decreased nodal efficiencies in basal ganglia and hippocampal networks. In addition, the decreased nodal efficiency in left hippocampus was negatively correlated with depressive severity at baseline and positively correlated with changes in the depressive scores after two weeks of antidepressant treatment. LIMITATIONS: The patients in the present study received different medications. CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that the altered brain functional topological organization in patients with MDD is associated with the treatment response in the early phase of medication. Therefore, brain topology assessments might be considered a useful and convenient predictor of short-term antidepressant responses.
