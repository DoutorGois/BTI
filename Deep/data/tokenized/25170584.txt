BACKGROUND: The significance of TDP-43 pathology in relation to aging and dementia in the population is unclear. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the prevalence of transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA (TDP-43) neuronal inclusions in a population-based sample, and associations with age group at death (</=90 and >90 years) and clinical dementia status prior to death. Further, we investigate associations between TDP-43 inclusions and other key dementia-related neuropathologies (plaques, tangles, and neuronal loss) within the hippocampus and entorhinal and temporal cortices. METHODS: All brain donors within the Cambridge City over-75 s Cohort (CC75C), which is population-based and longitudinally tracked (n = 228), were included. Age at death ranged from 78 to 106 years. TDP-43 neuronal inclusions were assessed in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and temporal cortex. These data were combined with existing clinical and neuropathological data. RESULTS: TDP-43 neuronal inclusions were present in 27% of the sample, 36% of those with clinical dementia and 18% without dementia. Individuals who died later (>90 years) or with clinical dementia were more likely to show TDP-43 inclusions. Hippocampal and entorhinal TDP-43 inclusions were significantly associated with dementia severity and increasing age, taking into account other neuropathologies. TDP-43 neuronal inclusions appeared to be co-localize with severe neuronal loss. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that hippocampal and entorhinal TDP-43 inclusions are important substrates of late onset dementia which appear to co-localize with severe neuronal loss, but not with Alzheimer's disease markers of amyloid and tau. This broadens the accepted view of TDP-43 pathology in dementias.
