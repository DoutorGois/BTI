OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of microglial activation of hippocampus in experimental epileptic rats. METHODS: Morphological changes and proliferation of OX-42 positive cells were compared at different time points after status of epilepticus (SE) in lithium-pilocarpine induced epileptic rats. RESULTS: OX-42 positive cells were activated after SE, which increased to a peak at 3-7 d and in a relatively stable state at 7-14 d; then gradually decreased after 14d and returned to slightly higher level than previously at 21 d. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory injury, microglial activation and cell proliferation are closely related after seizures, microglial activation may be an important mechanism in the inflammatory injury of epilepsy.
