Long-term depression of synaptic transmission was induced following the prior induction of long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. We show that the induction of this form of synaptic depression can be prevented by (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, a selective antagonist of metabotropic glutamate receptors.
