OBJECTIVE: To observe inhibitive effects of Panax notoginseng saponins on expression of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42) protein in SAMP8's brain. METHODS: Amount of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42 immuno-positive neurons was detected in parietal cortex and hippocamp in their brains under high power lens (40 x) by immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: PNS could reduce the amount of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42) protein in parietal cortex and hippocamp. CONCLUSION: PNS can reduce the amount of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42) protein in SAMP8's brain.
