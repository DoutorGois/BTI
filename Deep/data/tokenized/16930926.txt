Voltage-dependent calcium channels play an important role in controlling many neuronal processes such as neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Any slight alteration in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) can have a considerable impact on various neuronal functions. The effects of caffeine on [Ca2+]i were studied in CA1 hippocampal neurons of young (2 months) and old (24 months) C57BL mice. Fura 2-AM fluorescence photometry was used to measure [Ca2+]i in the presence and absence of caffeine (100 microM) in response to KCl (26 mM) application. Caffeine enhanced the peak [Ca2+]i as compared to control solution in young mice (control: 325+/-8 nM, caffeine: 402+/-10 nM), but had no effect on the peak [Ca2+]i in old mice (control: 222+/-6 nM, caffeine: 223+/-7 nM). These results indicate that caffeine can impact neuronal functions through the modification of [Ca2+]i. The lack of caffeine-induced modulation of [Ca2+]i in old mice suggests that this role of caffeine has been compromised with aging.
