Intracellular recordings were obtained in the vitro slice preparation from neurons of lateral and mesial temporal cortex removed from human epileptics suffering from intractable temporal lobe seizures. Spontaneous rhythmic synaptic events, which were capable of triggering action potential discharge, were observed in many neurons, particularly in mesial tissue slices. Such activity may reflect the epileptogenic capacity of this human cortex.
