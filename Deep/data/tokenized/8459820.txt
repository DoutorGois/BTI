Focal epilepsies of childhood with complex partial seizures, with or without secondarily generalized seizures are reviewed. Particular emphasis is placed on the semiology of seizures, which are subdivided into: aura, disturbance of consciousness, speech disturbances, automatims, and other motor and vegetative seizure symptoms. The significance of routine ictal and interictal EGGs and their importance for the localization is discussed. Recent neuropathological findings and etiology are presented and the courses epilepsies can take (especially those involving febrile convulsions), prognosis and long-term therapy with standard antieleptic drugs. A definition of pharmacoresistance is given, a prerequisite for surgical therapy, which in turn necissitates special presurgical diagnostic procedures [corrected].
