A differential display was performed to analyze differential gene expression in the brain of mice in association with dietary high beef tallow. Consumption of a high beef tallow diet up-regulated the expression of zinc finger protein ZPR1 mRNA in the brain. Expression of ZPR1 mRNA in the cerebellum and hippocampus was elevated in response to the high beef tallow diet. The increased ZPR1 expression in the neuronal, Neuro-2A cells, caused a significant increase in H(2)O(2)-induced cell death. These results suggest that a high beef tallow diet up-regulates ZPR1 mRNA expression in the brain and might increase the vulnerability to oxidative stress.
