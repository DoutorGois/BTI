Congenital hypothyroidism strongly affects myelination. To assess the role of thyroid hormone on myelin gene expression, we have studied the effect of hypothyroidism on the steady state levels of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) and its mRNA in rat brain during the first postnatal month. As studied by immunoblot analysis of several brain regions, MAG increased from days 10-15 onwards, reaching constant levels by days 20-25. Hypothyroid samples showed a delay in the accumulation of MAG that was more severe in rostral regions, such as cortex and hippocampus. The effect of hypothyroidism on the accumulation of the protein correlated with mRNA levels. MAG mRNA started to accumulate in the cerebrum of normal animals by postnatal day 7, reaching maximal levels by day 20. Hypothyroid rats showed a delay of several days in the onset of mRNA expression, increasing thereafter at the same rate as in normal animals, and eventually reaching similar values. When individual brain regions were analyzed, we found strong regional differences in the effect of hypothyroidism. The cerebral cortex was most affected, with messenger levels lower than in normal animals at all ages. In more caudal regions differences between control and hypothyroid rats were evident only at the earlier stages of myelination, with spontaneous recovery at later ages. By run on analysis, we found no differences in transcriptional activities of the MAG gene in normal, hypothyroid, or T4-treated rats. Therefore, the effects of hypothyroidism on MAG mRNA and protein levels were most likely caused by decreased mRNA stability. We propose that thyroid hormone contributes to enhanced myelin gene expression by affecting the stability of newly transcribed mRNA in the early phases of myelination.
