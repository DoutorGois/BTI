OBJECTIVES: We examined the relationship between severity of depression in Parkinson's disease (PD) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and the reaction to levodopa-selegiline combination therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 52 patients with PD and nine age-matched controls with SPECT and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to evaluate depression severity and its connection with rCBF. Furthermore, we examined rCBF in patients with PD treated with levodopa with or without selegiline. RESULTS: A significant fall in rCBF was observed in the bilateral posterior cingulate, hippocampus, and cuneus and the superior parietal and primary visual areas in PD patients with minor depression and in all regions in those with major depression. Elevations in UPDRS part III and BDI scores and falls in MMSE scores were of significantly lower magnitude in the levodopa-selegiline group than in the levodopa group. Whole brain rCBF fell significantly less in the levodopa-selegiline group than in the levodopa group. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that selegiline controlled not only worsening of motor function and cognitive function in PD but also aggravation of minor depression, and restrained a fall in whole brain rCBF.
