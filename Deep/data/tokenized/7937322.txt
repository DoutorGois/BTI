The acute and long-term effects of a single injection of psychoactive drugs, methamphetamine or phencyclidine, were investigated by Northern blot to assess alterations in the cholecystokinin (CCK) mRNA in three areas of the rat brain. In the frontal cortex, there were no significant changes in CCK mRNA after the drug injection. In contrast, decreases in CCK mRNA were observed in the posterior cortex and the hippocampus from 30 min to 48 h after the drug treatment. The data suggest that CCK gene expression has different sensitivity to these psychoactive drugs within the cortices.
