Subregions of the rat hippocampal slice were investigated in relation to (a) the presence of long-term potentiation and (b) responsiveness to low-frequency stimulation. Long-term potentiation was observed in CA1, CA3 and dentate. The effect occasionally lasted up to 6 h, developed gradually, and depended upon repeated low-frequency tetani for maximal effect. To low-frequency monosynaptic stimulation, areas CA3 and CA1 exhibit response facilitation whereas the dentate gyrus exhibits response depression. Reponsiveness in all areas was influenced by stimulus frequency. Recovery was rapid in all areas.
