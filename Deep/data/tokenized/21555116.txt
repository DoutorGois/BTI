Nesfatin-1 reduces food intake when injected centrally in rodents. We recently described wide distribution of nucleobindin2 (NUCB2)/nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity in rat brain autonomic nuclei activated by various stressors. We used C57BL/6 mice to localize brain NUCB2/nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity and assessed activation of NUCB2/nesfatin 1 neurons after water avoidance stress (WAS). Gastric emptying of a non-nutrient liquid was also determined. NUCB2/nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity was detected in cortical areas including piriform, insular, cingulate and somatomotor cortices, the limbic system including amygdaloid nuclei, hippocampus and septum, the basal ganglia, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the thalamus including paraventricular and parafascicular nuclei, the hypothalamus including supraoptic, periventricular, paraventricular (PVN), arcuate nuclei and ventromedial and lateral hypothalamic areas. Intensely labeled NUCB2/nesfatin-1 neurons were detected in a previously undefined region which we named intermediate dorsomedial hypothalamus. In the brainstem, NUCB2/nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity was detected in the raphe nuclei, Edinger-Westphal nucleus, locus coeruleus (LC), lateral parabrachial nucleus, ventrolateral medulla (VLM) and dorsal vagal complex. WAS induced Fos expression in 35% of NUCB2/nesfatin-1-immunoreactive neurons in the PVN, 50% in the LC, 54% in the rostral raphe pallidus, 58% in the VLM, 39% in the middle part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and 33% in the caudal NTS. Nesfatin-1 injected intracerebroventricularly significantly decreased gastric emptying. These data showed that NUCB2/nesfatin-1 immunoreactivity is distributed in mouse brain areas involved in the regulation of stress response and visceral functions activated by an acute psychological stressor suggesting that nesfatin-1 might play a role in the efferent component of the stress response.
