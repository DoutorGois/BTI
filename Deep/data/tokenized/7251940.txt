The corticostriate projections of temporal areas TA, TE, TF, TG, 35, and 28 were studied in the rhesus monkey with the use of autoradiography. Widespread projections were observed to rostral as well as caudal parts of the striatum for all areas except area 28. For example, areas TA and TG have sizable projections to the medial or periventricular part of the head of the caudate nucleus, as well as to the medial part of the tail of this structure and the dorsally adjacent putamen. Areas TE and TF also were observed to send strong projections to the head of the caudate nucleus. In addition, they project to the rostral putamen. Both have projections to the tail of the caudate nucleus and caudal putamen. The widespread distribution of temporostriate axons to the rostral striatum suggests strongly that previous silver impregnation studied have not only underestimated the strength of the temporal cortical contribution to the corticostriate system, but also failed to identify the major projection zone of temporostriate axon terminals. For example, while all temporal cortical areas contribute projections to an organized topography in the tail of the caudate nucleus and the ventrocaudal putamen, they were observed consistently to have larger projections to the head of the caudate nucleus and rostral putamen. These results add to a growing body of evidence which demonstrates the existence of widespread nonmotor cortical input to the basal ganglia, and an organization of this input far greater in complexity than that demonstrated by earlier suppressive silver impregnation methods.
