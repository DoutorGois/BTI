Studies of the ontogenesis of the limbic and entorhinal cortex, the hippocamp and the hypothalamus in man and monkeys in the pre- and postnatal periods revealed substantial differences in their development. The architectonic structures of the monkey brain develop in the prenatal period, and by the time of the birth they have already been formed to a greater degree than the analogous structures in the human newborn. A substantial difference of the ontogenesis of the above cortical structures in man consists in development of limitrophe structures and appearance of new structural units. A specific feature of the development of the limbic and entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus of the human brain, as compared with that in rhesus macacas, is a longer duration of their postnatal ontogenesis. The main development of the cortical structures of the human brain proceeds after the birth.
