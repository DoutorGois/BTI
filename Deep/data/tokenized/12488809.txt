We studied the spatial and temporal expression of BDNF immunoreactivity and mRNA in the hippocampal formation after transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils. Our study demonstrated that in the vulnerable CA1 neurons, there was a prolonged expression disparity between BDNF immunoreactivity and mRNA and the BDNF level was reduced, in contrast to the ischemia-resistant dentate gyrus neurons that showed transient expression disparity and maintained the BDNF level. This expression disparity of the neurotrophic factor may be related to delayed neuronal death. Double immunostaining showed that reactive astroglia and microglia could express BDNF, suggesting a possible involvement of these cells in the mechanism of neuronal survival after ischemia.
