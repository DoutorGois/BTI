BACKGROUND: A downregulation of I(2)-imidazoline binding sites has been reported in frontal cortices of depressed suicide victims, according to I(2)-radioligand binding and confirmed by Western blotting. We now report Western blots of imidazoline receptor proteins in hippocampi of subjects with and without depression at the time of death. METHODS: Postmortem diagnoses were obtained from 17 cases of Axis I major depressive disorder and 17 cases without Axis I psychopathology. No psychotropic compounds were found in body fluids. Hippocampi were removed, sectioned, and assessed histologically. Throughout the analysis, each major depressive disorder sample was paired with a sample from a psychiatrically healthy subject based on equivalent life spans and postmortem delays. The antiserum was identical to that used in previous studies that reported a downregulation of cortical 29/30-kd imidazoline receptor-binding proteins in depression. RESULTS: A triad of imidazoline receptor-binding protein bands (40-50 kd) was detected in the human hippocampus. Subjects with major depressive disorder had significantly less intensity in each imidazoline receptor-binding proteins band compared with control subjects (p =. 01 for overall bands). CONCLUSIONS: The present results can be aligned with previous reports of downregulation of I(2)-radioligand binding sites in both cortices and platelets of depressed patients.
