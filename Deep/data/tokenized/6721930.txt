The experiments addressed the question of whether certain modalities of stimulation are more effective in eliciting immobility-related, atropine-sensitive neocortical low-voltage fast activity and hippocampal rhythmical slow activity from the rabbit. More pronounced activation and less pronounced habituation followed tactile than auditory and visual stimulation. On the basis of these results, and other studies, it is suggested that atropine-sensitive electroencephalographic activity may be importantly involved in the central programming, initiation, and guidance of movement.
