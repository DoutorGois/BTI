Rats placed into the rotating cylindrical tretbahn (diameter 50 cm, 2.3 r. p. m.) for 24, 48 and 96 hrs developed the sleep deprivation resulting in elevation of SH-group level for over 20% in mesencephalon and diencephalon. The normalizing occurred within 48 hrs. The high level of brain SH-groups in 24-hr sleep-deprived rats changed insignificantly after 12 hrs of resting. The intraperitoneal administration of phenazepam (1 mg/kg) or barbamyl (70 mg/kg) had no effect whereas their combination normalized the SH-groups level within 12 hrs of rest.
