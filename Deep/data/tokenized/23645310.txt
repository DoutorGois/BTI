OBJECTIVE: Low dose exposure to endocrine disrupters (environmental chemicals) may induce hormone-like effects on wildlife and humans. bisphenol A (BPA) might disturb the neuronal signaling regulated by endogenous estrogens. We investigated the rapid modulation effects of 10nM BPA, a typical endocrine disruptor, on long-term depression (LTD) of adult rat hippocampal slices. METHOD: LTD was induced by a transient perfusion of 30 microM NMDA for 3 min. And measured with multielectrode probes. RESULTS: A 30 min perfusion of 10 nM BPA rapidly enhanced LTD in CA1, however, BPA suppressed LTD in dentate gyrus (DG). An ERRgamma antagonist, 4-OH-tamoxifen, suppressed LTD in CA1 and DG. Inhibitor of estrogen receptor ICI 182,780 did not disturb BPA effects. On the other hand, tributyltin (TBT), another endocrine disruptor, did not have any effect on LTD in CA1 and DG. CONCLUSION: ERRgamma, but not estrogen receptors, is a high affinity BPA receptor in LTD processes, since the effect of BPA on LTD was suppressed by an ERRgamma antagonist. A possible mechanisms of BPA-induced enhancement of LTD could be described with ERRgamma, MAPK activation and phosphorylation of MMDA receptors.
