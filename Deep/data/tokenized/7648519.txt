Nitroxides are antioxidant compounds that have been shown to provide radioprotection in vivo and in vitro. Radioprotection in vivo is limited by toxicity, which appears to be neurologic in nature. To further evaluate the toxicity of these compounds, three representative nitroxides, Tempol, Tempamine, and Tempo, were examined in slices of guinea pig hippocampus. Each nitroxide increased the population spike and caused potentiation of excitatory postsynaptic potential--spike coupling. Repetitive activity and epileptiform activity were observed at the highest concentrations of Tempo and Tempamine. Tempol was the least toxic compound in this system, followed by Tempamine and Tempo. Additional studies are necessary to further define the effects of nitroxides on the central nervous system and to develop strategies to mitigate these effects.
