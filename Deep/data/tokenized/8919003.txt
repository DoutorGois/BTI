Young and old rats performed on a maze according to a forced-choice and then a spatial memory procedure either in the same or a different environment. Aged rats were slower to learn the spatial memory task when tested in the same, but not in a different, room. One interpretation of this pattern of results is that although old rats learn new rules as quickly as young rats, they show less flexibility with old rules and familiar spatial information. Impaired choice accuracy during asymptote performance suggests poor processing of trial-unique information by old rats. Spatial correlates of hippocampal CA1 and hilar cells varied with task demand: CA1 cells of aged rats showed more spatially selective place fields, whereas hilar cells showed more diffuse location coding during spatial memory, and not forced-choice, tests. Such representational reorganization may reflect a compensatory response to age-related neurobiological changes in hippocampus.
