OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of recombine human erythropoietin (rhEPO) on neural cells apoptosis and the expression of Caspase-3 protein in brain tissue of fetal rats after intrauterine hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. METHODS: Forty-four Sprague-Dawley rats on 19 days of pregnancy were divided into rhEPO treated group, ischemia-reperfusion group and sham-operated group. Intrauterine hypoxic-ischemic injury of fetal rats was induced by bilateral occlusion of the utero-ovarian artery for 20 min. rhEPO (5000 U/kg) was injected into rats through caudal vein in rhEPO treated group while saline was injected into rats in hypoxic-ischemic group 30 min before hypoxic-ischemic injury. The brain samples in rhEPO treated group and hypoxic-ischemic group were obtained at 30 min, 3 h, 6 h, 24 h and 48 h respectively after artery clamping. There was no hypoxic-ischemic injury in sham-operated group, so the brain samples were obtained at 24 hours after sham operation. Neuroapoptosis in brain tissue was measured by TdT mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (Tunel) staining. The expression of Caspase-3 protein was observed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The number of apoptosis cells in fetal rat hippocampus after intrauterine hypoxic-ischemic increased progressively with reperfusion. Compared with the I/R group, the number of apoptosis cells decreased in rhEPO treated group (P < 0.01). The expression of Caspase-3 increased rapidly after 3 hours from the reperfusion in the I/R group. Compared with the I/R group, there was less expression of Caspase-3 in rhEPO treated group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: rhEPO showed the effects to inhibit the apoptosis of fetal neural cells and the expression of Caspase-3 protein due to intrauterine hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
