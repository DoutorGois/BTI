Hippocampal and neocortical EEG was studied in spontaneously immobile rabbits and in immobilized rabbits, "animal hypnosis.' Neocortical low voltage fast activity (LVFA) and hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA) occurred spontaneously and were elicited by sensory stimulation, eserine and brain stimulation in normally immobile and hypnotized animals. Atropine sulfate blocked the LVFA and RSA that occurred during spontaneous immobility and hypnosis but not the LVFA and RSA that occurred during movement. RSA was also recorded from both CAI and dentate gyrus generators of the hippocampus during both types of immobility. The results show that hypnotized rabbits have the same type II (atropine-sensitive) EEG that is found in spontaneously immobile rabbits. The presence of type II EEG during hypnosis and its sustained sensitivity to stimulation is compatible with the view that the EEG activity is not uncoupled from its normal behavioral correlates. Perhaps normal EEG during animal hypnosis allows normal sensorimotor functions. This may permit the possibility of escape from predators at opportune moments once the immobility has served its defensive function.
