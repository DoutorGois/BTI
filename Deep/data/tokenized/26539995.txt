OBJECTIVES: Long-term d-galactose injection induces accelerated aging in experimental rodent models. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of dietary fructo-oligosaccharide (FO) on the brain beta-amyloid (Abeta), amyloid-associated enzymes, cognitive function, and plasma antioxidant levels in d-galactose-treated Balb/c mice. METHODS: The subcutaneous (s.c.) injection and the dietary treatment were conducted simultaneously for 49 days. Mice (12 weeks of age) were divided into five groups (n = 14/group): control (s.c. saline, control diet) serving as a young control, DG (s.c. 1.2 g d-galactose/kg body weight, control diet), DG + LFO (2.5% w/w FO, low-dose FO diet), DG + HFO (5% w/w FO, high-dose FO diet), and DG + E (alpha-tocopherol 0.2% w/w, vitamin E diet) as an antioxidant reference group. Another group of older mice (64 weeks of age) without any injection served as a natural aging (NA) group. RESULTS: The DG and NA groups had greater Abeta levels in the cortex, hippocampus, and the whole brain. High-dose FO, similar to alpha-tocopherol, attenuated the d-galactose-induced Abeta density in the cortex and hippocampus. In addition, FO attenuated the d-galactose-induced protein expression of Abeta and beta-site amyloid precursor cleaving enzyme of the whole brain in a dose-response manner. Either dose of FO supplementation, similar to alpha-tocopherol, attenuated the d-galactose-induced cognitive dysfunction. In addition, FO improved the plasma ascorbic acid level in a dose-response manner. CONCLUSION: Dietary FO (2.5-5% w/w diet) could attenuate the development of Alzheimer's disease, which was likely to be associated with its systematic antioxidant effects.
