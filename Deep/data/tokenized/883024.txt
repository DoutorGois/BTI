The injection of aethimizol to rats (10 mg/kg) causes an irregular widening of cisternae of the granular endoplasmic reticulum in "light" pyramidal neurons of zone CA1 of dorsal hippocampus, which is considered as a depression of the neuronal apparatus of protein synthesis. A 1 mg/kg dose causes, in some synapses, a complex of changes supposed to express the activation of synapses. No essential changes were revealed in the heart neurons. Aethimizol acts selectively on the ultrastructure of central nervous system and does not exert a pronounced action on autonomic neurons.
