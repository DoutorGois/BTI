There is literature evidence that both growth hormone (GH) and its mediator, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), are able to act upon neuronal and glial cells in the brain. We report here the location of the GH receptor in the brain of the rat and rabbit. Receptor distribution was determined by immunohistochemistry with GH receptor/binding protein (BP) specific monoclonal antibodies and by in situ hybridization with a [35S]riboprobe. GH receptor/BP immunoreactivity in the rat was most prominent in the neonate and declined with postnatal age. Receptor immunoreactivity was generalised with variation in immunoreactivity in regional areas. In the rat, strongest immunoreactivity was seen in layers 2, 3, 5 and especially layer 6 of the cerebral cortex, in neurones of the thalamus and hypothalamus, in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, in neurones of the trapezoid body of the brainstem, and in retinal ganglion cells. Glial cells, notably astrocytes were also strongly reactive, along with ependyma of the choroid plexus, ventricular lining and pia mater. In the neonatal rabbit, strongest immunoreactivity was evident in layers 2 and 3 of the cerebral cortex, in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus, and in neurones of the inferior and superior colliculi, brain stem reticular formation, dorsal thalamus and hypothalamus. A similar distribution of GH receptor mRNA was seen by in situ hybridization. The ontogeny of GH receptor/BP mRNA in whole rat brain was quantified by solution hybridization-RNAse protection assay. Contrary to its ontogeny in the liver (Endocrinology, 113 (1983) 1325-1329) receptor mRNA decreased with postnatal age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
