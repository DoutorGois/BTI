An RNAse protection assay was used to identify p140trk mRNA in the developing rat septohippocampal system. In both the septum and hippocampus, levels of p140trk mRNA were low at birth and increased thereafter. Levels of transcripts were found to be much higher in the septum than in the hippocampus, whereas another brain region, the hypothalamus, showed levels of expression intermediate between these two structures. Only one isoform of the p140trk receptor was found to be expressed in the rat central nervous system (CNS) during development. This isoform corresponds to the one preferentially expressed in neural tissues in the adult animal. These data show that expression of the high affinity nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor is developmentally regulated during postnatal brain development and suggest that it might mediate NGF effects on developing central cholinergic systems.
