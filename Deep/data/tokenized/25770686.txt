The hippocampus is one of the most essential components of the human brain and plays an important role in learning and memory. The hippocampus has drawn great attention from scientists and clinicians due to its clinical importance in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), non-AD dementia, and epilepsy. Understanding the function of the hippocampus and related disease mechanisms requires comprehensive knowledge of the orchestration of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins. The past decade has seen remarkable advances in the high-throughput sequencing techniques that are collectively called next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS enables the precise analysis of gene expression profiles in cells and tissues, allowing powerful and more feasible integration of expression data from the gene level to the protein level, even allowing "-omic" level assessment of PTMs. In addition, improved bioinformatics algorithms coupled with NGS technology are finally opening a new era for scientists to discover previously unidentified and elusive proteins. In the present review, we will focus mainly on the proteomics of the human hippocampus with an emphasis on the integrated analysis of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Finally, we will discuss our perspectives on the potential and future of proteomics in the field of hippocampal biology.
