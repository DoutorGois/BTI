Gestational diabetes (GD) alters normal fetal development and is related to a diabetogenic effect in the progeny. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are considered to be potential drug targets for the regulation, treatment, or prevention of diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate early and late changes of LXR in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of the male and female offspring of control (CO) and diabetic (DO) mothers. We used an experimental model of streptozotocin-induced GD to assess the protein expression of LXRalpha (NR1H3) and LXRbeta (NR1H2) by western blotting. The tissues were obtained from CO and DO animals at postnatal day 1 (1D), day 10 (10D), and day 35 (35D) and 9 months (9M). In CO, the LXR expression showed significant differences among the groups, which were tissue- and receptor-specific (P<0.05). Sex differences in CO were found only in the hypothalamus for LXRbeta expression at 35D and 9M (P<0.05). When CO and DO were compared, differences between them were observed in the majority of the studied groups at 1D (male hippocampus, LXRalpha 31% and LXRbeta 161%; female hippocampus, LXRbeta 165%; male hypothalamus, LXRbeta 182%; and female hypothalamus, LXRalpha 85%; P<0.05). However, these differences disappeared later with the exception of LXRbeta expression in the male hypothalamus (P<0.05). The area under the curve during the glucose tolerance test correlated negatively with LXRbeta in CO but not in DO animals. Moreover, in a male DO subpopulation this correlation was positive as it occurs in intolerant animals. These results indicate that GD affects hypothalamic LXR expression differently in male and female offspring.
