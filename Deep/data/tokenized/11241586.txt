We investigated the cognition enhancing effects of ginsenoside Rb1 and Rg1. Mice were trained in a Morris water maze following injection (i.p.) of Rb1 (1 mg/kg) or Rg1 (1 mg/kg) for 4 days. Both Rb1- and Rg1-injected mice showed enhanced spatial learning compared to control animals. The hippocampus, but not the frontal cortex, of treated mice contained higher density of a synaptic marker protein, synaptophysin, compared to control mice. Electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices revealed that Rb1 or Rg1 injection did not change the magnitude of paired-pulse facilitation or long-term potentiation. Our results suggest that Rb1 and Rg1 enhance spatial learning ability by increasing hippocampal synaptic density without changing plasticity of individual synapses.
