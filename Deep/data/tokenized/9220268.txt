Cerebral malaria is a common disease, but there have not been any reports or investigations of long-term neurological or neuropsychological outcome. We present a case in which severe deficits in delayed memory and naming ability are observed 10 years after the patient contracted cerebral malaria. Neuropsychological testing and medical imaging are both consistent with temporal lobe/hippocampal dysfunction, which corroborates earlier animal research that cerebral malaria is particularly likely to lead to interrupted blood circulation in this area.
