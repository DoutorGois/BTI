The actions of 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine (THA) were studied on rat CA1 pyramidal neurones under voltage-clamp in transverse slices of hippocampus maintained in vitro. As previously reported, THA reduced the resting conductance of cells; THA also suppressed inward rectification activated by hyperpolarization by up to 75% (The dose of THA which reduced the response by 50% (IC50) was 300 microM). More sensitive to the action of THA was the outward K+ current activated in CA1 neurones by 5-HT, adenosine and baclofen. This was completely blocked by THA (IC50 = 28 microM). The cooperativity of this latter action of THA with its well-known anticholinesterase activity is discussed in relation to the therapeutic effects of THA in treating Alzheimer's disease.
