In this issue of Neuron, report that forebrain-specific Presenilin-1 conditional knockout mice show defects in enrichment-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This defect in neurogenesis is associated with enhanced fear memory of contextual cues when animals are subjected to enrichment between training and testing. The authors suggest that neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus may serve to clear out old memory traces from the hippocampus, thus leaving the hippocampus available for new memory processing.
