Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is one of the CAG-repeat diseases, and is classified into juvenile and early adult types showing progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) in addition to late adult type. We immunohistochemically examined accumulation of oxidative products and expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in autopsy cases of DRPLA. Oxidative products to nucleosides, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-hydroxyguanosine, were accumulated in the lenticulate nucleus predominantly in DRPLA cases having PME. Neuronal accumulation of 4-hydroxy nonenal, a reactive lipid aldehyde, was found in the hippocampus, globus pallidus and cerebellar dentate nucleus in adult DRPLA cases and controls. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for Cu/ZnSOD was reduced in the external segment of globus pallidus, dentate nucleus and cerebellar cortex in DRPLA cases. Mitochondrial immunoreactivity for MnSOD was reduced in the lenticulate nucleus and cerebellum in DRPLA cases having PME. Some DRPLA cases showed reduced immunoreactivity for MnSOD in the cerebral cortex. Coexistence of reduced SOD expression and polyglutamine was observed in a few cases. It has been discussed in Huntington's disease that expanded polyglutamine can lead to oxidative neurodegeneration. It is likely that oxidative stress can be involved in DRPLA, although relationship with expanded polyglutamine remains to be elusive.
