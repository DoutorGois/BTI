Hippocampal organotypic cultures constitute a very easy but delicate method widely used to study amyloid beta-peptide toxicity. This ex vivo technique is performed on tissues isolated from newborn rats. Here, we describe a protocol for the preparation and culture of hippocampal organotypic slices that can be maintained for 14-21 days and their application to the study of amyloid beta-peptide toxicity.
