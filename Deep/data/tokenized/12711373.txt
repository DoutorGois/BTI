Using a well-established songbird model of juvenile vocal development, we have found that daily cannabinoid exposure at modest dosages alters sensory-motor vocal learning. Adult exposure did not change song that had already been learned. Our results demonstrate the potential for cannabinoid exposure to produce distinct effects during post-natal CNS development.
