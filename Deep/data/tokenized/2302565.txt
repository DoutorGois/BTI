Lipoprotein lipase is a key enzyme in lipoprotein metabolism present primarily in extrahepatic tissues with high turnover of fatty acids. Using immunocytochemistry we have explored where lipoprotein lipase is localized in guinea pig brain. The enzyme was found to be associated with neuronal cells and vascular endothelial surfaces. The distribution was strikingly uneven with intense reaction in some areas, and virtually no reaction in adjacent areas. The highest reactivity was in neocortex, in hippocampus, in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and in some motor nuclei of the brainstem. The results suggest marked differences between individual brain areas in utilization of plasma lipoproteins.
