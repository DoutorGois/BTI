The ability of a neuronal surface glycoprotein to mediate the formation of neuronal connections was tested in an explant culture system. A monoclonal antibody against the limbic system-associated membrane protein (LAMP) was used in co-cultures containing cholinergic neurons of the septum and their hippocampal target neurons. Antibody treatment had no effect on general axon outgrowth, but significantly diminished the ability of septal cholinergic axons to invade and collateralize in the hippocampus. The results suggest that factors regulating general axon outgrowth may be distinct from those regulating the patterns of outgrowth that define the formation of neural circuits.
