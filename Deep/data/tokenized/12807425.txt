Chemokines and their receptors have been strongly implicated in the inflammatory process. However, their roles in excitotoxic brain injury are largely unknown. In this study we used C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) knockout (KO) mice to investigate the role of CCR5 in neurodegeneration induced by intranasal administration of the excitotoxin kainic acid (KA). Although KA treatment resulted in an increased CCR5 mRNA level in the hippocampi of wild-type mice, a CCR5 deficiency in KO mice did not affect either the clinical and pathological changes in vivo or the neuronal susceptibilities to KA insult in vitro. KA treatment stimulated mRNA expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-2 (MCP-2) in both the wild-type and KO mice. KA treatment did not affect mRNA levels for the macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha) or the regulated upon activation normal T cells expressed and secreted protein (RANTES) in either wild-type or CCR5 KO mice. CCR2 mRNA expression was undetectable in the hippocampi of wild-type mice regardless of KA treatment. In contrast, CCR5 KO mice showed CCR2 mRNA expression that was remarkably increased after KA treatment. KA treatment did not affect CCR3 mRNA expression in the wild-type mice, whereas KO mice showed both a higher basal level of CCR3 mRNA expression as well as a strong upregulation following KA treatment. These results indicate that CCR5 is not a necessary inflammatory mediator in KA induced neurodegeneration. The roles of CCR5 in excitotoxic injury in CCR5 deficient mice are compensated by increased CCR2 and CCR3 expression, which share the common MCP-2 ligand with CCR5.
