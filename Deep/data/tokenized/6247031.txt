Bath application of low concentrations of opioid peptides and higher concentrations of opiates increased the amplitude and duration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials of pyramidal cells and induced long-lasting depolarization shifts. These actions were reversible and blocked by the opiate antagonist naloxone. Synaptic isolation of the cells by exposure of the cultures to 8 mM Mg2+ not only abolished all spiking and synaptic activity, but also obliterated the peptide effects on pyramidal cells, although these cells were still excited by bath-applied glutamate. The opioid peptides had no detectable effect on resting membrane potential and on the input resistance of the penetrated cells. Experiments in which pyramidal cells were synaptically activated by field stimulation provided direct evidence for a disinhibitory action of the peptides.
