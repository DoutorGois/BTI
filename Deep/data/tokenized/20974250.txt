Presenilin 2 (PS2) mutation increases Abeta generation and neuronal cell death in the brains of Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. In a previous study, we showed that increased oxidative damage and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were associated with Abeta generation and neuronal cell death in neuronal cells expressing mutant PS2. In this study, we show that oral treatment with 4-O-methylhonokiol, a novel compound isolated from Magnolia officinalis, for 3 months (1.0mg/kg) prevented PS2 mutation-induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death accompanied by a reduction in Abeta(1-42) accumulation. We also found that 4-O-methylhonokiol inhibited PS2 mutation-induced activation of ERK and beta-secretase, and oxidative protein and lipid damage, but recovered glutathione levels in the cortex and hippocampus of PS2 mutant mice. Additionally, 4-O-methylhonokiol prevented PS2 mutation-induced activation of astrocytes as well as production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide (NO) in neurons. Generation of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, ROS, and NO and ERK activation in cultured astrocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (1mug/ml) were also prevented by 4-O-methylhonokiol in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the improving effects of 4-O-methylhonokiol on memory function may be associated with a suppression of the activation of ERK and astrocytes as well as a reduction in oxidative damage. Thus, 4-O-methylhonokiol may be useful in the prevention and treatment of AD.
