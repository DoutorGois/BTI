Early-generated Cajal-Retzius cells in the marginal zone of the cortex synthesize and secrete the glycoprotein Reelin. The reelin gene is deleted in reeler mice, which show characteristic alterations in cortical lamination. Recent studies have shed some light on the role of Cajal-Retzius cells and Reelin in the formation of cell and fiber layers in the neocortex and hippocampus.
