S. Berry and R. Thompson (1979) reported that electrolytic lesions of the medial septum significantly retard eyeblink conditioning. However, these electrolytic lesions were nonselective and may have also damaged the subcortical inputs to the hippocampus via the fimbria-fornix. In the present study, the medial septum was selectively lesioned with ibotenic acid in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), whose performance in a delay eyeblink conditioning paradigm was compared with that of intact controls. sham-operated controls, and intact controls given a systemic injection of scopolamine. Rabbits with selective medial septal lesions and rabbits receiving systemic scopolamine were significantly slower to condition than were intact and sham-lesioned rabbits. This finding demonstrates that the selective removal of the medial septum retards delay eyeblink conditioning in a manner similar to the disruption seen after systemic administration of scopolamine.
