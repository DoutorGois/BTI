The immunoperoxidase-antiperoxidase method (PAP) was combined with immunofluorescence for simultaneous localization of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-and somatostatin-like immunoreactivity in rat hippocampal neurons growing in dissociated cell culture. A subpopulation of GAD-immunoreactive neurons additionally exhibited somatostatin-like immunostaining. GAD-negative somatostatin-positive cells could not be observed. It is discussed whether the cultured somatostatin-containing GAD neurons correspond to a certain subclass of basket cells as they occur in situ.
