1. Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) has been reported to regulate the cAMP signaling system at various levels, suggesting that the cAMP system is involved in the therapeutic mechanism. 2. Chronic ECS has been suggested to change the expressions of adenylate cyclase (AC) genes, which constitute at least 9 families. However, little is known about its effect on the expression of AC. Therefore, to understand how chronic ECS alters the expression of AC genes in the brain, the authors analyzed the expression of 9 AC isoforms at the transcriptional level in rat hippocampus and cerebellum by quantitative RT-PCR following chronic ECS treatment. 3. Chronic ECS treatment was found to induce differential changes in the expression of AC isoforms in an isoform- and brain region-specific manner in the rat hippocampus and cerebellum. 4. Thus, it is concluded that chronic ECS induces differential changes in the expression of AC isoform mRNA in an isoform- and brain region-specific manner in the rat hippocampus and cerebellum. This suggests that the differential expression of AC isoforms might be an important mechanism by which chronic ECS treatment regulates the cAMP signaling system in rat brains.
