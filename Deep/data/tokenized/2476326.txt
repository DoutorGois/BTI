GABA/benzodiazepine coupling was evaluated in 8 regions of rat brain by the ability of GABA to stimulate 0.5 nM [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Rats were treated acutely with diazepam (p.o) or chronically with flurazepam, offered in the drinking water for 4 weeks, and compared to a pair-handled vehicle-treated control group. Regional variations in GABA/benzodiazepine coupling were found in control membranes. GABA increased benzodiazepine binding maximally (40%) in cerebellum and medulla, and least (25%) in olfactory bulb. A significant decrease in the effect of GABA was found in cortex of chronically treated rats immediately after, but not 2 days following treatment. The Emax for GABA stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was significantly increased in medulla after acute treatment but was not altered after acute or chronic treatment in other brain areas evaluated. Treatment had no effect on the ability of bicuculline to inhibit [3H]flunitrazepam binding in cortex. Benzodiazepine/Cl- coupling in cortex or hippocampus of acutely and chronically treated rats, evaluated by the ability of Cl- to stimulate specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding, was not changed. The results support the hypothesis that a functional uncoupling of the benzodiazepine recognition site from the GABA receptor in cortex, but not from the anion recognition site, may play a role in tolerance development.
