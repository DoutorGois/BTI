Distribution of the delta- and epsilon-subspecies of protein kinase C (PKC) in rat central nervous tissues was semiquantitated by an immunoblot analysis. The epsilon-subspecies, which is expressed predominantly in the brain, was abundant in hippocampus and cerebral cortex among rat brain areas, whereas the delta-subspecies, which is expressed ubiquitously in many tissues, showed no significant difference among tissue areas tested. Unlike other subspecies, the delta-subspecies was primarily associated with particulate fractions. Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that both the epsilon- and delta-subspecies were enriched in the synaptosomal P2 fraction. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) induced translocation of the epsilon-subspecies from cytosolic fraction to membrane fraction. In contrast, upon treatment with TPA, the delta-subspecies normally bound to membrane fraction was released into cytosol.
