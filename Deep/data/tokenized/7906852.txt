We studied the localizations of alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits of soluble guanylate cyclase using in situ hybridization. The beta subunit was widely distributed in most neurons throughout the brain, with different levels of expression. The alpha 1 subunit was also distributed throughout the brain; however, it was located in more limited regions. Both subunits were expressed markedly in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, dorsal and ventral striatum, and several regions in the brainstem. Regions with little or no alpha 1 subunit expression, but with marked expression of the beta 1 subunit included the olfactory bulb except for the glomerular layer, pyramidal cell layer in CA1 and granular cell layer in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and many brainstem nuclei. The above regions expressing both subunits are suggested to contain active soluble guanylate cyclase as a target for nitric oxide, and thus may be involved in cellular signal transduction.
