OBJECTIVE: To research the effect of the Jingqianshu granule (JQS) on the expression of serotonin receptor-1A (5-HT(1A)R) in hippocampus and hypothalamus of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) model rats with Liver-qi depression. METHOD: The PMS model rats with Liver-qi depression were induced by bandaging the limbs. The model rats were treated with JQS, and evaluated by open-field test. The expression of 5-HT(1A)R in hippocampus and hypothalamus was analysed by the method of RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULT: After the JQS were administered, the open field scores, the expression of 5-HT(1A)R mRNA and protein in hippocampus and hypothalamus of rats increased significantly. CONCLUSION: The JQS granule can up-regulate the expression of 5-HT(1A)R in hippocampus and hypothalamus, which maybe one of the mechanism to treat PMS with liver-qi depression.
