The present study explored the effect of 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-d-glucoside (THSG) on the staurosporine (STS)-induced toxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The results showed that administration of 200muM of THSG significantly protected against 0.3muM of STS-induced apoptosis in cultured rat hippocampal neurons tested by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays. Furthermore, when the Akt signaling pathway was blocked by LY294002, an inhibitor of Phosphatidyl Inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the protective effects of THSG against STS-induced neurotoxicity were abrogated. We further examined the involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in THSG protection against STS-induced cytotoxicity on cultured neurons and found that administration of THSG significantly inhibited the STS-induced decreases in the content of phosphorylated AKt (p-Akt). Moreover, we found that THSG rescued the down-regulation of B cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (Bcl2) and pro-caspase-3 (pro-Csp3) caused by STS in the neurons. These results indicate that THSG protect the cultured rat hippocampal neurons against STS-induced cytotoxicity and the PI3K/Akt signaling and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways are involved in the THSG-induced protective effects.
