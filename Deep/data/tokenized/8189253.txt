To study the relationship between energy impairment and the effects of d-methamphetamine (METH) on dopaminergic neurons, ATP and dopamine levels were measured in the brain of C57BL/6 mice treated with either a single or four injections of METH (10 mg/kg, i.p.) at 2-h intervals. Neither striatal ATP nor dopamine concentrations changed after a single injection of METH, but both were significantly decreased 1.5 h after the multiple-dose regimen. The effects of METH on ATP levels appear to be selective for the striatum, as ATP concentrations were not affected in the cerebellar cortex and hippocampus after either a single or multiple injections of METH. In a second set of experiments, an intraperitoneal injection of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG; 1 g/kg), an inhibitor of glucose uptake and utilization, was given 30 min before the third and fourth injections of METH. 2-DG significantly potentiated METH-induced striatal ATP loss at 1.5 h and dopamine depletions at 1.5 h and 1 week. These results indicate that a toxic regimen of METH selectively causes striatal energy impairment and raise the possibility that perturbations of energy metabolism play a role in METH-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity.
