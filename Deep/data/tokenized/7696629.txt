The effects of zinc on neuronal excitability in rodent hippocampal slices were examined. In a paired-pulse protocol, the second population spike increased appreciably in the presence of zinc, whereas the first spike and the size of both population excitatory post-synaptic potentials remained unaffected. Changes in the second population spike produced by zinc were most pronounced when the afferents were stimulated with paired-pulses separated by 8-40 ms. The magnitude of altered excitability increased with the concentration of zinc in the perfusate. A long exposure to zinc in physiological concentration caused an epileptiform discharge followed by a period of depression. The effects of zinc could be mimicked with 1-3 microM bicuculline. We conclude that the integrity of the hippocampal inhibitory system is particularly vulnerable to zinc.
