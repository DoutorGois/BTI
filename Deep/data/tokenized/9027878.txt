The contribution of the various hippocampal regions to the maintenance of epileptic activity, induced by stimulation of the perforant path or commissural system, was examined in the awake rat. Combination of multiple-site recordings with silicon probes, current source density analysis and unit recordings allowed for a high spatial resolution of the field events. Following perforant path stimulation, seizures began in the dentate gyrus, followed by events in the CA3-CA1 regions. After commissural stimulation, rhythmic bursts in the CA3-CA1 circuitry preceded the activation of the dentate gyrus. Correlation of events in the different subregions indicated that the sustained rhythmic afterdischarge (2-6 Hz) could not be explained by a cycle-by-cycle excitation of principal cell populations in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop. The primary afterdischarge always terminated in the CA1 region, followed by the dentate gyrus, CA3 region and the entorhinal cortex. The duration and pattern of the hippocampal afterdischarge was essentially unaffected by removal of the entorhinal cortex. The emergence of large population spike bursts coincided with a decreased discharge of interneurons in both CA1 and hilar regions. The majority of hilar interneurons displayed a strong amplitude decrement prior to the onset of population spike phase of the afterdischarge. These findings suggest that (i) afterdischarges can independently arise in the CA3-CA1 and entorhinal dentate gyrus circuitries, (ii) reverberation of excitation in the hippocampal-entorhinal loop is not critical for the maintenance of afterdischarges and (iii) decreased activity of the interneuronal network may release population bursting of principal cells.
