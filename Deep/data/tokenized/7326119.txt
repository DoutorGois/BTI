The effects of hippocampal electrical stimulation on unit responses to clicks in the primary auditory area were quantitatively studied in the cat. Differences in number of spikes per response, spike distribution within the response and constancy of responses were statistically tested in the absence and in the presence of hippocampal stimulation, respectively. The results show that statistically significant changes are produced in the firing pattern of about 50% of neurons responding to clicks.
