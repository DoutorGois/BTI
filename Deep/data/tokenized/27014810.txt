OBJECTIVE: In this research, we have observed changes of PHF8H3K9me2BDNF, and their regulatory roles in changing the amplitude value of LTP in hippocampus due to aluminum exposure so that we can discuss the impact on the learning and memory that caused by chronic aluminum exposure. METHODS: Forty healthy SPF grade SD male rats were randomly divided into four groups by weight, including control group and low, medium, high dose aluminum exposed group, each group had 10 rats. The exposed rats drank water containing different doses of aluminum chloride (AlCl3) (21272 mg/kg Al(3+)) for 90 d. We measured LTP in hippocampus by electrophysiological grapier and detected the expression of PHF8H3K9me2BDNF by western-blot. RESULTS: Electrophysiological measurements shows that compared with that of control group, the average of fEPSPs was decreased at different time points in all exposed groups (P<0.01) . The results of western-bolt test demonstrated that the expression of PHF8 in the exposed groups were significantly lower than those of control group (P<0.01) . And the expression the of H3K9me2 of medium and high dose groups were significantly higher than control group (P<0.05) . While the expression of BDNF of medium and high dose groups were decreased compared with the control group (P<0.05) . CONCLUSION: Chronic aluminum exposure can reduce the LTP via the route of PHF8-H3K9me2-BDNF in the hippocampus of rats, which then may impair the ability of learning and memory.
