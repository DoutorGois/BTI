The effect of dihydropyridine agonists and antagonists on neuronal voltage sensitive calcium channels was investigated. The resting intracellular calcium concentration of synaptosomes prepared from whole brain was 110 +/- 9 nM, as assayed by the indicator quin 2. Depolarisation of the synaptosomes with K+ produced an immediate increase in [Ca2+]i. The calcium agonist Bay K 8644 and antagonist nifedipine did not affect [Ca2+]i under resting or depolarising conditions. In addition, K+ stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake into synaptosomes prepared from the hippocampus was insensitive to Bay K 8644 and PY 108-068 in normal or Na+ free conditions. In neuronally derived NG108-15 cells the enantiomers of the dihydropyridine derivative 202-791 showed opposite effects in modulating K+ stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake. (-)-R-202-791 inhibited K+ induced 45Ca2+ uptake with an IC50 of 100 nM and (+)-S-202-791 enhanced K+ stimulated uptake with an EC50 of 80 nM. These results suggest that synaptosomal voltage sensitive calcium channels either are of a different type to those found in peripheral tissues and cells of neural origin or that expression of functional effects of dihydropyridines requires different experimental conditions to those used here.
