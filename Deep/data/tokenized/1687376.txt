Electroconvulsive shock-induced seizures elevate seizure thresholds in humans and interfere with kindling in animals; opioids may mediate the anticonvulsant mechanism. In a potential model of acute electroconvulsive shock in hippocampal slices, a high-intensity tetanus via the mossy fibers substantially delayed subsequent in vitro kindling through the Schaffer collaterals. Naloxone blocked this effect, implicating the opioid system in the antiepileptogenic properties of this model.
