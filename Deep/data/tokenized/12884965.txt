In order to test the role of mu and kappa opioid receptors (Mu opioid receptor (MOR) and Kappa opioid receptor (KOR)) in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning, we analyzed genetically engineered null mutant mice missing the functional MOR or KOR gene. Compared to wild-type mice, the homozygous MOR null mutants exhibited an impairment in the ultimate level of spatial learning as shown in two distinct tasks, the 8-arm radial-maze and the Morris water-maze. Control behaviors were normal. The learning impairment could be associated with the impairment we found in the maintenance of long-term potentiation in mossy fibers in CA3. In comparison, there was no impairment in spatial learning in our KOR mutants or in mossy fibers (mf) in CA3 region long-term potentiation (LTP). Our work suggests that the MOR may play a positive role in learning and memory by increasing LTP in CA3 neurons.
