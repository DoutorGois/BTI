Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) represents an important adaptation of CNS to sub-lethal ischemia, which results in increased tolerance of CNS to the lethal ischemia. Ischemia-induced mitochondrial apoptosis is considered to be an important event leading to neuronal cell death after cerebral blood flow arrest. In presented study, we have determined the effect of IPC on ischemia/reperfusion-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. Global brain ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion of vertebral arteries and temporal occlusion of carotid arteries for 15 min. Rats were preconditioned by 5 min of sub-lethal ischemia and 2 days later 15 min of lethal ischemia was induced. With respect to mitochondrial apoptosis initiation, translocation of p53 to mitochondria was observed in hippocampus but not in cerebral cortex. However, level of both apoptotic bax and anti-apoptotic bcl-xl in both hippocampal and cortical mitochondria was unchanged after global brain ischemia. Detection of genomic DNA fragmentation as well as Fluoro-Jade C staining showed that ischemia induces apoptosis in vulnerable CA1 layer of rat hippocampus. IPC abolished completely ischemia-induced translocation of p53 to mitochondria and had significant protective effect on ischemia-induced DNA fragmentation. In addition, significant decrease of Fluoro-Jade C positive cells was observed as well. Our results indicate that IPC abolished almost completely both initiation and execution of mitochondrial apoptosis induced by global brain ischemia.
