In experiments on mature and developing (3-4 weeks old) rats the influence was shown of neuroimmunization with summate antigens of hippocampal or neocortical tissue cytosolic fraction on short-term plasticity of hippocampal CA3 field potentials under dentate gyrus zone stimulation. An increase of paired facilitation and frequency potentiation was revealed in pyramidal layer responses of hippocampal tissue immunized animals. In case of immunization with neocortical antigens the changes were less expressed, had mainly the opposite direction and took place in the apical dendrites zone. In young animals besides antigen spectrum depending effects of neuroimmunization an earlier manifestation (in comparison with age norm) of some focal activity definitive properties was described. The suggestions are made about different localization of hippocampal or neocortical tissue immunization "targets" with possible preferential damage of intrahippocampal systems when using this structure antigens, and also about dependence of physiological consequences on the extent of target structure ontogenetic maturity.
