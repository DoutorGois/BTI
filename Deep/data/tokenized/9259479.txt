Previous data have shown that through dopamine D1 receptors serotonin and dopamine systems could be interdependent during development. In this study, we have analysed monoamine and metabolite levels in hippocampus, striatum and superior colliculus of puber male rats, which received 10 days of either prenatal or early postnatal D1 receptor stimulation with 0.03 mg/kg of the selective agonist SKF 38393. This substance induced a differential long-term and significant reduction in serotonin (5-HT) and/or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels, but it was dependent on the developing brain region. Norepinephrine (NE) levels were also reduced in superior colliculus, but only after early postnatal treatments. These results suggest that an abnormal stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors during sensitive stages of ontogeny may alter the development of 5-HT fibers innervating hippocampus and superior colliculus.
