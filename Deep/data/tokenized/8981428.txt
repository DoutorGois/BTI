We examined the regional and cellular distribution of presenilin-1 gene expression in the rat brain by in situ hybridization. Microscopic analysis demonstrated that presenilin-1 mRNA is predominantly expressed in areas such as the occipital cortex, the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus, thalamic nuclei and the cerebellar granular layer. The expression of presenilin-1 is mostly neuronal: only a weak hybridization signal was found in the corpus callosum and in the astrocytoma cell lines U373MG and U138MG.
