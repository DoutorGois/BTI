Phospholipase D (PL-D) activity per mg protein of whole homogenate increased 5.1 fold between Embryonic (E) day 17 and Postpartum (P) day 14 and slightly decreased by P 30 days. This was due to the decrease of PL-D activity of the P2 fraction. The PL-D activity of P2 and P3 fractions increased 11.2 and 6.1 fold respectively between E 17 and P 14. The 3 base exchange enzyme (BEE) activities per mg protein of whole homogenate increased up to P 14 or P 21 and then decreased. This decrease was greater in the P2 fraction and the P3 fraction increased after P 14. Brains from 1 day to 25 month old rats were dissected into 7 separate regions and both PL-D and BEE activities were measured. In adult rats, the hippocampus and hypothalamus had the highest PL-D activities while medulla + pons and cerebellum had the lowest PL-D activities. The developmental patterns of 5 regions except for hippocampus and hypothalamus were similar. PL-D activity in the hippocampus was maximum at P 7 followed by a steep decrease till P 30 suggesting that the PL-D activity of the hypothalamus develops later and that of the hippocampus develops earlier than any other region. The distributions of BEE activities were quite different from those of PL-D activities. In adult rats, the cerebellum had the highest activity while the striatum and medulla + pons had the lowest. The BEE activities of cerebellum were lowest at P 1 and showed steep increase during the next 2 weeks.
