Recent biochemical studies revealed that ric-8A encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for a subset of Galpha proteins. Ric-8 is a key component of a signaling network in C. elegans that regulates neurotransmitter secretion and also plays a role in centrosome-mediated events during early embryogenesis. Here we show that during the early development in mice (E9.5-E12.0) ric-8 (synembryn) is expressed in the developing nervous system such as the cranial ganglia, neural tube, sympathetic chain and dorsal root ganglia. Ric-8 is also found in the lens, vomeronasal organ, and endolymphatic sac. In adult brain, it is expressed in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum as well as in the pineal gland and ependymal layer.
