In this study, we investigated the differences in calbindin D-28k (CB), calretinin, (CR) and parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus of Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and Zucker lean control (ZLC) rats. In addition, we observed the effects of hypothyroidism on the levels of immunoreactivity of these proteins in ZDF rats. For this study, 7-week-old ZDF rats were used, and methimazole treatment was continued for 5 weeks to induce hypothyroidism. The animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks of age. ZDF rats showed increased blood glucose levels compared to those in ZLC rats. Methimazole intervention significantly reduced total and free T3 levels, and it ameliorated the increase of blood glucose levels in ZDF rats. In ZLC rats, CB, CR, and PV immunoreactivity was detected in regions of the hippocampus proper. In vehicle-treated ZDF rats, CB, CR, and PV immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in the hippocampus. However, in the methimazole-treated rats, CB, CR, and PV immunoreactivity was significantly increased compared to that in the vehicle-treated rats. These results suggest that hypothyroidism ameliorated the diabetes-induced reduction of CB, CR, and PV immunoreactivity in the hippocampus.
