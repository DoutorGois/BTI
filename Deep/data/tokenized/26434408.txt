Obesity is more frequent in bipolar disorder. Adipokines are associated with depression and obesity via the inflammatory process. Twenty-six DSM-IV patients with BD and 39 controls were enrolled to assess the relationship between serum leptin and adiponectin with hippocampal volumes. Among patients, there was a significant negative correlation between right hippocampal volume and serum leptin levels. This result sum for the hypothesis of a pro-inflammatory state associated with BD and the prevalent co-morbid obesity.
