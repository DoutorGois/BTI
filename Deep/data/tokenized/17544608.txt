PURPOSE: To demonstrate drop in brain ADC measurements from low to high b values; to evaluate the structural information provided based on those changes; and to discuss the anatomical reasons for ADC differences. METHODS: Four cerebral ROI (precuneus-PRC, hippocampus-HIP, and the genu-GCC and splenium-SCC of the corpus callosum-CC) were drawn for ADC measurements with low (1000) and high (3000) b-value DWI in 50 normal subjects. ANOVA and Bonferroni correction tested ADC differences between areas, between both hemispheres, between GCC and SCC, and between b-value related ADC drop within areas. Pearson test evaluated dependence of interhemispheric and intercallosum ADC measurements obtained with the same b-value, dependence between areas of intrazonal drop, and the interhemispheric and intercallosum dependence of intrazonal drop. RESULTS: ADCs differed between areas (P<.0001). Interhemispheric ADC only differed in PRC with low b-value (P<.027). No HIP asymmetries occurred regardless the b-value. ADC drop within PRC and HIP was similar but differed (P<.0001) from ADC drop within both CC ROI. ADC drop was also different between GCC and SCC (P<.0001). In PRC and HIP, ADC showed a significant interhemispheric and intrazonal dependence (P<.0001). There was no GCC to SCC ADC dependence. Intrazonal dependence in the CC was only significant in the SCC (P<.001). Interhemispheric dependence of intrazonal drop was significant (PRC P=.007; HIP P<.0001) but failed to reach significance in the CC. CONCLUSION: Low and high b-value measurements show different diffusion behaviours within different tissues, especially in a highly anisotropic structure as the corpus callosum. This fact can provide valuable information about brain structure and different diffusion compartments in clinical DWI.
