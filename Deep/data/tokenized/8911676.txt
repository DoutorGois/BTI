We investigated whether aging changed H+ homeostasis in hippocampal slices bathed in HEPES buffer. Intracellular pH in hippocampal slices from rats aged 26-27 months (7.06 +/- 0.02) was significantly lower compared with that in slices from rats aged 6-7 months (7.16 +/- 0.04). Age did not influence extracellular ph. Age-related reductions in intracellular pH may reflect altered pH regulation that potentially affects brain function and could contribute to the increased vulnerability of the aged brain to metabolic stress.
