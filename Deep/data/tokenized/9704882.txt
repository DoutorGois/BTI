The serotonin neuron system was studied using immunohistochemical and neurochemical techniques in zitter mutant rats aged 1-14 months, which are characterized by abnormal metabolism of superoxides. The morphology of the serotoninergic neuron system and the serotonin level in the zitter rat were compared to those of age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Up to age 4 month, the density and distribution of serotoninergic fibers in the zitter rat brain were similar to those of control rats. However, several serotoninergic fibers with abnormal morphology, characterized by swollen varicosities, were observed in the cerebral cortex and caudate putamen of 6-month-old zitter rats. The density and distribution of these fibers in other regions of the brain were similar to those of control rats. The abnormal serotoninergic fibers increased in number and extended into other regions of the brain such as the thalamus, hippocampus, and vestibular nucleus. On the other hand, the density of normal serotoninergic fibers decreased throughout the brain of the 14-month-old zitter rat. Abnormal serotoninergic fibers have also been reported in the brain of normal older (24 months) SD rats. Neurochemical analysis revealed lower levels of serotonin, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, in all cortical areas (prefrontal, parietal, and occipital cortices), the caudate putamen, and the hippocampus of 12-month-old zitter rats. Levels differed significantly in the parietal cortex and hippocampus between the zitter and SD rats. Based on the morphological and neurochemical similarities, the present results suggest that age-related degeneration of serotoninergic fibers occurs in the zitter rat brain. Furthermore, degeneration of serotoninergic fibers appears to be induced by superoxide species. Thus, the zitter rat may provide a good model for studying the neurotoxic effects of superoxide species on the serotoninergic neuron system.
