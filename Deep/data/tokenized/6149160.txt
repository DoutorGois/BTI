The regulation of immune reactions is maintained by a brain system consiting of rigid and versatile ("flexible") links. The main rigid link of this system is the posterior hypothalamic area. This area has a minimal latency and obvious reactions of single neuron activity, excitability, DC potential level. A correlation between the rigid and versatile links during separate phases of immune reaction, is shown. The discovered reaction depends on immune reactivity.
