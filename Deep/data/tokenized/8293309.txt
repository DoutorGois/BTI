The effects of the irreversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) antagonist paraoxon (Px) on hippocampal neurophysiology were investigated and compared to those of physostigmine in urethane-anaesthetized rabbits. Hippocampal CA1 EEG signals were analyzed by power spectra. Following intracarotid administration, the two drugs induced a similar fundamental low-frequency theta power peak while the appearance of a second theta harmonic was commonly found under Px. Again, inhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells firing was significantly more pronounced after Px injection than after physostigmine. A potent inhibitory action was also described following local Px iontophoretic application. However, a discrepancy appeared between the effects of Px and the classical cholinergic drugs (acetylcholine, physostigmine). The results indicate that Px and physostigmine have a rather similar influence on the septo-hippocampal pathway and support suggestions that Px could act within local hippocampal circuitry through other systems than the cholinergic system exclusively.
