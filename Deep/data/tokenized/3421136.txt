After local administration into the midbrain reticular formation of an acetylcholinesterase reactivator--Pralidoxime, a significant decrease of intensity of hippocampal theta rhythm induced by previous inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by DFP was observed already after 10 min. This result suggests that cholinergic structures are localized in midbrain reticular formation and that they play a role in the origin of hippocampal theta rhythm.
