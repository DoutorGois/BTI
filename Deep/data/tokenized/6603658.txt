Corticotropin releasing factor in concentrations of 15 to 250 nanomoles per liter increased the spontaneous discharge frequency and decreased the size of hyperpolarizations after burst discharges in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampal slices. Concentrations greater than 250 nanomoles per liter also depolarized the cells. These excitatory actions of corticotropin releasing factor may involve a novel calcium-dependent process.
