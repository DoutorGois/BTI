In conditions of stimulation of adrenergic mechanisms with ephedrine, there was an improvement of the memory engrams reproduction (MER). Blockade of the alpha-adrenergic system by pyrroxan more expressively impeded reproduction of a passive defensive habit in comparison with the action of a beta-adrenolytic, the obsidan. Stimulation of MER processes was accompanied by a parallel activation of glucose-6-phosphate- and 6-phosphategluconatedehydrogenases of pentose path in the tissues of the frontal area of the cerebral cortex and pons Varolii. Blockade of alpha-adrenoreceptors suppressed the activity of the given enzymes in the same structures, while the obsidan suppressed the dehydrogenases of the pentose path only in the frontal zone of the neocortex.
