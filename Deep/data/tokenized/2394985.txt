Vasopressin (AVP) immunoreactivity in cells and projections of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and medial amygdaloid nucleus (MA) depends on gonadal steroids. In addition, the AVP projections from the BST show denser fiber staining in males than in females. To study whether these differences depend on different hormone levels in adulthood, male and female rats were gonadectomized and similarly treated with testosterone for 4 weeks prior to sacrifice. Immunocytochemistry showed that males had significantly more AVP-immunoreactive (AVP-IR) cells in the BST and significantly denser AVP-IR projections from this nucleus to the lateral septum, lateral habenular nucleus, and periaqueductal central gray than did females. The number of AVP-IR cells in the MA nucleus was not statistically different, but denser AVP-IR fiber networks were found in the MA and ventral hippocampus, which receives its input from the MA. No differences were found in the anteroventral portion of the periventricular nucleus and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus that receive their AVP innervation from the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These results indicate that the sex difference in the steroid-sensitive AVP pathways depends on other factors besides circulating hormone levels in adulthood.
