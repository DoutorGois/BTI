The present study was undertaken in order to investigate whether dearomatized white spirit induces indices of oxidative stress in subcellular fractions of hemisphere, hippocampus, kidney and liver tissue of rats exposed to 0, 400 and 800 ppm 6 hr/day, 7 days a week for 3 weeks. The results show that white spirit is a strong in vivo inducer of oxidative stress in subcellular fractions of brain, kidney and liver. In the liver there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and a decrease in glutamine synthetase activity. In the kidney there was a statistically significant decrease in the rate of ROS generation. In the hemisphere there was a statistically significant increase in the level of reduced glutathione. In the hippocampus there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of ROS generation. However, in vitro addition of dearomatized white spirit had no effect on the rate of cerebrocortical P2 fraction ROS generation. The results suggest that cumulative oxidative damage may be an underlying mechanism of dearomatized white spirit-induced neurotoxicity and that various regions of the brain may respond differently.
