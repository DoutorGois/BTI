An anti-tau monoclonal antibody tau-2 was demonstrated to react with the cells which characteristically appeared in the subcortical nuclei of certain neurodegenerative disorders. These cells had rod-like cell bodies and elongated processes, whose morphology was consistent with that of reactive microglia (tau-2 positive microglia-like cells; TPMC). TPMC were diffusely scattered in the subcortical nuclei, especially the putamen, irrelevant to focal tissue injury such as infarcts and amyloid deposits. TPMC were positively immunostained with anti-ferritin antibody, but negatively with LN3, anti-GFAP, other kinds of anti-tau and anti-neurofilament antibodies. TPMC were found in some cases of Alzheimer type dementia and diffuse Lewy body disease, but not in the cases of Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease and control without neurological disorder. Similar microglia-like cells were found around infarctic foci and amyloid cores of senile plaques, regardless of the disorder. They were, however, different from TPMC in that they were positively immunostained with LN3.
