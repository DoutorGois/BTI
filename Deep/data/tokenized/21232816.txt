Previous studies have shown that messenger RNA (mRNA) of the dynamin-binding protein (DNMBP), a scaffold protein regulating actin cytoskeleton and synaptic vesicle pools, is lower in neuropathologically-confirmed Alzheimer's brains. Here we investigated whether a deficit in long term memory formation during physiological aging is also associated with lower DNMBP expression. Hippocampal DNMBP mRNA was quantified by quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) following inhibitory avoidance task in aged (26- to 27-month-old) rats that, according to memory performance, were ranked as good responders (GR) and bad responders (BR), in adult (3-month-old), late-adult (19-month-old), and aged (26-27-month-old) naive animals. We found that DNMBP mRNA levels were significantly higher in naive adults versus late adult and aged naive rats, in GR versus BR, and in pooled GR and BR versus aged-matched controls. Our data provide the first evidence that hippocampal DNMBP mRNA expression is reduced during physiological aging, and suggest that the capability to increase the expression of this mRNA may be a requirement for preserving long term memory formation during aging.
