Synaptic dysfunction during early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is triggered by soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers that interact with NMDA receptors (NMDARs). We previously showed that Abeta induces synaptic protein loss through NMDARs, albeit through undefined mechanisms. Accordingly, we here examined the contribution of individual NMDAR subunits to synaptotoxicity and demonstrate that Abeta exerts differential effects on the levels and distribution of GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDAR in dendrites. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with Abeta1-40 (10 muM, 1 h) induced a significant increase of dendritic and synaptic GluN2B puncta densities with parallel decreases in the puncta densities of denritic and synaptic pTyr1472-GluN2B. Conversely, Abeta significantly decreased dendritic and synaptic GluN2A and dendritic pTyr1325-GluN2A puncta densities and increased synaptic pTyr1325-GluN2A puncta densities. Unexpectedly, Abeta treatment resulted in a significant reduction of GluN2B and pTyr1472-GluN2B protein levels but did not influence GluN2A and pTyr1325-GluN2A levels. These results show that Abeta exerts complex and distinct regulatory effects on the trafficking and phosphorylation of GluN2A and GluN2B, as well as on their localization within synaptic and non-synaptic sites. Increased understanding of these early events in Abeta-induced synaptic dysfunction is likely to be important for the development of timely preventive and therapeutic interventions.
