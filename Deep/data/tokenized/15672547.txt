In the present study we investigated a potential mechanism by which high sugar (HS) and high fat (HF) diets could affect acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The treatment with HS and HF diet was done for six months on male and female rats. The results showed decreased hippocampal AChE activity in male and females receiving HS and HF diets (HS 24% and 36%; HF 38% and 32%, males and females, respectively; P < 0.05). The activity in the cerebral cortex was reduced in males (49 and 40%) and females (19 and 17%) (P < 0.05) on HS and HF diets, respectively. In the hypothalamus AChE activity was decreased on HS diet in males (46%) and female (25%) (P < 0.05) and also on HF diet in males (34%) and females (21%) (P < 0.05). However, in the cerebellum no changes in AChE activity were observed. These results indicate that HS and HF diets produced mainly inhibition in acetylcholine degradation. It probably indicates a chronic alteration induced by these diets on the cholinergic system.
