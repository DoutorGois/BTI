Peptide-like compounds containing an arginine have been shown to bind and stabilize the central helix of the Alzheimer's disease related amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in an alpha-helical conformation, thereby delaying its aggregation into cytotoxic species. Here we study a novel Abeta targeting ligand AEDabDab containing the triamino acid, N(gamma)-(2-aminoethyl)-2,4-diaminobutanoic (AEDab) acid. The new AEDab triamino acid carries an extra positive charge in the side chain and is designed to be incorporated into a ligand AEDabDab where the AEDab replaces an arginine moiety in a previously developed ligand Pep1b. This is done in order to increase the Abeta-ligand interaction, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the stability of the Abeta central helix in the presence of the AEDabDab ligand shows further stabilization of the helical conformation of Abeta compared to the previously reported Pep1b as well as compared to the AEOrnDab ligand containing an N(delta)-(2-aminoethyl)-2,5-diaminopentanoic acid unit which has an additional methylene group. To evaluate the effect of the AEDabDab ligand on the Abeta neurotoxicity the AEDab triamino acid building block is synthesized by reductive alkylation of N-protected-glycinal with alpha-amino-protected diaminobutanoic acid, and the Abeta targeting ligand AEDabDab is prepared by solid-phase synthesis starting with attachment of glutarate to the Wang support. Replacement of the arginine residue by the AEDab triamino acid resulted in an improved capability of the ligand to prevent the Abeta1-42 induced reduction of gamma (gamma) oscillations in hippocampal slice preparation.
