The hippocampus receives two streams of information, spatial and nonspatial, via major afferent inputs from the medial (MEC) and lateral entorhinal cortexes (LEC). The MEC and LEC projections in the temporoammonic pathway are topographically organized along the transverse-axis of area CA1. The potential for functional segregation of area CA1, however, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrated differential novelty-induced c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA1 corresponding to topographic projections of MEC and LEC inputs. We found that, while novel place exposure induced a uniform c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA1, novel object exposure primarily activated the distal half of CA1 neurons. In hippocampal slices, we observed distinct presynaptic properties between LEC and MEC terminals, and application of either DA or NE produced a largely selective influence on one set of inputs (LEC). Finally, we demonstrated that differential c-Fos expression along the transverse axis of area CA1 was largely abolished by an antagonist of neuromodulatory receptors, clozapine. Our results suggest that neuromodulators can control topographic TA projections allowing the hippocampus to differentially encode new information along the transverse axis of area CA1.
