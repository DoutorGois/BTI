Na(+)-dependent binding of L-glutamate in cortical and hippocampal synaptic membranes from hyperammonemic rats was compared to corresponding data in the controls. In hippocampal membranes, repeated hyperammonemia resulted in a 13% and 18% decrease in binding in 20-day-old and 50-day-old rats, respectively. The decrease was statistically significant (P < 0.05) in the older animals and Scatchard analysis revealed a 19% reduction in the number of binding sites without any changes in the affinity. Within the hippocampal formation, the binding in the dentate gyrus was the most sensitive to hyperammonemia where a 21% decrease was found (P < 0.01), whilst the decline of binding in CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus proper was not significant. The results support the idea that excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate during hyperammonemia is a consequence not only of its increased release, but also of the blocking of Na(+)-dependent binding of glutamate to specific uptake sites.
