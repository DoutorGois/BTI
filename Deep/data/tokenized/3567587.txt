We investigated the possible importance of stimulus train frequency for the induction and magnitude of long-term synaptic plasticity in the perforant path-granule cell pathway. Under the same experimental conditions, low- (15 Hz) or high-frequency (400 Hz) stimulation could elicit a profound long-term depression (LTD), or typical long-term potentiation (LTP), of the population spike amplitude, excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude and spike onset latency. In addition, changes in the relationship between the EPSP and population spike amplitude indicated that granule cell excitability was enhanced during LTP and reduced during LTD. LTD occurred primarily after low-frequency stimulation (5 of 6 cases), and was always accompanied by striking changes in the EEG, most notably a biphasic slow potential. While the EEG changes were confined to the first 5 min after the tetanus, LTD lasted from 1 to 4 h. The nature of the EEG events is still unclear, it is suggested that they may represent a spreading depression-like episode. Finally, we found that LTP evoked by high-frequency stimulation was larger and generally reached peak magnitude faster than when it followed low-frequency stimulation. A possible mechanism and role for hippocampal LTD is proposed.
