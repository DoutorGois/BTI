The excitability of Schaffer collateral terminal regions in the CA1 area of rat hippocampal slices is usually increased and occasionally decreased for about 300 ms following the activation of the same or other nearby fibers. The increased excitability appears to be at least partly Ca2+ dependent. Exposure of the slices to slightly elevated extracellular K+ levels (4.5 mM) increased while exposure to 12 mM K+ decreased the excitability of Schaffer collateral terminal regions. These results indicate that presynaptic terminals in hippocampus interact with each other possibly through a build-up in extracellular K+ or secondary to the release of transmitters.
