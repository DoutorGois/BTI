Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus can be modulated and prolonged by emotional/motivational influences when concurrently activated. A similar effect on LTP can be obtained by stimulating the amygdala, suggesting that this limbic structure might be part of the neural system involved in behavioural reinforcement. To confirm this we have performed a series of experiments in which the basolateral amygdala was either temporary inactivated by injection of lidocaine or permanently lesioned electrolytically. Both manipulations completely blocked the reinforcing effect of a motivational stimulus (drinking after 24-h deprivation) on LTP at the perforant pathway-dentate gyrus synapses, whilst leaving intact the non-reinforced potentiation. These results demonstrate that the basolateral amygdala is a key structure within the system involved in the modulatory interaction between the affective status of the animal and the mechanisms of functional plasticity.
