It has been found in experiments on rats with chronically implanted electrodes that water-deprived rats as well as those under the conflict-punishment conditions demonstrated considerable activation of the hippocampal theta-rhythm. Phenazepam decreased the hippocampal theta-rhythm in water-deprived rats, whereas electric punishment did not produce any appreciable changes in the frequency spectrum on the electrogram. The data obtained suggest that an anticonflict (anxiolytic) effect of benzodiazepines is caused by the regulatory influence on the theta-rhythm in the hippocamp.
