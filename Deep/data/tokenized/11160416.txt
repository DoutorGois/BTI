The hippocampus is one of the brain regions involved in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Extensive studies have unveiled how information is processed within this system. However, the mechanisms by which hippocampal activity is translated into action remain unsolved. One important target of hippocampal projections is the nucleus accumbens, which has been described as the motivation-to-action interface. Previous experiments indicate that these projections can control information processing in this region by setting neurons into a depolarized state. Here, we report that membrane potential transitions in nucleus accumbens neurons are correlated with electrical activity in the ventral hippocampus, suggesting that hippocampal neural activity can determine ensembles of active accumbens neurons.
