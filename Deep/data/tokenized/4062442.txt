The effects of 2-chloroadenosine (2-CLA), a metabolically stable analogue of adenosine, on amygdaloid and hippocampal kindled seizures were examined in rats. Intraperitoneal injections of 2-CLA, 1.0 mg/kg, did not modify the evolution of either amygdaloid or hippocampal kindled seizures. 2-CLA in the dose of 3.0 mg/kg shortened the duration of both behavioral and electrographic convulsive manifestations while the dose of 5.0 mg/kg completely blocked the evolution of the kindled seizures. The results indicate that purinergic mechanisms are involved in the maintenance and modulation of the seizure threshold within the limbic system.
