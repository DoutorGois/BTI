The functional relationships of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and entorhinal area were studied in cats. The dorsal hippocampus was shown to suppress the electric activity and evoked responses to entorhinal stimulation in the ventral hippocampus and other structures. The dorsal hippocampus inhibits evoked responses to skin stimulation in entorhinal area and ventral hippocampus. The ventral hippocampus produced opposite effects. The functional differences of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus suggest different connections with entorhinal area.
