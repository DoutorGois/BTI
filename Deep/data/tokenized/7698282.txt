To investigate the properties of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesizing enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), in the brain and the pancreatic islets of the rat, GABA concentration in the brain and the pancreatic islets was measured after intraperitoneal administration of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MP) at 25 mg/kg. 60 min after the administration of 3-MP, GABA concentration in the hypothalamus, the superior colliculus and the hippocampus of the brain decreased by 20-30% and in the pancreatic islets by 35%. The concentration in the pancreatic acini did not change. Western blotting showed that GAD activity in the pancreatic islets decreased after administration of 3-MP compared to the control. The activity of GAD in the pancreatic islets as well as brain can be modified by a convulsant, in this case 3-MP. These results suggest the properties of GAD may be similar in the pancreatic islets and brain.
