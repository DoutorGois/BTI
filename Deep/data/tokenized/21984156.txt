OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of venlafaxine on the cognitive impairment of learning and memory in rats with post-stroke depression (PSD) and to investigate its relationship with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus. METHODS: Fifty male adult SD rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and three treatment groups (5,10, 20 mg*kg(-1) venlafaxine) with ten in each group. After the procedure of selective cerebral right middle artery embolism, a paradigm of continuous 3-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to induce PSD. Along with the course of CUMS the peritoneal injection at different dose levels of venlafaxine were performed once a day in PSD rats in a fixed time interval. Morris water maze test was applied to assess the spatial learning and memory function and immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the change of BDNF expression. RESULTS: The learning function decreased significantly in PSD rats compared with the control (P<0.05), as well as in spatial exploring time (14.2 s +/- 4.8 s Compared with 45.9 s +/- 4.5 s) and frequency of spanning platform (1.3 +/- 0.3 Compared with 8.3 +/- 1.1). Moreover,very fewer BDNF positive cells were found in CA3 area of hippocampus in model group in comparison with the control group (9.8 +/- 3.2 Compared with 18.5 +/- 4.7). After different dosage of venlafaxine treatment, the BDNF expression and cognition increased markedly. CONCLUSION: Venlafaxine can improve PSD-induced learning and memory dysfunction, possibly through the enhancement of the BDNF level in the CA3 area of hippocampus.
