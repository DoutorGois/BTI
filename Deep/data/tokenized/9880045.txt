Galanin (GAL) has been proposed to be an inhibitory modulator of cholinergic memory pathways because it acts within the hippocampus to inhibit the release and antagonize the postsynaptic actions of acetylcholine. Here we have used: 1) slice binding and quantitative autoradiography to assess the density and occupancy of GAL receptors; and 2) in situ hybridization histochemistry to assess expression of the GALR1 receptor subtype in the ventral hippocampus of 3-month-old and 21-month-old Fischer 344 male rats. We detected a small but significant (p < or = 0.0003) age-related reduction in 125I-GAL binding-site density in the ventral hippocampus and entorhinal cortex under standard binding conditions. Post-hoc analysis indicated that this reduction with age persisted in the CA1 radiatum and entorhinal cortex following GTP-induced desaturation to unmask pre-existent GAL receptors occupied by endogenous ligand. It was not associated with a significant change in peak GALR1 gene expression in the hippocampus. Because a portion of GAL receptors in this region have been postulated to function as presynaptic auto-receptors on cholinergic fiber terminals, the reduction in GAL binding sites with age may be a consequence of age-related alterations in GAL receptor expression by basal forebrain cholinergic neurons which project to the ventral hippocampus.
