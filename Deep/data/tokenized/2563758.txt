The effect of treatment with L-3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) on the levels of pyroglutamyl peptidase I and pyroglutamyl peptidase II in rat brain regions, pituitary, and serum was studied. Pyroglutamyl peptidase I cleaves pyroglutamyl peptides such as thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, neurotensin, and bombesin, whereas pyroglutamyl peptidase II appears to be specific for TRH. Acute administration of T3 did not affect pyroglutamyl peptidase I in any of the regions studied, whereas pyroglutamyl peptidase II was significantly elevated in frontal cortex and pituitary. Treatment with T3 for 10 or 14 days significantly elevated pyroglutamyl peptidase I in pituitary, hypothalamus, olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and thalamus. Chronic T3 treatment elevated pyroglutamyl peptidase II in frontal cortex and in serum. These studies demonstrate regulation of neuropeptide degrading enzymes by thyroid hormones in vivo. This regulation may play a role in the negative feedback control of thyroid status by T3.
