Variations in calcium alimentation influence the development of high blood pressure in genetic hypertensive rats. Different calcium feeding and changes in parathyroid hormone status cause altered cAMP-content in specific brain areas. All animals with high calcium diet show significant elevated cAMP-content in the locus coeruleus, irrespective of parathyroid status. These findings support the hypothesis that elevated cAMP-concentrations reflect an increased depressor activity of the locus coeruleus.
