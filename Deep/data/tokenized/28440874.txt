Estrogen receptors have protective effects against ischemic brain injury. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have yet to be well studied. Given that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) can reduce cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that estrogen receptors-mediated protective effects against ischemia-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption involve inhibition of GSK3. Thus, we evaluated GSK3 expression in the brain of ovariectomized female rats, and examined the effects of intracerebroventricular pre-treatments of SB216763, GSK3 inhibitor, on BBB permeability following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We also examined the role of specific estrogen receptor subtype in regulation of GSK3 expression and BBB permeability after MCAO. We found that ovariectomized female rats exhibited increased mRNA levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), and increased protein levels of GSK3beta but not GSK3alpha in brain cortical areas. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular pre-treatments of SB216763 dose-dependently attenuated brain infarction volume, brain water contents, neurological deficits, and BBB disruption, and increased tight junction protein ZO-1 and occludin expression at 24 h following MCAO. Finally, activation of ERbeta but not ERalpha dose-dependently decreased GSK3beta expression at 24 h following MCAO. This was associated with increased tight junction protein expression and improved neurological scores. Thus, our study suggested that activation of ERbeta may protect against brain ischemia-induced BBB disruption by inhibiting GSK3beta-mediated signaling.
