We have previously shown that a single dose of PCP produces a dose-related increase in NMDA-sensitive 3H-glutamate binding in CA1 of hippocampus 24 hours later, and some regional changes in kainate binding. Here we report that dizocilpine (MK 801) (0.1 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg), a selective agonist at the PCP receptor and a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA, produces a similar increase in NMDA-sensitive glutamate and kainate receptor binding in hippocampus 24 hours after a dose. These observations support the conclusion that blockade of glutamate-mediated transmission at the NMDA receptor selectively increases NMDA-sensitive glutamate receptor binding in CA1 of hippocampus and kainate binding in CA3 and dentate gyrus at putatively delayed time points. Several additional areas outside of hippocampus also showed receptor changes at 24 hours after MK801.
