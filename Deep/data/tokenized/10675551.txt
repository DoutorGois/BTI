Fatty acid utilization is initiated by fatty acid-CoA ligase, which converts free fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters. We have cloned previously the human long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 (FACL4), which is a central enzyme in controlling the free arachidonic acid level in cells and thereby regulating eicosanoid production. We report here the expression of this gene in tissues, particularly in different parts of the brain. We found that FACL4 encoded a 75 kDa enzyme and that there was a modified translation product expressed in the brain. FACL4 was expressed in early stages of development with a significant amount of FACL4 mRNA detected in an E7 mouse embryo. In addition, FACL4 was highly expressed in both adult and newborn mouse brain especially in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus and the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 in hippocampus, and the granular cell layer and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum.
