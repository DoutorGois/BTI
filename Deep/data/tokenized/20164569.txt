Colostrinin (CLN), a complex mixture of proline-rich polypeptides derived from colostrums, can alleviate cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's disease patients. The molecular basis of the action of CLN has been studied in vitro using human neuroblastoma cell lines. The aim of the present study was to use quantitative immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting to investigate the ability of CLN to relieve amyloid-beta (Abeta)-induced cytotoxicity in rat primary hippocampal neuronal cells. Our data confirm that CLN alleviates the effect of Abeta-induced cytotoxicity and causes a significant reduction in the elevated levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD1.
