An increase in the medium size of mitochondria in synapses, postsynaptic dendrites and neurons of the dorsal hippocampus was recorded after single and 3fold intracortical injection of penicillin (1000 IE) to rabbits. An increase in the size of vacuoles was found in astrocytes, synapses and postsynaptic dendrites. Mitochondrial hypertrophy indicates the energy output intensification in the form of ATP, while the increased size of vacuoles points to a greater permeability. The changes disclosed evidence an activation of synapses, postsynaptic dendrites and neurons.
