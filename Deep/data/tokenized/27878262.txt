Borna disease virus (BDV) is a neurotropic RNA virus that infects the limbic system of mammals and results in behavioral disorders. The hippocampus is a core region in the limbic system, which contributes to memory and learning and is important in the regulation of emotion. However, no validated microRNA housekeeping genes have yet been identified in BDVinfected rat primary hippocampal neurons. Proper normalization is key in accurate miRNA expression analysis. The present study used reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) to evaluate the expression stability of 10 commonly used reference genes [miR92a, 5S, U6, miR103, miR101a, miR-let-7a, miR16, E2 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), U87 and miR191] in BDVinfected rat hippocampal neurons and noninfected controls across 12 days postinfection. The data was analyzed by four statistical algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative DeltaCt method. Subsequently, the most suitable reference genes (miR101a and U87) and the least suitable (snoRNA) were determined by the RankAggreg package. miR155 was selected as a standard by which to evaluate the most and least suitable reference genes. When normalized to the most stable reference gene there were significant differences between the two groups. However, when the data were normalized to the less stably expressed gene, the results were not significant. miR101a was recommended as a suitable reference gene for BDV-infected rat primary hippocampal neurons.
