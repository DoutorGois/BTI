Memory is fundamental to everyday life, and cognitive impairments resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) have devastating effects on TBI survivors. A contributing component to memory impairments caused by TBI is alteration in the neural circuits associated with memory function. In this review, we aim to bring together experimental findings that characterize behavioral memory deficits and the underlying pathophysiology of memory-involved circuits after TBI. While there is little doubt that TBI causes memory and cognitive dysfunction, it is difficult to conclude which memory phase, i.e., encoding, maintenance, or retrieval, is specifically altered by TBI. This is most likely due to variation in behavioral protocols and experimental models. Additionally, we review a selection of experimental treatments that hold translational potential to mitigate memory dysfunction following injury.
