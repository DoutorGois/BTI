We describe the onset and the expansion of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) expression in the intermediate zone of embryonic mouse cerebral cortex between embryonic days (E)11.5 and 18.5, and on postnatal day 1. Using in situ hybridisation with a digoxigenin-labeled probe, SDF-1 mRNA was detectable by E 12.5 in a small area of the intermediate zone just dorsal to the pallial-subpallial boundary. During the following days, SDF-1 expression extended towards the dorso-lateral pallium, and then the hippocampus and cortical hem. The position of the SDF-1 positive cells within the intermediate zone was closely correlated with the stream of tangentially migrating cells carrying the polysialylated form of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM). However, whereas these cells form a ventro-dorsal stream passing from the subpallium into the pallium, SDF-1 was not detectable on the ventral side of the pallial-subpallial boundary at any of the developmental stages studied. By E 16.5, the intensity of SDF-1 hybridisation signal in the intermediate zone decreased, to become undetectable by E 18.5.
