OBJECTIVE: A model in neonatal rats was established to study pathophysiology of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. METHODS: 7-9 day old Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral carotied artery ligation followed by hypoxic state for 3 hours (10% O2 + 90% N2, at 37 degrees C). Magnesium sulfate (0.5 mg/gBW) and ligustrazin (0.1 mg/gBW) was separately given a 30 min before hypoxia. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malonic dialdehyde (MDA) in the cerebral cortex and serum MDA were measured immediately after hypoxia. Neuropathologic examination was made in 4 weeks after hypoxia. RESULTS: It was found that SOD and MDA in the cerebral cortex and serum MDA in the hypoxicischemic group were significantly increased in comparision with the normal control group (P < 0.01), and that all these parameters either in the magnesium sulfate group or in the ligustrazin group were lower than in the hypoxic-ischemic group (P < 0.05). The hypoxic-ischemic group showed that there were neuronal degenerations in the gray matter, hippocampus and cerebellum which were reduced in the two treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that oxide free radical formation is one of the pathogenic factors of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage and magnesium sulfate and ligustrazin reduce hypoxicischemic brain damage due to indirect anti-oxidation.
