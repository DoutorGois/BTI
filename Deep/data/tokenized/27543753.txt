The hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are crucial for learning and memory-guided behavior, but neural mechanisms underlying their coordinated operation are currently unclear. Recent evidence indicates that different network activity patterns, each marked by local field potential signatures, play distinct roles in mediating long-range interactions between these regions to support memory processing. We propose that network patterns underlie multiple communication modes between these regions, and support different cognitive demands during ongoing behavior. Network patterns may represent a fundamental neurophysiological mechanism through which the hippocampus communicates memory-related information with other regions. Dissecting the causal roles of these network patterns in cognitive processes has the potential to delineate a coherent and dynamic functional organization across hippocampal and prefrontal networks during memory-guided behavior.
