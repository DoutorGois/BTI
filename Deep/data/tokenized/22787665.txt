Prolonged or recurrent seizures that result in significant morbidity and mortality are referred to as status epilepticus (SE). Benzodiazepines, which are positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors, are effective agents for treating SE; however, they become ineffective when seizures are prolonged. This is in part due to seizure-induced plasticity of synaptic GABAA receptors present on principal neurons of the hippocampus. There is post-translational modification and altered trafficking of synaptic receptors during SE whereas the function of extrasynaptic receptors is preserved. Novel therapies of SE could be designed to target synaptic receptor trafficking or extrasynaptic GABAA receptors.
