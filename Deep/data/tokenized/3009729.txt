Rat hippocampal neurons grown in dissociated cell culture were studied in a medium containing 1 microM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 25 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA), which eliminated the Na+ and K+ conductances normally activated by depolarizing current injections. In this medium depolarizing current pulses evoked depolarizing regenerative potentials and afterhyperpolarizations in most cells. Both of these events were blocked by close application of Co2+ or Cd2+. These events resemble Ca2+ spikes reported previously in hippocampal pyramidal cells. The membrane potential at which these Ca2+ spikes could be triggered and the rheobase current necessary were dependent on the potential at which the cell was conditioned: the more depolarized the holding potential, the more negative the absolute potential at which a spike could be triggered and the less rheobase current required. The duration of these Ca2+ spikes was also sensitive to the holding potential: the more depolarized the holding level, the longer the duration of the triggered spikes. The amplitude and duration of the Ca2+ spikes were enhanced in a reversible manner by 0.5-1.0 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) delivered in the vicinity of the cell. Two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis of cells studied in TTX, TEA-containing medium revealed an inward current response that peaked in 25-50 ms during depolarizing commands. This response first became detectable during commands to -30 mV. It peaked in amplitude during commands to -10 mV and was enhanced in medium containing elevated [Ca2+]0. It was blocked by either 20 mM Mg2+, 0.2 mM Cd2+, 5 mM Co2+, or 5 mM Mn2+. These results have led us to identify this inward current response as ICa2+. 4-AP enhanced the magnitude and duration of ICa2+ independent of the drug's depressant effects on a transient K+ current also observed under these same experimental conditions. In many but not all cells the Ca2+ spike was followed by a long-lasting hyperpolarization associated with an increase in membrane conductance. This was blocked by Co2+. Under voltage clamp ICa2+ was followed by a slowly developing outward current response that was attenuated by Co2+ or Cd2+. These properties observed under current- and voltage-clamp recording conditions are superficially similar to those previously reported for Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance mechanisms (IC) recorded in these and other membranes. Long-lasting tail currents following activation of IC inverted in the membrane potential range for the K+ equilibrium potential found in these cells.
