PURPOSE: AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptors (AMPARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmissions in the mammalian brain. A series of phosphorylation sites have been predicted or identified and knowledge on phosphorylations is mandatory for understanding receptor biology and functions. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Immunoprecipitation from extracted hippocampal rat proteins was carried out using an antibody against the AMPAR GluA1 subunit, followed by identification of GluA1 and binding partners by MS. Bands from SDS-PAGE were picked, peptides were generated by trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion and identified by MS/MS (LTQ Orbitrap Velos). RESULTS: Using Mascot as a search engine, phosphorylation sites S506, S645, S720, S849, S863, S895, T858, Y228, Y419, and T734 were found on GluA1; S357, S513, S656, S727, T243, T420, T741, Y 143, Y301,Y426 on GluA2; S301, S516, S657, S732, T222, and T746 were observed on GluA3; and S514, S653 was phosphorylated on GluA4. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A series of additional protein modifications were observed and in particular, tyrosine and tryptophan nitrations on GluA1 were detected that may raise questions on additional regulation mechanisms for AMPARs in addition to phosphorylations. The findings are relevant for interpretation of previous work and design of future studies using AMPAR serving as a resource for neuroscience research and indeed, phosphorylations and PTMs per se would have to be respected when neuropathological and neurological disorders are being studied.
