In unrestrained rabbits, the majority of dorsal hippocampus' neurons changed their firing rate immediately after cessation of electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus. Microionophoretic application of cortisol inhibited the excitatory responses selectively and intensified the inhibitory responses unspecifically. Cortisol seems to affect the hippocampal neurons via different mechanisms depending on the level of their excitability and the transmitters involving them into the integrative function of the positive reinforcement.
