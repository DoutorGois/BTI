BACKGROUND: beta-adrenoceptor activation in the hippocampus is sufficient to induce heterosynaptic long-term potentiation of perforant path input to the dentate gyrus. However, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest the plasticity effects of beta-adrenoceptor activation may vary depending on the level of receptor activation. METHODS: The present experiments use an in vivo model concurrently infusing differing concentrations of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol (ISO; 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 mumol/L in aCSF; 1 muL over 12.5 min) in the dentate gyrus, while monitoring changes in the perforant path-evoked potential at the same site. RESULTS: Long-term depression (LTD) of fEPSP slope was elicited by 0.1 mumol/L ISO. Higher doses did not alter fEPSP slope. Maximal long-term potentiation of the perforant path-evoked population spike (183% >3 h) occurred at 10 mumol/L ISO. Transient depression of spike amplitude occurred at 0.1 mumol/L ISO. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate concentration-dependent effects of beta-adrenoceptor activation on the perforant path-evoked potential. Long-term depression and long-term potentiation of perforant path-evoked responses are variably elicited as a function of the degree of receptor activation.
