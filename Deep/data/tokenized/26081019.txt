Early postnatal propofol administration has potential detrimental effects on hippocampal synaptic development and memory. Therapeutic method is still lack due to unknown mechanisms. In this study, a 7-day propofol protocol was applied to model anesthesia in neonatal mice. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (Pten) inhibitor bisperoxovanadium (bpV) was pre-applied before propofol to study its potential protection. After propofol application, Pten level increased while phospho-AKT (p-AKT) (Ser473) decreased in dorsal hippocampus. Interestingly, i.p. injection of Pten inhibitor reversed the decrease of p-AKT. Two months after administration, basal synaptic transmission, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory were reduced in propofol-administrated mice. By contrast, i.p. injection of Pten inhibitor at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day before propofol reversed the detrimental effects due to propofol application. Consistently, bpV injection also reversed propofol application-induced decrease of synaptic plasticity-related proteins, including p-CamKIIalpha, p-PKA and postsynaptic density protein 95. Taken together, our results demonstrate that bpV injection could reverse early propofol exposure-induced decrease of memory and hippocampal LTP. bpV might be a potential therapeutic for memory impairment after early propofol postnatal application.
