G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER-1) plays important roles in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. However, protective effects of GPER-1 on blood-brain barrier (BBB) after ischemic stroke have not been determined. The aim of present study was to determine whether GPER-1 activation ameliorates BBB permeability in ovariectomized rats with induced global cerebral ischemia (GCI). GCI was induced by 4-vessel occlusion for 20 min followed by 24 h reperfusion period. The GPER-1 agonist (G1) was bilaterally administered immediately upon reperfusion by intracerebroventricular (icv) injection. We found that the GPER-1 agonist could significantly decrease immunoglobulin G (IgG) extravasation and increase the levels of tight junctions (occludin and claudin-5) in the CA1 at 24 h of reperfusion after GCI. Further, protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) was significantly decreased in the ischemic CA1 by G1. Our results suggest that GPER-1 activation reduce tight junctions disruption via inhibition of VEGF-A expression after ischemic injury.
