We present a 5-year-old boy with Landau-Kleffner syndrome, whose clinical manifestations were very similar to cases previously reported in the literature. CT and MRI scan failed to document any morphological abnormalities of his brain. However, high resolution rCBF imaging by HMPAO and SPECT demonstrated relatively low-flow areas in the left middle frontal gyrus and the right mesiotemporal/hippocampal region corresponding to the localization of EEG changes.
