The distribution density of opioid receptors in the brain of El mice (seizure-susceptible strain) was examined to determine the relation between seizures and the opioid system. Saturation curves and Scatchard plots of [3H]2-D-alanine-5-D-leucine enkephalin binding revealed that the opioid delta receptor density in adult El mice during interictal periods was significantly increased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and septal area. It was further shown that the concentration of such receptors in 25-day-old El mice that had no seizures was also significantly increased in the hippocampus and septal area, with no changes in apparent affinities, as compared with in the corresponding regions in ddY mice (seizure-nonsusceptible strain; the mother strain of El). Such up-regulation of opioid receptors in the El mouse brain could result from deficits in endogenous opioid peptides, which could be associated with the pathogenesis of seizure diathesis in the El mouse.
