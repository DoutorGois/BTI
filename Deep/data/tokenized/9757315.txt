BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Changes occurring in neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity after kainic acid injection in rats and their possible consequences on seizure-brain damage were studied. METHODS: First, an intra-hippocampal kainic acid injection was performed (n = 7), inducing an ectopic and bilateral neuropeptide-Y immunoreactivity in mossy fibers. On the side of the injection, this neuropeptide-Y staining was associated with dramatic neuronal loss whereas, in the contralateral hippocampus staining was observed without associated neuronal loss. The CA3 a-b pyramidal cell loss induced by an intra-ventricular kainic acid injection was then compared between a control group (n = 6) and a pre-conditioned group (n = 6) characterized by neuropeptide-Y staining in the mossy fibers obtained by a previous contralateral intra-hippocampal kainic acid injection as described. RESULTS: In the pre-conditioned group, the CA3 a-b pyramidal cell loss was significantly lower (m = 33.5%) than in the control group (m = 86.6%). The neuropeptide-Y inhibiting the pre-synaptic release of glutamate, glutamate-related epileptic-brain damage could be reduced when neuropeptide-Y is expressed by granulated cells. IN CONCLUSION: Seizure-linked plasticity could induce a self-protection phenomenon against excitotoxic lesions possibly partially mediated by de novo neuropeptide-Y mossy fiber expression.
