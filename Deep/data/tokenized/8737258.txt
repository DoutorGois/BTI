Ceramide has been typically thought of as the membrane anchor for the carbohydrate in glycosphingolipids but many studies have suggested that it may cause apoptosis. Apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD) is thought to be responsible for the death of one-half of neurons surviving the development of the nervous system. The potential involvement of the sphingomyelin-ceramide signaling process as an integral part of PCD was therefore examined in several neurotumour cell lines. We show that synthetic C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine), a soluble ceramide analogue, can rapidly trigger PCD in these cells, characterized by: 1) classic DNA laddering on agarose gels; 2) DNA fragmentation as determined by Hoechst Dye; and 3) cell viability (mitochondrial function and intact nuclei) assays. We report that staurosporine can both activate PCD (by all three criteria above) in neurotumour cells and increase both the formation of ceramide and ceramide mass. Both ceramide formation and the induction of PCD were further enhanced by the co-addition of a ceramidase inhibitor oleoylethanolamine (25 microM). Staurosporine and oleoylethanolamine were similarly effective in inducing ceramide formation and PCD in immortalized hippocampal neurons (HN-2) and immortalized dorsal root ganglion cells (F-11). Our data suggests that formation of ceramide is a key event in the induction of PCD in neuronally derived neurotumour cells.
