SCOPE: Vitamin B6 plays crucial roles on brain development and its maternal deficiency impacts the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic systems in offspring. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurological changes are not well understood. Thus, we aimed at evaluating which components of those neurotransmitter metabolism and signaling pathways can be modulated by maternal vitamin B6 -deficient or B6 -supplementated diets in the hippocampus of rat dams and their offspring. METHODS AND RESULTS: Female Wistar rats were fed three different diets: control (6 mg vitamin B6 /kg), supplemented (30 mg vitamin B6 /kg) or deficient diet (0 mg vitamin B6 /kg), from 4 weeks before pregnancy through lactation. Newborn pups (10 days old) from rat dams fed vitamin B6 -deficient diet presented hyperhomocysteinemia and had a significant increase in mRNA levels of glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2), and glutamate-ammonia ligase (Glul), while glutaminase (Gls) and tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) mRNAs were downregulated. Vitamin B6 supplementation or deficiency did not change hippocampal global DNA methylation. CONCLUSION: A maternal vitamin B6 -deficient diet affects the expression of genes related to GABA, glutamate, and serotonin metabolisms in offspring by regulating Gad1, Glul, Gls, and Tph1 mRNA expression.
