The concentrations of somatostatin and choline acetyl transferase (CAT) were measured in nine brains from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and compared with those obtained from 19 matched control brains. In PSP, CAT activity was reduced in the caudate nucleus and limbic areas (amygdala, hippocampus and cingulate cortex) but was not different from controls in neocortical areas (frontal and temporal). Somatostatin concentrations were not different from controls in any region tested. In contrast to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, intellectual deterioration in PSP is not associated with a deficit in neocortical somatostatin and CAT levels.
