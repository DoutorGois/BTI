Protective effect of hypothermia against DNA fragmentation in hippocampal CA1 field after transient forebrain ischemia in gerbils was evaluated by changing the magnitude of hypothermia. Inhibition of DNA fragmentation was proportional to the magnitude of hypothermia. The result indicates that, in terms of susceptibility to ischemia, hippocampal CA1 neurons are sensitive to a relatively small decrement of temperature, with temperatures </=35 degreesC being critical for the prevention of apoptotic process following transient forebrain ischemia.
