BACKGROUND: Patients with alcohol dependence (AD) are known to develop poor social skills, to report a higher number of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and to attempt suicide more frequently than the general population. The background for the association between ACEs and a higher risk of suicide still remains understudied. SSTR4 rs2567608 is a functional polymorphism of the gene for somatostatin receptor subtype 4, predominantly found in the CA1 hippocampus area and involved in memory formation. We hypothesize that the functional polymorphism SSTR4 rs2567608, general self-efficacy, and adverse childhood experiences influence the risk of suicide attempt in patients with AD. METHODOLOGY: 176 patients with AD and 127 healthy controls were interviewed regarding 13 categories of ACEs and assessed with the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Genotyping for the SSTR4 rs2567608 polymorphism was performed according to the manufacturer's standard PCR protocol. RESULTS: Patients with AD and the controls did not differ significantly according to the SSTR4 rs2567608 genotype and allele frequencies. Lower general self-efficacy, higher number of ACEs, and the SSTR4 rs2567608 TT genotype increased the risk of suicide attempt in patients with AD, and it persisted significant only in male patients with AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports previous findings on ACEs and general self-efficacy association with a risk for suicide. Additionally, we suggest that patients with AD of the SSTR4 rs2567608 TT genotype may be more vulnerable to ACEs and at a higher risk of suicide attempt.
