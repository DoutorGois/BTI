The protein encoded by ORF 4 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is not required for growth of some strains in tissue culture cells, but its role in pathogenesis in the murine host has not been defined previously in a controlled manner. MHV strain JHM causes acute and chronic neurological diseases in susceptible strains of rodents. To genetically manipulate the structural proteins of this and other strains of MHV, we have generalized an interspecies-targeted RNA recombination selection that was originally developed for the A59 strain of MHV. Using this approach, a recombinant MHV-JHM was constructed in which gene 4 was genetically inactivated. Virus lacking gene 4 expression replicated in tissue culture cells with similar kinetics to recombinant virus in which gene 4 expression was not disrupted. Both types of viruses exhibited similar virulence when analyzed in a murine model of encephalitis. These results establish a targeted recombination system for inserting mutations into MHV-JHM. Furthermore, the protein encoded by ORF 4 is not essential for growth in tissue culture cells or in the CNS of the infected host.
