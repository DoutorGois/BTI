In order to understand the dynamics of large neural networks, where information is widely distributed over thousands of cells, one of today's challenges is to successfully monitor the simultaneous activity of as many neurons as possible. This is made possible by using the Micro-Electrode Array (MEA) technology allowing neural cell culture and/or tissue slice experimentation in vitro. Thanks to development of microelectronics' technologies, a novel data acquisition system based on MEA technology has been developed, the BioMEA. It combines the most advanced MEA biochips with integrated electronics, and a novel user-friendly software interface. To move from prototype (result of the RMNT research project NEUROCOM) to manufactured product, a number of changes have been made. Here, we present a 256-channel MEA data acquisition system with integrated electronics (BioMEA) allowing simultaneous recording and stimulation of neural networks for in vitro and in vivo applications. This integration is a first step towards an implantable device for BCI (Brain Computer Interface) studies and neural prosthesis.
