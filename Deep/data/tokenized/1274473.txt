During a total action of a static magnetic field (SMF) of 1000--4000 Oe, high-amplitude synchronized discharges appear in the electrograms of the cortical and subcortical parts of the rabbit brain. An automatic frequency analysis exhibits increased bioelectrical activity in the range of 8 to 30 c/s with no substantial changes in slower rhythms. The effect increases as the field becomes stronger. A SMF of 1000 Oe tends to facilitate the photic driving which persists as an after-effect. In SMF of 3000 Oe the driving reaction is weakened; it is rapidly restored after cessation of the SMF action.
