Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease that results in progressive neurodegeneration. Brain regions are differentially affected in AD. There is also an age-dependent effect on amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation and neuroinflammation as disease progresses. In the TgCRND8 APP transgenic mouse model, levels of Abeta species and cytokines were examined as a function of brain region and age. A temporal sequence was observed whereby Abeta accumulation is followed by expression of IL-1beta and eventually, of CXCL1, in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not the cortex. We have shown for the first time, in an APP mouse model, age and regional differences in Abeta accumulation and cytokine expression.
