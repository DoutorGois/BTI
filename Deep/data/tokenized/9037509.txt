The whole-cell mode of patch-clamp techniques was used to investigate the effect of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) on spontaneous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of cultured hippocampal neurons. Application of VIP caused a significant increase in the frequency of spontaneous IPSCs with a reversible and dose-dependent manner. VIP had no effect on the mean amplitude and kinetic parameters of spontaneous IPSCs. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, VIP increased the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) without affecting their mean magnitude. Forskolin, but not its inactive analog 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, mimicked the stimulatory effect of VIP on spontaneous IPSCs and mIPSCs. VIP and forskolin failed to modulate GABAergic IPSCs in the presence of Rp-cAMPs, a cell permeable antagonist of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Calcium channel blocker CdCl2 did not prevent VIP and forskolin from increasing the frequency of mIPSCs. These results suggest that the activation of presynaptic VIP receptor enhances the GABAergic synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons through the cAMP-PKA pathway and that VIP is likely to increase GABA release by directly stimulating the vesicular release apparatus.
