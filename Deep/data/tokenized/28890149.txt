Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are chromatin modifying enzymes that have been implicated as powerful negative regulators of memory processes. HDAC3has been shown to play a pivotal role in long-term memory for object location as well as the extinction of cocaine-associated memory, but it is unclear whether this function depends on the deacetylase domain of HDAC3. Here, we tested whether the deacetylase domain of HDAC3has a role in object location memory formation as well as the formation and extinction of cocaine-associated memories. Using a deacetylase-dead point mutant of HDAC3, we found that selectively blocking HDAC3 deacetylase activity in the dorsal hippocampus enhanced long-term memory for object location, but had no effect on the formation of cocaine-associated memory. When this same point mutant virus of HDAC3 was infused into the prelimbic cortex, it failed to affect cocaine-associated memory formation. With regards to extinction, impairing the HDAC3 deacetylase domain in the infralimbic cortex had no effect on extinction, but a facilitated extinction effect was observed when the point mutant virus was delivered to the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest that the deacetylase domain of HDAC3 plays a selective role in specific brain regions underlying long-term memory formation of object location as well as cocaine-associated memory formation and extinction.
