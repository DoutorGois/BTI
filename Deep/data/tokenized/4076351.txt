The effect of the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, fusaric acid (FA), on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic acid (HVA) was studied in pentobarbitone-anesthetized rats. Idazoxan, a selective alpha 2-antagonist, accentuated the FA-induced HVA elevation in CSF while alpha-methyldopa pretreatment prevented this effect of FA on the HVA level in CSF. These results could indicate that the rate of dopamine synthesis in noradrenaline neurons could be the main determinant of the FA-induced HVA elevation.
