Background unit activity and that evoked by ethanol of neighbouring neurones in hippocampal tissue culture of 9-19 div was studied by means of cross-correlational analysis. The results obtained point to a possibility of existence of complex neuronal networks consolidated by functional synaptic connections, even in such a simple model system as neuronal tissue culture. Excitatory interactions of neighbouring neurones were more sensitive to ethanol than the inhibitory ones. The effect of ethanol administration consisted mainly in a weakening of correlational connections. Such changes are supposed to be the basis for different coordination disorders in the work of brain structures observed during chronic alcoholic intoxication.
