Considering the putative participation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase enzymes in the susceptibility to convulsions induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), the present study sought to determine if rats with high (HTR) and low (LTR) thresholds to clonic convulsions induced by DMCM differed in the following aspects: the binding of NMDA receptors by [(3)H]-MK-801, Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity (K(+)-stimulated p-nitrophenylphosphatase) and high-affinity [(3)H]-ouabain binding to membranes from discrete brain regions. Compared to the HTR subgroup, the LTR subgroup presented a lower binding of [(3)H]-MK-801 in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and striatum. The subgroups did not differ in K(+)-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity, but the LTR subgroup had a lower density of isozymes with a high-affinity to ouabain in the brainstem and in the frontal cortex and a lower affinity to ouabain in the hippocampus than the HTR subgroup. These results suggest that NMDA receptors and ouabain-sensitive Na(+), K(+)-ATPase isozymes may underlie the susceptibility to DMCM-induced convulsions.
