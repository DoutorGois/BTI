We have investigated the influence of age (3, 18, 24 months) on Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) and Prostacyclin (PGI2) levels in hippocampal slices from F344/NHSD rats. A significant increase in TXA2 and PGI2 levels was observed in 18 and 24 months old compared to 3 months old animals. A significant reduction in the ratio TXA2/PGI2 produced by a higher increase in PGI2 was observed in 24 month old animals. The reduction in the TXA2/PGI2 ratio has been related to vasodilatory and antiaggregating effects that may contribute to protect the brain against neuronal damage.
