The study of tritiated S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine binding in various areas of the Rat brain has shown that the affinity was the same in the different regions whereas the number of binding sites was greater in the hippocampus and in the cerebellum than in the cortex, the corpus striatum, the mesencephalon, the hypothalamus and the brainstem. The phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methylase activity was also greater in the hippocampus and in the cerebellum.
