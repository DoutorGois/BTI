The cellular mechanisms underlying mu opioid facilitation of mossy fiber (MF) long-term potentiation (LTP) and synaptic transmission were investigated in the rat hippocampal slice. Naloxone (10 microM) significantly inhibited the induction of mossy fiber LTP, an effect attributed by Derrick and Martinez [B.E. Derrick, J.L.J. Martinez, Opioid receptor activation is one factor underlying the frequency dependence of mossy fiber LTP induction, J. Neurosci. 14 (1994) 4359-4367] to antagonism of endogenous opioid peptide action. We found that the inhibitory effects of naloxone were not blocked by bicuculline, suggesting that endogenous opioids did not enhance mossy fiber LTP by depressing GABAA inhibition. [d-Ala2, NMePhe4, Glyol5] enkephalin, DAMGO (300 nM), a mu opioid agonist, mimicked the action of endogenous opioids, enhancing both mossy fiber LTP induction and paired-pulse facilitation. DAMGO potentiation of the paired-pulse facilitation of mossy fiber response was also insensitive to bicuculline but was blocked by the mu selective antagonist CTOP. Further analysis of the cellular mechanism showed that the depletion of internal Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin (1 microM), or inhibition of protein kinases by application of staurosporine (1 microM) did not block the DAMGO facilitation of mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission. However, application of phaclofen (100 microM GABAB receptor antagonist or SCH 50911, a more potent GABAB antagonist significantly inhibited the DAMGO effect (49+/-15%; 51+/-19% inhibition, P<0.05). The data indicate that the DAMGO effect on the mossy fiber pathway is partially mediated by a reduction in GABA activation of GABAB receptors. These findings further suggest that endogenous opioid peptides activate mu opioid receptors to facilitate mossy fiber LTP and synaptic transmission in rat hippocampus partially by GABAB receptor-mediated disinhibitory mechanism.
