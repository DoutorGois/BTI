Chronic ethanol treatment of Wistar rats to 10% (v/v) ethanol over a period of 4, 12, and 36 weeks produced distinct alterations of the glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity (GFAP-IR) of dorsal hippocampal astrocytes. Ethanol consumption over a period of 4 weeks caused an increase in the total GFAP-IR of the astrocytes. Down-regulation of the total GFAP-IR was measured in all examined brain regions after 36 weeks of ethanol treatment. Prolonged ethanol treatment induced a significant loss of the total number of hippocampal pyramidal and dentate gyrus granule cells. Regional differences in the vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of chronic ethanol intake over 36 weeks were found: CA3 > CA1 + CA2 > > CA4 > GD. In agreement with the degree of neuronal cell loss, ethanol-induced behavioral impairments were found. The acquisition of maze performance using a complex elevated labyrinth was deteriorated after 36 weeks of ethanol treatment, suggesting a deficit in learning and memory. These findings illustrate the importance of time-response analysis when determining the structural and functional changes produced by chronic ethanol treatment.
