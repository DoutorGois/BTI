The left common carotid artery was ligated in anaesthetized 7-day-old Wistar rats (P7), prior to asphyxia by inhaling 100% nitrogen for 9 min. Pups recovered from asphyxia received i.p. saline (n = 16), or L-Arg 300 mg/kg (n = 14). Pups undergoing sham operation remained as controls (n = 12). At day 14, the amount of surviving or degenerating neurons was quantified under optical microscopy by Nissl technique or by Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) in CA1 area of hippocampus and in parietal cortex. In these areas, asphyxia reduced the neuronal density by 23.6 and 30%, and increased the proportion of degenerating neurons two and four times, respectively. L-Arg administration to asphyxiated pups reduced the neuronal loss and the proportion of degenerating neurons by 50% (p < 0.05). We conclude that L-Arg administration after acute severe asphyxia in newborn rats is neuroprotective, reducing early and delayed neuronal loss.
