Injection of chelants into the animal body induces the development of the biphasic behavioral reaction. The first phase is marked by intensification of motor activity because of the direct chelant action on hippocampal synapses. The second phase is characterized by reduced motor activity due to the indirect chelant action on hippocampal synapses (via formation of toxic complexes with loosely bound zinc).
