PACAP is a member of the secretin/vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) family, isolated from hypothalamus. Recent studies have shown that PACAP is expressed in many parts of adult brain. We have studied the precise distribution of PACAP mRNA in developing rat brain, employing in situ hybridisation. PACAP mRNA is expressed in distinct parts of the embryonic rat brain from embryonic day 13, with a robust expression in developing cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus as well as in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. The expression in hippocampus and cortex diminishes towards adulthood, compared to new-born rat brain. In the mature brain, PACAP mRNA is located in alternating layers of cerebral cortex (layers I, III and V), in the dentate gyrus, in CA4 and CA1 regions, but not in CA2 or CA3 of the hippocampus. The presence of PACAP mRNA in different structures of developing rat brain suggests an important function for this peptide during brain development.
