1. Literature is reviewed that implicates various limbic structures (particularly amygdala and hippocampus) in the modulation of stress-associated neuroendocrine systems. 2. Procaine and related local anesthetics may show a selective proclivity for activating limbic structures. 3. Procaine stimulates ACTH-cortisol and prolactin, but not growth hormone secretion. This pattern is most comparable to that elicited by stimuli which act bilaterally on temporal lobe and limbic areas. 4. Procaine may be a useful agent for helping to elucidate the anatomic and physiologic basis for mood, endocrine, and cognitive dysregulation associated with stress and affective disorders. 5. The endocrine concomitants of limbic activation may have relevance to the course and symptom complex of affective disorders and related psychiatric conditions.
