Using blind whole cell recording technique on rat hippocampal slices, the function and mechanisms of P/N leak subtraction of Clampex program in pClamp acquisition software were studied. The ways of picking up sub-pulse current and properly selecting parameters, including time course, polarization, sub-holding potential, numbers and location of P/N sub-pulse were analyzed in detail. Our results indicate that voltage-gated ion channel currents recorded by Clampex will be more accurate and reproducible by properly using P/N leak subtraction.
