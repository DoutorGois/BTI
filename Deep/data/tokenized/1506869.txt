By using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay system for rat parvalbumin, we determined parvalbumin contents in the 4 cerebrocortical regions (superior frontal gyrus of frontal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus of temporal lobe, superior parietal lobule of parietal lobe, and calcarine area of occipital lobe) of patients with Alzheimer's disease and age-matched controls. Among the 4 regions, concentrations of parvalbumin were the highest in calcarine area (68.6 +/- 6.7 ng/mg protein, rat parvalbumin equivalents, mean +/- SE) and the lowest in the parahippocampal gyrus (11.0 +/- 1.7 ng/mg protein) in the controls. A similar regional difference of the concentration was observed also in the patients with Alzheimer's disease. When compared with the controls, however, concentrations of parvalbumin in parahippocampal gyrus of patients with Alzheimer's disease (4.0 +/- 0.9 ng/mg protein) were significantly low (P less than 0.01), showing less than a half of the control values. In contrast, the concentrations in the 3 other regions showed little difference between Alzheimer's disease and the controls.
