In the hippocampus of mice lacking the gene for serine racemase (SR), a D-serine synthesizing enzyme, in the CaMKIIalpha-expressing neurons, we observed a significant decrease in the extracellular concentration of D-serine, a coagonist for the N-methyl-D-aspartate type glutamate receptor (NMDAR), and NMDAR hypofunction as revealed by diminished extracellular taurine concentrations after an intra-hippocampal NMDA infusion when compared to the wild type controls. Therefore, the neuronal SR could regulate the extracellular D-serine signaling responsible for NMDAR activation in the hippocampus.
