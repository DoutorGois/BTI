Corticosteroids in human plasma and urine increase after amygdala stimulation, and plasma corticosteroids decrease after hippocampus stimulation. Five subjects underwent unilateral temporal lobectomy, and histopathologic localization of electrode sites was attempted. Localization was successful for six sites: three in basolateral amygdala and three in hippocampus.
