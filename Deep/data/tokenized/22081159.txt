The adult olfactory bulb and hippocampus are continuously supplied with newborn neurons that are thought to possess a capacity for plasticity only at a young neuronal age, mainly during the early stages of integration into the network. We find that the two main types of adult-born neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb undergo experience-dependent plasticity long after maturation and integration, as evidenced by stabilization of synaptic turnover rates. Thus, the potential time window for plasticity of adult-born neurons extends well into maturity.
