Rats were trained in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task and tested for retention 1, 31, or 60 days later. Three to 7 days prior to testing, they were bilaterally implanted with cannulae in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus and in the amygdaloid nucleus (H + A), in the entorhinal cortex (EC), and in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Ten minutes prior to testing, the animals received, through the cannulae, 0.5-microliter microinfusions of vehicle (20% dimethylsulfoxide in saline) or of 0.5 microgram of CNQX dissolved in the vehicle. A second test session was carried out 90 min after the first. CNQX blocked retention test performance when given into H + A 1 day after training but not later; when given into EC 1 or 31 days after training, but not later; and when given into PPC 1, 31, or 60 days after training. In all cases performance returned to normal levels in the second test session. The data suggest that H and A are involved in memory expression for only a few days after acquisition; that EC is involved in memory expression for up to 31, but less than 60, days after acquisition; and that PPC is involved in memory expression for up to at least 2 months after acquisition.
