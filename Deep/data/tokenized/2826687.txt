Spot 35 protein is a cerebellar Ca-binding protein. Because Southern blot analysis showed evidence for the nucleotide sequence of spot 35 protein cDNA in the rat genome, we applied cDNA to quantitate the mRNA of rat spot 35 protein. The size of this mRNA was about 1,900 nucleotides in length, and that of mRNA from bovine cerebellum was larger. We also examined the developmental changes and regional distribution of spot 35 protein mRNA in rat brains by dot-blot analysis using cDNA as a probe. During postnatal days 1-20, a rapid increase of mRNA levels was observed. Further, the level of mRNA for spot 35 protein was found in the cerebellum and was negligible in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus.
