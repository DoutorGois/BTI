The endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), of Salmonella typhimurium was biosynthetically labeled with (3)H and (14)C incorporated into the fatty acyl chains and glucosamine residues, respectively. The radio-labeled LPS was isolated from the bacteria and then injected into Sprague-Dawley rats. The distribution of (14)C and (3)H-LPS in plasma and other organs was determined following intraperitoneal (IP) doses of (14)C and (3)H-LPS (200 mug/kg). Plasma concentrations of both fatty acyl chains and glucosamine residues were biphasic, with a relatively rapid decay followed by a slow decline for 48 h. Similar biphasic results were found in the peripheral organs (kidney and heart) and brain barrier tissues (meninges and choroid plexus). In other brain tissues (brain stem, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus), the glucosamine residue was biphasic, whereas the fatty acyl chains showed accumulation. Highest concentrations of LPS were found in the plasma, spleen and the liver. In addition, in the liver, sustained elevations of (14)C-glucosamine and (3)H-fatty acyl chains were observed. This indicates LPS accumulation in the liver. By contrast, the spleen showed biphasic decay of glucosamine residues and accumulation of fatty acyl chains. In the brain barrier tissues, peak LPS concentrations were significantly reduced (about 70%) and were further reduced (about 95%) in other brain tissues. The high elevation of LPS in the spleen is considered indicative of an immune response. Our findings highlight the potential significant role of lipid A as shown with the sustained elevation of (3)H-fatty acyl chains in the brain.
