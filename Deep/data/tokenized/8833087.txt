Using multiple polymerase chain reaction assay and cytosolic receptor binding assay we studied type I, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and type II, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), adrenocorticoid receptors expression in rat hippocampus and spinal cord, at various times after adrenalectomy: 12 hr, 24 hr, 3 days, and 1 week. Analysis of the data demonstrates that in hippocampus the expression of MR and GR mRNA was not significantly affected by adrenalectomy. On the contrary, Bmax of MR was significantly increased at each time post-surgery, with only slight modifications of Kd. Bmax and Kd for GR showed a significant increase after 3 days and 1 week. In the spinal cord, MR mRNA was increased 12 hr after adrenalectomy, reaching a maximum at 3 days. Bmax of MR was also significantly increased after 3 days, whereas its Kd remained unchanged for the entire duration of the the study. Both GR mRNA and binding parameters were poorly affected by adrenalectomy. The results of the present experiments demonstrate that the absence of adrenocortical hormones influences differentially MR and GR expression in hippocampus and spinal cord, suggesting the existence of various and independent mechanisms of regulation of adrenocorticoid receptor.
