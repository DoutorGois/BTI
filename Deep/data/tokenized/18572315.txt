Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is known to produce neuronal damage in the dentate gyrus at least in part via oxidative stress. DJ-1, an oncogene product, is known to act as an anti-oxidant to prevent neuronal damage in dopaminergic neurons. The aim of this study was to determine the alterations in DJ-1 expression in the hippocampal cells of mice after in vivo and in vitro treatment with TMT. In naive animals, DJ-1 was ubiquitously expressed in the hippocampus, in which the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and dentate granule cell layer had lower and higher levels of it, respectively. An intraperitoneal injection of TMT at the dose of 2.8 mg/kg produced DJ-1 up-regulation in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer, CA3 stratum lucidum, dentate molecular layer, and dentate hilus, but not in the dentate granule cell layer, on day 3-5 post-treatment. Temporary depletion of endogenous glutathione by the prior subcutaneous injection of 2-cyclohexen-1-one was effective in facilitating neuronal damage and DJ-1 up-regulation in the dentate gyrus induced by an intraperitoneal injection of TMT at the dose of 2.0 mg/kg. In primary cultures of mouse hippocampal cells, DJ-1 was present in neurons, but not in astrocytes. TMT treatment produced a dramatic expression of DJ-1 in the astrocytes in the cultures. Taken together, our data suggest that the DJ-1 protein is positively regulated in response to oxidative stress induced by TMT.
