In this chapter we describe in detail the surgical and imaging techniques employed for the study of the anatomical routes of drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) from the brain. The types of tracers, sites of injection, and volumes injected are crucial. For example, when testing the drainage of ISF from the parenchyma, volumes larger than 0.5 muL result in spillage of ISF into the ventricular CSF.
