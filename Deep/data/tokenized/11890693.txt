Brief exposure for 15 min to static magnetic filed at 100 mT led to marked but transient potentiation of binding of a radiolabeled probe for activator protein-1 (AP1) in immature cultured rat hippocampal neurons with high expression of growth-associated protein-43. Immunoblotting and supershift analyses revealed that brief exposure to static magnetic field increased AP1 DNA binding through expression of Fra-2, c-Jun, and Jun-D proteins in immature cultured hippocampal neurons. Significantly less potent increases were seen in both intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration and AP1 binding following the addition of N-methyl-d-aspartate in these immature neurons exposed to magnetism 24 h before. These results suggest that brief exposure to weak static magnetic field may lead to desensitization of NMDA receptor channels through modulation of de novo synthesis of particular inducible target proteins at the level of gene transcription by the AP1 complex expressed in the nucleus of immature cultured rat hippocampal neurons.
