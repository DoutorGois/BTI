Enkephalin analogues were electrophoretically applied into the dentate granule cell layer of the hippocampus in vivo to determine opioid effects on granule cell responsiveness to afferent input. The results indicate that opioids, probably acting at mu receptors, enhance dentate responsiveness to perforant path transmission. This enhancement includes decreased inhibition and increased potentiation.
