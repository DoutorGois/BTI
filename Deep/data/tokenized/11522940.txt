Inflammatory and immune responses are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). NF-kappaB is a major transcription factor that plays a central role in the inflammatory and immune responses and is regulated by I-kappaB through an autoregulatory feedback system. Southwestern immunohistochemistry and immunohistochemistry in our study demonstrated activated NF-kappaB in AD brains. However, there was also activated expression of I-kappaB in a distribution that corresponded to the neurofibrillary pathology of AD. These observations indicate that disruption of the autoregulatory mechanism of NF-kappaB in brain regions with neurofibrillary pathology may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.
