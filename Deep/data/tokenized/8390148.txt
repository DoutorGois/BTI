Results from this study clearly indicate that Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase is a target enzyme of cerebral ischemia insult. This enzyme is responsible for removal of Ins(1,4,5)P3 which, in turn, plays an important role in the maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Not only did a time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity occur due to the focal cerebral ischemic insult, but there was also a second phase for the decline in enzyme activity around 6 h after the insult. Examination of the mRNA for the 3-kinase in frozen brain sections suggested an increase in message at a time (around 8 h) prior to development of tissue infarct. Since the initial decline in enzyme activity during ligation correlated well with the time for development of an infarct, assay of this enzyme could be used as a biochemical marker of cerebral ischemic insult.
