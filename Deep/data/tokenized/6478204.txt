Using a monoclonal antibody to choline acetyltransferase, immunoreactive synaptic boutons were identified in the neostriatum, cingulate cortex, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala, hippocampus and interpeduncular nucleus of the rat. The synapses were generally symmetrical although some asymmetrical membrane specializations were observed. Postsynaptic targets included perikarya, dendritic shafts and dendritic spines.
