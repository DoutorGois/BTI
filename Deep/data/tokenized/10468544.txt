Memory formation, like real estate, can be summarized succinctly-location, location, location. It is an emergent property involving different anatomical regions in the brain, sets of neuronal circuits, and cellular and molecular interactions between and within those neurons. At each of these levels of description, location continues to be a major organizing principle guiding researchers. The difficulty in the field is the integration of information between the various levels of analyses, and it is proposed that molecular reporters may help to fill that void.
