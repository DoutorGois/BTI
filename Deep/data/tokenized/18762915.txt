RATIONALE: Development of cognitive-enhancing drugs that delay or halt mild cognitive impairment progression to Alzheimer's disease would be of great benefit. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the ability of (S)-2,3-dihydro-[3,4]-cyclopentano-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide (S 18986), a positive allosteric modulator of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, to improve behavioral performance and alleviate age-related deficits in oxidative stress status in the prelimbic cortex and hippocampus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Daily administration of S 18986 (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg) or vehicle was given to separate groups of male rats starting at 12 months of age. Additionally, daily vehicle administration was given to a group of rats starting at 3 months of age. Four months after initiation of drug administration, rats were trained and tested in an operant-delayed alternation task and a reinforcer devaluation task. Upon completion of testing, oxidative stress status was assessed in the prelimbic cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: S 18986 dose-dependently altered responses in the reinforcer devaluation task such that aged rats came to resemble young rats. There were no age or drug effects in the operant-delayed alternation task. Levels of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-nonenal (HNE) were increased, and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were decreased in prelimbic cortex in aged rats, changes that were reversed by S 18986. Similarly, age-related increases in hippocampal HNE levels were prevented by S 18986. CONCLUSIONS: Positive modulation of AMPA receptor activity may be a therapeutic approach to halt or slow progression of mild cognitive impairment via improvement in oxidative stress status in the hippocampus and prelimbic cortex.
