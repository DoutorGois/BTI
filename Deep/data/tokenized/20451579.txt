Bacterial meningitis is associated with intense inflammation and also linked to the production of reactive oxygen species. To this aim, animals underwent a magna cistern tap and received either sterile saline as a placebo or an equivalent volume of a Streptococcus pneumoniae suspension. The animals began antibiotic therapy 16h after induction. The animals were sacrificed at 24 or 48h post-infection and the hippocampus and cortex were harvested. The activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and thiobarbituric acid reactive species, protein carbonyls, and free sulphydryl groups were altered, but reversed, in part, by the antibiotic treatment. Our results support the hypothesis that antibiotic treatment prevents, in part, the oxidative stress in the bacterial meningitis induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae.
