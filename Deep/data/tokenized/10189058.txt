The present study examined the distribution of angiotensin-binding cells by using a fluorescence-coupled angiotensin II in fixed horizontal sections that contained several limbic structures. In normal female rats, dense staining was found in the CA3 and CA1 regions and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus--in the subiculum as well as in the entorhinal cortex and piriform cortex. Moderate staining was found in the CA2 region, in the central and medial nuclei of the amygdala. Low-level staining was obtained in the basolateral and lateral nucleus of the amygdala as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. The co-incubation of fluorescence-coupled angiotensin II together with angiotensin II in excess and with saralasin, respectively, suppressed the angiotensin staining in structures investigated.
