We investigated the distribution of serotonin (5-HT) receptors of type 3 (5-HT3) in human brain areas, by means of the the specific binding of [3H]GR65630. The brains were obtained during autoptic sessions from 6 subjects. Human brain membranes and the binding of [3H]GR65630 were carried out according to standardized methods. The highest density (Bmax +/- SD, fmol/mg protein) of [3H]GR65630 binding sites was found in area postrema (13.1+/-9.7), followed at a statistically lower level, by nucleus tractus solitarius (6.7+/-3.4), nervus vagus (5.5+/-2.1), striatum (4.8+/-2.4) with a progressive decrease in amygdala, olivar nuclei, hippocampus, olfactory bulbus and prefrontal cortex, and then by the other cortical areas and the cerebellum, where no binding was detected. These observations extend previous findings on the distribution of 5-HT3 receptors and confirm interspecies variations that might explain the heterogeneous properties of 5-HT3 receptors in different animals.
