This study has analysed the effects of infusing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) into either the ventral or dorsal hippocampus on dopamine (DA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) core or shell for the first time. Dopamine was measured using in vivo microdialysis with high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). Unilateral NMDA infusion (0.5 microg) into the ventral hippocampus (VH) increased extracellular DA levels in NAC shell during the first 30 min following infusion compared to saline (SAL) infused animals. In contrast, NAC core DA levels were unaffected. NMDA infusion into the dorsal hippocampus (DH) led to a decrease in NAC core DA levels; this effect was not observed in the SAL-infused group. DA levels in NAC shell remained unaltered. At the end of the experiments, we examined the response to a systemic amphetamine (AMPH) injection of 1mg/kg on extracellular DA levels of the NAC core and shell. Interestingly, on2ly animals previously infused with NMDA into the VH exhibited a sensitized DA response in the NAC shell in response to the AMPH injection. We can conclude that VH activation has an acute stimulatory effect on DA release in the shell and that DH activation has a suppressive effect on extracellular DA levels in the core.
