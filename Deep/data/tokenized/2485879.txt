The effects of prolonged (2 months) corticosterone (CORT) treatment on several cholinergic markers of various brain areas were compared to the effects of prolonged intermittent exposure to stress. CORT, but not stress, caused a significant reduction in the number of acetylcholinesterase-stained neurons in the medial septal area. Neither treatment resulted in any hippocampal pyramidal cell loss. It is concluded that a time-dependent degeneration of the septohippocampal cholinergic system follows 2 months of CORT administration but not chronic intermittent stress of this duration.
