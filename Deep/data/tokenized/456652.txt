In animals, an increase in glycolysis intensity and processes of oxidative phosphorylation in the brain correlated with the steady potential shifts within the range of 0--1.0 Hz in the neocortex, dorsal hippocampus, and thalamic nuclei. The neurotropic drug ethymizol revealed two effects depending on the initial functional state of the rabbit: 2.5 mg/kg of the drug enhanced the amplitude of the minute waves in the frontal neocortex and dorsal hippocampus, increasing the metabolic rate in the unsteady period of conditioning, whereas after the fast conditioning the drug rendered background values to the minute oscillations and elongated the extinction of conditioned reflexes. The ethymizol appears to be an unspecific connector.
