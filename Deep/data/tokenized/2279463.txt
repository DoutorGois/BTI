The effect of methionine on cerebral content of dopamine, serotonin and major acidic metabolites was studied in distinct CDF-1 mouse brain regions. Methionine was administered 30 mg/kg for five trials over 24 h and mice were sacrificed 30 min post the terminal treatment. Methionine exerted differential effects on regional brain concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and serotonin. The results suggest methionine-mediated decreases of dopamine turnover in the hippocampus and medulla compared to increases of serotonin turnover in the cerebral cortex and midbrain regions. The results indicate a central action for methionine as related to endogenous neurotransmitters measured which may precede the abnormal O- or N-dimethylation ascribed to methionine and the insuing adverse effects postulated in schizophrenia.
