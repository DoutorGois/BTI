Protocadherins are cell-cell adhesion molecules that are thought to be involved in neural development. Here, we report the expression pattern of protocadherin 2A (Pc2A) in the developing mouse brain as determined by the in situ hybridization technique. In the postnatal day 2 brain, various regions expressed Pc2A including the cerebellar cortex, ventral posterior thalamic nucleus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, hippocampus and cerebellum (Purkinje cells). In particular, some ependymal cells that form the lining of the lateral ventricle and the third ventricle and floor plate cells lining the fourth ventricle showed prominent expression. In the adult brain, strong expression was restricted to the Purkinje cells. Expression in other areas of the adult brain was down-regulated to a faint level, and only a weak signal was detected in regions such as the retina, olfactory bulb, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, and in some parts of the medial eminence. These observations suggest that Pc2A is expressed in various regions of the brain in a developmentally regulated manner.
