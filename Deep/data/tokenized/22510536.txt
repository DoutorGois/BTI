Although synaptic plasticity is believed to comprise the cellular substrate for learning and memory, limited direct evidence exists that hippocampus-dependent learning actually triggers synaptic plasticity. It is likely, however, that long-term potentiation (LTP) works in concert with its counterpart, long-term depression (LTD) in the creation of spatial memory. It has been reported in rats that weak synaptic plasticity is facilitated into persistent plasticity if afferent stimulation is coupled with a novel spatial learning event. It is not known if this phenomenon also occurs in other species. We recorded from the hippocampal CA1 of freely behaving mice and observed that novel spatial learning triggers endogenous LTD. Specifically, we observed that LTD is enabled when test-pulse afferent stimulation is given during the learning of object constellations or during a spatial object recognition task. Intriguingly, LTP is significantly impaired by the same tasks, suggesting that LTD is the main cellular substrate for this type of learning. These data indicate that learning-facilitated plasticity is not exclusive to rats and that spatial learning leads to endogenous LTD in the hippocampus, suggesting an important role for this type of synaptic plasticity in the creation of hippocampus-dependent memory.
