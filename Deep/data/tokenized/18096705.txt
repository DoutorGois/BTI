Wnt signaling is essential for neuronal development and the maintenance of the developing nervous system. Recent studies indicated that Wnt signaling modulates long term potentiation in adult hippocampal slices. We report here that different Wnt ligands are present in hippocampal neurons of rat embryo and adult rat, including Wnt-4, -5a, -7a, and -11. Wnt-7a acts as a canonical Wnt ligand in rat hippocampal neurons, stimulates clustering of presynaptic proteins, and induces recycling and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles as studied by FM dyes. Wnt-3a has a moderate effect on recycling of synaptic vesicles, and no effect of Wnt-1 and Wnt-5a was detected. Electrophysiological analysis on adult rat hippocampal slices indicates that Wnt-7a, but not Wnt-5a, increases neurotransmitter release in CA3-CA1 synapses by decreasing paired pulse facilitation and increasing the miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents frequency. These results indicate that the presynaptic function of rat hippocampal neurons is modulated by the canonical Wnt signaling.
