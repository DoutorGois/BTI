pH homeostasis is a fundamental regulator of the function of the central nervous system. Dysfunction of acid-base transporters often results in disturbance of neuronal excitability. In a latest issue of Journal of Neuroscience, Jones et al. report that increasing intracellular bicarbonate concentration substantially stimulates the excitability of pyramidal neurons from mouse hippocampus by inhibiting KCNQ potassium channel. The finding shed important new light in understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of neuronal excitability by acid-base transporters.
