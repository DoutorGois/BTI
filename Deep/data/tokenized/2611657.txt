Chronic ethanol ingestion by mice was previously shown to result in decreased activation of adenylate cyclase by guanine nucleotides and beta-adrenergic agonists, and in the loss of the high affinity beta-adrenergic agonist binding site in frontal cortex and hippocampus but not in cerebellum. These results indicate a regional specificity of ethanol's actions on beta-adrenergic receptors, the guanine nucleotide binding protein (Gs) and/or adenylate cyclase. To further detail the anatomical specificity of the effects of ethanol ingestion on receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase (AC) systems we have quantified the binding of [3H]forskolin to brain sections of control and ethanol-fed mice. High-affinity forskolin binding, thought to represent the complex of the alpha-subunit of Gs (as) and AC, was decreased in several brain areas including frontal cortex and hippocampus, but not in cerebellum, nucleus accumbens and certain other brain areas of ethanol-fed mice. Guanine nucleotides, such as Gpp(NH)p, generally enhanced forskolin binding in control animals. In ethanol-fed mice, however, Gpp(NH)p failed to enhance forskolin binding in most brain regions. These findings suggest that chronic ethanol ingestion may decrease the amount or function of as-AC in certain brain regions. Moreover, the regulation of the formation of this complex in different brain regions may affect responses to ethanol ingestion in mice.
