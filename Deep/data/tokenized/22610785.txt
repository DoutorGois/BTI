In spite of definite roles for beta-amyloid (Abeta) in familial Alzheimer's disease (AD), the cause of sporadic AD remains unknown. Amyloid senile plaques and Lewy body pathology frequently coexist in neocortical and hippocampal regions of AD and Parkinson's diseases. However, the relationship between Abeta and alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn), the principle components in the pathological structures, in neuronal toxicity and the mechanisms of their interaction are not well studied. As Abeta and alpha-Syn accumulate in aging patients, the biological functions and toxicity of these polypeptides in the aging brain may be different from those in young brain. We examined the neurotoxicity influences of Abeta1-42 or alpha-Syn on mature neurons and the effects of Abeta1-42 or alpha-Syn on the production of endogenous alpha-Syn or Abeta1-40 reciprocally using a model of culture enriched with primary neurons from the hippocampus of adult rats. Treatment of neurons with high concentrations of Abeta1-42 or alpha-Syn caused significant apoptosis of neurons. Following Abeta1-42 treatment at sub apoptotic concentrations, both intra- and extra-cellular alpha-Syn levels were significantly increased. Reciprocally, the non-toxic levels of alpha-Syn treatment also increased intra- and extra-cellular Abeta1-40 levels. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002, suppressed alpha-Syn-induced Abeta1-40 elevation, as well as Abeta1-42-induced alpha-Syn elevation. Thus, high concentrations of Abeta1-42 and alpha-Syn exert toxic effects on mature neurons; however, non-toxic concentration treatment of these polypeptides induced the production of each other reciprocally with possible involvement of PI3K pathway.
