This paper discusses the task of true physical quantity reconstruction from experimental data on the basis of fluorescence microscopy images when a specific ion indicator is used for an investigation into ion concentration. Brain cell functional activity in the form of calcium oscillation may be processed as quantitation on the basis of measurements of single-wavelength fluorescence intensity using data about dye loading protocol, excitation, and detection conditions without calibration of every experiment.
