We studied modifications in [3H]MK801-binding sites in the rat brain after chronic clozapine. We found a 20-30% reduction of [3H]MK801-binding sites in the anterior cingulate, frontoparietal motor and frontoparietal somatosensory cortices on the left side but none on the right. We also demonstrated a 20% bilateral increase of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. No changes were found in the prefrontal cortex, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus or olfactory tubercle.
