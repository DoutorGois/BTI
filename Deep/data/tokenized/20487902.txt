The characteristics of (3)H-dihydroalprenolol ((3)H-DHA) binding to mounted tissue sections of rat brain were studied. The binding had all the characteristics of a beta-receptor. It was reversible, saturable (K(D) 2.3 nM, B(max) 23 fmol/mg tissue, wet wt) and was inhibited only by beta-adrenergic drugs. The forebrain binding had the properties of a beta-1 receptor, while cerebellar binding had beta-2 characteristics. Beta-adrenergic receptors were widely distributed in the rat brain. High concentrations were localized in the superficial layers of the neocortex, in the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercles, substantia nigra, nucleus interpeduncularis, subiculum and pia mater. Areas containing intermediate concentrations of receptors included the cerebellum, hippocampus and thalamus. Areas containing low concentrations of receptors included the hypothalamus, amygdala, brainstem and medulla. Co-incubation with low concentrations of zinterol to preferentially block beta-2 receptor resulted in an inhibition of most of the binding to the cerebellum and pia matter and produced only a small and generalized decrease in the rest of the brain. Beta receptors were found in many areas known to contain noradrenergic nerve terminals. Paradoxically some areas with high densities of dopaminergic nerve terminals, had high densities of receptors. Results of electrophysiologica and lesion studies are also discussed.
