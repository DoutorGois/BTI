We have investigated the effects of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) inhibitors on high-threshold voltage activating (HVA) calcium currents in CA1 pyramidal neurones, whole-cell patch-clamp recorded from rat hippocampal slices. Genistein (100 microM) and tyrphostin B42 (100 microM), two PTKs inhibitors, reduced the steady-state barium current (IBa). On the other hand, daidzein and genistin (100 microM), two inactive analogues of genistein, had no effect on IBa amplitude. The inhibition induced by genistein was more pronounced at negative potentials. In order to characterize the calcium channels subtypes inhibited by PTKs inhibitors, we examined the effect of genistein in the presence of different calcium channel blockers. When L-type calcium channels were blocked by nifedipine, genistein induced a strong inhibition of the nifedipine-resistant IBa, suggesting an effect on non-L-type channels. Genistein did not antagonize the depressant effect of omega-Conotoxin-GVIA, a selective N-type calcium channel blocker, suggesting that N-type channels were not blocked by genistein. omega-Conotoxin-MVIIC (3-10 microM), a selective P/Q-type calcium channel blocker, greatly antagonized the depressant effect of genistein. Our results suggest that PTKs inhibitors reduce P-/Q-type, but not L- or N-types calcium currents in neurones of the CNS. The possible modulation of calcium channels by endogenous PTKs is discussed.
