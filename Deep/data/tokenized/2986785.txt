The effects of different synaptic antagonists on paired-pulse plasticity of medial perforant path responses were studied in rat hippocampal slices. Baclofen reduces the response to activation of the perforant path, but does not have the same net effect on the first and second responses to paired stimulation: baclofen lessens the percent paired-pulse depression of medial perforant path responses. Furthermore, at doses that reduced the control medial perforant path response by half, paired-pulse plasticity changed from paired-pulse depression to paired-pulse potentiation. A similar effect on medial perforant path paired-pulse plasticity is produced by decreasing extracellular calcium concentration. Kynurenic acid reduces the first and second responses to paired stimulation proportionately the same, and, therefore, has no effect on the percent paired-pulse depression. These results suggest that baclofen acts presynaptically to reduce the synaptic response, whereas kynurenate acts postsynaptically. Adenosine was also found to be a potent antagonist of medial perforant path responses, with effects on paired-pulse plasticity similar to baclofen: a new synaptic antagonist, N-p-chlorobenzoyl-piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylate, was found to have effects like kynurenate, suggesting that it is also a postsynaptic receptor blocker.
