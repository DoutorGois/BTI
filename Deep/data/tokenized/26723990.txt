The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remain elusive. One of the hypotheses is the dysfunction of serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission, which is critically regulated by serotonin transporter (SERT). Therefore, we hypothesized that attenuation of SERT gene expression in the hippocampus could prevent hippocampal autophagy and the development of PTSD-like behavior. To this end, we infused SLC6A4 siRNAs into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) to knockdown SERT gene expression after a single prolonged stress (SPS) treatment in rats. Then, we evaluated the effects of SERT gene knockdown on anxiety-related behaviors and extinction of contextual fear memory. We also examined the histological changes and the expression of Beclin-1, LC3-I, and LC3-II in the hippocampus. We found that SPS treatment did not alter anxiety-related behaviors but prolonged the extinction of contextual fear memory, and such a behavioral phenomenon was correlated with increased hippocampal autophagy, decreased 5-HT level, and increased expression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in the hippocampus. Furthermore, intra-DRN infusion of SLC6A4 siRNAs promoted the extinction of contextual fear memory, prevented hippocampal autophagy, increased 5-HT level, and decreased expression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio. These results indicated that SERT may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of hippocampal autophagy, and is likely involved in the development of PTSD.
