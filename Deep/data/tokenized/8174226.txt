The expression and distribution of three retinoic acid receptors, alpha, beta, and gamma, were investigated in the CNS of mouse embryos during development. mRNAs and protein of RAR-beta that were expressed in the spinal cord of the 12.5-day mouse embryo decreased during development but they were not decreased in the brain. The RAR-beta-positive cells were already present in the ventral region of the spinal cord of 10.5-day mouse embryos, gradually appeared in the dorsal region during development and then disappeared from the spinal cord after birth. In the brain, RAR-beta-positive cells were detected in the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon but not in the telencephalon of the 12.5-day mouse embryos. RAR-beta-positive cells were present in the hippocampus and cingulum but not in the neocortex of 14.5-day mouse embryos. Most neurons in the hippocampus of 16.5-day mouse embryos and the cortex of newborn mice were RAR-beta-positive. In the spinal cord, RAR-alpha mRNAs and proteins also decreased during development but more gradually than RAR-beta mRNAs and proteins. During development, the distributions of RAR-alpha and -beta in the spinal cord and brain did not differ substantially. The main difference was the appearance of a subtypes of RAR-alpha, a 52-kDa protein, in the brain of newborn mice. On the other hand, RAR-gamma proteins were only faintly detected in the spinal cord and the brain of the mice during the embryonal stages but these increased after birth. The distribution of RAR-alpha- or -beta-positive cells were consistent with the neurogenesis during development in the spinal cord and brain.
