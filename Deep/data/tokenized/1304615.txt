Remarkable changes in personality, emotion and behavior were observed in a 66-year-old female with bilateral infarction of the medial inferior portion at the temporo-occipital region. Aggressiveness, emotional lability and indifference were noted in the patient as psychiatric manifestation. No definite delirium, however, was observed. A neuroradiological examination revealed the lesions located at the territory of the posterior cerebral artery, which involved the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyri, the fusiform gyri and the lingual gyri. Therefore, the psychiatric disturbances and the neuropsychological symptoms presented here are attributed to these lesions with the multiple infarctions in the brain. The present case is noteworthy for its unique changes in personality and emotion which in the literature have not reported to be caused following the vascular accident of the bilateral posterior cerebral artery.
