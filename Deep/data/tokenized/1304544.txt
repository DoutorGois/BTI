Paired-pulse depression (PPD) technique was used to investigate the potency of recurrent synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA in area CA1 of 54 hippocampal slices from coriaria lactone (CL)-kindled and control rats. When paired stimuli were sent to the axon of CA1 pyramidal cell and Schaffer collaterals, the effect of population spike PPD lasted about 40-60ms; no significant change was observed on PPD potency between kindled and control groups (P = 0.06, 2-way ANOVA). The results indicate that the GABA-ergic synaptic inhibition seemed not to play a key role in the maintenance of the chemical kindling induced by CL.
