Limbic seizures were provoked in freely moving rats by intrahippocampal administration of the muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine via a microdialysis probe (10 mM for 40 min at 2 microliters/min). Changes in extracellular hippocampal and cerebellar glutamate, aspartate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels were monitored during and after pilocarpine administration. Effects of systemic or local administration of anticonvulsants on the seizures and concomitant changes in amino-acid concentrations, were investigated. Pilocarpine-induced seizures were completely abolished after intraperitoneal premedication for 7 days with phenobarbital (15 mg/kg per day) and after intrahippocampal administration of 10 mM phenobarbital and 1 mM carbamazepine (180 min at 2 microliters/min). Rats premedicated with carbamazepine (5 mg/kg per day) still developed seizures. The changes in extracellular hippocampal amino-acid levels suggest that glutamate, aspartate and GABA are not involved in seizure onset, but may play a role in seizure maintenance and/or spread in the pilocarpine animal model of epilepsy. The increases in extracellular amino acids in ipsi- and contralateral cerebellum following limbic seizures provoked in the hippocampus, probably play a role in the 'reversed' diaschisis phenomenon.
