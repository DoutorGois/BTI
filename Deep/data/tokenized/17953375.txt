OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of Levetiracetam (LEV) on the sodium currents of rat hippocampal neurons exposed to epileptogenic coriaria lactone (CL). METHODS: Acutely isolated Sprague-Dawley Rat hippocampal neurons were subjected to the whole-cell mode of patch clamp under experimental conditions designed to detect voltage-gated sodium currents. The CL (0.2 mg/mL) was used to increase the sodium currents of the neurons. Then the LEV was added (150 or 300 micromol/L) to test the effect of LEV on the peak current amplitudes through a comparison with the control group in which extracellular solution was added instead and the group in which nothing was added. Another. group was pretreated with 300 micromol/L of LEV before the neutrons were treated with the CL. RESULTS: The maximum peak amplitudes (MPA) of the sodium currents increased 36.92% +/- 2.84% by the 150 micromol/L of LEV (P < 0.05), similar to those exposed to the CL only (P > 0.05). The increase of MPA of the sodium currents by the 300 micromol/L of LEV (16.58% +/- 1.56%) was less than those exposed to the CL only (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found between the 300 micromol/L LEV treated group and the control group (P > 0.05). The MPA of the sodium currents of LEV pretreated neutrons increased 32.86% +/- 6.73% (P < 0.05), similar to those without pretreatment (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The LEV does not decrease the sodium currents of rat hippocampal neurons induced by the CL. The antiepileptic action of LEV has nothing to do with the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels.
