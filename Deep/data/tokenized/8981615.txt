Rats with 36 nM or 54 nM of phencyclidine (PCP), 36 nM of naloxone or saline injected into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus were tested for acquisition of a spatial continuous recognition memory task. Results indicate that relative to controls and rats with 36 nM of PCP or 36 nM of naloxone injections, rats with 54 nM of PCP injections were impaired in acquisition of the task across all lags as measured by increased in latency for repeated items. Since it is assumed that successful learning of this continuous recognition memory task depends upon processes associated with consolidation of new learning into long term memory, it appears that high doses of PCP, but not naloxone are sufficient to impair this process.
