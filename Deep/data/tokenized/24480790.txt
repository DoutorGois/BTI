Mutations in GABRG2, which encodes the gamma2 subunit of GABAA receptors, can cause both genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) and Dravet syndrome. Most GABRG2 truncating mutations associated with Dravet syndrome result in premature termination codons (PTCs) and are stably translated into mutant proteins with potential dominant-negative effects. This study involved search for mutations in candidate genes for Dravet syndrome, namely SCN1A, 2A, 1B, 2B, GABRA1, B2, and G2. A heterozygous nonsense mutation (c.118C>T, p.Q40X) in GABRG2 was identified in dizygotic twin girls with Dravet syndrome and their apparently healthy father. Electrophysiological studies with the reconstituted GABAA receptors in HEK cells showed reduced GABA-induced currents when mutated gamma2 DNA was cotransfected with wild-type alpha1 and beta2 subunits. In this case, immunohistochemistry using antibodies to the alpha1 and gamma2 subunits of GABAA receptor showed granular staining in the soma. In addition, microinjection of mutated gamma2 subunit cDNA into HEK cells severely inhibited intracellular trafficking of GABAA receptor subunits alpha1 and beta2, and retention of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The mutated gamma2 subunit-expressing neurons also showed impaired axonal transport of the alpha1 and beta2 subunits. Our findings suggested that different phenotypes of epilepsy, e.g., GEFS+ and Dravet syndrome (which share similar abnormalities in causative genes) are likely due to impaired axonal transport associated with the dominant-negative effects of GABRG2.
