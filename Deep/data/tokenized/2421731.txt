Adult rats received intraventricular injections of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) to destroy serotonin (5-HT)-containing nerve terminals throughout the brain. When the animals were killed 3 or 21 days later, we observed a marked decrease in 5-HT content in septum and hippocampus and a parallel decline in in vitro high affinity 5-HT uptake. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations also were reduced but by a much smaller extent, resulting in significant increases in the ratio of 5-HIAA to 5-HT. These changes were accompanied by similar increases in the ratio of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity to 5-HT content. The relative increases in TPH activity resulted from two temporally distinct processes, the first of which appeared to be an activation that could be mimicked in vitro by Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation. We conclude that, after partial damage to 5-HT neurons, there is a compensatory increase in the synthesis and release of 5-HT from those terminals that remain.
