The transcription factor COUP-TFI (NR2F1), an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is an important regulator of neurogenesis, cellular differentiation and cell migration. In the forebrain, COUP-TFI controls the connectivity between thalamus and cortex and neuronal tangential migration in the basal telencephalon. Here, we show that COUP-TFI is required for proper axonal growth and guidance of all major forebrain commissures. Fibres of the corpus callosum, the hippocampal commissure and the anterior commissure project aberrantly and fail to cross the midline in COUP-TFI null mutants. Moreover, hippocampal neurons lacking COUP-TFI have a defect in neurite outgrowth and show an abnormal axonal morphology. To search for downstream effectors, we used microarray analysis and showed that, in the absence of COUP-TFI, expression of various cytoskeleton molecules involved in neuronal morphogenesis is affected. Diminished protein levels of the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B and increased levels of the GTP-binding protein RND2 were confirmed in the developing cortex in vivo and in primary hippocampal neurons in vitro. Therefore, based on morphological studies, gene expression profiling and primary cultured neurons, the present data uncover a previously unappreciated intrinsic role for COUP-TFI in axonal growth in vivo and supply one of the premises for COUP-TFI coordination of neuronal morphogenesis in the developing forebrain.
