Involvement of prostaglandins (PGs) and histamine in the hypothalamus and hippocampus in the clonidine-induced pituitary-adrenocortical response was investigated in conscious rats. The hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) activity was assessed indirectly by measuring corticosterone secretion. Clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, given intracerebroventricularly (10 micrograms icv), considerably increased the serum corticosterone and hypothalamic histamine levels and markedly elevated the hippocampal histamine levels. Systemic or icv pretreatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg or 10 micrograms), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, significantly reduced the clonidine-induced corticosterone response and abolished the increase in the hypothalamic and hippocampal histamine levels elicited by clonidine. Indomethacin in the doses used did not substantially change the resting serum corticosterone or hypothalamic and hippocampal histamine levels. These results indicate that prostaglandins and hypothalamic histamine are considerably involved in the HPA response to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation. They also suggest involvement of prostaglandins and histamine of the hippocampus in the clonidine-induced HPA response.
