This unit presents a procedure for the preparation of acute mammalian hippocampal slices for electrophysiological recording. Although this protocol should not be taken as the only means of making brain slices, it is a widely-used typical procedure. It is simple and straightforward. It can be used on a variety of mammalian species, though it is discussed here for use in rats.
