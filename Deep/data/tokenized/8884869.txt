Since adenosine has been shown to mediate some actions of ethanol we have examined the effect of ethanol (20 and 80 mM) or its metabolite acetate (5 and 20 mM) on the formation and release of adenosine by rat hippocampal slices. The ATP pool of the slices was radioactively labelled by preincubation with [3H]-adenine. The efflux of radioactivity under basal conditions and following ATP breakdown induced by combined hypoxia/hypoglycaemia was examined. Ethanol or acetate did not increase the total efflux of [3H]-purines, but changed the composition to a larger proportion of [3H]-adenosine. The release of endogenous adenosine was also increased. This type of effect exactly mirrors that previously reported for purine nucleoside transport inhibitors. The present results thus show that ethanol (20 mM) can increase adenosine release from a brain slice by a mechanism that probably involves transport inhibition.
