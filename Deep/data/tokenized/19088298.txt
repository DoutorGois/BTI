We examined therapeutic in vitro and in vivo approaches using lentivirus-based packaging of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the non-integrin laminin receptor mRNA for treatment and prevention of prion disorders. Transfection of N2aSc(+) cells with recombinant plasmids expressing three different siRNAs, significantly reduced both the LRP (laminin receptor precursor) and PrP(Sc) levels by approximately 40-60 %. Stereotactic intracerebral microinjection of recombinant lentiviral vectors LVsiRNA-LRP 7 and 9 into the cortex of C57BL/6 wild-type mice resulted in a significant reduction of the LR levels in the cortex 15 days post-injection by 62 and 82 %, respectively. Intracerebral RML inoculation of C57BL/6 mice after microinjection with recombinant lentiviral vector LVsiRNA-LRP 7 into the hippocampus resulted in a significant reduction of both LRP and PrP(Sc) levels by 36 and 41 %, respectively, concomitant with a significant prolongation of the pre-clinical phase. Lentiviral vectors expressing siRNAs targeting LRP mRNA represent a novel delivery system for the treatment of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
