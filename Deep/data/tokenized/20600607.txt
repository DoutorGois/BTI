Neurogenesis is important for developing certain forms of memory. Recently, hippocampal cell proliferation has been implicated in the development of drug addiction, an extreme form of emotional/motivational pathological memory. Aiming to explore the role of hippocampal neural cell proliferation in cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), we treated rats with whole brain X-irradiation, which substantially decreases the number of progenitor cells in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the expression of cocaine-induced CPP. These results suggest that the existing neural network, rather than potential new neural circuits mediated by adult neurogenesis, is sufficient for the acquisition of cocaine-induced CPP.
