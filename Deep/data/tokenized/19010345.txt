Even though the role of the serotonin1A (5-HT(1A))-receptor for cognitive processes is undisputed, the exact involvement of pre- and postsynaptic sites remains unexplained. Recently, we introduced a mouse line overexpressing the 5-HT(1A)-receptor in the hippocampus and cortex. In this study we investigated in comparison to wild-type mice their cognitive abilities using the Morris water-maze task and inhibitory avoidance test. Acute effects of pre- and posttraining administered 8-OH-DPAT (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.p.) were examined in the inhibitory avoidance test. Additionally, habituation learning was studied in the hole-board test. Transgenic mice showed no overall learning deficit. Spatial learning and memory revealed in the Morris water-maze task was comparable to wild-type mice, and both genotypes habituated to the hole-board arena in a similar manner. Comparing the performance of both genotypes in the inhibitory avoidance test, cognitive functions of transgenic mice seemed to be slightly impaired. When 8-OH-DPAT was administered pretraining an amnesic effect was produced only in transgenic mice and only at the highest dose (0.3 mg/kg). Posttraining administered 0.3 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT did not affect the performance of both genotypes. Overall, the cortical and hippocampal overexpression of the 5-HT(1A)-receptor had no major effect on cognitive functions in mice, suggesting that changes in the 5-HT(1A)-receptor density are not necessarily accompanied with alterations of learning and memory processes.
