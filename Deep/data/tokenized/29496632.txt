Aging is associated with a substantial decline in the expression of social behavior, as well as increased neuroinflammation. Since immune activation and subsequent increased expression of cytokines can suppress social behavior in young rodents, we examined age and sex differences in microglia within brain regions critical to social behavior regulation (PVN, BNST, and MEA) as well as in the hippocampus. Adult (3-month) and aged (18-month) male and female F344 (N = 26, n = 5-8/group) rats were perfused and Iba-1 immunopositive microglia were assessed using unbiased stereology and optical density. For stereology, microglia were classified based on the following criteria: (i) thin ramified processes, (ii) thick long processes, (iii) stout processes, or (iv) round/ameboid shape. Among the structures examined, the highest density of microglia was evident in the BNST and MEA. Aged rats of both sexes displayed increased total number of microglia number exclusively in the MEA. Sex differences also emerged, whereby aged females (but not males) displayed greater total number of microglia in the BNST relative to young adult counterparts. When morphological features of microglia were assessed, aged rats exhibited increased soma size in the BNST, MEA, and CA3. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive characterization of microglia number and morphology under ambient conditions in CNS sites critical for the normal expression of social processes. To the extent that microglia morphology is predictive of reactivity and subsequent cytokine release, these data suggest that the expression of social behavior in late aging may be adversely influenced by heightened inflammation.
