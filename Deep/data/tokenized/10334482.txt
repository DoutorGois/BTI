The densities of Pick bodies (PB), Pick cells (PC), senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the frontal and temporal lobe were determined in ten patients diagnosed with Pick's disease (PD). The density of PB was significantly higher in the dentate gyrus granule cells compared with the cortex and the CA sectors of the hippocampus. Within the hippocampus, the highest densities of PB were observed in sector CA1. PC were absent in the dentate gyrus and no significant differences in PC density were observed in the remaining brain regions. With the exception of two patients, the densities of SP and NFT were low with no significant differences in mean densities between cortical regions. In the hippocampus, the density of NFT was greatest in sector CA1. PB and PC densities were positively correlated in the frontal cortex but no correlations were observed between the PD and AD lesions. A principal components analysis (PCA) of the neuropathological variables suggested that variations in the densities of SP in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex and hippocampus were the most important sources of heterogeneity within the patient group. Variations in the densities of PB and NFT in the temporal cortex and hippocampus were of secondary importance. In addition, the PCA suggested that two of the ten patients were atypical. One patient had a higher than average density of SP and one familial patient had a higher density of NFT but few SP.
