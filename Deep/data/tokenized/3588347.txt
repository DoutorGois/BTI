Pain responsiveness and Met-enkephalin-like immunoreactivity (MLI) were studied in the rat after cold (25 degrees C) and immobilization stress for different lengths of time (30 min, 90 min and 180 min). The 30-min stress-induced analgesia (as measured by the tail-flick method), which was partially antagonized by pretreatment with naloxone (5 mg/kg, SC), and the magnitude of this analgesia was less than that of the 90-min stress or 180-min stress. The 30-min stress resulted in a significant decrease in MLI in the mesolimbic area, striatum, hypothalamus and thalamus. After the 90-min stress, MLI was found to be significantly decreased in the prefrontal cortex, amygdaloid nuclei and piriform cortex, thalamus and hippocampus, while the 180-min stress failed to induce a significant change in any brain area tested. As such a change in MLI content was thought to be related to an increase in the activity of the endogenous Met-enkephalin neuronal system, the activation of this system by the stress, especially in the hypothalamus and thalamus, seemed to be associated with analgesia.
