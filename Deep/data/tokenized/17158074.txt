PURPOSE: The findings of previous studies have been controversial regarding the optimal surgical procedures required for effective seizure control. In particular, there are varying views as to whether or not lesionectomy of a temporal-lobe-mass lesion is a satisfactory process or whether removal of additional seizure foci is necessary. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of additional removal of electrically positive foci using intraoperative electrocorticography on mass lesions related to temporal lobe epilepsy. METHODS: Thirty-five medically intractable epilepsy patients with temporal-lobe benign mass lesions, who had been surgically treated, were assessed. The relationship between resection of the epilepsy focus using intraoperative electrocorticography and seizure outcome was analyzed. In addition, the sites of residual spikes after lesion removal were evaluated. RESULTS: In this study, the benign mass lesions consisted of 21 gangliogliomas, 8 cavernous angiomas and 6 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors. The number of 3-year postoperative seizure-free incidences for the group that underwent lesionectomy plus additional spike-positive site resection equated to 90.9%. In contrast, in the group that underwent a lesionectomy only, 76.9% were seizure-free for 3-years postoperatively. After complete removal of mass lesions, 86.4% of the residual spikes were detected over the hippocampus. CONCLUSION: Even after the complete removal of temporal-lobe-mass lesions, a high frequency of residual spikes was obtained from the hippocampus. Effective surgical seizure control was achieved by carrying out additional procedures on the affected hippocampus. To detect seizure foci surrounding the lesion, especially over the hippocampus, intraoperative electrocorticogram monitoring was shown to be an effective technique.
