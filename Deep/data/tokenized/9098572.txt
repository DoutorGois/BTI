We investigated whether the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, could protect neurons in the immature brain from the excitotoxic affects of perforant path stimulation. A high dose of MK-801 reduced the number of injured hilar interneurons in the stimulated hippocampus from 30.0 +/- 5.2 in unmedicated rats to 12.2 +/- 9.6 in MK-801 treated animals (P < 0.05). MK-801 injection also protected the animals from the scattered dentate granule cell injury observed in non-medicated animals 1 day after stimulation. Other effects of drug injection included exacerbated damage in limbic cortices, retrosplenial cortical damage, and reduced inhibition in a highly epileptogenic region of the dentate gyrus. Our results show that a subpopulation of hilar interneurons is vulnerable to NMDA-induced damage in the immature hippocampus but that non-competitive blockade of the NMDA receptor may be a dangerous therapeutic strategy.
