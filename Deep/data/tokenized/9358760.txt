The chemokine receptor CCR5 has recently been described as a co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. In this study, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for human CCR5, we show by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry that CCR5 is expressed by bone-marrow-derived cells known to be targets for HIV-1 infection, including a subpopulation of lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages in blood, primary and secondary lymphoid organs, and noninflamed tissues. In the central nervous system, CCR5 is expressed on neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. In other tissues, CCR5 is expressed on epithelium, endothelium, vascular smooth muscle, and fibroblasts. Chronically inflamed tissues contain an increased number of CCR5+ mononuclear cells, and the number of immunoreactive cells is directly associated with a histopathological correlate of inflammatory severity. Collectively, these results suggest that CCR5+ cells are recruited to inflammatory sites and, as such, may facilitate transmission of macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1.
