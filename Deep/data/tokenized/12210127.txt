cAMP is a ubiquitous second messenger, which acts mainly through specific protein kinases that consist of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. An unsolved problem in cAMP physiology is how it can regulate so many cellular functions through this simple enzymatic cascade. A tentative explanation is related to the different biochemical properties of the four regulatory subunit isoforms (RI alpha and RI beta, RII alpha and RII beta) and to their differential cell and tissue distribution. For example, detergent insoluble aggregates of RI alpha are present in some cholinergic neurons of the adult rat brain. Rat brains, from the embryonic stage to old age, were examined for the presence of highly concentrated clusters of RI alpha. They are present only in some neurons of restricted brain areas, for a limited time span. During development, labeled neurons appear in different brain areas after neuron migration, at a stage of advanced functional maturation. They have their greatest expression after birth but before sexual maturation, and then they slowly decline, persisting only in a few brain areas throughout life. The first appearance, time course, and eventual disappearance is different in the different brain areas: RI alpha clusters appear in brainstem, hypothalamus, and accessory olfactory bulb at a late embryonic stage; in the main olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and medial thalamic nuclei shortly after birth; and in the cortex as late as in the third and fourth postnatal week. During the rat's lifespan, the distribution of these peculiar RI alpha clusters undergo changes that may contribute to shape neuronal responses differentially to agents modifying cAMP levels.
