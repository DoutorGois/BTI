Resveratrol (Res) is a phytoalexin produced naturally by several plants, which has multi functional effects such as neuroprotection, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer. The present study was to evaluate a possible anti-epileptic effect of Res against kainate-induced temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in rat. We performed behavior monitoring, intracranial electroencepholography (IEEG) recording, histological analysis, and Western blotting to evaluate the anti-epilepsy effect of Res in kainate-induced epileptic rats. Res decreased the frequency of spontaneous seizures and inhibited the epileptiform discharges. Moreover, Res could protect neurons against kainate-induced neuronal cell death in CA1 and CA3a regions and depressed mossy fiber sprouting, which are general histological characteristics both in TLE patients and animal models. Western blot revealed that the expression level of kainate receptors (KARs) in hippocampus was reduced in Res-administrated rats compared to that in epileptic ones. These results suggest that Res is a potent anti-epilepsy agent, which protects against epileptogenesis and progression of the kainate-induced TLE animal.
