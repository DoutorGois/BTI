Neuropathological findings obtained from a female patient, 49 years of age, with progeria adultorum (Werner's syndrome) are described in this paper. Vascular sclerosis with multiple ischaemic infarctions, cerebral atrophy, and vascular myelopathy were the most strongly pronounced CNS findings. Also recorded were severe lipofuscin depositions from the cortex, dentate nucleus, and olivae as well as amylaceous bodies in the insula of Reil and the hippocampus. Neurofibrillary tangles or plaques were not recordable. The central nervous system proved somewhat comparable to other organs, in that mesenchymal regressive changes were the main features.
