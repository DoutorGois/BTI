Previous studies have produced conflicting results about the effects of intracerebral injection of NGF after septal damage in rats: in one experiment, behavioral deficits in maze tasks were exacerbated by NGF administration whereas they were alleviated in another one. The present investigation aimed to clarify the effects of NGF and to identify factors liable to induce different behavioral outcomes. Behavioral effects were assessed following a postsurgical delay of five months using various parameters: food consumption in a novel environment, spontaneous activity, locomotion in an open-field, immobility in a tail suspension test, spontaneous alternation in a T-maze and performance in a radial eight-arm maze. Possible influence of intrahippocampal sympathetic fiber ingrowth occurring after septal lesions was ruled out, as the comparison of rats subjected to superior cervical ganglia removal with their lesion-control counterparts showed few behavioral differences, even after NGF administration. All lesioned rats showed reduced adaptability in most of these tests. Grafts partially reversed the lesion-induced deficit in spontaneous alternation. A single intracerebral NGF injection was found to ameliorate radial maze performance, whether rats were grafted or not. However, it appeared that the number of strategies available to NGF-rats in the radial maze task was as limited as for lesion-control rats. These findings suggest that NGF-rats do not recover spatial abilities lost after septal lesions, but are able to make more efficient use of remaining capacities to master the maze task.
