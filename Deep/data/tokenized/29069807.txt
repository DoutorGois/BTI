Major depression has various types of symptoms and disease courses with inconsistent response to monoamine-related antidepressants. Thus, monoamine theory may not be the only pathophysiologic pathway relevant to depression. Recently, it has been suggested that regulatory T cell (Treg) is associated with depression. Based on our previous study that showed decreased regulatory T cell (Treg) population following chronic high-dose captopril (CHC, 40 mg/kg/day * 21 days) administration, we examined whether CHC alone can induce depressive-like behaviors in mice even without stressful stimuli. In this study, we found that CHC induced depressive-like behaviors in tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST) without systemic illness, while it did not induce anhedonic behavior, anxiety-like behaviors, or sociality-related behavior. The depressive-like behaviors were rescued by either CHC washout or antidepressant. CHC caused reduction in foxp3 and gata3 mRNA expression in the lymph nodes with elevation in plasma IL-1beta and IL-6. Interestingly, CHC increased serum angiotensin II level. In the hippocampus, CHC increased TNF-alpha and IL-6 mRNA expression with microglia activation while reduced glucocorticoid receptor expression. However, CHC did not affect to hippocampal kynurenine pathway, serotonin level, hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA level, or serum corticosterone level. Consequently, we propose that CHC may induce a specific form of depressive-like behaviors via Treg reduction and microglial activation.
