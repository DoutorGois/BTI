We describe an automated volumetric measure of the hippocampus obtained with software called the Knowledge-Guided MRI Analysis Program (KGMAP). Postmortem MR images from 56 participants in the Nun Study were used to validate the measure. KGMAP-determined volumes strongly correlated with those obtained with manual tracings and neurofibrillary pathologic findings of Alzheimer disease in the hippocampus. KGMAP provides a rapid and accurate estimate of hippocampal volume that is suitable for use in clinical practice.
