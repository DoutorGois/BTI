Using sodium (NaN3)-induced anoxia plus aglycaemia as a model of chemically-induced ischemia, we have characterized the endogenous release of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids from superfused hippocampal slices. Chemical ischemia produced an azide (1-30 mM) dose-dependent increase in the efflux of glutamate, aspartate and GABA. These increases were attenuated to varying degrees by removal of Ca2+, or the addition of the voltage dependent Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX), the selective Ca2+ channel blockers conotoxin MVIIA, MVIIC, and nifedipine, the NMDA antagonist MK801, the AMPA antagonist GYKI-52466. Similarly, addition of the GLT-1 glutamate transport inhibitor dihydrokainate (DHK) and the anti-estrogen/anion channel blocker tamoxifen also attenuated the efflux of glutamate and GABA. It would therefore appear that the increases in amino acid efflux induced by chemical ischemia originates from both the neuronal pool, via conventional exocytotic release, and glial sources via reversal of the GLT-1 transporter and anion channel regulated cell swelling.
