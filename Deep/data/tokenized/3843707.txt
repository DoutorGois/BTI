The effects of hippocampal ablation on acquisition rates and temporal characteristics of classically conditioned nictitating membrane responses were examined in groups of rabbits trained with a 150-, 300-, or 600-ms interstimulus interval. Acquisition rates were accelerated in the 150- and 600-ms groups. No effect was present in the 300-ms group. Response onset latencies were also affected in the 150-ms group. These findings were interpreted to support the notion that the hippocampus modulates learned motor behavior by a neural model of the response to be executed.
