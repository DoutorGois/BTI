We studied the effects of pre-treatment (15 days) with oral administration of Ginkgo biloba extract (Ph-Gb 37.5-150 mg/kg) on brain malonildialdehyde (MDA), brain edema, brain nitrite and nitrate and delayed neuronal death following transient cerebral ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil. Survival was not modified, however, pre-treatment with Ginkgo biloba significantly and in a dose-dependent way reduced post-ischemic brain MDA levels and post-ischemic brain edema. Delayed neuronal death in the CA1 of the hippocampus was attenuated by the highest dose of the extract. Increase of nitrite and nitrate was observed after cerebral ischemia in the hippocampus and it was dose-dependently reduced in animals pretreated with Ph-Gb, thus suggesting that neuroprotective effects of Ginkgo biloba may be due to an inhibitory action on nitric oxide formation.
