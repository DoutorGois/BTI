Several interrelationships exist between basal ganglia and hippocampus. The ventral striatum appears to be involved in the control of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway. The caudate, in turn, seems to influence the hippocampal theta rhythm and to inhibit hippocampal spikes. In the present work the role played by globus pallidus pars interna and substantia nigra pars compacta on hippocampal bioelectrical activity is studied. Injection of sodium penicillin i.v. produces steady interictal spikes in the hippocampus. Substantia nigra stimulation induces regular theta rhythm and inhibits the spikes. Pallidal stimulation, on the contrary, appears to strongly enhance epileptiform activity, proceeding to generalised seizure activity. The results are discussed in the light of a putative feedback loop from basal ganglia to hippocampus, probably underlying co-participation of the two subcortical structures in the control of motor behaviour.
