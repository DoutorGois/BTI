The entorhinal (perforant path) projection to the dentate gyrus was labeled with an anterograde horseradish peroxidase method to test whether prenatal exposure to ethanol affected the normal development of afferent lamination. Mean ethanol consumption of the ethanol-consuming dams was 12.7 g/kg +/- 0.3 g per day during days 1-21 of gestation. Adult offspring of normal and pair-fed controls as well as ethanol-exposed rats were analyzed. Computer-assisted image analysis of the entorhinal terminal field organization revealed no permanent changes in the development of the afferent lamination pattern in the dentate gyrus molecular layer in spite of the heavy in utero ethanol exposure.
