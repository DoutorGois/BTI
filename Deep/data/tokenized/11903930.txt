Corpora amylacea (CAm) are regarded as a hallmark of brain ageing, but little is known about their role in normal and pathological circumstances. CAm contain, in addition to glucose polymers, ageing-, stress- and proinflammatory proteins. In view of their almost universal occurrence and their cumulation with time, formation of CAm may represent a basic mechanism for the management of metabolic degradation products. In this context, we studied samples from post-mortem cases with repetitive brain hypoxic episodes in the past history. We investigated, by immunohistochemistry, the presence of Bcl-2, c-jun and bax in CAm. CAm showed immunoreactivity for the mitochondrial membrane associated protein Bcl-2, and for the major component of activator protein 1 transcriptional factor c-Jun. We found higher numbers of CAm in the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus in cases with repetitive cerebral hypoxia than in controls. We conclude that: (1) the presence of C-Jun and Bcl-2 within the glucose polymer mass of CAm may be related to mitochondrial damage and/or a transient overload of proteolytic systems during cellular injury; and (2) repetitive cellular stress during life may cause the age-related increase of CAm in elderly subjects.
