Senescence-accelerated mouse (SAMP8) is known as a murine model of accelerated aging and memory dysfunction. The binding activity of [3H] 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide (PK-11195) as a neurochemical marker of gliosis markedly increased with aging in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of SAMP8. Immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was also enhanced. A beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP)-like immunoreactivity and 27-kDa-carboxyl terminal fragments of APP increased in SAMP8 brain. In addition, anti-APP antibody stained reactive astrocytes surrounding spongy degeneration in brain stern of SAMP8. These results suggest that astrocytosis and production of APP-derived fragments occur markedly in SAMP8 brains.
