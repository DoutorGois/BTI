Long term memory formation obviously is accompanied by changes in macromolecule synthesis within the brain structures involved. The regulation of this process was investigated in various rat brain regions using the model of histone acetylation with [14C]-acetate during the training session, as well as 5 min and 120 min upon completion of training. Almost at all three times and in most brain structures the acetylation rate was diminished in trained animals as compared to pseudo-conditioned rats. With the exception of hippocampus labeling in trained animals was even lower in comparison to passive controls.
