Hypertension is major risk factor leading to cerebrovascular pathologies. N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and renin-angiotensin system are involved in neuronal plasticity, as well as cognitive functions in the hippocampus. In this study, we examined the effects of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, on the levels of hippocampal NMDAR subunits; NR2A and NR2B in L-NAME (N(epsilon)-nitro-L-arginine Methyl Ester)-induced hypertensive rats. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured as a marker for lipid peroxidation. Compared with the control group, the MDA level was significantly increased after 8 weeks in the L-NAME-treated group. Rats treated with lisinopril and L-NAME plus lisinopril were found to have significantly decreased hippocampal MDA levels. Regarding the hippocampal concentrations of NR2A and NR2B, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. We demonstrated that lisinopril treatment has no direct regulatory effect on the levels of NR2A and NR2B in the rat hippocampus. Our results showed that Lisinopril could act as an antioxidant agent against hypertension-induced oxidative stress in rat hippocampus. The findings support that the use of lisinopril may offer a good alternative in the treatment of hypertension by reducing not only blood pressure but also prevent hypertensive complications in the brain.
