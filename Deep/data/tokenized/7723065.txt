Although duration of unconsciousness is commonly used as a prognostic index following traumatic brain injury (TBI), few controlled studies have statistically evaluated the relationship between unconsciousness and histologic pathology, particularly after moderate head injury. Using a pendulum-striker concussive device, a reproducible model of TBI in rats was developed. This model is uncomplicated by skull fractures, contusions, or experimenter-induced craniotomies. In the present study, the severity of the histopathology observed in this model of moderate closed-head injury at 48 h posttrauma is linearly related to the duration of unconsciousness (p < 0.0001). The pathology, assessed with a silver stain for neurodegeneration, is particularly striking if unconsciousness persists for 4 minutes or more. These data suggest that the initial period of unconsciousness may be a useful predictor of clinical brain histopathology associated with moderate closed-head injury, predicting either the degree of pathology and/or the rate it progresses if left untreated.
