The study of factors that regulate the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) is essential to understand neural development as well as brain regeneration. The Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells (NFAT) is a family of transcription factors that can affect these processes besides playing key roles during development, such as stimulating axonal growth in neurons, maturation of immune system cells, heart valve formation, and differentiation of skeletal muscle and bone. Interestingly, NFAT signaling can also promote cell differentiation in adults, participating in tissue regeneration. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the expression of NFAT isoforms in NPCs, and to investigate its possible role in NPC survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Our findings indicate that NFAT proteins are active not only in neurogenic brain regions such as hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ), but also in cultured NPCs. The inhibition of NFAT activation with the peptide VIVIT reduced neurosphere size and cell density in NPC cultures by decreasing proliferation and increasing cell death. VIVIT also decreased NPC migration and differentiation of astrocytes and neurons from NPCs. In addition, we identified NFATc3 as a predominant NFAT isoform in NPC cultures, finding that a constitutively-active form of NFATc3 expressed by adenoviral infection reduces NPC proliferation, stimulates migration, and is a potent inducer of NPC differentiation into astrocytes and neurons. In summary, our work uncovers active roles for NFAT signaling in NPC survival, proliferation and differentiation, and highlights its therapeutic potential for tissue regeneration.
