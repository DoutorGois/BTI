Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a single session of 100 inescapable tail shocks (IS). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered 1 h, 2 days or 7 days later and hippocampal cell proliferation (CP) was assessed after a 2-h survival period. Measures of plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were also obtained. Despite a large increase in CORT immediately following IS, no associated change in CP was observed. In fact, the only significant change in CP was seen 7 days after IS, at a time when CORT was unchanged from control levels. These data raise questions about the general nature of the relationship between CORT and CP. They also suggest that, under some conditions, changes in hippocampal CP may emerge only after an "incubation period".
