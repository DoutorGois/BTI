Neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD) occurs in the brains of patients with myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 1. The authors report a similar tau pathology in the CNS of a patient with DM2 and compare it to that of patients with DM1. A reduced expression of tau exon 2 and exon 3 epitopes is observed in both DM1 and DM2. This suggests a similar physiopathologic process that may contribute to common neurologic features in patients with DM.
