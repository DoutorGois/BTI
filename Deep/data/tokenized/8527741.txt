We characterized the electrophysiological properties of calcium channels in cultured rat hippocampal neurones using omega-agatoxin-TK (omega-Aga-TK) and compared them with those of the P-type channel and the BI (alpha 1A) channel which resembles the Q-type channel. Two types of omega-Aga-TK-sensitive calcium channels were detected in hippocampal neurones. The first type showed slow inactivation, high sensitivity to omega-Aga-TK and low reversibility from omega-Aga-TK-induced block, resembling the P-type channel. The second type showed fast inactivation, low sensitivity to omega-Aga-TK and high reversibility from omega-Aga-TK-induced block. These results suggest that the second type of calcium channel (Q-type-like) plays a prominent role in the hippocampal synaptic transmission.
