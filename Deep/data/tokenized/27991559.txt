Neurexins are transmembrane synaptic cell adhesion molecules involved in the development and maturation of neuronal synapses. In the present study, we report that Nrxn3beta is processed by the metalloproteases ADAM10, ADAM17, and by the intramembrane-cleaving protease gamma-secretase, producing secreted neurexin3beta (sNrxn3beta) and a single intracellular domain (Nrxn3beta-ICD). We further completed the full characterization of the sites at which Nrxn3beta is processed by these proteases. Supporting the physiological relevance of the Nrxn3beta processing, we demonstrate in vivo a significant effect of the secreted shedding product sNrxn3beta on the morphological development of adult newborn neurons in the mouse hippocampus. We show that sNrxn3beta produced by the cells of the dentate gyrus increases the spine density of newborn neurons whereas sNrxn3beta produced by the newborn neuron itself affects the number of its mossy fiber terminal extensions. These results support a pivotal role of sNrxn3beta in plasticity and network remodeling during neuronal development.
