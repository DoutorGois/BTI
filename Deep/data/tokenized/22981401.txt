Cofilin is the major actin-depolymerizing factor in the CNS for the regulation of actin dynamics. Neurodegenerative stimuli can induce the formation of cofilin rod, a pathological structure composed of cofilin and actin. The formation of cofilin rod was found to disrupt synapse function and cause neurite loss. The aim of the present study is to study the whole process of cofilin rod formation pattern in cultured hippocampal neurons under excitotoxic stimulation and to explore its underlying pharmacological mechanism. By using live cell imaging of neurons overexpressing EGFP-tagged wild type cofilin, we found a two-phase pattern of rod formation induced by glutamate stimulation. The early phase of rod formation occurred shortly after stimulation ( approximately 0.5h) but quickly dissolved within 2h. The second phase happened within a much longer time window, 8h after stimulation. Immunostaining of endogenous cofilin in neurons also confirmed this glutamate stimulation induced two-phase rod formation pattern. The first phase was co-related with intracellular calcium concentration and pH increase while the second phase was not. These two phases of cofilin rod formation induced by glutamate stimulation was antagonized by both non-NMDA and NMDA receptor antagonist DNQX and AP5, respectively. Our results for the first time demonstrate the dynamic cofilin rod formation pattern under stress stimulation in detail by time lapse imaging. These findings reveal a novel time course of excitotoxicity induced neuronal damage and indicate a potential target of neuropathy treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
