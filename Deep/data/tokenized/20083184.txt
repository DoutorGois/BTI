AIM OF STUDY: To determine the effect of jujuboside A (JuA) in modulating the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor subunits gene expression of hippocampal neurons at different terms in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hippocampal neurons of rat were cultured in vitro, treated with JuA or diazepam (DZP). Then GABA(A) receptor mRNAs were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: JuA at the low dose of 41 microM (about 0.05 g/l) induced significant increase of GABA(A) receptor alpha1, alpha5, beta2 subunit mRNAs in both 24 and 72h treatments. JuA at the high dose of 82 microM (about 0.1g/l) significantly increased GABA(A) receptor alpha1, alpha5 subunit mRNA levels and decreased beta2 subunit mRNA level at 24h treatment, and decreased GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha1, beta2 mRNAs expression at 72h treatment. DZP of 10 microM significantly increased expression of GABA(A) receptor subunit alpha1, alpha5 and decreased expression of beta2 at 24h treatment, and decreased alpha1, alpha5, beta2 subunits gene expression at 72h treatment. CONCLUSION: Differences in alterations in GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs expression following JuA and DZP treatments could help to explain the differences in the pharmacological action of the two drugs.
