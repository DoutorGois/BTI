To date, EEG studies towards strain differences have focussed on pharmacologically altered or pathological EEG activity, but only few studies have investigated strain differences and normal EEG activity. A strong relation between behaviour and EEG activity has been demonstrated, especially for hippocampal EEG activity. This relation is known to be similar across species and strains, but no direct comparisons between rat strains within one study have been made. This study compared two rat strains (Sprague-Dawley and Long-Evans) with regard to open-field behaviour and concurrent hippocampal EEG recordings. A detailed behavioural analysis was made and spectral power was calculated for corresponding EEG activity in eight frequency bands. The two strains differed in exploratory activity and in spectral power in the 9-10-Hz frequency band (high frequency rhythmical slow activity [RSA] 6-10 Hz). Long-Evans rats showed higher exploratory activity and higher 9-10 Hz spectral power for voluntary movement and sniffing behaviours. Our results demonstrated these behaviour-specific strain differences in RSA power, although the relation between EEG and behaviour within each strain was similar. The strain differences in EEG were interpreted in relation to strain differences in exploratory behaviour, attributing the differences to a main motor component but also to a smaller sensory component integrated in exploratory behaviour. This is in accordance with theories on the sensory-motor function of the hippocampus and hippocampal theta activity.
