Benzodiazepine binding sites were studied by autoradiography in several hippocampic layers in brains of drug-free violent suicide victims (hanging) and matched controls. Kd was increased in suicides, and when brain sections from control subjects were incubated in the bath fluid that had previously served to incubate sections from suicides, Kd was increased in the same way. Results are discussed in terms of possible modulators of benzodiazepine binding sites, mainly tissue GABA and amino acid concentrations.
