The role of septo-hippocampal connections in spatial behaviour is examined in lesion and stimulation experiments in rats. Destruction of septo-hippocampal connections produces a severe and enduring deficit in the ability to perform a spatial memory task. Furthermore, crossed unilateral lesions of the entorhinal area and fimbria-fornix produce the same deficit as bilateral lesions in either the entorhinal area or the fimbria-fornix, as predicted from a disconnection analysis of hippocampal lesions. Evidence also suggests that septo-hippocampal damage produces a greater deficit in spatial behaviours when a flexible response is required than when a consistent response is required, although this difference is a relative one rather than an absolute one. Finally, disruptive stimulation of the hippocampus while rats are performing a spatial memory task produces retrograde amnesia but not proactive interference. Taken together, these data indicate an important role of the septo-hippocampal system in spatial behaviour, and in the maintenance of spatial memories.
