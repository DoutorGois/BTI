Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are intracellular calcium-release channels found on the endoplasmic reticulum of all cells. All three RyR isoforms, RyR1-3, are expressed in the brain, with RyR2 predominating. RyRs are localized within the soma, axons, dendritic spines, and presynaptic terminals of neurons. RyRs are highly expressed in the cerebellum, hippocampus, olfactory region, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. During the physiological processes of development and aging, the intracellular calcium homeostasis is largely regulated by RyRs. In this review, we discussed the potential mechanisms underlying development- and age-related RyR regulation. Dysregulation of RyRs can cause imbalance of intracellular calcium levels, leading to cellular vulnerability, impairment of synaptic neuronal function, and eventually neuronal death. Regulation of RyRs may play an essential role in cellular senescence associated with aging, and thus may be pharmacological targets for slowing down aberrant processes and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
