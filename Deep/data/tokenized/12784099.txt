Phencyclidine (PCP) induces a psychotomimetic state that closely resembles schizophrenia. Therefore, PCP-treated animals can provide a model for schizophrenia. Using differential display, we identified a gene regulated by the delayed action of PCP in rat nucleus accumbens (NAcs). Sequence analysis showed that the cDNA clone obtained was identical to rat synapse-associated protein 90/postsynaptic density-95-associated protein 1 (SAPAP1). Quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed that SAPAP1 mRNA had increased significantly in rat NAc (P<0.0001) and hippocampus (P<0.01) 24 h after a PCP (10 mg/kg) injection as compared to the controls. Immunoquantification using an anti-SAPAP1 antibody indicated that immunoreactivity for SAPAP1 increased significantly (P&<0.05) in the NAcs of unmedicated patients with schizophrenia, as compared to the control subjects and medicated patients with schizophrenia. Our findings support the hypothesis that there is abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia and show evidence of abnormalities in the intracellular signal transduction via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.
