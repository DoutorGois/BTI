Chemical LTD (CLTD) of synaptic transmission is triggered by simultaneously increasing presynaptic [cGMP] while inhibiting PKA. Here, we supply evidence that class II, but not III, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and A1 adenosine receptors, both negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, play physiologic roles in providing PKA inhibition necessary to promote the induction of LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in hippocampal slices. Simultaneous activation of group II mGluRs with the selective agonist (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxy-cyclopropyl) glycine (DCGIV; 5 microM), while raising [cGMP] with the type V phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast (20 microM), resulted in a long-lasting depression of synaptic strength. When zaprinast (20 microM) was combined with a cell-permeant PKA inhibitor H-89 (10 microM), the need for mGluR IIs was bypassed. DCGIV, when combined with a "submaximal" low frequency stimulation (1 Hz/400 s), produced a saturating LTD. The mGluR II selective antagonist, (2S)-alpha-ethylglutamic acid (EGLU; 5 microM), blocked induction of LTD by prolonged low frequency stimulation (1 Hz/900 s). In contrast, the mGluR III selective receptor blocker, (RS)-a-Cyclopropyl-[3- 3H]-4-phosphonophenylglycine (CPPG; 10 microM), did not impair LTD. The selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX; 100 nM), also blocked induction of LTD, while the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA; 50 nM) significantly enhanced the magnitude of LTD induced by submaximal LFS and, when paired with zaprinast (20 microM), was sufficient to elicit CLTD. Inhibition of PKA with H-89 rescued the expression of LTD in the presence of either EGLU or DPCPX, confirming the hypothesis that both group II mGluRs and A1 adenosine receptors enhance the induction of LTD by inhibiting adenylate cyclase and reducing PKA activity.
