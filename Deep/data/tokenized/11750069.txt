Various genes for transcription factors are induced in neurons involving long-lasting synaptic plasticity that is accompanied by de novo protein synthesis. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression of NeuroD-related factor (NDRF/neuroD2), a neural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, in the mouse hippocampus following pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. Both the levels of mRNA and protein of NDRF were elevated by PTZ injection. In contrast to c-fos, a representative neuronal activation-related immediate-early gene that was induced within 1 h after PTZ administration, induction of the NDRF gene expression reached a maximum level at 7-8 h after PTZ injection and was inhibited by pretreatment with cycloheximide and MK801. In situ hybridization of the mouse hippocampus revealed that NDRF mRNA was significantly induced in the dentate gyrus. During hippocampal development, NDRF transcripts were found to be highly expressed in a juvenile period, when extensive synaptogenesis occurs. Our present results demonstrate that NDRF is a new member of the family of activation-induced transcription factors, whose expression is probably regulated by immediate-early transcription factors. NDRF is thought to be involved in long-lasting neuronal activation.
