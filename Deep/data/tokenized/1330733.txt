During cocultivation in vitro, raphe nuclei, as distinct from cerebellum, were shown to stimulate the growth and morphofunctional development of hippocampus, including glia proliferation, neurite outgrowth, earlier formation of spontaneous unit activity, greater number of active neurons, and predominance of cells with a periodic type of activity. These findings coincide with the effects of exogenous serotonin and suggest that the raphe-hippocampal serotoninergic input may be important for hippocampal cells maturation in early ontogenesis.
