The distribution of enkephalin immunoreactivity (EI) in the molecular layer of the hippocampal formation corresponded to the terminal field of the lateral perforant path and the lateral temporoammonic tract. The distribution of cholecystokinin immunoreactivity (CI) in the molecular layer of the hippocampal formation corresponded to the established terminal field of the medial temporoammonic tract. The exception was a CI band at the deep part of the molecular layer throughout the regio superior. Accordingly, an additional terminal field of the medial temporoammonic tract is suggested. Selective lesion of the entorhinal afferents to the hippocampus and the area dentata resulted in a disappearance of EI throughout the molecular layer with no affection of CI and vice versa. Neonatally X-ray irradiated hippocampi were examined as they appear in the adult animal. These animals are known to possess an altered relation between the granule cells of area dentata and the perforant path zones extending beyond a reduced medial blade into the stratum oriens of the regio inferior. In such animals EI and CI revealed the same pattern of changes by following the perforant path zones into stratum oriens due to neonatal X-ray irradiation. Accordingly, the perforant path may contain EI and CI independent of the granule cell dendrites. Based on a discussion of these observations we conclude that enkephalin immunoreactivity is localized in terminals of the lateral perforant path and the lateral temporoammonic tract and that cholecystokinin immunoreactivity is localized in the terminals of the medial perforant path and the medial temporoammonic tract.
