Twenty days after complete uni- or bilateral hippocampus extirpation in rats, a 25% decrease in glutamate concentration was observed in the septum. Glutamate content also decreased in other terminal structures of the hippocampo-subicular system, i.e. entorhinal cortex, nucleus accumbens septi, mammillary bodies and contralateral hippocampus. It is concluded that the fall in glutamate content which is absent in caudate nucleus is specific for target regions of the hippocampal efferents, adding further support to the suggested transmitter role of glutamate in the limbic system.
