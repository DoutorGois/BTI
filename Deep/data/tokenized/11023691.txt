Two experiments explored the effects of sequential exposure to multiple concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) on rat hippocampal slice synaptic transmission and excitability in area CA1. When hippocampal slices were exposed to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 microM MeHg chloride in successive 30-min exposures, MeHg produced an increase in excitability over baseline levels throughout the 1 microM exposure and the first 5 min of the 10 microM exposure, followed by profound suppression of excitability at the 100 microM level. When hippocampal slices were exposed to 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 microM concentrations, MeHg produced an increase in excitability throughout most of the 10 and 25 microM exposures, followed by profound suppression of excitability at the 50 microM level of exposure. In both series of concentrations, MeHg suppressed local inhibitory systems prior to suppressing excitatory systems. In a third experiment, a single exposure of 50 microM MeHg suppressed both presynaptic and postsynaptic responses recorded in stratum radiatum with the same time course, suggesting that the observed suppressive effects of MeHg were not primarily synaptic.
