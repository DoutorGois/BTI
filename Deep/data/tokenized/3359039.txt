The rat frontal brain cortex and CAr hippocampal region were studied on the 4th day after 10-min complete ischemia. It has been established that the number of "dark" osmiophilic neurons was increased. The reparative, destructive and adaptive processes in cells were observed. The most prominent destructive changes were found in CAr hippocampal region, they can be associated with the microcirculatory disturbances. The hypertrophic thread-like mitochondria appear in the nervous and glial cells, with the quantity of lipofuscin granules increasing. Lipofuscin and hypertrophic mitochondria are thought to provide energy exchange in the brain cells during the postischemic period, forming one of the mechanisms of intracellular adaptation to hypoxia.
