The influence of SP in vitro on the (Ca Mg) ATPase activity of synaptosomes from cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain and thalamus with hypothalamus of rats was studied. It was confirmed that SP increases the activity of the enzyme from hippocampus, midbrain and thalamus with hypothalamus. A condition of this stimulation is the maintenance of Ca2+ concentration between 1 and 2 X 10(-4) M. Ca2+ concentration above and below the optimal (0.2 mM), reduced the SP stimulation of (Ca Mg) ATPase activity.
