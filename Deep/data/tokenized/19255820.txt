We evaluated Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in hippocampus of rats submitted to an animal model of mania which included the use of lithium and valproate. In the acute treatment, amphetamine or saline was administered to rats for 14 days, between day 8 and 14, rats were treated with lithium, valproate or saline. In the maintenance treatment, rats were treated with lithium, valproate or saline, between day 8 and 14, amphetamine or saline were administered. Locomotor activity was assessed by open field test and Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity was measured. Our results showed that mood stabilizers reversed and prevented amphetamine-induced behavioral effects. Moreover, amphetamine (acute treatment) increased Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity, and administration of lithium or valproate reversed this effect. In the maintenance treatment, amphetamine increased Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity in saline-pretreated rats. Amphetamine administration in lithium- or valproate-pretreated animals did not alter Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity. The findings suggest that amphetamine-induced hyperactivity may be associated with an increase in Na(+),K(+)-ATPase.
