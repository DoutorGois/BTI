Intra-amygdaloid unilateral application of low doses of kainic acid rapidly elicits, in both chronic and acute conditions, secondarily generalized convulsive seizures which often culminate in fatal true status epilepticus unless appropriate anti-epileptic drugs are provided. Spontaneous recurrent seizures are observed for several hours starting approximately 10 min. after the application of kainic acid. In addition to the primary degeneration in the amygdaloid complex, a secondary cell loss is seen in CA3 area of the dorsal hippocampus. It is suggested that this procedure may constitute a particularly suitable model for the study of true focalized status epilepticus.
