The high affinity binding of [3H]paroxetine was measured in rat cerebral cortex following chronic treatment (21 days) with imipramine (5 mg/kg), trimipramine (5 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (2 mg/kg), in adult (3-4 months) or neonatal (7 days of age) rats. Tissue concentrations of serotonin and of its metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid were also determined by high-performance liquid chromatography in cingulate cerebral cortex, rostral neostriatum, hippocampus and midbrain raphe nucleus region. No differences were found in any of the parameters of [3H]paroxetine binding after antidepressant administration, in either adult or neonatal animals. In addition, endogenous serotonin and 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid levels were not different from control values in any of the regions examined. The present study shows that the serotonin uptake recognition site is resilient to changes after chronic treatment with therapeutic doses of antidepressants, and emphasizes the potential usefulness of uptake site ligands as markers to quantify innervation densities within the brain.
