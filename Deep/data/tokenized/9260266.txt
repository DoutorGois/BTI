A series of new 1-aryl-4-propylpiperazines containing the modified terminal amide fragment 9, 15-19, 21, 23 and 25 were synthesized and their 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor affinities were determined. All the compound were highly potent 5-HT1A receptor ligands with a diverse 5-HT2A receptor affinity. It was found that the 5-HT2A receptor affinity depends on the dipole moment and lipophilicity of amide moiety. Compound 9b was found to be a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and a weak 5-HT1A receptor agonist.
