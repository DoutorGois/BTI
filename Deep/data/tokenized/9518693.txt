It has been hypothesized that changes in the excitatory amino acid receptor biosynthesis may be involved in the mechanism of kindling-an animal model of epileptogenesis. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of pentylenetetrazol kindling on the expression of genes coding for NMDAR1 and GluR2 in the rat hippocampal formation. Pentylenetetrazol kindling decreased the hippocampal NMDAR1 mRNA level after 3 and 24 h; lowered the GluR2 flip level and elevated the flop mRNA one in the CA1 field and dentate gyrus after 3 and 24 h, respectively. A receptor autoradiography showed an increase in the [3H]MK-801 binding density in the hippocampus following both acute and repeated pentylenetetrazol administration. We conclude that an early occurrence of downregulation of the glutamate receptor gene expression may be an adaptive response of glutamate receptors to an oversupply of excitatory amino acids during repeated seizures.
