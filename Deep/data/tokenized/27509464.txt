AIM: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex process. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that reactive oxygen species contribute to brain injury. Resveratrol (RVT) which exhibits significant antioxidant properties, is neuroprotective against excitotoxicity, ischemia, and hypoxia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of RVT on the hippocampus of a rat model of TBI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty eight rats were divided into four groups. A moderate degree of head trauma was induced using Feeney"s falling weight technique. Group 1 (control) underwent no intervention or treatment. Head trauma was induced in Group 2 (trauma) and no drug was administered. Head trauma was induced in Group 3 and low-dose RVT (50 mg/kg per day) was injected. In Group 4, high-dose RVT (100 mg/kg per day) was used after head trauma. Brain tissues were extracted immediately after perfusion without damaging the tissues. Histopathological and biochemistry parameters were studied. RESULTS: Brain tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the trauma group were significantly higher than those in the control, lowdose RVT-treated, and high-dose-RVT-treated groups. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in the control group were significantly higher than those in the trauma, low-dose RVT-treated, and high-dose RVT-treated groups. Glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels in the control group were significantly higher than those in the trauma and low-dose RVT-treated groups. The level of oxidative deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage (8-OHdG/106 dG) in the trauma group was higher than that in the control group, low-dose RVT-treated, and high-dose RVT-treated groups. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol has a healing effect on neurons after TBI.
