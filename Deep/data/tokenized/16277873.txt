It remains controversial which of the two regulators, red blood cell velocity (RBC-V) or concentration (RBC-C), is a main contributor to increasing flow (RBC-F) during functional hyperemia in the rat hippocampus induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). To address this, we monitored these parameters simultaneously under NMDA-infusion via microdialysis in the hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized rats and found a greater elevation in RBC-V than in RBC-C. This suggests that an RBC-V-dependent increase in RBC-F occurs under NMDA-induced functional hyperemia in the hippocampus as well as in the cortex.
