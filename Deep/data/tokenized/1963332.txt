The Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) levels were studied under stress-reaction condition and after diazepam and N6-cyclohexyladenosine injections. The radioimmune method was used to study the DBI levels. It was shown, that DBI level increased during stress-reaction. Diazepam and N6-cyclohexyladenosine injection decreased DBI level in these conditions. On the basis of these data the authors proposed the hypothetic model of interaction between adenosine receptors and GABA-Benzodiazepine-receptor complex.
