Cytoarchitectonic and histochemical analyses were carried out for perirhinal areas 35 and 36 and the postrhinal cortex, providing the first detailed cytoarchitectonic study of these regions in the rat brain. The rostral perirhinal border with insular cortex is at the extreme caudal limit of the claustrum, consistent with classical definitions of insular cortex dating back to Rose ([1928] J. Psychol. Neurol. 37:467-624). The border between the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices is at the caudal limit of the angular bundle, as previously proposed by Burwell et al. ([1995] Hippocampus 5:390-408). The ventral borders with entorhinal cortex are consistent with the Insausti et al. ([1997] Hippocampus 7:146-183) description of that region and the Dolorfo and Amaral ([1998] J. Comp. Neurol. 398:25-48) connectional findings. Regarding the remaining borders, both the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices encroach upon temporal cortical regions as defined by others (e.g., Zilles [1990] The cerebral cortex of the rat, p 77-112; Paxinos and Watson [1998] The rat brain in stereotaxic coordinates). Based on cytoarchitectonic and histochemical criteria, perirhinal areas 35 and 36 and the postrhinal cortex were further subdivided. Area 36 was parceled into three subregions, areas 36d, 36v, and 36p. Area 35 was parceled into two cytoarchitectonically distinctive subregions, areas 35d and 35v. The postrhinal cortex was divided into two subregions, areas PORd and PORv. These regional definitions of perirhinal areas 35 and 36 and the postrhinal cortex were confirmed by new empirical analyses of previously reported quantitative connectional data (Burwell and Amaral [1998a] J. Comp. Neurol. 398:179-205).
