OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of the ultrastructural features of sprouted mossy fiber synapses in the mechanism of temporal lobe epilepsy. To explore the correlation between axon guidance molecule-netrin-1 gene expression and mossy fiber synaptic reorganization. METHODS: Sixty-one SD rats underwent intraperitoneal injection of lithium chloride and pilocarpine to establish models of status epilepticus characterized with temporal lobe epilepsy. Nineteen rats were used as controls. One, 2, and 4 weeks after the injection, a certain numbers of rat were killed with their brains taken out. The sprouted mossy fiber synaptic terminals were labeled by Timm histochemistry and the ultrastructure of new synapses were observed by electron microscopy. By in situ hybridization, the mRNA expression of netrin-1 gene was observed. RESULTS: The sprouted mossy fiber synapses in epileptic rats most commonly formed asymmetric synapses with dendritic spines and occasionally with granule cell somata. Seven days after the injection, up-regulation of netrin-1 mRNA expression was seen in the dentate granule cell layers of hippocampus and continued to 4 weeks after the injection. The time course of the increase of netrin-1 mRNA in the dentate granule cell layers was correlated with the time course of mossy fiber sprouting and synaptic reorganization in hippocampus. CONCLUSION: The ultrastructural features of sprouted mossy fiber synapses support the viewpoint that the reorganization of synapses prominently involves the formation of recurrent excitatory circuits. The axon guidance molecule- netrin-1 plays an important role in the process of mossy fiber axonal outgrowth and synaptogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.
