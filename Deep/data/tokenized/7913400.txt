Effects of nitric oxide on glutamate (Glu) release in long-term potentiation (LTP) were investigated by superfusion of conventional (P2) and large (P3) synaptosomes prepared from the rat hippocampus. Basal releasing rates of endogenous Glu from P2 and P3 fractions were 103.6 and 85.2 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. Exposure to a depolarizing concentration of KCl (30 mM) evoked 3.58- and 4.52-fold increases in releasing rates of Glu from P2 and P3 fractions, respectively. Although the perfusion with sodium nitroprusside (NP, 10(-3) M), a nitric oxide-releasing agent, failed to augment the K(+)-evoked releases of Glu from P2 and P3 synaptosomes, NP enhanced that from slices of the hippocampus by 39% without changing basal release. Similarly, 8-bromoguanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (10(-4) M) increased the K(+)-evoked release of Glu from slices by 30%, but not from either synaptosomes. When synaptosomes were prepared from the hippocampus which was pretreated with two trains of electrical field stimulation (100 Hz, 0.1 ms, for 2 s), K(+)-evoked releases of Glu from P2 and P3 synaptosomes were increased by 15% and 23%, respectively. Although nitric oxide is postulated to function as a retrograde messenger to maintain LTP, present results suggest that nitric oxide may not directly act upon nerve terminals to enhance glutamate release, but that interventions of glias and short neurons may be involved in the presynaptic mechanism of LTP.
