Postictal and interictal psychoses are relatively common complicating factors in the clinical course of epilepsy, yet their neurobiological substrates are poorly understood. Recent evidence shows that kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activation elicits anticonvulsant and psychotomimetic effects. In view of this background, here we introduce the hypothesis that epilepsy-related psychoses may partially result from excessive hippocampal dynorphin release and kappa opioid receptor overstimulation aimed at seizure control.
