Taurine, 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is present at high concentrations in many invertebrate and vertebrate systems and has several biological functions. In addition, it has been related to a neuroprotective role against several diseases such as epilepsy. In the present work, we treated mice with taurine and examined its effects on the expression of proteins in the hippocampus associated with calcium regulation. Taurine treatment alters the presence of calbindin-D28k, calretinin, and parvalbumin in the brain, mainly in the hippocampus. It also reduced CaMKII activity, indicating that taurine could alter calcium signaling pathways. However, the activity of calpain, a protease related to apoptosis induced by calcium signalling, did not change. The concentration of taurine in the hippocampus was also unaffected by the treatment. These results provide new insight into the role of taurine in calcium homeostasis.
