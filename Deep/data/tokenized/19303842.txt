The axon and dendritic arbor of neurons require different sets of membrane proteins to carry out their functions. In this issue, Song et al. (2009) describe how a cytoplasmic diffusion barrier in the axon initial segment of rat hippocampal neurons ensures that only axonal (and not dendritic) membrane proteins enter the axon.
