The content of lipofuscin is different in pyramidal and nonpyramidal neurons (NpNH) of the pyramidal layer of the field CA1 of the brain hippocampus of adult man. This criterion allowed using the method of intracellular administration of Lucifer yellow for staining NpNH only. The morphometrical analysis of geometrical parameters and orientation of the dendrites allowed all the NpNH to be divided into 4 types: large multipolar spine-free neurons, middle-sized multipolar spine-free neurons, middle-sized multipolar neurons with short dendrites and small bipolar reticular neurons.
