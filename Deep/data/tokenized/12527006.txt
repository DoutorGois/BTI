The reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide is well known for its role in disease mechanisms. Mounting evidence indicates, however, that superoxide also is generated for useful purposes and contributes to normal physiologic function. Studies with transgenic mice that overexpress superoxide scavengers show that certain types of memory function and underlying neuronal processes are impaired under conditions of severely reduced superoxide signaling. These findings have implications for the use of antioxidant treatments as well as for our understanding of the signaling events involved in cognition.
