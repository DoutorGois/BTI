The effects of toluene on synaptic transmission and neuronal morphology were investigated using guinea pig hippocampal slices. Population spikes (PS) were elicited in granule cell layer by stimulation of the perforant path and antidromic potentials (AP) were evoked in the same locii by stimulation of mossy fibers. Toluene at a concentration of 1000 micrograms/ml completely depressed post-synaptic responses within 15 min but increased the AP to 140% of its original value. The PS recovered completely when washout was begun 10 and 20 min after onset of depression, but exhibited only partial recovery following a 40 min depression. There were no evident changes in staining of axons or cell bodies after toluene treatment. These results indicate that toluene at high concentrations (1000 micrograms/ml) inhibits synaptic transmission selectively and with longer exposures causes lasting physiological effects unaccompanied by gross morphological changes.
