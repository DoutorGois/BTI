We investigated the cytoarchitecture and connectivity of the medial pallium of amphibians by intracellular recording and biocytin labeling. The experiments were carried out in a whole-brain in vitro preparation in the painted frog, Discoglossus pictus. Four types of neurons with specific axonal projection patterns and position in the medial pallium are distinguished, three types with extratelencephalic and one type with only intratelencephalic projections. Our findings corroborate the assumption that the anuran medial pallium is homologous to the subiculum and Ammon's horn of the mammalian hippocampus at a gross level, while the specific axonal projection patterns differ. Due to the absence of hippocampal neurons with only intrinsic projections, there seems to be no portion homologous to the dentate gyrus.
