RATIONALE: Patients with schizophrenia exhibit high comorbidity for substance abuse, but the biological underpinnings of this dual-diagnosis condition are still unclear. Previous studies have shown that rats with a neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL), a widely used developmental animal model of schizophrenia, exhibit increased cocaine and methamphetamine self-administration and cocaine-induced reinstatement. OBJECTIVE: Here, we assessed whether a NVHL would also potentiate cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking and the time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving) in adult rats. METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (3 or 6 h/day with 0.75 mg kg(-1) infusion(-1) paired with a tone-light cue) for 10 days, followed by extinction training (3 h/day) and cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Other rats were tested for incubation of cocaine craving, assessed in extinction tests 1 and 30 days after the last self-administration session. RESULTS: Although there was no significant difference in cocaine intake between NVHL and sham controls, NVHL rats took significantly longer to reach an a priori set extinction criterion and exhibited enhanced cue-induced reinstatement. However, while cue-induced cocaine seeking was higher after 30 days than after 1 day of withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving), the NVHL had no effect on this incubation. CONCLUSION: These data confirm previous reports on enhanced resistance to extinction after NVHL and demonstrate that NVHL rats exhibit enhanced cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking after extinction, a measure of drug relapse.
