The neurochemical mechanisms supporting the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety are now under investigation. To address this issue, we examined whether the pharmacological blockade of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channels in the ventral hippocampus would attenuate anxiety-related behaviour. Rats infused with the TRPV1 channel antagonist capsazepine (2.0 nmol) showed less inhibitory avoidance than controls in the elevated plus-maze test. This result indicates an anxiolytic-like effect, and suggests a role for TRPV1 channels in regulating anxiety.
