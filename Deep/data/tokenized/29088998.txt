Acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that plays a key role in cognitive function, including learning and memory. Previous studies have shown that experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) reduces cholinergic neurotransmission, decreases evoked release of acetylcholine, and alters cholinergic receptor levels. Galantamine (U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease) has been shown to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and allosterically potentiate nicotinic receptor signaling. We investigated whether acute administration of galantamine can reduce TBI pathology and improve cognitive function tested days after the termination of the drug treatment. Post-injury administration of galantamine was found to decrease TBI-triggered blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability (tested 24 h post-injury), attenuate the loss of both GABAergic and newborn neurons in the ipsilateral hippocampus, and improve hippocampal function (tested 10 days after termination of the drug treatment). Specifically, significant improvements in the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and context-specific fear memory tasks were observed in injured animals treated with galantamine. Although messenger RNAs for both M1 (Nos2, TLR4, and IL-12ss) and M2 (Arg1, CCL17, and Mcr1) microglial phenotypes were elevated post-TBI, galantamine treatment did not alter microglial polarization tested 24 h and 6 days post-injury. Taken together, these findings support the further investigation of galantamine as a treatment for TBI.
