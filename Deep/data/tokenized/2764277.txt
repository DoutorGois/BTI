Large differences in hippocampal lamination have been found between several inbred strains of mice. These variations are thought to be caused by differences in developmental processes. We produced aggregation chimaeras between the inbred strains BALB/c and C57BL/6 and studied the lamination patterns in these animals. Next to some intermediate patterns, several patterns not occurring in the donor strains were obtained. These patterns differed also from those found in F1 hybrids. Thus, although the genetic information from both parental strains is present in both F1 and chimaeric mice, different processes occur during development.
