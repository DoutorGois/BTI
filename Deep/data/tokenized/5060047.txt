Tritiated corticosterone injected subcutaneously into adrenalectomized male rats 1 hour before killing produced intense labeling of the hippocampus in radioautograms prepared by a method that reduced or prevented diffusion of the radioactive material. The pyramidal neurons of the cornu ammonis and the granule neurons of the gyrus dentatus contained more radioactivity than did other regions of the brain; however, the intensity of labeling varied among adjacent neurons. The nuclei of many neurons were clearly labeled but radioactivity was relatively sparse in the cytoplasm, in the axons where they branch from cell bodies, and in adjacent neuropil.
