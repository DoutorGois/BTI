Seizure development was examined in amygdaloid (AM), hippocampal (HIPP) and septal (SEPT) "KINDLED" CATS BY BEHAVIORAL AND Electrographic methods. hipp seizure developed into motor seizure after establishing secondary epileptogenesis in AM and globys paliidus. A secondary epileptogenesis in the hippocampus was not necessary for AM seizures to develop into generalized conculsions. The SEPT seizure development was almost identical to the hippocampal seizure development. This latter finding suggests that psychomotor epilepsy may not only ne triggered by the HIPP and AM focus but by the septum and its related structures. In the second experiment, the effect of various neuroactive agents on the interictal dischage frequency was studied in AM and HIPP kindled cats. Clear antagonistic action of L-Dopa against reserpine or alpha-MPT induced increase of IID frequency was observed. Viewed in conjunction with our previous assay study of catecholamine that showed a marked depletion of both norepinephrine and dopamine, in hippocampal kindled cat brain, it can be concluded that catecholamine inhibits the establishment and activation of the kindled epileptic neurocircuits.
