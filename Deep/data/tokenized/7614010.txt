Following cholinergic denervation of the hippocampus by medial septal lesions, and unusual neuronal reorganization occurs, in which peripheral sympathetic fibers, originating from the superior cervical ganglia, grow into the hippocampus. Previously, we have found that both hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth (HSI) and cholinergic denervation (CD), alone, altered the total number and affinity of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChR). In this study, we utilized the muscarinic antagonist [3H]Pirenzepine, in combination with membrane radioligand binding techniques, to determine the effects of HSI and CD on hippocampal M1 and M1 + M3 mAChR subtypes, 4 weeks after MS lesions. In both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, HSI was found to markedly diminish the number of M1 AChRs, while CD was found to increase the number of M1 AChRs. Neither treatment affected the affinity of the M1 AChR. However, when M1 + M3 binding was assessed, CD was found to decrease the affinity in both hippocampal regions, without altering the number of receptors. Neither affinity nor number of M1 + M3 receptors was altered by HSI. The results of this study suggest that both cholinergic denervation and hippocampal sympathetic ingrowth uniquely affect hippocampal muscarinic receptors.
