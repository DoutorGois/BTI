Prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide (PLG) and its substituted and protected analogues were tested on the steady-state level of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in various brain areas. The tripeptides were structurally modified at the N-terminal proline residue either by protection with benzoxycarbonyl (Z group) or by tertiary butyroxycarbonyl (BOC), or by substitution with homoproline (HPRO). C-terminal modification was performed by substitution of the amino group of glycine (GLY-NH2) by methylester (GLY-OMe). The parent molecule (PLG) increased the 5-HT content in the striatum and the NA and DA levels in the dorsal hippocampus. N-terminal protection by Z-group resulted in a loss of these effects. Striatal effects re-appeared if a methylester group was introduced in the C-terminal glycine. Substitution of the N-terminal with HPRO or that of the C-terminal amine group by OMe resulted in a tendency to increase the 5-HT level in the hypothalamus.
