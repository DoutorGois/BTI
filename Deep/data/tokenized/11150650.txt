The role of hippocampal dynorphin A (1-8) (Dyn A (1-8)) and kappa opioid receptors was investigated in the isolation-induced hypertensive rat (IHR). Male Sprague Dawley rats were either isolated (1 per cage) or grouped (3 per cage) for 7 days. Isolated rats exhibited increased blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 159.7 +/- 6.6 mmHg) whereas the grouped rats remained normotensive (systolic blood pressure 137 +/- 6.3 mmHg). Using radioligand binding techniques we observed a significant increase in kappa opioid receptor binding in the hippocampus of isolated rats (56% increase) and this further increased when the length of isolation was increased to 2 weeks (72% increase). Radioimmunoassay showed that isolation decreased the hippocampal content of Dyn A (1-8) from 12.7 +/- 0.4 to 11.6 +/- 0.2 pg Dyn A (1-8) per 10 mg tissue (rats weighing approximately 100 g) and from 13.3 +/- 0.8 to 9.7 +/- 1 pg Dyn A (1-8) per 10 mg tissue (approximately 200 g rats). These data suggest that functional alterations in the hippocampal dynorphin system may be involved in the maintenance of isolation induced hypertension.
