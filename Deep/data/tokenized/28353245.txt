Some patients with psychiatric disorders show hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This may be due to an impaired feedback inhibition and can be seen through increased levels of circulating cortisol. Here a protocol is described to mimic this situation by subcutaneous implantation of corticosterone pellets in mice. We also present characterization of the model by looking at effects on neuronal proliferation in hippocampus, one of the main tissues known to be affected by HPA axis hyper-activation. Such tissues could be used in analyses by proteomic platforms.
