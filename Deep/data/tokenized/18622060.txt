The effect of the newly synthesized pyridoindole antioxidant SMe1EC2 (1 micromol/l) and drugs activating or inhibiting adenosine receptors was tested under ischemia. Synaptic transmission was recorded extracellularly before and under 6-min ischemia and 20-min reoxygenation in rat hippocampal slices in vitro. In untreated slices, ischemia elicited failure of synaptic transmission and excitability expressed by a population spike decay (t(0.5) = 1.7 +/- 0.1 min) and poor recovery of synaptic transmission at the end of reoxygenation, expressed as percentage of PoS amplitude of that at zero minute of ischemia (9.9 +/- 3.6%). The compound SMe1EC2 increased recovery of PoS amplitude in reoxygenation (31.2 +/- 7.0% of that at the beginning of ischemia) and decreased the number of irreversibly damaged slices in reoxygenation (64%) compared to untreated slices (80%). Co-administration of SMe1EC2 + SCH-58261 (1 micromol/l, A(2A) adenosine receptor antagonist) resulted in delayed synaptic transmission decay during 6-min ischemia (t(0.5) = 2.3 +/- 0.1 min), increased PoS amplitude recovery during reoxygenation (37.7 +/- 12.4% of that at zero minute of ischemia), and in a decreased number of slices with damaged synaptic transmission at the end of reoxygenation (54%), all data compared to untreated controls. Co-administration of pyridoindole with CGS 21680 (1 micromol/l, A(2A) adenosine receptor agonist) or with DPCPX (100 nmol/l, A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist) eliminated the described effect. Further studies are required to elucidate the putative influence of manipulation with adenosine receptors on the neuroprotective effect of SMe1EC2 under ischemia.
