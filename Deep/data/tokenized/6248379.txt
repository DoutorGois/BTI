In response to cortisole administration the majority of hormonesensitive hippocampal neurons increased ther firing rate in unrestrained rabbits. Apart from this, the hormone affected the interspike intervals distribution. Neurons with a lower spontaneous firing rate revealed a trend towards raise of hormone sensitivity. The data obtained corroborate the inhibitory role of the dorsal hippocampus in central mechanisms of regulation of hypophyseal corticotropic activity by the corticoids level.
