Relations between a unilateral lesion of circumscribed structures of the Pes hippocampi on the one hand, and stress-induced blood-pressure and learning behaviour, on the other, were studied. An asymmetric functioning of the CNS was analyzed, in which unilateral exclusion of right-hand hippocampal structures stimulates processes of excitation, while lesion of left-hand structures causes prevalence of inhibitory processes. The resulting impairment of the emotional equilibrium potentiates the stress action's contribution to the development of arterial hypertension.
