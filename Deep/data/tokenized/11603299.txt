AIM: To observe the protective effect of gypenosides (GP) on the neurons of hippocampus, cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, and dentate gyrus in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury of rats. METHODS: Modified 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method was used to establish the model of acute global ischemia. The acridine orange (AO) staining method was used to observe the DNA and RNA contents of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model in the areas. RESULTS: The fluorescent intensity (reflecting DNA and RNA contents) of the DNA and RNA in the areas of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was markedly abated compared with the normal control group. In the group of ig GP (100 mg/kg) it was enhanced compared with the model group and was the same as the normal control group. CONCLUSION: The injury of the DNA and RNA in the areas of ischemia-reperfusion model was decreased by GP.
