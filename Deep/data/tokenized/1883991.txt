Functional responses of cultured neurons from rat cortex and hippocampus to transient hypoxia/asphyxia was studied by the measurement of [3H]2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) specific uptake. Hypoxic insult was induced by incubating the cells in 5% CO2/95% N2 or in 1 mM NaCN-containing culture medium for various periods of time. Cell morphology, lactate dehydrogenase efflux and protein levels were also examined. Twenty-four hours following hypoxia (6 to 8 h in an anaerobic atmosphere or 90 min in the presence of NaCN) 2DG specific transport was significantly enhanced, without morphological alteration. Cell injury was evident three days post-hypoxia, with a significantly reduced rate of cellular metabolism. The data suggest indirectly that postanoxic release of excitatory amino acids may be responsible for 'delayed neuronal death'.
