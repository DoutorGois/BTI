Collapsing response mediator protein-1 (CRMP-1) was initially identified in brain and has been implicated in plexin-dependent neuronal function. The high amino acid sequence identity among the five CRMPs has hindered determination of the functions of each individual CRMP. We generated viable and fertile CRMP-1 knock-out (CRMP-1(-/-)) mice with no evidence of gross abnormality in the major organs. CRMP-1(-/-) mice exhibited intense microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining in the proximal portion of the dendrites, but reduced and disorganized MAP2 staining in the distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Immunoreactivity to GAP-43 (growth-associated protein-43) and PSD95 (postsynaptic density-95) (a postsynaptic membrane adherent cytoskeletal protein) was also decreased in the CA1 region of the knock-out mice. These changes were consistent with the mutant mice showing a reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region and impaired performance in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory tests. CRMP-1(-/-) mice showed a normal synapsin I labeling pattern in CA1 and normal paired-pulse facilitation. These findings provide the first evidence suggesting that CRMP-1 may be involved in proper neurite outgrowth in the adult hippocampus and that loss of CRMP-1 may affect LTP maintenance and spatial learning and memory.
