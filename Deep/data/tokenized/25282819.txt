Using the method of quantitative immunohistochemistry, the expression of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and neurotrophin BDNF was studied in CA1 hippocampal field of rats that survived severe hypoxia (SH), the damaging effects of which were compensated by subsequent three postconditioning (PC) sessions of mild hypobaric hypoxia (360 mm Hg, 2 hours, three times with 24 hour intervals). It was shown that the expression of the proteins studied was decreased in rat hippocampus after SH. Hypoxic postconditioning which improved the structural and functional rehabilitation after SH, was shown to up-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and BDNF in hippocampal CA1 neurons in rats that survived SH. These results suggest the involvement of Bcl-2 and BDNF in processes of adaptation to SH and compensation of its damaging effects.
