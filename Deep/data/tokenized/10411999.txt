Immunoreactivity of dystrophin family proteins was observed in the astrocytes of the adult and immature rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex by using Dys2, a monoclonal antibody recognizing both 427 kDa and short dystrophin isoforms. As revealed by light and electron microscopy, immunostaining of the ribosomal apparatus and of pericapillary endfeet was particularly pronounced in the adult. In the pericapillary astrocyte processes immunostaining appeared between postnatal days 10 and 20, and reached the intensity seen in the adult by postnatal day 30. In the pericapillary astrocyte process, the membrane facing the endothelial basal lamina was the earliest structure to show the immunoreaction. At later stages, the pericapillary astrocyte process was gradually filled up with immunoprecipitate. Findings suggest that dystrophins are expressed coinciding with the development of the blood-brain barrier, and it is assumed that they contribute to the formation of this system.
