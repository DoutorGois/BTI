The influence of cobalt-induced epileptogenic foci in the somatosensory area of the cerebral cortex on sleep-wakefulness pattern has been studied in rats and the data obtained were compared with the learning ability of rats. It has been established that the formation of cobalt-induced epileptogenic foci may result in a decreased ability to learn that correlated with the selectivity of phasic components of the paradoxical sleep hippocampal theta-rhythm.
