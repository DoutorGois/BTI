Enkephalin peptides released from hippocampal mossy fibres lower the threshold for the generation of long-term potentiation (LTP) at the mossy fibre synapses. High frequency stimulation of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, sufficient to induce mossy fibre LTP, is associated with increased expression of the proenkephalin gene in the granule cells. We show here that a similar elevation in proenkephalin mRNA levels is observed, in anaesthetised rats, following stimulation of the perforant path sufficient to induce LTP in the perforant path/granule cell synapses. This strengthens the evidence implicating granule cell enkephalins as mediators of functional plasticity in the hippocampus. Furthermore. the results hint at a form of 'domino plasticity', where potentiation of transmission at the perforant path/granule cell synapses is subsequently followed by an enkephalin-mediated potentiation of transmission at the mossy fibre synapses.
