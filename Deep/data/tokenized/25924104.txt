In the hippocampus, estrogens are powerful modulators of neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. In women, menopause is associated with increased risk of memory disturbances, which can be attenuated by timely estrogen therapy. In animal models of menopause, 17beta-estradiol (E2) replacement improves hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. Here, we explored the effect of E2 replacement on hippocampal gene expression in a rat menopause model. Middle-aged ovariectomized female rats were treated continuously for 29 days with E2, and then, the hippocampal transcriptome was investigated with Affymetrix expression arrays. Microarray data were analyzed by Bioconductor packages and web-based softwares, and verified with quantitative PCR. At standard fold change selection criterion, 156 genes responded to E2. All alterations but 4 were transcriptional activation. Robust activation (fold change > 10) occurred in the case of transthyretin, klotho, claudin 2, prolactin receptor, ectodin, coagulation factor V, Igf2, Igfbp2, and sodium/sulfate symporter. Classification of the 156 genes revealed major groups, including signaling (35 genes), metabolism (31 genes), extracellular matrix (17 genes), and transcription (16 genes). We selected 33 genes for further studies, and all changes were confirmed by real-time PCR. The results suggest that E2 promotes retinoid, growth factor, homeoprotein, neurohormone, and neurotransmitter signaling, changes metabolism, extracellular matrix composition, and transcription, and induces protective mechanisms via genomic effects. We propose that these mechanisms contribute to effects of E2 on neurogenesis, neural plasticity, and memory functions. Our findings provide further support for the rationale to develop safe estrogen receptor ligands for the maintenance of cognitive performance in postmenopausal women.
