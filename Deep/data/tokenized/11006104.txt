The myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) is a prominent PKC-substrate in the brain, which has been implicated in brain development, cytoskeletal remodeling, calcium/calmodulin signaling, and neuroplasticity. The sequence of the Macs gene codes for a protein that has three highly conserved domains including a 5' myristoylation region and a 25-amino-acid phosphorylation site domain (PSD), which are involved in anchoring MARCKS to the cellular membrane. In this study, we examined the role of the myristoylation signal in the regulation of MARCKS in transfected rat hippocampal cells (H19-7) following retinoic acid (RA) treatment. A mutant MARCKS lacking the myristoylation signal was engineered by substitution of alanine for glycine at position 2 of the Macs gene and was found to be exclusively expressed in the cytosol fraction of transfected cells. Exposure of the wild-type MARCKS-transfected cells to RA resulted in an apparent shift of MARCKS from the membrane to the cytosol, while the total protein of wild-type MARCKS was not significantly changed. In contrast, RA-exposed cells transfected with the mutant MARCKS revealed a dramatic reduction of expression of MARCKS protein in both cytosol and total protein fractions. These data suggest that the absence of the myristoyl moiety may not only alter the anchoring of the protein to the membrane but also play a novel role in modulating cellular levels of MARCKS protein in response to RA.
