We identified the mouse homolog of human DRAPC1 (APCDD1) gene, shown to be a target of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in cancer cell lines. Analysis of its spatiotemporal expression in mouse embryos from E7.5 to E14 showed that Drapc1 is expressed during development of the extraembryonic structures, nervous system, vascular system and inner ear. In addition, Drapc1 is expressed in the mesenchyme of several developing organs at sites of epithelio-mesenchymal interactions. Drapc1 expression was also found in the hair follicles of the adult mouse skin. Similarity of Drapc1 expression pattern to location of active beta-catenin in developing mouse embryo further suggests that mouse Drapc1 is a novel in vivo target gene of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
