Dynorphin A (1-8)-like immunoreactivity (DN-LI A(1-8] was determined by radioimmunoassay in the brains of age matched spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and two normotensive control groups consisting of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) strain rats. A significantly lower DN-LI A(1-8) was found in the hippocampus and hypothalamus of the SHR compared with the WKY groups. DN-LI A(1-8) was 24% of control WKY levels in hippocampus and 79% of that in WKY hypothalamus at 16 weeks. Similar lower levels of DN-LI A(1-8) were also observed in SHR at 4, 8, and 12 weeks during the development of hypertension when compared with both WKY and SD groups. We failed to find significant differences in brain stem DN levels between the groups. The relationship between the low hippocampal dynorphin levels in SHR and the hypertension is problematical because the differences were present before (4 wks), during (8 and 12 wks) and after (16 wks) its development.
