The hippocampus plays a vital role in learning and memory and is susceptible to damage following hypoglycaemic shock. The effect of an acute administration of insulin on hippocampal function has been described in terms of behavioural deficits but its effect on hippocampal oxygen and glucose is unclear. Glucose oxidase biosensors (detecting glucose) and carbon paste electrodes (detecting oxygen) were implanted into the hippocampus of Sprague Dawley rats. Animals were allowed to recover and real-time recordings were made in order to determine the effects of fasting, insulin administration (15 U/kg; i.p.) and reintroduction of food on hippocampal oxygen and glucose. Fasting caused a significant decrease in hippocampal glucose over the course of 24h. Insulin administration produced a significant decrease in hippocampal glucose along with a significant increase in hippocampal oxygen. Finally, the reintroduction of food resulted in glucose levels significantly increasing along with a transient but significant increase in oxygen levels. The findings presented here suggest that even a single acute period of hypoglycaemia may substantially disrupt hippocampal oxygen and glucose and therefore affect hippocampal function.
