OBJECTIVE: Fructose-1, 6-diphosphate (FDP), serving as a cellular energy substance, has shown its roles in the treatment of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and myocardial damage. The present study aimed at exploring the potentiality of the protective effect of FDP against ultrastructural damage of the hippocampus caused by febrile seizures (FS) in rats. METHODS: Thirty-six 21-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: untreated FS (control), high-dose FDP-treated FS and low-dose FDP-treated FS. FS were induced by hyperthermal bath. Thirty minutes before FS induction, rats in the high-dose and low-dose FDP-treated groups received a peritoneal injection of FDP at a dosage of 50 and 25 mg per 100 g of body weight respectively, whereas the same volume of 0.9% sodium chloride solution were injected to the rats in the control group. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine the ultrastructural pathologic changes of neurons and organelles as well as the features of synaptic morphological parameters in the hippocampal CA1 area. RESULTS: Neuronal degeneration and necrosis, mitochondria swelling, polyribosomes disaggregation from endoplasmic reticula, and golgiosomes dilation in the hippocampal CA1 area in the two FDP intervention groups were less severe compared with the control group. FDP treatment resulted in significant increases in postsynaptic density thickness (F=12.47, P<0.01), synaptic active zone length (F=14.75, P<0.01) and synaptic interface curvature (F=3.77, P<0.05), as well as a shorter interspace of neural synapses (F=7.29, P<0.01) when compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in the ultrastructural changes between the two FDP treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: FDP can ameliorate ultrastructural damage in the hippocampus caused by FS in rats. However, further research is warranted for a reasonable and effective dosage of FDP.
