Male Long-Evans rats alternately drank a salt solution in one distinctive compartment of a conditioned cue preference (CCP) apparatus and water in a different compartment over 8 days (training trials) and were then given a choice between the two compartments with no solutions present (test trial). Rats that were water deprived during training, then salt+water deprived during testing, spent more time in their salt-paired compartments, a salt latent cue preference (LCP). Rats that were water-only deprived during training and testing spent more time in their water-paired compartments, a water CCP. Rats that were salt+water deprived during both training and testing spent more time in their salt-paired compartments, a salt CCP. Bilateral, pre-training lesions of the lateral amygdala impaired the water and salt CCPs but not the salt LCP, reflecting the role of the amygdala in Pavlovian conditioning. Lesions of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus impaired the salt LCP and the water and salt CCPs, possibly reflecting the role of the hippocampus in contextual learning. Lesions of the fimbria-fornix impaired the water and salt CCPs but not the salt LCP, while lesions of the entorhinal cortex impaired the salt LCP but not the CCPs. This suggests that the LCP depends on a circuit that includes dorsal and ventral hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, a major conduit of sensory information from the cortex. In contrast, the CCPs depend on the amygdala and a circuit that includes the hippocampus and fimbria-fornix, possibly as a conduit of motivational information from subcortical structures.
