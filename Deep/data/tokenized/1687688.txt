Immunoreactivity to four neurotransmitters/transmitter-related enzymes was found in the dorsomedial telencephalon (hippocampal region) of the pigeon. Putative afferent fibers containing choline acetyltransferase-like, serotonin-like, and tyrosine hydroxylase-like immunoreactivity were seen in a fiber tract passing through the septo-hippocampal junction and along the medial wall of the hippocampal region. The most intensive labeling of neuropil and terminals of all four substances was found in the dorsomedial area of the hippocampal region. Glutamic acid decarboxylase-like immunoreactivity was seen in sparsely scattered cells throughout the region. These results are discussed in relation to hypotheses about the boundaries and subdivisions of the hippocampal region of the pigeon.
