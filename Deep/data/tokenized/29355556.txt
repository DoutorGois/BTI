Hypothyroidism is often associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression. In this study, we evaluated the effect of chrysin on depressive-like behavior and monoamine levels in hypothyroid female mice. Hypothyroidism was induced by continuous exposure to 0.1% methimazole (MTZ) in drinking water for 31 days. Exposure to MTZ was associated with low plasma levels of thyroid hormones T3 and T4 compared with the control group. Subsequently, euthyroid and MTZ-induced hypothyroid mice were intragastrically administered vehicle or chrysin (20mg/kg) once a day for 28 consecutive days. After treatments, the following behavioral assessments were performed: Open-Field Test (OFT), Tail suspension test (TST), and Forced Swimming Test (FST). Additionally, T3 and T4 levels were measured again, and serotonin (5HT), dopamine, and noradrenaline levels were analyzed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Chrysin treatment could not reverse T3 and T4 levels. Hypothyroid mice showed an increased immobility time in TST and FST; chrysin treatment reversed these effects. Reduced levels of 5HT and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus were observed in the hypothyroid mice than in the euthyroid mice. Chrysin treatment recovered 5HT content in both structures and dopamine content only in the hippocampus. Noradrenaline content was not altered by treatments. Together, our results have demonstrated that chrysin treatment reverses depressive-like behaviors in hypothyroid female mice and suggests the involvement of 5HT and dopamine in these effects.
