Five neuropeptides (cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), somatostatin (SRIF), neurotensin (NT) and substance P (SP)) were measured in 14 brain areas (4 cortical areas, hippocampus, amygdala, 3 striatal areas, 2 thalamic areas and 3 subcortical areas-- septum, substantia innominata and hypothalamus) in 12 brains with neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer type change and in 13 control brains. Choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was assessed in 6 of these areas. Levels of SRIF, but not those of the other peptides, were reduced in several cortical areas in Alzheimer-type dementia (ATD). The distribution and magnitude of the reduction in SRIF were less than that of CAT activity and the temporal cortex was the only region in which there was a significant relationship between CAT and SRIF deficits. Peptide levels were unchanged in hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus and striatum (except for an increase in SP in the putamen). SRIF levels were increased in substantia innominata in ATD. NT and SRIF were significantly, and VIP and SP non-significantly, reduced in the septum in ATD. Thus, apart from these alterations in the septum, SRIF was the only neuropeptide for which major changes were identified and these did not follow either the pattern of neuropathological change (e.g. in amygdala and hippocampus) or of CAT deficits (e.g. in substantia innominata).
