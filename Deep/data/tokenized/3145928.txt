In view of the importance of calcium in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), experiments were carried out to localize calcium at the electron microscopic level in the CA1 region of guinea pig hippocampal slices, following high-frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals. Apart from the ultrastructural localization, a semi-quantitative method was used to count the calcium-containing deposits in electron micrographs. Significantly more calcium-containing deposits were seen in the dendrites of the stratum radiatum in slices with LTP than in those without it. A moderate increase of the extradendritic deposits was observed, too. The calcium content of the deposits was determined by means of EGTA incubation and X-ray analysis. The presented results, together with the relevant literature data, underline the importance of calcium-activated processes in postsynaptic structures probably involved in the generation of LTP.
