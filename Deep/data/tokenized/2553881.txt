1. The effects of brief anoxia (2-4 min) on membrane currents--especially the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-insensitive, Cd2+-sensitive slow inward currents, presumed to be Ca2+ currents--were studied by single-electrode voltage clamp in CA1 and CA3 neurons in submerged hippocampal slices from adult and newborn Wistar rats (PN1-13). 2. In mature neurons, anoxia had no effect on Q-type inward relaxations, but slowly activating C-type outward currents were depressed. The most striking change was the suppression of Ca inward currents (especially the slowly inactivating L-type, by greater than 95%). This effect of anoxia was not sensitive to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, D-aminophosphonovalerate. Anoxia also reversibly abolished the NMDA-evoked inward current. 3. In neurons from newborn animals (PN1-6), Q-type inward relaxations and postanoxic outward currents were very small or undetectable. The slow inward (Ca) currents were smaller than in mature cells, but they showed a clearer separation between low-threshold, fast-inactivating and high-threshold, slowly inactivating currents. Both types of current were more resistant to anoxia (mean depression of L-type was by only 53.3 +/- 5.6%, mean +/- SE). 4. In such immature neurons, the NMDA-evoked inward currents were also more resistant to anoxia. 5. By PN7-13, increasing maturation was reflected in 1) larger voltage-dependent inward currents, 2) increasingly evident Q-type relaxations and postanoxic outward currents, and 3) near-complete blockade of inward currents by anoxia (at PN11-13, mean depression of L-type currents was by 98.5 +/- 1.5%).
