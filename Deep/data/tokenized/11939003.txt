In order to study the role of immediate early genes (IEG) in the neurotoxic mechanism of lead, expression of c-fos and c-jun genes in different regions of rat brain treated with lead (13 and 130 mg/kg) were observed by using immuno-histochemical method. The observation and image analysis showed that after rats treated by lead for 2 hours, the c-fos and c-jun expression in cortex, CA3 area of hippocampus and cerebellum of rats were higher than those of control rats significantly (P < 0.05). The results indicated that IEG, as a transcription regular factor, may participate in the neurological toxicity damaging the learning and memory ability induced by lead. The study provided experimental basis for revealing the molecular neurotoxic mechanism of lead.
