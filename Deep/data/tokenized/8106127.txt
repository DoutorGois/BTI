Both the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the facilitation of depolarization-evoked glutamate release have been implicated in the induction of hippocampal long-term synaptic potentiation. These observations may be functionally related, since stimulation of PKC activity enhances evoked glutamate release. Recently, it was shown that arachidonic acid and the diacylglycerol analog oleoyl-acetyl-glycerol activate brain PKC in a synergistic fashion. We report the facilitation of depolarization-induced glutamate efflux from hippocampal mossy fiber synaptosomes due to a combination of arachidonic acid and oleoyl-acetyl-glycerol. The potentiating effects appeared to depend on the activation of PKC since they were attenuated by staurosporine. In addition, the effects of arachidonic acid and oleoyl-acetyl-glycerol appeared to be limited to calcium-dependent processes.
