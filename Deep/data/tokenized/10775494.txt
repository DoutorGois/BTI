The role played by hippocampal mossy fibers in the learning and memory processes implemented in the Morris swimming navigation task has been studied in C57BL/6 mice by selective and reversible inactivation of mossy fiber synaptic fields by diethyldithiocarbamate. The functional integrity of the mossy fibers proved essential for the storage of the spatial representation on the modifiable synapses of the recurrent collaterals of the CA3 pyramidal cells, whereas it is not necessary for the consolidation and recall of spatial memories. The results suggest that mossy fibers are preferentially involved in new learning. They are consistent with the hypothesis that the hippocampal CA3 region might act as an autoassociation memory.
