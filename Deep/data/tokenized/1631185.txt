Trimethyltin (TMT) at moderate doses selectively damages hippocampus and related olfactory cortex and produces learning and memory impairments. TMT also increases forebrain beta-adrenergic ligand binding; this could be ancillary to reduced noradrenergic neurotransmission, which in turn could be involved in the cognitive deficit caused by TMT. If this hypothesis is correct, then the alpha 1-adrenergic agonist clonidine, which inhibits noradrenergic neurotransmission in normal subjects, should be less behaviourally effective after TMT poisoning. Thus, rats treated with water vehicle or TMT (6 mg/kg, PO) were given saline or clonidine IP (5, 10, or 20 micrograms/kg) 30 min before placement in a hole-board apparatus. Exploratory activity was reduced in controls by 10 or 20 micrograms/kg. Clonidine at 10 micrograms/kg was ineffective in rats given TMT. At 20 micrograms/kg, an apparent reduction in exploratory activity was not significant because variability of responding was higher after TMT treatment. The results suggest an impairment in noradrenergic neurotransmission following TMT poisoning.
