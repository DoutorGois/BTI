The present study examines the effect of acetylcholine (ACh), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) agonist pilocarpine and mAChRs antagonist atropine on the pain-evoked response of pain-excited neurons (PEN) and pain-inhibited neurons (PIN) in the hippocampal CA1 of rats. The trains of electric impulses applied to the sciatic nerve were used as noxious stimulation. The discharges of PEN and PIN in the hippocampal CA1 were recorded by glass microelectrode. The results showed that intrahippocampal microinjection of ACh (2 microg/1 microl) or pilocarpine (2 microg/1 microl) decreased the frequency of discharge of PEN, and increased the frequency of discharge of PIN evoked by the noxious stimulation in the hippocampal CA1, while intrahippocampal administration of atropine (0.5 microg/1 microl) produced opposite response. On the basis of the above findings, we can deduce that ACh and mAChRs are involved in the modulation of nociceptive information transmission in the hippocampal CA1.
