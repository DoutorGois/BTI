The effects of dopaminergic drugs on the lowering of hippocampal theta wave frequency induced by reserpine 1 mg/kg s.c. were examined. Sibutramine (monoamine reuptake inhibitor) 10 mg/kg p.o., methamphetamine (monoamine releaser) 1 mg/kg, quinpirole (dopamine D2 receptor agonist) 10 mg/kg i.p., and SKF 38393 (dopamine D1 receptor agonist) 10 mg/kg i.p. each antagonized the reserpine-induced lowering of hippocampal theta wave frequency in rats. Moreover, the combined administration of SKF 38393 1 mg/kg i.p. and quinpirole 1 mg/kg i.p. synergistically antagonized a reserpine-induced lowering of this frequency. Dosulepin, amitriptyline, and desipramine, which are weak inhibitors of dopamine reuptake, each had little effect on the reserpine-induced lowering of theta wave frequency at a dose of 40 mg/kg p.o. Furthermore, atropine (muscarinic anticholinergic drug) 20 mg/kg p.o. decreased theta wave power in the low-frequency range following a shift to the lower range by reserpine. A positive correlation was observed for each of the above drugs between a reversal of reserpine-induced lowering of theta wave frequency and a reversal of impairment of reserpine-induced conditioned avoidance responses (ACAR) in rats. These results suggest that the reserpine-induced lowering of hippocampal theta wave frequency plays a role in the impairment of reserpine-induced ACAR, and that dopamine D1 and D2 receptors play important roles in antagonizing this lowering of frequency.
