This study aimed to demonstrate the effect of uridine monophosphate (UMP) on the consolidation of a brightness-discrimination reaction after topical application of this RNA precursor into the hippocampus, the neocortex or the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF). Thirty minutes before the rats started their training in a Y-chamber, UMP was injected into each animal through cannula implanted into the particular brain area. When injected into hippocampus or MRF UMP exerted no influence on acquisition, but after epidural UMP injection an impairment of acquisition was observed. After intrahippocampal or epidural UMP application the retention test carried out 48 hour after training showed a significant improvement in retention performance, whereas UMP injection into MRF showed no influence on retention. Consequently, the retention-improving effect of UMP is probably not induced by activation of ascending neuronal systems.
