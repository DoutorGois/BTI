Combined lesions in the medial septum/diagonal band and nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) in rats were produced using three excitotoxins, ibotenate (Ibo), quisqualate (Quis), and AMPA. Reductions in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity differed in the cortical regions for the three toxins (AMPA > Quis > Ibo), but were fairly similar in the hippocampus. ChAT activities were not reduced in the globus pallidus, but AMPA reduced ChAT in the amygdala. Lesions with all three toxins produced similar decrements in hippocampal and posterior cortical serotonin levels. A small reduction in posterior cortical norepinephrine was detected for Quis and Ibo lesions. Spatial memory impairments were found for all three toxin groups compared with controls in acquisition, platform reversal, and a spatial probe in the water maze. The learning deficit was greatest with the Quis lesion and equivalent for the Ibo and AMPA lesions. There was no deficit in single trial passive avoidance retention for the Ibo and AMPA groups. The AMPA group was slower than controls on both training and retention trials to enter the dark compartment. This group also showed a tendency to hypoactivity as measured in an open-field test. Excitotoxic infusions into medial septum/diagonal band and NBM produced spatial mnemonic deficits which do not parallel reductions in overall ChAT activity and do not resemble the profile of behavioral changes previously reported for NBM lesions alone using these toxins.
