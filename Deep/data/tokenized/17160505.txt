Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used as a treatment for mental disorder since 1930s, little progress has been made towards understanding the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic and adverse effects. The aim of this work was to analyze the expression of NCS-1 (neuronal calcium sensor 1, a protein that was found to be altered in post-mortem prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients) in striatum, cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of Wistar rats after acute or chronic electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS). Rats were submitted to a single stimulation (acute) or to a series of eight stimulations, applied one every 48 h (chronic). Animals were killed for collection of tissue samples at time zero, 30 min, 3, 12, 24 and 48 h after stimulation in the acute model and at the same time intervals after the last stimulation in the chronic model. Our results indicated that chronic ECS increased the expression of NCS-1 only in cerebellum. Such results on the expression of proteins involved in signaling pathways that are relevant for neuropsychiatric disorders and treatment, in particular ECT, can contribute to shed light on the mechanisms related to therapeutic and adverse effects.
