Voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents (ICas) in neurons can be classified into T-, N- and L-types. In the CA1 pyramidal neurons freshly isolated from rat hippocampus we found an additional tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Ca2+ current (termed 'TTX-ICa') which passed through the Na+ channel. The TTX-ICa showed a heterogeneous distribution in the dorsal site of Ca1 region.
