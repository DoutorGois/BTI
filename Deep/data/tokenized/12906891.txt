A novel short-chain peptide BmKK4 was isolated from the venom of Asian scorpion Buthus martensi Karsch. It is composed of 30 amino acids including six cysteine residues, and shares less than 25% sequence identity with the known alpha-KTx toxins. The action of BmKK4 on voltage-dependent potassium currents was examined in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons of rat. BmKK4 (10-100 microM) inhibited both the delayed rectifier and fast transient potassium current in concentration-dependent manners. The inhibition was reversible and voltage-independent. BmKK4 caused a depolarizing shift (about 10 mV) of the steady-state activation curve of the currents, without changing their steady-state inactivation behavior. The unique amino acid sequence and electrophysiological effects suggest that BmKK4 represent a new subfamily of potassium channel toxins.
