A series of putative neuroprotective agents was tested to determine their efficacy in preventing the loss of the CA 1 neurons of the hippocampus at 4 days following 5 min of bilateral ischemia in the gerbil. Agents associated with the GABAergic system were determined to be the most effective, but only when given prior to the ischemic episode, suggesting that there was a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related event during ischemia which triggers the delayed neuronal death of these cells. In this report, the unidirectional release of GABA and glutamate from gerbil hippocampal slices was determined under conditions mimicking anoxia and/or ischemia. Pentobarbital, the most effective of the GABAergic agents, had little or no effect on the time-dependent release of glutamate. In contrast, pentobarbital reduced in release of GABA in both anoxia and ischemia, but only after 25 to 30 min of incubation.
