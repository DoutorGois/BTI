The present study characterizes the effects of Abeta31-35, a short active fragment of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta), upon the BK channel-mediated K(+) current and intracellular free Ca(2)(+) concentration ([Ca(2)(+)]i) of freshly dissociated pyramidal cells from rat CA1 hippocampus by using whole-cell patch-clamp recording and single cell Ca(2)(+) imaging techniques. The results show that: (1) in the presence of voltage- and ATP-gated K(+) channel blockers application of 5.0 muM Abeta31-35 significantly diminished transient outward K(+) current amplitudes at clamped voltages between 0 and 45mV; (2) under the same conditions [Ca(2)(+)]i was minimally affected by 5.0 muM but significantly increased by 12.5 muM and 25 muM Abeta31-35; and (3) when 25 muM of a larger fragment of the amyloid beta-peptide, Abeta25-35, was applied, the results were similar to those obtained with the same concentration of Abeta31-35. These results indicate that Abeta31-35 is likely to be the shortest active fragment of the full Abeta sequence, and can be as effectively as the full-length Abeta peptide in suppressing BK-channel mediated K(+) currents and significantly elevating [Ca(2)(+)]i in hippocampal CA1 neurons.
