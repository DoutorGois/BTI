Polyclonal antibodies against Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) of rat brain were prepared by immunizing rabbits and then purified by antigen-affinity column. The antibodies which recognized both subunits of the enzyme with Mrs 49K and 60K were used for the study on the distribution of CaM kinase II in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. In the brain, a light-microscopic study demonstrated strong immunoreactivity in neuronal somata and dendrites and weak immunoreactivity in nuclei. The densely stained regions included cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, striatum, substantia nigra, and cerebellar cortex. In substantia nigra, neurites were stained, but not neuronal somata. Electron microscopy revealed that the immunoreactive product was highly concentrated at the postsynaptic densities. In addition to neurons, weak immunoreactivity was also demonstrated in glial cells, such as astrocytes and ependymal cells of ventricles and epithelial cells of choroid plexus. In other tissues, strong immunoreactivity was observed in the islet of pancreas and moderate immunoreactivity in skeletal muscle and kidney tubules. Immunoreactivity was demonstrated in all of the tissues tested. The results suggest that CaM kinase II is widely distributed in the tissues.
