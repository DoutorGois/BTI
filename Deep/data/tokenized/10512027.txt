Male Wistar rats with different types of behavior in "emotional resonance" test ("active" and "passive") were studied one week after the global ischemia induced by cardiac arrest. Recovery of some physiological functions as well as free-radical-mediated processes and NO-synthase activity were studied in cerebral structures and blood serum. The "open-field" behavior normalized more rapidly in the "active" rats than in the "passive" ones, though the time course of the neurologic deficit compensation did not differ in these groups. A decrease in superoxide scavenging activity and in the content of 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive material was revealed in the cerebral structures of both "active" and "passive" rats. Increased levels of free-radical generation in the hippocampus of the "passive" rats and in the cerebellum of the "active" rats were found. Higher NO-synthase activity was demonstrated in the cerebellum of the "passive" rats. Taken together, these data suggest that there are specific patterns of free-radical-mediated processes in the brain of rats with different types of behavior in "emotional resonance" test.
