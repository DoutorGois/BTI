Transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactivity is examined in the developing and adult brain of cats and rats, and in the adult human brain in cryostat sections immediately processed free-floating with a well-characterized monoclonal antibody which does not cross-react with epidermal growth factor. Transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactivity is observed in neurons of the cerebral neocortex, subiculum, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, amygdala, basal forebrain, mesencephalon, cerebellar cortex, dentate nucleus and brainstem during development and in adulthood. The intensity of the immunoreaction directly correlates with the size of the cytoplasm. Diffuse transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactivity also occurs in the white matter of the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem in the kitten, but not in the adult cat. In addition to neurons, numbers of glial cells in the cerebellar white matter, brainstem and cerebral hemispheres during development, and a few glial cells in the cerebellar cortex, diencephalon, cerebral cortex and white matter in adults are strongly transforming growth factor-alpha immunoreactive. These results support the concept that transforming growth factor-alpha is widely distributed in the brain of mammals, localizes in both neurons and glial cells, and is development dependent. These findings also suggest that transforming growth factor-alpha may play a role in the developing and adult central nervous system.
