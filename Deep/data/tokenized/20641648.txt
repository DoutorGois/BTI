Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that modulates a number of physiologic functions in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral organs such as the heart, kidney, and muscle (1, 2). The effect is mediated by two major subtypes of receptors (A1 and A2A receptors) and two minor subtypes (A2B and A3). In the CNS, A1 receptors are present both pre- and post-synaptically in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. A2A receptors are highly concentrated and co-localized with dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. A2A receptors are also present in low levels in the hippocampus and cortex. A2B receptors are widely distributed, but the density is higher in the gastrointestinal tract. A3 receptors are also widely distributed but with higher density in the testis. A1 and A3 receptors mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, whereas A2A and A2B receptors mediate stimulation. Changes in the adenosine receptor functions are implicated in epilepsy, ischemic cerebral stroke, movement disorders, sleep disorders, and psychiatric disorders (3-5). A2A receptors have been studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) using [7-methyl-(11)C]-(E)-8-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)-1,3,7-trimethylxanthine ([(11)C]TMSX), a methylxanthine analog of KF17387 with selective A2A antagonistic activity (6). TMSX showed better selectivity for A2A over A1 receptors than KF17387 and had little affinity in various neuroreceptor-binding assays (7). However, TMSX as a xanthine analog is subject to photoisomerization. 5-Amino-7-(3-(4-methoxy)phenylpropyl)-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1 ,5-c]pyrimidine, a non-xanthine derivative of pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine, is found to be a selective and potent antagonist for the A2A receptors (8). 5-Amino-7-(3-(4-[(11)C]methoxy)phenylpropyl)-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-tri azolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine ([(11)C]SCH442416) is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of A2A receptors in the human brain.
