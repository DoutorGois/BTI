Employing the brain dialysis technique, we demonstrate that the aspartate congener N-methyl-D,L-aspartic acid (NMA) stimulates the release of endogenous taurine in vivo in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, exogenous taurine (1-10 mM) inhibits the NMA-induced Ca2+ influx into intracellular compartments. This suggests that the extracellular taurine concentration may control Ca2+ movement and thereby provide a homeostatic mechanism in situations of excessive excitation.
