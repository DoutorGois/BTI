Statistical characteristics of background impulse activity of the rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons in situ and in vitro were compared. A statistical analysis shows a good coincidence of the following numerical characteristics of interspike intervals distribution: mathematical expectations, standard deviations, coefficients of asymmetry and excess. This coincidence proves the preservation of normal functional properties of hippocampal neurons in tissue culture. However some differences were found in the structure of the compared spike sequences which may be attributed to essential differences between the neuronal networks in the objects studied.
