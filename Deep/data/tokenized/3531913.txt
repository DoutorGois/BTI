The new electrophysiological model earlier described as stereo-EEG is extended now to allow recording from the freely moving rat by means of a telemetric device. Chronic implantation of 4 electrodes into the brain allows simultaneous transmission of field potentials from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation. Frequency analysis of these potentials results in a drug-specific 'fingerprint' which cannot only be used to compare different chemicals with each other but also to detect onset and time dependence of drug actions. Application of the model to the question if fenetylline has its own intrinsic mode of action or merely develops its stimulatory effect after metabolic separation into its molecular moieties amphetamine and theophylline (prodrug hypothesis) revealed that fenetylline indeed displays its own stimulatory effect to the same extent and at a similar time course as amphetamine and theophylline. The 'fingerprint' as obtained by the analysis of the action of fenetylline in the rat resembles closely that obtained after the application of theophylline with respect to decreased alpha activity, but resembles amphetamine with respect to beta 1 activity. Thus the applied method allows studying structure function relationships as the action of fenetylline seems to reflect both its molecular moieties.
