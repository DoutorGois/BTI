The density of hippocampal adenosine A1 receptors was measured in autopsy samples of six patients with dementia with either Alzheimer (three) or sclerosis type pathology (three) in hippocampus and six control patients. Kinetic parameters (Bmax and KD) were determined by means of quantitative autoradiography using [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1 ,3-dipropylxanthine as a radioligand. A significant 50% reduction of CA1 adenosine A1 receptors was observed in patients with dementia independent of the specific pathology. These results suggest that loss of hippocampal adenosine A1 receptors in dementia is not specific for Alzheimer type pathology.
