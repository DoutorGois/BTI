Preincubation of rat hippocampal slices with 0.05-0.5 microM pyroglutamylasparagine amide improved characteristics of long-term potentiation of focal responses in the synaptic system of Schaffer collaterals-CA1 field pyramids facilitating LTP development and increasing its amplitude and duration. Presumably, the positive modulation of plastic characteristics of synaptic transmission in the hippocampusis is responsible for facilitation of learning and memory induced by pyroglutamylasparagine.
