Neurodegeneration observed in lentiviral-associated encephalitis has been linked to viral-infected and -activated central nervous system macrophages. We hypothesized that lentivirus, macrophages, or both lentivirus and macrophages within distinct microenvironments mediate synaptic damage. Using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaque model, we assessed the relationship between virus, macrophages, and neurological damage in multiple brain regions using laser confocal microscopy. In SIV-infected macaques with SIV encephalitis (SIVE), brain tissue concentrations of SIV RNA were 5 orders of magnitude greater than that observed in nonencephalitic animals. In SIVE, staining for postsynaptic protein microtubule-associated protein-2 was significantly decreased in the caudate, hippocampus, and frontal cortical gray matter compared to nonencephalitic controls, whereas staining for presynaptic protein synaptophysin was decreased in SIV-infected macaques with and without encephalitis. These data suggest that presynaptic damage occurs independent of pathological changes associated with SIVE, whereas postsynaptic damage is more tightly linked to regional presence of both activated and infected macrophages.
