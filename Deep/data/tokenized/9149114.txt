The present study employed differential library screening to identify genes associated with kainic acid (KA)-mediated selective neuronal death. One of the isolated clones was lamp-1, which encodes a major lysosomal membrane protein that is also present in the cell membrane. Following systemic KA treatment, lamp-1 was induced in vulnerable hippocampal and other limbic regions. This effect was blocked by cycloheximide (CHX) pre-treatment. Northern blot analysis also demonstrated the presence of lamp-1 transcripts in non-neural tissues. These findings suggest a novel role for lysosomal membrane proteins as markers of selective neuronal vulnerability.
