Wistar rats were kindled by electrical stimulations in the amygdala and autophosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) at Thr-286 (alpha-subunit) was investigated immunocytochemically. In kindled rats strong immunoreactivity was detected in the somas and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in CA1 area of the hippocampus. Immunoreactivity was also positive in the somas of CA2 to CA4 pyramidal cells, dentate granule cells, and some hilar cells. Only weak reaction was detected in the somas of these neurons in non-kindled rats. Data suggest the role in the development of kindling of CaMKII which is activated through its autophosphorylation.
