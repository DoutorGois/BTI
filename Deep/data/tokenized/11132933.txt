Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a process of unknown etiology characterized by amyloid deposition in the wall of small cerebral and meningeal blood vessels. CAA is also a feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of a subgroup of elderly people. Alpha-1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) is a serum glycoprotein frequently associated with vascular and senile plaque amyloid. The ACT gene is known to have a bi-allele polymorphism that causes a simple amino acid substitution. In an attempt to clarify the possible role of ACT polymorphism in AD and in cases of CAA, the ACT genotype was investigated in AD, CAA, and intellectually intact controls. Representative brain areas (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, putamen, white matter, and gyrus cinguli) from all cases were studied using classical histologic staining techniques (hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Mallory's thrichromic or alkaline congo red stain), and immunohistochemistry for tau and beta-amyloid proteins. There was a significantly increased T allele and TT genotype frequency in the CAA group, but not in the AD group, suggesting a role for the ACT genotype in the development of vascular lesions. The presence of the apolipoprotein E4 allele (ApoE4) did not correlate with the ACT-A allele, as previously reported, and appeared to be independent of the risk for developing AD.
