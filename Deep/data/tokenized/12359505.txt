Galanin overexpressing transgenic mice (GAL-tg) were generated on two different promoters. Both lines of GAL-tg displayed high levels of galanin in the hippocampus and reduced sensitivity to seizures, as compared to their respective wildtype littermate controls (WT). Performance deficits on learning and memory tasks, impaired long-term potentiation, reduced hippocampal excitability, lower evoked glutamate release, and reduced numbers of choline acetyltransferase immunoreactive neurons in the horizontal limb of the diagonal band were detected in GAL-tg as compared to WT. Changes in sensitivity to nociceptive stimuli were demonstrated in one line. GAL-tg represent a new model for investigating the biological actions of endogenous galanin, and for testing novel therapeutics based on galanin receptor ligands.
