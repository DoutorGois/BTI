Rats with one- or two-stage lesions in the hippocampus, anzygdala, or frontal cortex were tested on a variety of tasks. Even though locus and amount of tissue damage were very similar in the two groups, animals with one-stage lesions were impaired as judged by performance on all problems, while aninmals with two-stage lesionis were not.
