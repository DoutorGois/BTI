The accumulation of serotonin induced by the monoamino oxidase inhibitor pargyline was used as an index for 5-HT turnover in the dorsal hippocampus and raphe area. A low dose of corticosterone administered s.c. immediately after adrenalectomy significantly increased serotonin turnover in both regions over the subsequent 1 h interval. The same dose of aldosterone was ineffective, but pretreatment with aldosterone blocked the serotonin response to corticosterone in the acutely adrenalectomized rat. [3H]Corticosterone administered to adrenalectomized rats was not retained by cell nuclei of the raphe area in a limited capacity manner as occurred in the hippocampus. Pretreatment with aldosterone blocked the uptake of [3H]corticosterone in hippocampal cell nuclei. It is concluded that corticosterone triggers a serotonin response and that the specificity of the corticosterone action suggests involvement of the steroid receptor system located postsynaptically to the raphe-hippocampal serotonin projection.
