A comparative morphometric study of postresuscitation changes in the neuronal populations of the pyramidal cells from hyppocampal sector CA1 and Purkinje cells of the lateral cerebellar region in the course of postresuscitation period after 12-minute cardiac arrest in rats has shown that the changes differ in severity and pattern. In the pyramidal cells there were reversible dystrophic alterations of the neurons. Purkinje cells showed death of some neurons, this process progressed in the course of postresuscitation period. A positive effect of the peptide kyotorphin on the brain condition after resuscitation was found but its efficacy in different neuronal populations varied.
