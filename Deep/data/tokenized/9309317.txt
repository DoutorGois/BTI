The technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) differential display was used to detect alterations in gene expression after chronic alcohol administration. Male Wistar rats were treated with ethanol vapor for 14 days. The cDNA generated from mRNA isolated from the hippocampi of ethanol-treated and control animals was compared by PCR differential display. A differentially expressed cDNA fragment was used to screen mRNA samples by Northern analysis. The level of a mRNA was significantly elevated (x 2.5) in the hippocampus, but not the cortex of alcohol-treated rats up to 48 hr after withdrawal. Sequence analysis of the cDNA fragment revealed an almost perfect homology to rat mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 mRNA. The selective induction of this mRNA in alcohol-treated rat brain areas suggests altered metabolic processes and possible dysfunction of the mitochondria. The technique of PCR differential display may prove useful in further analysis of gene expression during alcohol dependence and withdrawal.
