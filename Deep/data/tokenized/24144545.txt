Here we explored the in vivo role of brain corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type-2 (CRFR2) in cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking. Conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure was used to assess the acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior in rats. First, expressions of CRFR2 were shown to be affected in a brain region-specific manner within cocaine-induced CPP and cocaine-extinct CPP models. Bilateral blockade of CRFR2 in the dorsal portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), or hippocampus (HP) was partially inhibited, but in the dorsal striatum (DS) did not affect, the cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine CPP.
