AIMS: Heart failure (HF) patients show cognitive and mood impairments, including short-term memory loss and depression, that have an adverse impacting on quality of life and self-care management. Brain regions, including the hippocampus, a structure significantly involved in memory and mood, show injury in HF, but the integrity of specific hippocampal subregions is unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess regional hippocampal volume loss, we evaluated 17 HF patients (mean age +/- SD, 54.4 +/- 2.0 years; 12 male, left ventricular ejection fraction 28.3 +/- 6.8%; New York Heart Association class II/III 94%/6%) and 34 healthy control subjects (52.3 +/- 1.3 years; 24 male) using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and evaluated localized surface changes with morphometric procedures. Hippocampi were manually outlined, and volumes calculated from normalized tracings. Volume differences between groups were assessed by two-sample t-tests, and regional differences were assessed by surface morphometry. Patients with HF exhibited smaller hippocampal volumes than controls (right 3060 +/- 146 mm(3) vs. 3478 +/- 94 mm(3), P = 0.02; left 3021 +/- 145 mm(3) vs. 3352 +/- 98 mm(3), P = 0.06). Volume reductions were detected principally in CA1, an area integral to an array of learning and memory functions, as well as in mid to posterior CA3 and subiculum. CONCLUSION: The hippocampus shows regional volume reduction in HF, which may contribute to short-term memory loss and depression associated with the condition.
