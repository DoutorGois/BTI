Many data suggest that the brain's cholinergic neurons participate in the control of memory and it has been suggested that cholinergic systems are involved differentially in working and reference memory. To test this hypothesis the effects on memory of unilateral injections of the neurotoxins, quinolinic acid or kainic acid into the cortically projecting cholinergic cells of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbm) were evaluated. In experiment 1, quinolinate-injected (n = 7) and sham-operated (n = 7) rats were tested in a T-maze alternation task that requires working memory. Lesion rats performed significantly more poorly than shams and subsequent biochemical assays of cortical choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity revealed significant reductions in the lesion rats. In experiment 2, kainate-injected (n = 9) and sham-operated (n = 8) rats were trained in an eight-arm radial maze with only four arms baited. Lesion rats made significantly more working memory errors (entries into baited arms from which the food had already been collected) than reference memory errors (entries into never baited arms). CAT assays showed that the lesion led to a decrease in cortical CAT with no significant change in hippocampal CAT. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that cholinergic neurons of the basocortical system may be differentially involved in working and reference memory.
