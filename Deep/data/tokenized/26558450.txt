Tris-(2,3-dibromopropyl) isocyanurate (TDBP-TAZTO), an emerging brominated flame retardant, possesses the characteristics of candidate persistent organic pollutants and has displayed toxicity to fish and rodents. TDBP-TAZTO can pass through the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. TDBP-TAZTO might also induce neuronal cell toxicity. However, the neurotoxicity and mechanisms of TDBP-TAZTO have not yet been studied. We hypothesize that TDBP-TAZTO could induce neurotoxicity in mouse hippocampal neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. The mice were exposed to TDBP-TAZTO of 5 and 50 mg/kg by gavage, daily for 30 days. TDBP-TAZTO resulted in depression-like behaviors, which may be related with TDBP-TAZTO-induced upregulation of oxidative stress markers and overexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins in hippocampus. Furthermore, TDBP-TAZTO treatment for 48 hr (12.5, 25 and 50 microM) damaged SH-SY5Y cells, and led to cell apoptosis and oxidative stress in concentration-dependent manner. Our findings suggested that cell apoptosis and oxidative stress are important mechanisms in neurotoxicity induced by TDBP-TAZTO.
