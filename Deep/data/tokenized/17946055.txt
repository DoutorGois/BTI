Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that can have damaging effects in the brain including over 50% loss of neuronal activity in the hippocampal regions of the CA1 and CA3. The pre-ictal period was studied in an animal model of limbic epilepsy using Shannon entropy and correlation analysis. The primary aim was to uncover underlying relative changes in signals between the Dentate Gyrus and CA1 areas of the bilateral hippocampus. Preliminary entropy analysis results included dynamical changes between channels in the Dentate Gyrus and channels in the CA1 region at and around the time of the seizure.
