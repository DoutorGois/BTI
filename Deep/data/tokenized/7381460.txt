The frequency characteristics of tetanic and post-tetanic potentiation of the septohippocampal and hippocampal commissural systems were studied in the acute rabbit preparation. Glass micropipettes were employed to stimulate the medial septal (MSR) and contralateral CA1 (cCA1) regions. Extracellular postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens layers of dorsal CA1. Low frequencies of stimulation (2--12 Hz) and brief stimulus trains (7 or 16 stimuli) ensured that only short-term effects appeared in the data. With MSR and cCA1 stimulation, tetanic potentiation became pronounced at 4 Hz, and plateaued at 6--8 Hz. Thus potentiation was found to be pronounced within the range of the rabbit hippocampal theta rhythm. No differences were found in the characteristics of potentiation evoked by stimulation of MSR and cCA1. Post-tetanic potentiation lasting 6--12 sec was found. Again, potentiation characteristics did not depend on stimulus site, suggesting a common mechanism for the pathways studied. A two-factor mechanism was proposed to account for the post-tetanic potentiation data.
