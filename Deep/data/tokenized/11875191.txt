Both the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the cerebellar cortex consist mainly of granule cells and develop postnatally. The granule cells in both tissues are presumed to be similar. Changes in gene expression were analyzed during the postnatal development of the dentate gyrus. Altogether, expression patterns of 1,937 genes were determined by adaptor-tagged competitive PCR. More than 90% of the genes belong to groups characterized by elevated expression either at earlier or later stages of development. A majority of the genes expressed showed marked changes during the developmental process, but there was little correlation between gene function and expression, unlike that observed during mouse postnatal cerebellar development. Despite anatomical and physiological similarities between these two processes, the gene expression profiles are completely different.
