Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common autosomal dominant disorder in which affected individuals develop benign and malignant tumors as well as non-tumor-related abnormalities, such as seizures and learning disabilities. Here, we report an NF1 isoform arising from the alternative splicing of exon 9a with predominant central nervous system (CNS) expression. Exon 9a expression is enriched in neurons of the forebrain, specifically septum, striatum, cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb with significantly less expression in brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord. This pattern of NF1 exon 9a expression correlates with the postnatal maturation of these neurons and suggests a role for NF1 in neuronal differentiation.
