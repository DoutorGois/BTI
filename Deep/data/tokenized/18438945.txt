Neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), have repeatedly been shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies have claimed that these neurotrophic factors are important tools for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. So far, little is known about the age- and disease-modulated time course of cerebral neurotrophins. Therefore, we have studied protein concentrations of BDNF, NGF, and NT-3 in different brain areas and sciatic nerve, a neurotrophin-transporting peripheral nerve, in a well-characterized AD model of amyloid precursor protein-overexpressing rodents (APP23 mice) at the ages of 5.0, 10.5, and 20.0 months. In APP23 mice, there was a significant increase of BDNF and NGF in the frontal and occipital cortices (for BDNF also in the striatum) of old 20.0-month-old mice (with respect to median values up to 8.2-fold), which was highly correlated with amyloid concentrations of these brain areas. Median values of NGF and NT-3 showed up to a 6.0-fold age-dependent increase in the septum that was not detectable in APP23 mice. Hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum (except NT-3) did not show substantial age- or genotype-related regulation of neurotrophins. In the sciatic nerve, BDNF and NGF levels are increased in5-month-old APP23 mice and decrease with age to control levels. In conclusion, APP23 mice show a genotype-dependent increase of cortical BDNF and NGF that is highly correlated with amyloid concentrations and may reflect an amyloid-related glia-derived neurotrophin secretion or an altered axonal transport of these neurotrophic factors.
