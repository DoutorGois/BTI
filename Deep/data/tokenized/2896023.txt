It has been established in chronic experiments on rabbits that acute alcohol intoxication increased the after-discharge thresholds in response to electrical stimulation of dorsal hippocampus. It has been shown that neurotropic agents selectively blocking M- or N-cholinoceptors exerted various effects. M-cholino-blocker methamizol (1 mg/kg, i. p.) decreased the excitability of dorsal hippocampus, potentiated EEG and behavioural effects of alcohol intoxication. N-cholinoblocker etherophen (IEM-506, 20 mg/kg, i. p.), on the contrary, increased the excitability of dorsal hippocampus and reduced behavioural effects of alcohol administration.
