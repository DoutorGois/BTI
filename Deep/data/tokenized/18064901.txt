Comparative investigation of activity of medial septal neurons, which was performed by extracellular recordings in the brain slices of health guinea pigs and in such ones of animals with the model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy, revealed the distinctions between them, concerning a neuronal frequency and pattern of discharges. In the epileptic brain, twofold increase of general level of activity was observed comparative to control one, owing to augmentation of frequency of discharges in non-regular and regular non-bursting neurons. Sharp increase (three times as much) of number of cells with rhythmic burst discharges and changing of parameters of burst activity were discovered, the letter both in the neurons with endogenous (pacemaker) pattern and in the cells secondary involved in the rhythmic activity. Possible mechanisms of these alterations are discussed. The present data advance the understanding of the processes of a pathological synchronization and may promote creation of new approaches to treatment this disease.
