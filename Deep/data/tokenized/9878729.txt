Binding studies were used to assess the changes in affinity and/or number of M1 muscarinic receptors in hippocampi from juvenile rats chronically deprived of NGF. NGF deprivation was obtained by implanting into right ventricle at postnatal day 2 (P2) hybrydoma cells secreting high levels of monoclonal antibodies against NGF (alphaD11). Parenteral myeloma cells (P3U) were used as controls. Competition experiments were used to characterise the [3H]-PNZ binding sites in membrane preparations of hippocampi from rats sacrificed at P15. [3H]-PNZ bound M1 receptors both in P3U and alphaD11 group as shown by displacing potency order of antagonists: TLZ=4-DAMP>PNZ>p-F-HHSiD>MTC. The deprivation of NGF for two weeks significantly increased the number of M1 receptors without changing the Ki values of antagonists with exception of methoctramine which showed an increase in affinity in alphaD11 group. Similar changes in binding parameters were already observed after the first week of anti-NGF treatment. In contrast, a treatment for a week with implant at postnatal day 15 failed to produce any changes in M1 binding parameters. These results provide further physiological evidence for developmentally regulated modulatory role of NGF in the cholinergic function in the hippocampus.
