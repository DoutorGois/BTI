Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are involved in the progression of ischemic brain injury and hence vascular dementia; however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we have investigated the interrelationship between stress-responsive heme oxygenase (HO)-1 isoenzyme and TLR4 during chronic brain hypoperfusion. The right unilateral common carotid artery occlusion was performed by ligation of the right common carotid artery in C57BL/6J mice. The brain cortex or hippocampus was removed for western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence analysis. The link between HO-1 and TLR4 was further examined by silencing TLR4 and pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 in primary cultured cortical neurons. Cognitive dysfunction and decrease in cerebral blood flow in mice were observed 4 weeks after the occlusion. Our data further show that common carotid artery occlusion induced an increase in TLR4 and HO-1 protein levels. Although the administration of CoPP (10 mg/kg), HO-1 agonist, improved the cognitive dysfunction in a mice model of occlusion, western blot analysis in primary cultured cortical neurons showed that HO-1 was upregulated after lipopolysaccharide treatment; this was partially abolished by the TLR4 siRNA interference. The flow cytometry analysis showed that pharmacological inhibition of HO-1 by ZnPP (100 muM) further exaggerated lipopolysaccharide-induced neuronal cell death. Hence, stress-responsive HO-1 isoenzyme participates in TLR4-induced inflammation during chronic brain ischemia. The pharmacological manipulation of TLR4 or the HO-1 antioxidant defense pathway may represent a novel treatment strategy for neuronal protection in vascular dementia.
