Using immunoenzymic assays, the authors studied concentrations of two isoforms of the glycolytic enzyme enolase (neurospecific, NSE, and non-neurospecific, NNE) in different structures of the postmortem brain in mentally normal people (n = 15) and in schizophrenics (n = 9). In schizophrenic patients NSE concentrations were increased by 70% (p less than 0.001) in the sensory cortex and reduced by the same magnitude in the thalamus. Insignificant changes in their levels (by 15-20%, p less than 0.05) were also discovered in the temporal cortex (elevation), lymbic cortex and the hippocampus (decrease). Cerebral values of NNE in schizophrenic patients were virtually unaltered; a certain augmentation was detected only in the hippocampus. It is supposed that marked changes in NSE concentrations in the sensory cortex and in the thalamus are probably related to the pathological processes occurring in the neural tissue in schizophrenia.
