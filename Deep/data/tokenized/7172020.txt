Rats were given sham, cortical, or hippocampal lesions and sacrificed 7 or 28 days following surgery. Levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, and the major dopamine metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid (HVA), were assayed in 3 brain regions. At day 7 there was a decrease in dopamine utilization and a decrease in norepinephrine levels in the nucleus accumbens after hippocampal damage but both of these measures returned to normal levels by day 28. In the neostriatum HVA levels decreased at day 7 after hippocampal damage. The utilization of dopamine in the neostriatum was decreased at day 28 in animals that received neocortical lesions but this was not observed in animals with hippocampal destruction. No effects of any lesion at any day were found in the olfactory tubercle region, the third brain region analyzed. It is thought that the removal of hippocampal and neocortical input to the basal ganglia influences catecholamine function reflected in the loss and subsequent recovery of dopamine utilization.
