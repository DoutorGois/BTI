The maximum rates (Vmax) of some mitochondrial enzyme activities related to energy transduction (citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome oxidase) and amino acid metabolism (glutamate dehydrogenase) were evaluated in non-synaptic (free) and synaptic mitochondria from rat hippocampus and striatum. Three types of mitochondria were isolated from control rats aged 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months and treated ones with L-acetylcarnitine (100 mg.kg-1, i.p., 60 min). Enzyme activities of non-synaptic and synaptic mitochondria are different in hippocampus and striatum, confirming that a different metabolic machinery exists in various types of brain mitochondria. During aging, enzyme activities behave quite similarly in both areas. In vivo administration of L-acetylcarnitine decreased the enzyme activities related to Krebs' cycle mainly of synaptic mitochondria, suggesting a specific subcellular trigger site of action. The drug increased cytochrome oxidase activity of synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria, indicating the specificity of molecular interaction with this enzyme.
