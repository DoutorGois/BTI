Glial cells provide energy substrates to neurons, in part from glycogen metabolism, which is influenced by glycogen phosphorylase (GP). To gain insight into the potential subfield and laminar-specific expression of GP, histochemistry can be used to evaluate active GP (GPa) or totalGP (GPa + GPb). Using this approach, we tested the hypothesis that changes in GP would occur under pathological conditions that are associated with increased energy demand, i.e. severe seizures (status epilepticus or 'status'). We also hypothesized that GP histochemistry would provide insight into changes in the days and weeks after status, particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, where there are robust changes in structure and function. One hour after the onset of pilocarpine-induced status, GPa staining was reduced in most regions of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex relative to saline-injected controls. One week after status, there was increased GPa and totalGP, especially in the inner molecular layer, where synaptic reorganization of granule cell mossy fibre axons occurs (mossy fibre sprouting). In addition, patches of dense GP reactivity were evident in many areas. One month after status, levels of GPa and totalGP remained elevated in some areas, suggesting an ongoing role of GP or other aspects of glycogen metabolism, possibly due to the evolution of intermittent, recurrent seizures at approximately 3-4 weeks after status. Taken together, the results suggest that GP is dynamically regulated during and after status in the adult rat, and may have an important role in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy.
