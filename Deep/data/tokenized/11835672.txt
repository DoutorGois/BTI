Cerebellar deficient folia (cdf) is a recently identified mouse mutation causing ataxia and cerebellar abnormalities including lobulation defects and abnormal placement of a specific subset of Purkinje cells. To understand the etiology of the cerebellar defects in cdf mutant mice, we examined postnatal development of the cdf/cdf cerebellum. Our results demonstrate that Purkinje cell ectopia and foliation defects are apparent at birth, suggesting the cdf mutation disrupts the positioning of many, but not all, Purkinje cells during development. In addition to cerebellar abnormalities, we observed lamination defects in the hippocampus of cdf mutant mice, although neocortical defects were not seen. Furthermore, ectopic Purkinje cells in cdf/cdf mice express an increased level of Dab1 protein, as previously observed in mice with mutations in genes in the reelin signaling pathway. Lastly, analysis of cdf <-->ROSA26 chimeric mice demonstrated that the cdf mutation is intrinsic to Purkinje cells. We suggest that the cdf gene product is required in a subset of Purkinje cells, possibly to respond to Reelin signals.
