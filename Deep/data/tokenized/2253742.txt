The effect of dexamethasone (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, 24 hours before the experiment) on the orientation activity of the rats in the "open field" was studied in experimental neurosis. The formation of neurosis was accompanied by changes in the locomotor and orientation activities, amino acid concentrations in the brain structures. This manifested itself in an increase of GABA amounts in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum by 56, 29 and 27%, respectively (p less than 0.001, 0.05 and 0.001). In the subcortical structures the contents of glutamic acid increased and the amounts of phenylalanine decreased. Dexamethasone was found to enhance the orientation activity and to change the neurochemical organization of the brain structures, to a greater extent in the hippocampus, that manifested itself in a sharp decrease of the contents of neuroactive amino acids.
