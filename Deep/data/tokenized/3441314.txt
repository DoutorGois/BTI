Rats, implanted with dialysis loops in the dorsal hippocampus, were injected with subconvulsant doses of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ 15 and 30 mg/kg) and a 30-min sample collected for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of amines and amino acids. Immediately after the sampling period they were given a 5-min test in the elevated plus-maze. On the basis of their performance in this test, they were divided into an 'anxious' and a 'non-anxious' group. The anxious group had significantly lower levels of glycine and serotonin (5-HT) release. Although PTZ decreased the release of noradrenaline, this was not correlated with behavioural differences in the elevated plus-maze.
