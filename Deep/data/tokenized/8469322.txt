We conducted a retrospective single-blind study assessing the value of MRI in 44 children surgically treated for partial epilepsy, and correlated the MRI findings with the pathology in all cases. MRI revealed abnormalities in concordance with the clinical and electroencephalographic data in 84% of patients. Developmental neuronal migration pathology was present in 25% of patients and was relatively more common in the sensorimotor cortex. There was hippocampal sclerosis in 50% of patients with temporal lobe resection; however, only two of the 10 children with hippocampal sclerosis were below the age of 12 years. Similarly, ganglio-glial tumors were more common than astrocytomas in children below age 12. These results indicate that MRI is sensitive in the detection of pathologic abnormalities in most pediatric candidates for epilepsy surgery, and that the distribution and type of pathology appear to be age related in this population.
