The object of this study was to compare the postnatal development of mossy fiber potentiation (MFP) and paired-pulse facilitation in the CA3 region of control and led-exposed rats. The postnatal development of MFP was not influenced by the chronic pre- and postnatal lead exposure nor did we find a statistically significant impairment of MFP in region CA3 following lead exposure in the four age groups studied. In contrast to the adult animals, in the three immature groups of the control as well as the lead-exposed animals MFP was preceded by a posttetanic depression after which MFP developed slowly. The results of the paired-pulse procedure depended both on the age and on the interstimulus interval (ISI) in control and lead-exposed animals. The differences between control and lead-exposed rats were statistically significant only in the adult animals at an ISI of 10 ms. In this case paired-pulse stimulation resulted in an increase of the second evoked response relative to the first response in the lead-exposed animals while the same procedure decreased the second evoked response in the control animals. It is concluded that although low lead exposure had no effect on the expression of MFP in hippocampal CA3 region, inhibitory mechanisms as revealed by paired-pulse stimulation are impaired by lead in adult rats.
