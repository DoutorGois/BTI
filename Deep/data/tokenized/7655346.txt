Transgenic mice that express human metallothionein-III (hMT-III) were generated. Human MT-III mRNA expression was prominent in brain, resulting in a 9-fold elevation of MT-III mRNA in cortex, a 3-5-fold elevation in hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, and olfactory bulb, and a 1.4-fold elevation in cerebellum. Human MT-III protein was detected biochemically and accounted for a 3.4-fold increase in total brain MT. The concentration of zinc (but not copper) was elevated in those brain regions that expressed the most hMT-III mRNA. The histochemically reactive pool of zinc, as measured by Timm's stain or TS-Q histofluorescence, was not appreciably altered. No changes in brain weight, morphology or histology have been noted; the mice breed normally and appear to have normal behavior.
