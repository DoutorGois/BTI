Astrocyte dysfunction emerges early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to its pathology and progression. Recently, the voltage gated potassium channel KV3.4 subunit, which underlies the fast-inactivating K(+) currents, has been recognized to be relevant for AD pathogenesis and is emerging as a new target candidate for AD. In the present study, we investigated both in in vitro and in vivo models of AD the expression and functional activity of KV3.4 potassium channel subunits in astrocytes. In primary astrocytes our biochemical, immunohistochemical, and electrophysiological studies demonstrated a time-dependent upregulation of KV3.4 expression and functional activity after exposure to amyloid-beta (Abeta) oligomers. Consistently, astrocytic KV3.4 expression was upregulated in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice. Further, confocal triple labeling studies revealed that in 6-month-old Tg2576 mice, KV3.4 was intensely coexpressed with Abeta in nonplaque associated astrocytes. Interestingly, in the cortical and hippocampal regions of 12-month-old Tg2576 mice, plaque-associated astrocytes much more intensely expressed KV3.4 subunits, but not Abeta. More important, we evidenced that the selective knockdown of KV3.4 expression significantly downregulated both glial fibrillary acidic protein levels and Abeta trimers in the brain of 6-month-old Tg2576 mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the expression and function of KV3.4 channel subunits are precociously upregulated in cultured astrocytes exposed to Abeta oligomers and in reactive astrocytes of AD Tg2576 mice.
