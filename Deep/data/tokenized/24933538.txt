Rosiglitazone has been known to attenuate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, Morris water maze test, ELISA and electrophysiological methods were used to examine the role and underling mechanisms of rosiglitazone on Abeta42 oligomer-induced memory impairments. We found that rosiglitazone attenuated Abeta42 oligomer-induced memory impairments in rats in a dose-dependent manner. The levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) were significantly increased 7 days after injection of Abeta42 oligomers into the rat hippocampus. Inhibition of microglia activation prevented Abeta42 oligomer-induced increases in IL-1beta and IFNgamma levels. Rosiglitazone completely prevented the increase in the levels of IL-1beta and IFNgamma induced by Abeta42 oligomers. Treatment of hippocampal slices with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1beta or IFNgamma significantly inhibited the production of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus. Rosiglitazone prevented the inhibitory effects of inflammatory cytokines on LTP. Thus, inhibition of inflammatory responses may be part of the mechanisms of action of rosiglitazone on preventing memory deficits induced by Abeta42 oligmers.
