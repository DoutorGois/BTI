In experiments with rat brain slices it was shown that a radiation-induced short-term increase in spontaneous neuron activity was mainly a function of dose rate. Pulsed X-radiation (pulse length of 2 X 10(-8) s, doses of 3 X 10(-5) to 6 X 10(-4) Gy) caused the most pronounced reactions that were almost completely prevented by caffeine, euphylline, and norepinephrine (10(-4) to 10(-3) M).
