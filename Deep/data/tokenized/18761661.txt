Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) continues to be the most common pathology identified in patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing surgery. Wilhelm Sommer described this characteristic pattern of neuronal loss over 120 years ago through his post-mortem studies on patients with epilepsy. Neuropathological post-mortem studies in the 20th century proceeded to contribute significantly to the understanding of this disease process, with regard to the varying patterns of HS and involvement of adjacent limbic structures. From studies of surgical temporal lobe specimens from the 1950s onwards it was recognized that an early cerebral injury could act as the precipitant for the sclerosis and epilepsy. Modern neuropathological studies have focused on aspects of neuronal injury, loss of specific neuronal groups and cellular reorganization to address mechanisms of epileptogenesis and the enigma of how specific hippocampal neuronal vulnerabilities and glial proliferation are both the effect and the cause of seizures.
