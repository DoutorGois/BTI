We have previously shown that short-lasting reduction of cerebral blood flow by bilateral clamping of carotid arteries (BCCA) results in long-lasting increase in regional GABA concentration and decrease in seizure susceptibility in rats. In the present experiments, the effect of BCCA on GABA turnover and the enzymes involved in GABA synthesis and degradation were studied in rats. Regional GABA turnover was measured by means of GABA accumulation induced by the GABA-transaminase (GABA-T) inhibitor aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA). Fourteen days after BCCA, GABA turnover was significantly increased in hippocampus, substantia nigra and cortex, but not different from sham-operated controls in several other brain regions, including striatum, hypothalamus and cerebellum. The activity of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) measured ex vivo did not show any changes in investigated structures, while the activity of GABA-T was slightly increased in hippocampus. The increased GABA turnover in some brain regions may explain our previous findings of increased GABA content in these brain regions and decreased sensitivity of BCCA treated animals to the GABAA-receptor antagonist bicuculline.
