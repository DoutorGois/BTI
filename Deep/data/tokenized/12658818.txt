To explore the relationship between beta-amyloid (A beta) and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), after injection of beta-amyloid into the rat brain, the apoptosis of nerve cells and acetylcholine (Ach) content in rat hippocampus were examined by employing TUNEL technique and base hydroxylamine colorimetry respectively. The influence of age and glucocorticoid on the neurotoxic effect of A beta was also analyzed. A beta peptide could strongly induce the apoptosis of neurons in hippocampus, cortex and striate body (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). In addition, the senility and glucocorticoid pre-treatment could enhance the toxic effect of A beta (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). It is concluded that A beta may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease via its induction of apoptosis of neurons and by decreasing the content of the Ach.
