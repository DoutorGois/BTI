INTRODUCTION: Synaptic dysfunction and intracellular transport defects are early events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Extracellular amyloid beta (Abeta) oligomers cause spine alterations and impede the transport of proteins and organelles such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondria that are required for synaptic function. Meanwhile, intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta precedes its extracellular deposition and is also associated with synaptic dysfunction in AD. However, the links between intracellular Abeta, spine alteration, and mechanisms that support synaptic maintenance such as organelle trafficking are poorly understood. RESULTS: We compared the effects of wild-type and Osaka (E693Delta)-mutant amyloid precursor proteins: the former secretes Abeta into extracellular space and the latter accumulates Abeta oligomers within cells. First we investigated the effects of intracellular Abeta oligomers on dendritic spines in primary neurons and their tau-dependency using tau knockout neurons. We found that intracellular Abeta oligomers caused a reduction in mushroom, or mature spines, independently of tau. We also found that intracellular Abeta oligomers significantly impaired the intracellular transport of BDNF, mitochondria, and recycling endosomes: cargoes essential for synaptic maintenance. A reduction in BDNF transport by intracellular Abeta oligomers was also observed in tau knockout neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that intracellular Abeta oligomers likely contribute to early synaptic pathology in AD and argue against the consensus that Abeta-induced spine loss and transport defects require tau.
