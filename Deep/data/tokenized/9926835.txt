We studied the effects of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) on expression of genes coding for PR isoforms in the forebrain of ovariectomized rats by RT-PCR analysis. In the hypothalamus the expression of both PR isoforms was induced by E2 and down-regulated by P4. In the preoptic area these changes were only observed in the PR-B isoform. In contrast, in the hippocampus PR induction by E2 was only observed for PR-A. In this region P4 did not modify the expression of any PR isoform. These results indicate that PR isoforms expression is differentially regulated by sex steroid hormones in distinct forebrain regions and suggest that the tissue-specific regulation of either PR-A or PR-B may be involved in the physiological actions of P4 upon the rat brain.
