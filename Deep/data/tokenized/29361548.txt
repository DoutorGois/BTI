The hippocampus is the region of the brain that is most susceptible to ischemic lesion because it contains pyramidal neurons that are highly vulnerable to ischemic cell death. A restricted brain neurogenesis limits the possibility of reversing massive cell death after stroke and, hence, endorses cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies following cerebral ischemia. Neurons differentiated from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) can mature and integrate into host circuitry, improving recovery after stroke. However, how the host environment regulates the NSPC behavior in post-ischemic tissue remains unknown. Here, we studied functional maturation of NSPCs in control and post-ischemic hippocampal tissue after modelling cerebral ischemia in situ We traced the maturation of electrophysiological properties and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, with these cells developing appropriate activity 3 weeks or less after engraftment. In the tissue subjected to ischemia, the NSPC-derived neurons exhibited functional deficits, and differentiation of embryonic NSPCs to glial types - oligodendrocytes and astrocytes - was boosted. Our findings of the delayed neuronal maturation in post-ischemic conditions, while the NSPC differentiation was promoted towards glial cell types, provide new insights that could be applicable to stem cell therapy replacement strategies used after cerebral ischemia.
