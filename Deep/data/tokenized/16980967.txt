Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) regulate synapse formation through their trans-synaptic and heterophilic adhesion. Here we show that postsynaptic netrin-G ligand (NGL) CAMs associate with netrin-G CAMs in an isoform-specific manner and, through their cytosolic tail, with the abundant postsynaptic scaffold postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95). Overexpression of NGL-2 in cultured rat neurons increased the number of PSD-95-positive dendritic protrusions. NGL-2 located on heterologous cells or beads induced functional presynaptic differentiation in contacting neurites. Direct aggregation of NGL-2 on the surface membrane of dendrites induced the clustering of excitatory postsynaptic proteins. Competitive inhibition by soluble NGL-2 reduced the number of excitatory synapses. NGL-2 knockdown reduced excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse numbers and currents. These results suggest that NGL regulates the formation of excitatory synapses.
