The behavior of the summary activity is learned on the proposed model of neuronal net, taking into account the data of the neuronal interactions in Ca3 hippocampus. The summary activities existence of the own oscillations frequency, depending on the synaptic connection weights is found. The hypothesis of this phenomena role on the theta-activity genesis in the hippocampus is proposed. The change of own oscillations under the influence of the external rhythmic excitation, coming on the net is investigated.
