A comparison was made of the responses of hypothalamic, septal and hippocampal neurons to microionotophoretic applications of corticotropin (ACTH) and hydrocortisone. A reliable positive correlation of medium significance was found in the hippocamp, less pronounced positive correlation in the hypothalamus and no correlation in the septum. The data obtained indicate that the hippocampal and hypothalamic brain structures are characterized by functional similarity of the mechanisms of neuronal sensitivity to each hormonal substance. It is unlikely that the neurophysiological processes participating in the response of nervous cells to ACTH and hydrocortisone applications are similar, this suggestion being supported by the presence of a number of exceptions and absence of the correlation in the septum.
