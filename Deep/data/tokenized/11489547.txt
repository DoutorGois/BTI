We have investigated changes in ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and in polyamine levels in the central nervous system of aged rats. We measured a significant increase of ODC catalytic activity in the spinal cord from 30 month-old rats (+105%) as compared to 4 month-old rats. No changes were noticed in the cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus from the same animals. A related putrescine increase was measured in the spinal cord of 30 month-old rats (+168%), together with a smaller increase of spermidine (+33%). A parallel increase (+78%) of the Ca2+-dependent transglutaminase activity was detected in the spinal cord of 30 month-old rats, while no changes were apparent in the cortex and cerebellum. Our observations indicate a possible role of the ODC/polyamine system during the normal process of ageing in rats and point to the spinal cord as the most sensitive area for this kind of modification. A possible role of protein polyamination by transglutaminase is discussed.
