We report here single channel data showing that high concentration of NaCl or CsCl at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane increases the open probability of the background Cl channel from hippocampal neurons. The open probability vs. voltage curve was shifted by 36 mV towards more negative voltages, when salt concentration was raised from 300 to 1000 mM. The steepness of the curve remained unchanged. Possible explanations for this effect are discussed.
