GABAA receptors are pentamers composed of subunits derived from the alpha, beta, gamma, delta, theta, epsilon, and pi gene families. alpha1, alpha4, gamma2, and delta subunits are expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but their subcellular distribution has not been described. Hippocampal sections were double-labeled for the alpha1, alpha4, gamma2, and delta subunits and GAD65 or gephyrin, and their subcellular distribution on dentate granule cells was studied by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The synaptic versus extrasynaptic localization of these subunits was inferred by quantitative analysis of the frequency of colocalization of various subunits with synaptic markers in high-resolution images. GAD65 immunoreactive clusters colocalized with 26.24+/-0.86% of the alpha1 subunit immunoreactive clusters and 32.35+/-1.49% of the gamma2 subunit clusters. In contrast, only 1.58+/-0.13% of the alpha4 subunit immunoreactive clusters and 1.92+/-0.15% of the delta subunit clusters colocalized with the presynaptic marker GAD65. These findings were confirmed by studying colocalization with immunoreactivity of a postsynaptic marker, gephyrin, which colocalized with 27.61+/-0.16% of the alpha1 subunit immunoreactive clusters and 23.45+/-0.32% of the gamma2 subunit immunoreactive clusters. In contrast, only 1.90+/-0.13% of the alpha4 subunit immunoreactive clusters and 1.76+/-0.10% of the delta subunit clusters colocalized with gephyrin. These studies demonstrate that a subset of alpha1 and gamma2 subunit clusters colocalize with synaptic markers in hippocampal dentate granule cells. Furthermore, all four subunits, alpha1, alpha4, gamma2, and delta, are present in the extrasynaptic locations.
