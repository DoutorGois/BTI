In this study of the rat hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum 4 days after 20 min transient cerebral ischaemia, we demonstrated ultrastructural dendritic degeneration and loss, whereas most axons appeared undamaged. Autoradiographs 4 days after ischaemia showed unchanged Na+-dependent glutamate high affinity uptake. The role of glutamate and Ca2+ for this selective postsynaptic vulnerability is discussed.
