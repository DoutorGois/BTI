Rabbits were fed 2% cholesterol diet for 4, 6 and 8 weeks or control diet for 6 weeks. Frontal cortex and hippocampal formation were stained with apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) antibody using standard immunocytochemical methods. The number of neurons expressing the Apo-E epitope and the intensity of Apo-E immunoreactivity increased with increasing time on the cholesterol diet. Because Apo-E chaperones cholesterol in the brain, the data may suggest that elevated circulating levels of cholesterol eventually cause increased cerebral levels.
