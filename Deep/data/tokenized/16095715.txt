Silicon-substrate multi-channel electrodes (multiprobes) have proven useful in a variety of electrophysiological tasks. When using multiprobes it is often useful to identify the site of each channel, e.g., when recording single-unit activity from a heterogeneous structure. Lesion marking of electrode sites has been used for many years. Electrolytic, or direct current (DC) lesions, have been used successfully to mark multiprobe sites in rat hippocampus [Townsend G, Peloquin P, Kloosterman F, Hetke JF, Leung LS. Recording and marking with silicon multichannel electrodes. Brain Res Brain Res Protoc 2002;9:122-9]. The present method used radio-frequency (rf) lesions to distinctly mark each of the 16 recording sites of 16-channel linear array multiprobes, in chinchilla inferior colliculus. A commercial radio-frequency lesioner was used as the current source, in conjunction with custom connectors adapted to the multiprobe configuration. In vitro bench testing was used to establish current-voltage-time parameters, as well as to check multiprobe integrity and radio-frequency performance. In in vivo application, visualization of individual-channel multiprobe recording sites was clear in 21 out of 33 sets of collicular serial-sections (i.e., probe tracks) obtained from acute experimental subjects, i.e., maximum post-lesion survival time of 2h. Advantages of the rf method include well-documented methods of in vitro calibration as well as low impact on probe integrity. The rf method of marking individual-channel sites should be useful in a variety of applications.
