Stressful stimuli are known to affect glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA levels in the rat brain. The aim of this study was to examine the duration of chronic stress-induced changes in GR gene expression in the male rat hippocampus and cerebellum. By using in situ hybridization histochemistry, we detected a statistically significant down-regulation of GR mRNA both in the hippocampus and in the cerebellum of rats stressed for 8, 10 and 14 days. The same degree of down-regulation could also be detected in the above brain areas of rats stressed for 14 days and left undisturbed for 48 h or 8 days after stress. To examine the effects of subsequent stressors on the expression of down-regulated GR mRNA in the hippocampus of chronically stressed rats, we determined, by Northern blotting, GR mRNA levels in the hippocampi of rats stressed for 14 days and subsequently exposed to either short- or long-duration stressors. The down-regulated levels of GR mRNA remained practically unaffected when a subsequent new stressor was applied. Our results show that chronic stress-induced down-regulation of GR mRNA in the rat brain can be extended for periods longer than the initial/causative stimulus, irrespective of the presence of a novel stimulus.
