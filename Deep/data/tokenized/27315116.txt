Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage are commonly associated with early stage Alzheimer disease (AD). The accumulation of somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been hypothesized to be a driver of these phenotypes, but the detection of increased mutation loads has been difficult due to a lack of sensitive methods. We used an ultrasensitive next generation sequencing technique to measure the mutation load of the entire mitochondrial genome. Here, we report a significant increase in the mtDNA mutation frequency in the hippocampus of early stage AD, with the cause of these mutations being consistent with replication errors and not oxidative damage.
