The distribution of [3H]naloxone binding sites was investigated in the brains of one-day-old domestic chicks using quantitative receptor autoradiography. Among the forebrain regions, the greatest levels of opiate binding were found in hyperstriatum dorsale, hyperstriatum ventrale, hyperstriatum intercalatum supremum and neostriatum. Intermediate levels were found throughout the paleostriatal regions, septum, thalamus, archistriatum, hyperstriatum accessorium and area parahippocampalis whilst in hippocampus and ectostriatum the density of [3H]naloxone binding sites was low. In the hindbrain, high levels of opiate binding were found in optic tectum whereas in cerebellum the density of binding sites was barely above background. The greatest densities of opiate binding appear to coincide with regions found to be involved in sensory processing and memory storage.
