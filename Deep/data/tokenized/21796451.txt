Pyramidal neurons have a complex dendritic arbor containing tens of thousands of synapses. In order for the somatic/axonal membrane potential to reach action potential threshold, concurrent activation of multiple excitatory synapses is required. Frequently, instead of a simple algebraic summation of synaptic potentials in the soma, different dendritic compartments contribute to the integration of multiple inputs, thus endowing the neuron with a powerful computational ability. Most pyramidal neurons share common functional properties. However, different and sometimes contrasting dendritic integration rules are also observed. In this review, we focus on the dendritic integration of two neighboring pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus: the well-characterized CA1 and the much less understood CA2. The available data reveal that the dendritic integration of these neurons is markedly different even though they are targeted by common inputs at similar locations along their dendrites. This contrasting dendritic integration results in different routing of information flow and generates different corticohippocampal loops.
