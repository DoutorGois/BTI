Cystatin C, a cysteine protease inhibitor produced by the choroid plexus and found in CSF at high concentrations, may have an important role in brain injury. We used the two-vessel occlusion model with hypotension to induce transient forebrain ischemia (TFI) in rats for 10 min and then examined cystatin C immuno-like reactivity (CC-IR) after 1, 3, 7 and 14 days of recovery. Our results reveal that CC-IR was minimal or absent in the hippocampus of normal and 1 day post-ischemic animals. However, CC-IR was present in CA1 pyramidal cells and a small number of reactive glia of the stratum radiatum (SR) and stratum oriens (SO) at 3, 7 and 14 days post-ischemia. Histological assessment of the hippocampus indicates that CC-IR was localized in morphologically degenerative neurons. This distinct temporal expression of cystatin C in the rat hippocampus is concurrent with delayed neuronal death following TFI. Thus, these results indicate that cystatin C and/or its substrates may be important components of the post-ischemic neurodegenerative and repair process.
