Animal and human studies have demonstrated that, depending upon the sequence of alcohol presentation, long-term memory of events can either be enhanced or diminished. In the present study a similar phenomenon is demonstrated in the neuronal excitability of slices of hippocampus from guinea pig brains. Alcohol given after, but not before, 3 days of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) administration to the intact animal produced kindling equivalent to 5 days of PTZ given by itself. This effect appears to be independent of the known withdrawal effects of alcohol and lasts for at least 14 days after the alcohol and PTZ administration have been discontinued.
