The onset of maternal behavior is characterized by the action of certain hormones, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters and a concomitant increase in the expression of c-Fos in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) but the signaling events that lie between have not been characterized. Because several of these hormones, neuropeptides and neurotransmitters function by activating Ca(2+)/calmodulin (CaM) mediated signaling pathways, many of which can lead to c-Fos expression, the goal of the current work was to identify calmodulin binding proteins (CaMBPs) or specific CaM-dependent phosphoproteins that might be involved. Probing of SDS-PAGE gels of extracts from the hippocampus, parietal cortex, basolateral amygdala and MPOA with recombinant (35)S-VU1-calmodulin (CaM) revealed 30 Ca(2+)-dependent and 4-6 Ca(2+)-independent CaMBPs. Statistically significant maternal behavior-related decreases in four Ca(2+)-dependent CaMBPs ( approximately 31 kDa, 50% decrease; approximately 33 kDa, 32%; approximately 50 kDa, 35%; approximately 60 kDa, 33%) were observed specifically in the MPOA. Numerous proteins were phosphorylated in a Ca(2+) CaM-dependent manner with two (MWs approximately 61 Da, approximately 58 kDa) showing a lack of phosphophorylation only in the MPOA. The selective decrease in CaMBPs coupled with the absence of CaM-dependent phosphoproteins implies that changes in Ca(2+)/CaM-mediated signaling may mediate some of the MPOA-specific processes during the onset of maternal behavior in the rat.
