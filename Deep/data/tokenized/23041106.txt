Baicalin, a flavonoid compound isolated from the plant Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, is known as a protective agent against delayed neuronal cell death after ischemia/reperfusion. To investigate the neuroprotective mechanism of baicalin, the present study was conducted to explore whether the alterations of GABAergic signaling, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) were involved in its neuroprotection on gerbils global ischemia. The bilateral carotid arteries were occluded by 5 min and baicalin at the dose of 200 mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected into the gerbils immediately after cerebral ischemia. Seven days after reperfusion, neurological deficit was scored and changes in hippocampal neuronal cell death were assessed by Nissl staining as well as NeuN immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expressions of GABAergic signal molecules (GABA(A)R alpha1, GABA(A)R gamma2, KCC2 and NKCC1) were determined in ischemic hippocampus by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. In addition, HSP70 and MAPKs cascades (ERK, JNK and p38) were also detected using western blot assay. Our results illustrated that baicalin treatment significantly facilitated neurological function, suppressed the ischemia-induced neuronal damage. Besides, administration of baicalin also caused a striking increase of GABA(A)R alpha1, GABA(A)R gamma2 and KCC2 together with the decrease of NKCC1 at mRNA and protein levels in gerbils hippocampus following an ischemic insult. Furthermore, the protein expressions of HSP70 and phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) were evidently augmented while the phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) and phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) were strikingly diminished in ischemic gerbils with baicalin treatment. These findings suggest that baicalin activates GABAergic signaling, HSP70 and MAPKs cascades in global ischemia, which may be a mechanism underlying the baicalin's neuroprotection.
