Hippocampal pyramidal neuron size was determined in all Cornu Ammonis subregions - CA1-CA4 - in five chronic schizophrenic men and compared with eight controls matched with respect to age and sex. Four out of five probands and the same eight controls had been examined in a previous study showing a significantly lower cell count and disorientation of pyramidal cells in the CA1- CA3 subregions of the schizophrenics. There was also a negative correlation between the total number of cells and the number of disoriented cells. In this study it was shown that the schizophrenic probands also had significantly smaller neurons in all subregions. There was a significant negative correlation between pyramidal neuron size and the number of disarrayed neurons in each subregion, and there was a significant positive correlation between neuron size and the total number of pyramidal cells in CA1 and CA2, but not in CA3 and CA4. The consistency of hippocampal anomalies in these schizophrenics is, thus, demonstrated by the statistical relations between the different parameters examined.
