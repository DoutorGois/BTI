Experiments on hippocampal slices form 4-week-old rats (n=28) showed that addition of lidase (1.0 and 10.0 U/ml) to the perfusion solution (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) was accompanied by the impaired generation or blockade of excitatory postsynaptic potentials and population spikes in the hippocampal CA1 region during stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Removal of lidase from this solution normalized the amplitude of evoked responses. Hence, lidase in these concentrations produced a reversible effect on synaptic transmission. Our results indicate that structure and function of glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix determine signal transduction in the nervous tissue.
