The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario's Epilepsy Surgery Series of 47 medically intractable children and adolescents was reviewed and analyzed to assess complications of surgical treatment. Complications and rates of incidence are discussed, and compared with the existing literature regarding children, adolescents and adults. No deaths or permanent disabling complications were incurred. Minor morbidity was minimal: 2 (4.2%) sustained permanent but nondisabling complications while an additional 3 (6.4%) incurred transient neurologic deficits which resolved rapidly. Epilepsy surgery in children and adolescents is safe, highly effective, and underutilized.
