BACKGROUND: The effects and mechanisms of preweaning Manganese (Mn) exposure on cognitive dysfunction remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effects of preweaning Mn exposure on spatial learning and memory as well as the protein expression of CaMKIIalpha and p-CaMKIIalpha. METHODS: We treated neonate rats with Mn(2+) doses of 0 (control group), 10, 20 and 30mg of Mn(2+) per kg body weight (Mn-exposed groups) over postnatal day (PND) 1-21 by intraperitoneal injection. The ability of spatial learning and memory was tested on PND 22 using the Morris water maze (MWM), while the protein expressions of CaMKIIalpha and p-CaMKIIalpha in the hippocampus were evaluated by Western blotting. The levels of Mn in the blood and hippocampus were measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). RESULTS: The rats in Mn-exposed groups showed a signi fi cant delay in spatial learning ability on the third day of the MWM without dose-dependent differences, but there was no effect on the spatial memory ability. p-CaMKIIalpha, but not CaMKIIalpha protein expression significantly reduced in the Mn-exposed group. CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that the inhibition of p-CaMKIIalpha could be one of the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of Mn-induced cognitive impairments.
