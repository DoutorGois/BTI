Metyrapone (MET) inhibition of hydrocortisone (3H-HC) uptake binding in the cytosol and nucleus of various brain regions of the pig was demonstrated in vivo. The hippocampus, hypothalamus and septum were the regions most sensitive to the inhibition by MET. The hippocampus exhibited the greatest reduction in 3H-HC concentration in whole homogenate, bound in cytosol and in nuclei. The anterior pituitary and cerebral cortex were the least sensitive to MET. In vitro incubation of hypothalami with 3H-HC and MET substantiated the results obtained in vivo with regard to the inhibitory action of MET on 3H-HC uptake and binding. These results were interpreted to indicate the MET may act directly in certain brain regions and that this inhibitory aciton has important implications for both experimental and clinical uses of this drug.
