Chemical transmission at central synapses is known to be highly plastic; the strength of synaptic connections can be modified bi-directionally as a result of activity at individual synapses. Long-term changes in synaptic efficacy, both increases and decreases, are thought to be involved in the development of the nervous system, and in ongoing changes in response to external cues such as during learning and addiction. Other, shorter lasting changes in synaptic transmission are also likely to be important in normal functioning of the CNS. Calcium mobilisation is an important step in multiple forms of plasticity and, although entry into neurones from the extracellular space is often the initial trigger for plasticity changes, release of calcium from intracellular stores also has an important part to play in a variety of forms of synaptic plasticity.
