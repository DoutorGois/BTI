The axons of the neurons in the medial and lateral components of the entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC) form the medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP) which represent the major source of cortical input to the hippocampus. Anatomical, physiological, and pharmacological studies have shown that MPP and LPP are distinct. Unfortunately, assessment of the functional significance of damage to either of these pathways has not used tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal function in the rodent. In this study, we performed dissociated lesions of MPP and LPP using a combined physiological and anatomical method. Rats with lesions of either the MPP or the LPP were tested on place learning in the water task and on a discriminative fear conditioning to context task. The results indicated that the MPP, but not LPP, lesions resulted in impaired place learning. The context discrimination data revealed an amygdala-like, reduced fear effect of MPP lesions and an enhanced discriminative fear conditioning to context effect of LPP lesions. Consistent with a two-stage model of spatial learning proposed by Buzsaki (Buzsaki G. Two-stage model of memory trace formation: a role for 'noisy' brain states. Neuroscience 1989;31(3):551-570), the impairment in the water task can be interpreted as reflecting the higher efficiency of the MPP synapses in activating hippocampal neurons. The context discrimination results can be explained by either a dissociation of sensory information that reaches the MEC and LEC, or alternatively, by a dissociation between the limbic nature of the MEC and the sensory nature of the LEC.
