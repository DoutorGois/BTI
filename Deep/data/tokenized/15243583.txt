One hemisphere of postnatal day 8 (P8) rats or P10 mice was irradiated with a single dose of 4-12 Gy, and animals were killed from 2 h to 8 weeks after irradiation (IR). In the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the granular cell layer (GCL) of the dentate gyrus, harboring neural and other progenitor cells, nitrosylation and p53 peaked 2-12 h after IR, followed by markers for active caspase-3, apoptosis-inducing factor and TUNEL (6-24 h). Ki67-positive (proliferating) cells had disappeared by 12 h and partly reappeared by 7 days post-IR. The SVZ and GCL areas decreased approximately 50% 7 days after IR. The development of white matter was hampered, resulting in 50-70% less myelin basic protein staining. Pretreatment with erythropoietin did not confer protection against IR. Caspase inhibition by overexpression of XIAP prevented caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation but not cell death, presumably because of increased caspase-independent cell death.
