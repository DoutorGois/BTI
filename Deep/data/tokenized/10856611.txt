Taurine is held to function as a modulator and osmoregulator in the central nervous system, being of particular importance in the immature brain. In view of the possible involvement of excitatory pathways in the regulation of taurine function in the brain, the interference of glutamate receptors with taurine release from different tissue preparations in vitro and from the brain in vivo is of special interest. The release of taurine from the brain is enhanced by glutamate receptor agonists. This enhancement is inhibited by the respective receptor antagonists both in vitro and in vivo. The ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor agonists appear to be the most effective in enhancing taurine release, their effects being receptor-mediated. Kainate is less effective, particularly in adults. Of the glutamate receptors, the NMDA class seems to be the most susceptible to modulation by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide also modulates taurine release, enhancing the basal release in both immature and mature hippocampus, whereas the K(+)-stimulated release is generally inhibited. Metabotropic glutamate receptors also participate in the regulation of taurine release, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors potentiating the release in the developing hippocampus, while group III receptors may be involved in the adult. Under various cell-damaging conditions, including ischemia, hypoxia and hypoglycemia, taurine release is enhanced, together with an enhanced release of excitatory amino acids. The increase in extracellular taurine upon excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors and under cell-damaging conditions may serve as an important protective mechanism against excitotoxicity, being particularly effective in the immature brain.
