Using ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, studies have been made on protein extracts obtained at low ionic strength from hippocampal slices of rats within the 1st month of their postnatal life. Significant changes in fractional composition were found. To the end of the 2nd week, a reliable decrease in the relative content of low-acidic fractions was observed together with the increase in the content of those fractions which were eluted by a buffer with a higher molarity. In 3-week animals, the relative content of weak-acidic fractions decreases by 1 1/2 times, the difference being even more significant in adult animals. It is suggested that the observed redistribution of fractions within protein spectra is due to the appearance of the brain specific proteins.
