Increase in the cellular burden of oxidative stress is critically involved in various pathological manifestations of aging, including age-related neurological disorders. Dietary restriction can lower reactive oxygen species formation, and thereby lower oxidative damage in the brain. The brain consists of a diverse group of neurons with varying functions. However, attenuating role of dietary restriction on oxidative stress in different regions of brain is not well known. In the present study we demonstrated that by restricting diet intake for a period of six months, mice lowered the endogenous levels of oxidative stress markedly by decreasing lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl contents in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum regions of the brain. Based on these results we suggest that dietary restriction can significantly reduce oxidative stress in various regions of the brain by virtue of lowering endogenous levels of reactive oxygen species, which might prove beneficial for preserving normal brain function with age.
