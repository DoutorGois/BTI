To investigate the mechanisms involved in graft survival, a rat cell line (PC12) that differentiates into sympathetic-like neurons by exposure to trophic factors has been grafted into rat striatum and hippocampus, two structures which differ in their amounts of trophic factors. Our results show that grafted PC12 cells behave differently depending on the area of implantation; they display a differentiated morphology in the hippocampus and proliferate as a tumor in the striatum. A qualitatively similar immunological reaction occurs in both structures, characterized by the invasion of T and B lymphocytes, macrophage-like cells and by the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens around the graft.
