The present work was undertaken to examine the central pharmacokinetics of phenytoin (PHT) in an experimental model of epilepsy, induced by administration of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MP), and possible participation of P-glycoprotein in this model of epilepsy. Repeated seizures were induced in male Wistar rats by injection of 3-MP (45 mg kg(-1), i.p.) during 10 days. Control rats (C) were injected with saline solution. In order to monitor extracellular PHT levels, either a shunt microdialysis probe or a concentric probe was inserted into carotid artery or hippocampus, respectively. All animals were administered with PHT (30 mg kg(-1), i.v.) 30 min after intraperitoneal administration of vehicle (V) or nimodipine (NIMO, 2 mg kg(-1)). No differences were found in PHT plasma levels comparing all experimental groups. In pre-treated rats with V, hippocampal PHT concentrations were lower in MP (maximal concentration, C(max): 2.7+/-0.3 microg ml(-1), p<0.05 versus C rats) than in C animals (C(max): 5.3+/-0.9 microg ml(-1)). Control rats pre-treated with NIMO showed similar results (C(max): 4.5+/-0.8 microg ml(-1)) than those pre-treated with V. NIMO pre-treatment of MP rats showed higher PHT concentrations (C(max): 6.8+/-1.0 microg ml(-1), p<0.05) when compared with V pre-treated MP group. Our results indicate that central pharmacokinetics of PHT is altered in MP epileptic rats. The effect of NIMO on hippocampal concentrations of PHT suggests that P-glycoprotein has a role in reduced central bioavailability of PHT in our epileptic refractory model.
