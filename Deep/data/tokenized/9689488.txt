Preprodynorphin and preproenkephalin mRNA expression was examined in the CNS of two rat strains, the alcohol-preferring Fawn-Hooded (FH) and the alcohol-non-preferring Wistar-Kyoto (WKY), using in situ hybridisation histochemistry. Relative to the WKY, the FH showed significantly lower levels of preproenkephalin mRNA in the striatum and nucleus accumbens (-24% and -17% respectively), but a higher level of preprodynorphin mRNA in the hippocampus (+33%). The depressed level of preproenkephalin mRNA in the nucleus accumbens may be implicated in alcohol-seeking behaviour.
