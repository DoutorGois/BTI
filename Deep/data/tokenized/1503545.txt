mRNA and protein populations were studied in the brains of Maudsley reactive (MR) and Maudsley nonreactive (MNR) rat strains, which exhibit differing levels of emotionality. Translational analysis of forebrain mRNA indicated that the relative levels of two translation products (42 kDA, pI 5.0; 30 kDa, pI 5.8) were increased in the MR compared to the MNR strain. In addition, a charge-shift variant of a 36 kDa protein was present in the MR strain. Analysis of brain protein patterns indicated that a protein of 39 kDa, pI 5.0, was found to be more abundant in MR compared with MNR strains in both frontal cortex and hippocampus and the relative level of one protein (40 kDa, pI 5.8) was decreased in the frontal cortex.
