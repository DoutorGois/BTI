In experiments on 7-20 and 75-day-old rabbits, the activity of units of the septal nuclei, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca (NBD), nucleus medialis (NSM) and the EEG of dorsal hippocamp (the CA2-CA3 fields) have been recorded. It was shown that the specific discharge pattern of septal neurons (the bursts) appears on 8-11th days under action of eserine. The distinct bimodal pattern of the interval histograms of the septal units appeared from the 14th day. The burst discharge pattern of NBD and NSM neurones reached a definitive level by the 20th day. The parallel evolution of discharge pattern of the septal units and the EEG of the hippocamp is observed in ontogenesis, the formation of hippocampal theta activity correlating with enhancement of the average frequency of the septal (NBD, NSM) neuronal activity, with shortening to the interval between the discharges within the bursts and with enhancement of the regularity of the bursts.
