Changes of correlation coefficients and coherence of the delta-, theta- and alpha-rhythms were studied between the somatosensory, motor and visual neocortex areas, dorsal hippocampus and dentate fascia at stimulation frequencies of the midbrain reticular formation from 60 to 1000 imp/s. It was shown that correlation coefficient between the structures studied increased at 60-200 imp/s and decreased at the further increase of stimulation frequency. In pairs with the visual area the correlation coefficient changed but little. The delta-rhythms coherence tended to decrease with the increase of stimulation frequency. Coherence of the theta-rhythms between the neocortical areas and the hippocampus increased with the increase of stimulation frequency up to 200 imp/s and decreased at higher frequency stimulation while in pairs of these areas with the dentate fascia it continued to rise with the increase of stimulation frequency up to 1000 imp/s. The coherence of the alpha-rhythms was almost unchanged at 60-200 imp/s and mostly had an increase at higher frequency stimulation.
