The direct effect of the local anesthetic lidocaine was studied using the hippocampal slice preparation in order to assess the involvement of this structure in lidocaine-induced seizure activity. Changes in the evoked field potential amplitude and latency were used to measure the effect of the drug. A dose-dependent depression of the evoked field potentials was observed at lidocaine concentration of 10(-4)M and greater. No synchronized population bursting (seizures) was observed at any of the concentrations tested (10(-6)M to 10(-3)M). However, the hippocampal slice preparation is capable of producing seizure activity, as was demonstrated following application of penicillin G. The results suggest that the hippocampus is not the site of lidocaine-induced seizure activity.
