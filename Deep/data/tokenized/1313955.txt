We have previously suggested that kainic acid (KA) increases the fluorescence of a fluoroprobe for Ca2+ via activation of the non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptor in cultured hippocampal cells. The present study provides further evidence to support this suggestion. KA and NMDA increased the fluorescence occasionally in different subcellular loci of a single cell for each agonist, excluding the possibility that KA activated the NMDA receptor. KA elevated fluorescence in the cell whose membrane was voltage-clamped, thus eliminating possible Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent channels. A monophasic response to KA was found to occur in the cells identified immunochemically as neurons. Even when the cells were cultured at different embryonic stages, KA responsiveness reached a peak at a rather fixed timepoint through the total age of neurons, while NMDA responsiveness continued to increase. This suggests that the Ca(2+)-permeable non-NMDA receptor is expressed according to a genetic schedule, but not to an artifactual effect of cell culture.
