The endogenous interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is the natural inhibitor of the biological effects of interleukin-1 during inflammation. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist refers to three isoforms: one secreted and two intracellular forms (types I and II). The objective of the present study was to investigate the expression of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist isoforms in the rat brain in vivo in response to an i.p. injection of lipopolysaccharide. The interleukin-1 receptor antagonist was studied at the messenger and protein levels by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist messenger RNA was constitutively expressed in the brain and its expression increased in response to lipopolysaccharide. The three interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein isoforms were up-regulated after lipopolysaccharide treatment in a time-dependent manner. Their relative expression differed according to the isoform and brain region studied. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed interleukin-1 receptor antagonist positive neurons and microglia in hippocampus 24h after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These results demonstrate for the first time that brain cells are able to produce interleukin-1 receptor antagonist isoforms in response to a peripheral immune challenge with a predominance of the secreted over intracellular forms.
