The neuroprotective role of endogenous adenosine during forebrain ischemia elicited by 4-vessel occlusion in rats was assessed using the adenosine antagonist, theophylline (32 mg/kg). Despite an increase in the release of glutamate in the hippocampus during ischemia, theophylline did not alter the neurological and histological outcomes. These results indicate that endogenous adenosine does not act as an endogenous neuroprotector by modulating glutamate release in this model.
