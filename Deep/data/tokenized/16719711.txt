Neonatal ethanol exposure in animals results in performance deficits on tests of hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, and recent studies have shown that extra dietary choline can ameliorate some of these impairments. In this experiment, rats were administered 5.25 g/kg ig ethanol per day or sham intubations on Postnatal Days (PD) 4-9 and choline (0.1 ml of an 18.8 mg/ml solution) or saline subcutaneously on PD 4-20. On PD 30, rats were given delay or trace fear conditioning trials and were tested for conditioned stimulus-elicited freezing 24 hr later. Neonatal ethanol produced a profound impairment in trace conditioning that was reversed by choline. Groups did not differ in delay conditioned responding, indicating that neonatal ethanol produces a relatively selective cognitive deficit that can be alleviated with supplemental choline.
