Brain studies by magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and spectroscopy have been performed with rat strains Wistar, GC (genetic and catatonia), and PM+ (pendulum movements). Both GC and PM+ rats show similar deviations from the ancestral Wistar population in having smaller areas of the right striatum (coronal slice). The anterior horns of lateral ventricles in GC rats are smaller than in the control strain. The maximum blood flow velocity in the common carotid arteries of PM+ rats is greater. The GC and PM+ strains differ in myo-inositol level in the hippocampus. The PM+ strain is characterized by a lower taurine level in the hippocampus, which may be one of the participants regulated the predisposition to audiogenic seizures.
