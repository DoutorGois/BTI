Gelfoam treated with peripheral nerve homogenate was implanted into a site of hippocampal fimbria transection in the adult rat to assess whether the homogenate might enhance growth of AChE-positive fibers into the lesion site and whether the fiber growth might be directed to the implants. Homogenate was prepared from intact peripheral nerve and in a few cases from degenerated nerve. Some implants were encased in Silastic. Homogenate was also injected into the denervated hippocampus. The major finding was that AChE-positive fiber growth was associated with regions of high astroglial cell content in preference to the relatively hypocellular implants. No clear differences in AChE fiber sprouting into the lesion site, fiber growth into implants, or hippocampal reinnervation were noted between homogenate and saline-treated animals.
