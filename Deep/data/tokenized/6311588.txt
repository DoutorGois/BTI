In order to examine the receptor basis for the development of spontaneous locomotion and for the effects of clonidine in the infant rat, we measured the densities of alpha 1-adrenoceptors, alpha 2-adrenoceptors and D2-dopamine receptors in various brain regions of the developing infant Wistar rat. The mesolimbic D2-dopamine receptors paralleled the rise in spontaneous locomotion of the infant rat. No alpha 1-adrenoceptors were detectable at birth in any of the four regions examined (mesolimbic, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and hypothalamus), thus providing no basis for the locomotor-stimulating action of clonidine in the first week of life. Mesolimbic alpha 2-adrenoceptors matured between 21 and 28 days (at which time clonidine yields its usual sedating action).
