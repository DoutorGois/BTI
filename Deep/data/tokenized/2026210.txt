Interneurons of rat motor cortex in vivo and of rat hippocampal slices were studied during penicillin-induced epileptic discharges. Synchronous with pyramidal cells, they showed transient depolarizations similar to paroxysmal depolarization shifts in pyramidal cells. The transient depolarizations were followed by hyperpolarizing or depolarizing afterpotentials lasting 600 to 1200 ms. During the transient depolarizations and the afterdepolarizations the interneurons discharged with increased frequency. This may contribute to the enlarged and prolonged synaptic inhibitions following interictal discharges in pyramidal cells.
