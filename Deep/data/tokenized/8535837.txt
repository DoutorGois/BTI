The effects of the stereoisomers of N-allylnormetazocine (SKF-10,047) on the hippocampal cholinergic functions were compared in rats. A putative sigma 1 receptor agonist, (+)-SKF-10,047, elicited an increase of hippocampal extracellular acetylcholine level and anti-amnesic effect against scopolamine-induced memory dysfunctions in rats. These phenomena were not produced by (-)-SKF-10,047, and were reversed by haloperidol, a putative sigma 1 receptor antagonist. Such stereoselectivity and antagonism imply an involvement of sigma 1 receptors in these (+)-SKF-10,047-stimulated hippocampal cholinergic functions.
