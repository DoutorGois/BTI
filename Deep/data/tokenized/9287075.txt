Mice with radiofrequency (RF) lesions of the posterior (PC) or anterior (AC) cingulate cortex were trained on spatial discrimination reversal learning in a T-maze. The results were compared with those obtained in an earlier study after ibotenic acid (IBO) cingulate lesions. PC-RF lesions facilitated the initial discrimination and first reversal, whereas they retarded subsequent reversals; in contrast, PC-IBO lesions yielded a deficit on the initial discrimination and first reversal, but had no effect on subsequent reversals. AC-IBO, but not AC-RF lesions, precluded the formation of a learning set across reversals. These data suggest that cingulum transection, which accompanies RF but not IBO lesions, can mask or even antagonize the specific effects of cingulate damage. Consequently, inferences made from the effects of conventional lesions to assess and distinguish the functions of the two cingulate areas appear subject to caution.
