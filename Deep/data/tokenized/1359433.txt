The "concentration clamp" technique has been modified to realize fast and short-term application of a transmitter to whole neuron followed by its fast washout. Prolonged glutamate application evoked activation of the desensitized current. The application time was shortened to intervals when the washout corresponded to unfinished desensitization of the current. Shortening of the glutamate application term to some milliseconds resulted in arising of fast currents which maximal amplitude appreciably exceeded that of currents evoked by prolonged glutamate application. The role of both components under real synaptic conditions is discussed.
