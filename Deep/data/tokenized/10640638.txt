Patients with the Lewy body variant (LBV) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have ubiquitinated intraneuronal and neuritic accumulations of alpha-synuclein and show less neuron loss and tau pathology than other AD patients. Aged Tg2576 transgenic mice overexpressing human betaAPP695. KM670/671NL have limited neuron loss and tau pathology, but frequent ubiquitin- and alpha-synuclein-positive, tau-negative neurites resembling those seen in the LBV of AD.
