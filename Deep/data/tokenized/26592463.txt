BACKGROUND: Studies in vitro demonstrate that neuronal membrane/lipid rafts (MLRs) establish cell polarity by clustering progrowth receptors and tethering cytoskeletal machinery necessary for neuronal sprouting. However, the effect of MLR and MLR-associated proteins on neuronal aging is unknown. METHODS: Here, we assessed the impact of neuron-targeted overexpression of an MLR scaffold protein, caveolin-1 (Cav-1) (via a synapsin promoter, SynCav1), in the hippocampus in vivo in adult (6-month-old) and aged (20-month-old) mice on biochemical, morphologic, and behavioral changes. RESULTS: SynCav1 resulted in increased expression of Cav-1, MLRs, and MLR-localization of Cav-1 and tropomyosin-related kinase B receptor independent of age and time post gene transfer. Cav-1 overexpression in adult mice enhanced dendritic arborization within the apical dendrites of hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 and granule cell neurons, effects that were also observed in aged mice, albeit to a lesser extent, indicating preserved impact of Cav-1 on structural plasticity of hippocampal neurons with age. Cav-1 overexpression enhanced contextual fear memory in adult and aged mice demonstrating improved hippocampal function. CONCLUSIONS: Neuron-targeted overexpression of Cav-1 in the adult and aged hippocampus enhances functional MLRs with corresponding roles in cell signaling and protein trafficking. The resultant structural alterations in hippocampal neurons in vivo are associated with improvements in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Our findings suggest Cav-1 as a novel therapeutic strategy in disorders involving impaired hippocampal function.
