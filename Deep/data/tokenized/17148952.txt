Human type 1 lissencephaly is a severe brain malformation associated with cognitive dysfunction and intractable epilepsy. Mutant mice with a heterozygous deletion of LIS1 show varying degrees of hippocampal abnormality and enhanced excitability. Whether a reduction of LIS1 function affects adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and if so, whether aberrant neurogenesis contributes to the generation of a disorganized hippocampus remain unknown. Previous reports indicate the presence of multiple pyramidal cell layers and granule cell dispersion in LIS1 mutant mice. Here we observed disruption of the subgranular zone and glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive radial astrocytes in the dentate gyrus of adult LIS1 mice. Using pulse-chase bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling combined with neuronal and glial antibody staining we provide evidence for ectopic adult neurogenesis in LIS1 mice. A gradually decreased survival rate for these newborn granule cells was also demonstrated in LIS1 mice 7 days after BrdU injection. This reduced survival rate was associated with impaired neuronal differentiation 28 days after BrdU administration. Thus, LIS1 haploinsufficiency can lead to abnormal cell proliferation, migration and differentiation in the adult dentate gyrus.
