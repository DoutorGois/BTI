Depending on the brain networks involved, aging is not accompanied by a general decrease in learning and memory capabilities. We demonstrated previously that learning and retrieval of taste potentiated odor aversion (TPOA) is preserved, and even slightly improved, in senescent rats showing some memory deficiencies in cognitive tasks (Dardou, Datiche, & Cattarelli, 2008). TPOA is a particular behavior in which the simultaneous presentation of odor and taste cues followed by a delayed visceral illness leads to a robust aversion towards both conditioned stimuli, which permits diet selection and animal survival. The present experiment was performed in order to investigate the stability or the evolution of the brain network underlying TPOA retrieval during aging. By using immunocytochemical detection of Fos and Egr1 proteins we mapped the cerebral activation induced by TPOA retrieval elicited by the odor presentation in the young, the adult and the senescent rats. The pattern of brain activation changed and the number of activated areas decreased with age. Nevertheless, the piriform cortex and the basolateral amygdala nucleus were always activated and seemed essential for TPOA retrieval. The hippocampus and the neocortical areas could have different implications in TPOA memory in relation to age. The patterns of expression of Fos and Egr1 were different, suggesting their differential involvement in TPOA retrieval. Data are discussed according to the possible roles of the brain areas studied and a model of schematic brain network subtending TPOA retrieval induced by the odor cue is proposed.
