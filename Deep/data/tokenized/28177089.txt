Neuroimaging studies investigating dopamine (DA) function widely support the hypothesis of presynaptic striatal DA hyperactivity in schizophrenia. However, published data on the striatal DA transporter (DAT) appear less consistent with this hypothesis, probably partly due to methodological limitations. Moreover, DAT in extrastriatal regions has been very poorly investigated in the context of schizophrenia. In order to address these issues, we used a high resolution positron emission tomograph and the selective DAT radioligand [11C]PE2I, coupled with a whole brain voxel-based analysis method to investigate DAT availability in striatal but also extra-striatal regions in 21 male chronic schizophrenia patients compared to 30 healthy male controls matched by age. We found higher DAT availability in schizophrenia patients in midbrain, striatal, and limbic regions. DAT availability in amygdala/hippocampus and putamen/pallidum was positively correlated with hallucinations and suspiciousness/persecution, respectively. These results are consistent with an increase of presynaptic DA function in patients with schizophrenia, and support the involvement of both striatal and extrastriatal DA dysfunction in positive psychotic symptoms. The study also highlights the whole brain voxel-based analysis method to explore DA dysfunction in schizophrenia.
