There is evidence that inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) may be therapeutically useful in neurodegenerative diseases. Using immunocytochemistry, we have investigated the distribution of PARP in the human CNS. Some neuronal groups showed cytoplasmic staining in addition to the expected staining of nuclei. Considerable variation between different neuronal groups was noted: motor neurons in the spinal cord showed greatest cytoplasmic staining, whereas staining was virtually absent in other neurons, notably in the hippocampus. These results indicate that PARP can be associated with sub-cellular components other than the nucleus, and may indicate additional roles for this enzyme.
