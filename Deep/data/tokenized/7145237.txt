The effects of electrical stimulation of ventral subiculum (VSB) of the hippocampus on the thermosensitive neurons in the preoptic area were studied in urethane-anesthetized rats. VSB stimulation affected thermosensitive neurons more frequently (92.1%, 58 of 63) than thermally insensitive neurons (71.4%, 55 of 77). The majority of the VSB-responsive thermosensitive neurons (33 of 44 warm-units and 11 of 14 cold-units) were initially inhibited following stimulation. The result provides further support for the involvement of hippocampus in the central control of thermoregulation.
