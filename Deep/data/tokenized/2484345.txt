Using several antibodies against rat or human laminin and an avidin-biotin immunocytochemical protocol, laminin-like immunoreactivity was detectable in the rat nervous system in expected locations, i.e., associated with blood vessels and reactive astrocytes. However, laminin staining was also abundantly present within neuronal cell bodies in most parts of the developing and adult rat CNS. Medial septum neuronal immunoreactivity was lost after septo-hippocampal disconnection, but could be preserved or even restored by intraventricular administration of nerve growth factor. Thus, at least for medial septum neurons, this laminin-like molecule can be accumulated or produced independent of direct hippocampal (target) contact. It remains to be determined whether CNS neuronal "laminin" processes activities similar to those found for laminin in vitro.
