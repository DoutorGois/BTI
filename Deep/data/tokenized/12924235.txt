Dynamics of distribution of 3[H]-labeled himantane (N-(adamant-2-yl) hexamethyleneimine hydrochloride), a new drug possessing antiparkinsonian and immunostimulant activity, was monitored over a time period of 10 days after single injection (10 mg/kg, i.v.) in rats. It is show that himantane exhibits a selective affinity with respect to the tissues of striatum, where up to 10(-5) M of the radioactive drug equivalent is absorbed. This is significantly greater as compared to the relative amounts of drug in the whole brain, hippocampus, cerebellum, or thymus. The accumulation of radioactive himantane in striatum increased upon oral administration, which is indicative of the formation of drug metabolites possessing higher lipophilicity.
