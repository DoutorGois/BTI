We implanted 20 rats with bipolar electrodes and randomly distributed them into four groups that received intraperitoneal injections of phenytoin (PHT) (20 mg/kg), dextromethorphan (DM) (50 mg/kg), PHT+DM (20 and 50 mg/kg, respectively), or saline (C), 15 minutes before each daily stimulation. The number of stimulations needed to reach stage 3 seizures was 14.4 +/- 1.7 (C); 28 +/- 12 (PHT, p < 0.001); 6.2 +/- 3.9 (DM, p < 0.05); and 7.6 +/- 3.4 (PHT+DM, p < 0.05), suggesting that DM accelerated the expression of kindled seizures. Daily injections of DM and of DM+PHT without stimulation resulted in progressive seizure buildup to stage 3 in 4.8 +/- 6.2 (DM) or in 8 +/- 4.8 (DM+PHT) trials. We demonstrated savings in six kindled animals reinjected after 1 month. These results and previous experimental and clinical data suggest that DM may be epileptogenic when given repeatedly in high doses.
