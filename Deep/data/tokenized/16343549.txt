Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO) has been shown to exert neuroprotection in ischemic, excitotoxicity, trauma, convulsions and neurodegenerative disorders. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage plays a role in the pathogenesis of many pathological states of the brain including neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to investigate the effects of r-Hu EPO on BBB integrity in pentylentetrazol (PTZ) induced seizures in rats. Seizures were observed and evaluated regard to latency and intensity for an hour. Macroscopical and spectrophotometrical measurement of Evans Blue (EB) leakage were observed for BBB integrity. r-Hu EPO was given intraperitoneally 24 h prior to seizure induction. Total seizure duration of 720+/-50 s after single PTZ administration (80 mg/kg i.p.) was declined to 190+/-40 s in r-Hu EPO pretreatment. A typical BBB breakdown pattern (i.e. staining in cerebellum, cerebral cortex, midbrain, hippocampus, thalamus and corpus striatum) was observed in rat brains with PTZ induced seizures; whereas, EPO pretreatment confined BBB leakage to cerebellum and cortical areas, and lessened the intensity of tonic-clonic seizures observed in PTZ seizures. The protective effect of r-Hu EPO on BBB permeability in seizures is a new and original finding. The protective action of r-Hu EPO in seizures and some of CNS pathologies warrant further investigations.
