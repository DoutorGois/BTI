Aging of the brain causes important reductions in quality of life and has wide socio-economic consequences. An increase in oxidative stress, and the associated inflammation and apoptosis, could be responsible for the pathogenesis of aging associated brain lesions. Melatonin has neuroprotective effects, by limiting the negative effects of oxygen and nitrogen free radicals. Growth hormone (GH) might exert additional neuro-protective and or neurogenic effects on the brain. The molecular mechanisms of the protective effects of GH and melatonin on the aging brain have been investigated in young and old Wistar rats. A reduction in the total number of neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus was evident at 24 months of age and was associated with a significant increase in inflammation markers as well as in pro-apoptotic parameters, confirming the role of apoptosis in its reduction. Melatonin treatment was able to enhance neurogenesis in old rats without modification of the total number of neurons, whereas GH treatment increased the total number of neurons without enhancing neurogenesis. Both GH and melatonin were able to reduce inflammation and apoptosis in the hippocampus. In conclusion, neuroprotective effects demonstrated by GH and melatonin in the hippocampus were exerted by decreasing inflammation and apoptosis.
