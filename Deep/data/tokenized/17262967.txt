Zn2 + is a novel ionic mediator of neurotoxic injury in central nervous system. Zn2 + homeostasis in hippocampal Zinc-rich mossy fiber (MF) pathway is important in keeping the balance between excitatory and inhibitory system, and in maintaining cognitive functions of the brain. Abnormal Zn2+ metastasis occurred during MS sprouting induced by developmental seizures and influenced the function of hippocampus. The Zn2+ transporters, Ca2 + permeable AMPA/kainate channels, metal binding proteins and mitochondrion may involved in this process. In addition to pathological effects of rapid intraneuronal Zn2+ accumulation, it is probable that following lower exposures, activation of signaling pathways by intracellular Zn2+ has important yet largely obscure effects on physiological synaptic functioning or synaptic plasticity. This unique ionic trans-synaptic messenger probably plays important roles in normal physiological functioning as well as in disease. Further elucidation of the process of Zn2+ metastasis in hippocampus should yield breakthroughs both in understanding the mechanism of developing seizure-induced brain injury and contributing the effects for making proper early intervention.
