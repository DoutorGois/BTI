Analysis of a continuum model of the hippocampus shows that strengthening of the synaptic connections within localized regions can convert the global activity-wave properties from decay to growth. These growing waves can play a part in the implantation of long-term memory in the higher brain regions. The wavelength of the fastest-growing mode decreases with increasing local synaptic strength and can be modified by the chemical state as reflected by synaptic sensitivity to stimuli. The temporal period of the response is a constant, equal to twice the delay time exhibited by some of the hippocampal inhibitory neurons ("d-cells"). The value for the period obtained from this relationship and measurement of the delay time agrees with the hippocampal gamma rhythm. For normal hippocampal function the proportion of d-cells is limited to one-third the total number of inhibitory neurons.
