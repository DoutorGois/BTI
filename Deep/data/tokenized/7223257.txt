Rats kept in isolation for 3 months from the 4th week onward show increased sensitivity of striatal neurons for dopamine and acetylcholine, as well as of the hippocampal neurons for noradrenalin administered microiontophoretically, in comparison to animals maintained collectively. The results are discussed as reflecting a supersensitivity of central dopaminergic and noradrenergic receptors caused by the social isolation.
