Two populations of phencyclidine (PCP) binding sites are shown to exist in the rat brain: a high-affinity monovalent ion-sensitive site (Kd of 10-14 nM for [3H]TCP, [3H]N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine), which exists in both the frontal cortex and the hippocampus, and a lower affinity site (Kd of 80-130 nM for [3H]TCP) which is found in the hippocampus but not in the frontal cortex. The nature of the interactions between the ion-binding sites and the high affinity PCP receptors depend on both ligand structure (PCP or TCP) and the ion involved (K' or Na'). The high-affinity sites are associated with an Mr 90,000 polypeptide whose labeling by [3H]azido phencyclidine is selectively inhibited by monovalent ions.
