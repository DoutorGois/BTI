Brain radiotherapy aims at controlling the pathological lesion(s) as well as avoiding damaging critical structures. However, side effects may occur. Neurocognitive function is often involved impairing quality of life. This dysfunction is among the most frequent complications of brain irradiation. Sparing as much as feasible hippocampus and/or other critical structures like the motor unit might reduce neurocognitive dysfunction, motor disturbance and other complications occurring after whole brain radiotherapy or radiosurgery.
