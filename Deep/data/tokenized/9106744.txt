Treatment of Parkinson's disease with levodopa is associated with fluctuations in motor function and dyskinesias, which may in part depend upon the mode of levodopa treatment. In rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions, intermittent levodopa results in sensitization to apomorphine-induced rotation, associated with massive ipsilateral increases in nigral dynorphin. We assessed the effects of nigral infusion of the selective kappa opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphomine (nor-BNI) in this model. Nor-BNI reduced apomorphine-induced rotation in animals receiving intermittent levodopa to a level comparable with that seen in animals treated with continuous levodopa or with saline. These data suggest that behavioural sensitization arising from intermittent levodopa therapy in a rodent model of parkinsonism depends upon increased expression of dynorphin in the striatonigral pathway and provides further insight into the mechanisms underlying motor fluctuations which develop during the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
