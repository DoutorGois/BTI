A neural network model of classical conditioning (Schmajuk, Lam, and Gray, J. Exp. Psychol.: Anim. Behav. Process, 22, 1996, 321-349) is applied to the description of the neural substrates of latent inhibition. Experimental data suggest that latent inhibition might be controlled by a circuit that involves the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the mesolimbic dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area to the accumbens. By mapping different nodes and connections in the model onto this brain circuit, computer simulations demonstrate that, in most cases, the model provides a good quantitative description of: (1) the impairment of latent inhibition by lesions of the shell of the nucleus accumbens; (2) the restoration of latent inhibition by haloperidol following lesions of the shell; (3) the preservation of latent inhibition by lesions of the core of the nucleus accumbens; (4) the facilitation of latent inhibition by combined shell core lesions and by core lesions with extended conditioning; (5) the impairment of latent inhibition following lesions of the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus; and (6) the restoration of latent inhibition by haloperidol following lesions of the entorhinal cortex and ventral subiculum. In addition, the model is able to describe neural activity in the nucleus accumbens.
