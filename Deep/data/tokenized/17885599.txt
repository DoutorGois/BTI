Calcyon is a brain-specific protein, implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this descriptive study we show that calcyon is exclusively expressed in neurons, and localized in moving vesicles. The movement of calcyon-containing vesicles was dependent on temperature and on intact microtubules, in addition these vesicles were colocalized with a marker for endocytosed plasma membrane proteins, suggesting that calcyon vesicles follow the endocytic recycling pathway. We also show using evanescent wave microscopy that there is a pool of ready releasable calcyon vesiclesaccumulated beneath the plasma membrane. We conclude that the mobility and storage properties of calcyon-containing vesicles imply that they play a role in brain plasticity.
