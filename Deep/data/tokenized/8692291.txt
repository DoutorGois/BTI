The effects of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and ganglioside GM1 (GM1) were evaluated alone and simultaneously in two types of experiments. First, the neuronal survival of primary culture neurons from fetal rat brain was measured. Then, performance on radial maze task in adult male rats following bilateral partial Fimbria-Fornix transections (F-F lesion) was tested. In primary culture neurons, bFGF (1-10 ng/ml) supported the neuronal survival from three regions (hippocampus, cortex and septum) of embryonic rat brain. However, GM1 (0.1-10 micrograms/ml) did not support the neuronal survival from any regions. Survival of cultured neurons was not supported by addition of 0.1 ng/ml bFGF, but when bFGF (0.1 ng/ml) and GM1 (0.1, 1 microgram/ml) were given to the cultured neurons simultaneously, the number of surviving neurons increased significantly. In the eight-arm radial maze task, where only the same four arms were baited, F-F lesion produced substantial memory impairment. In this task, administration of bFGF (10 micrograms/ml) or GM1 (1 mg/ml) alone did not produce any effects. However, when they were given simultaneously, the number of working memory errors decreased significantly, in spite of no amelioration for hippocampal choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) depletion. These findings indicate that actions of bFGF may be potentiated by the addition of GM1 in both primary neuronal cultures and radial maze task performance. These results suggest that the combination of bFGF and GM1 may synergistically improve spatial memory deficits.
