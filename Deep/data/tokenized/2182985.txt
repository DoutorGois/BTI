The hypothesis presented here suggests that schizophrenia is caused by the action of gestational zinc deficiency on genetically susceptible foetuses. The psychosis seen is suggested to be due to a combination of dietary or otherwise induced zinc deficiency and lack of zinc releasing capacity in the hippocampus. A non genetic but transmissable immune defect is suggested to be relevant to psychosis and to the nonmendelian pattern of inheritance of the disorder.
