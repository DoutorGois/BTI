We report a case of transient global amnesia (TGA), in a right-handed woman, which was due to a cerebral venous thrombosis. In our knowledge it is the first case reported. MRI and SPECT revealed the existence of a dysfunction in the right internal temporal region. Such a localization leads us to discuss the specialisation of each hippocampus.
