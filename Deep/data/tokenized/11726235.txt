An understanding of synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain has been one of R. F. Thompson's major pursuits throughout his illustrious career. A current series of experiments of significant interest to R. F. Thompson is an examination of the interactions between sex hormones, synaptic plasticity, aging, and stress. This research is contained within a broader project whose aim is to investigate animal models that evaluate estrogen interactions with Alzheimer's disease. This paper reviews the recent results that have led to a better understanding of how the sex hormone estrogen influences synaptic plasticity in an important structure within the mammalian brain responsible for learning and memory: the hippocampus. In this review, a number of experiments have been highlighted that investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie estrogen's effect on two specific forms of synaptic plasticity commonly studied in neurophysiology and the behavioral neurosciences: long-term potentiation and long-term depression.
