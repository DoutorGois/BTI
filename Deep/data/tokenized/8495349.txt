The initiation site of seizure discharges and the relationship between behavioral manifestations and electroencephalography were investigated in the El mouse, a hereditary epilepsy model. The chronic depth electrodes were implanted stereotaxically into the frontal cortex, parietal cortex, temporal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, amygdaloid complex, non-specific nuclei of thalamus and substantia nigra. Electrical activities were recorded in freely moving condition with use of the buffer amplifier devised in the laboratory and behaviors were monitored simultaneously. Seizure spike discharges started in the parietal cortex and spread out into other brain areas. When the hippocampus was involved, the tonic convulsion occurred behaviorally. The paper describes the first direct evidence of the initiation and propagation of seizure discharges in the brain of El mouse.
