Some actual problems of higher nervous activity have been analysed on the peculiarities of brain states in the course of different types of conditioning and reactivity of the nervous structures which depend on the brain state have been considered. A concept of brain state as a specific mechanism of each temporal connection forming during the learning process has been formulated for the first time. The authors suggest that the brain represents the dynamic system with changeable structure which reveals itself in multitude nervous set constellation during various types of activity. This concept is presented to be the theoretical basis for integral evaluation of functional capacities of central nervous system.
