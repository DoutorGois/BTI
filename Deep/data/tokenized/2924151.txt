The immunoreactivity of parvalbumin (PV), a Ca2+-binding protein present in a subpopulation of interneurons, was studied in the hippocampal CA1 region during kindling epileptogenesis, induced by tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers. PV-immunoreactivity was increased in comparison to controls after 13 afterdischarges and after the induction of generalized seizures. A quantification of the number of PV-immunoreactive somata showed an increase of 20% in both stages of kindling. This level had returned to baseline level 31 days after the last seizure. These results imply that changes in PV-immunoreactivity are related to seizure activity rather than to the long-term increase in seizure sensitivity in kindled animals. Co-localization study in controls showed that 32% of PV-immunoreactive somata were also immunopositive for GABA. A colocalization study in stratum oriens and pyramidale on the stimulated side of kindled animals 31 days after the last generalized seizure showed neither a reduction in the number of PV-immunoreactive somata nor in the number of GABA-immunopositive cell bodies that co-localized with PV. In contrast, the number of GABA-immunoreactive somata that did not co-localize with PV was reduced by 50%. It has been shown that a large influx of Ca2+ plays a crucial role in epileptogenesis. Here we demonstrate that the presence of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin seems to exert a protective effect against the process that leads to a decrease in GABA content.
