Glucocorticoids and serotonin (5-HT) modulate behaviour and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses. The two systems interact prominently in the hippocampus, where these effects may occur. We have previously shown that hippocampal 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression is increased by adrenalectomy or central 5-HT lesions. We have now determined expression of corticosteroid and 5-HT receptor subtype genes in the hippocampus across the diurnal cycle, when there are changes both in plasma corticosterone and hippocampal 5-HT levels, as well as the responses of these transcripts to acute and chronic stress, using in situ hybridisation histochemistry. Expression of both glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor mRNAs was significantly higher (131-153%) in the hippocampus at 08.00 h (corticosterone nadir) than at 20.00 h (corticosterone peak). 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression also showed circadian variation (106-184% higher in CA1-CA3 in the morning). Hippocampal 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression had no diurnal variation. Chronic (15 day) adjuvant arthritis stress, abolished the circadian corticosterone nadir, maintaining plasma corticosterone around diurnal peak values. Chronic arthritis stress suppressed hippocampal 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression at 08.00 h to levels comparable to 20.00 h controls. By contrast to chronic stress, 6 h after acute laparotomy stress, plasma corticosterone was elevated above control (20.00 h) and 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression was increased (CA2). Neither acute nor chronic stress altered MR, GR, 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression in any hippocampal subfield. These results show that hippocampal expression of the 5-HT2C receptor gene, but not other subtypes, is sensitive to a variety of manipulations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
