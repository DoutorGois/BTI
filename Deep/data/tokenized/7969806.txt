Laboratory rats exhibit innate behavioural and corticosterone responses when exposed to cat odour. However, not all are responsive and differences in benzodiazepine receptor binding between responders and non-responders were explored. Rats were exposed to cat odour for 5 min and based on time spent sheltering were divided into responders (n = 21; mean +/- SEM = 244 +/- 8.2 sec) or non-responders (n = 20; 43.9 +/- 4.8 sec). Four days later, both groups were randomly allocated among 3 experimental conditions: home-cage, neutral or cat odour, and killed 30 min after exposure. [3H]flunitrazepam binding was performed at two ligand concentrations (2 and 10 nM); where significant differences in single point binding were found, Scatchard analysis was performed on pooled samples. In hippocampus and frontal cortex responders had significantly lower binding than non-responders. In hippocampus this was most apparent when the rats were exposed to the novel test situation, i.e. neutral odour and was due to a reduction in affinity (Kd = 0.4 and 1.2 nM non-responders and responders). In frontal cortex, differences were significant only following exposure to cat odour (Bmax = 2663 and 1501 fmol/mg protein in non-responders and responders). The changes in amygdala were not significant.
