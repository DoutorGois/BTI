Chlorogenic acid is a major polyphenolic component of many plants and beverages, and is particularly abundant in coffee. We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of chlorogenic acid on learning and memory impairment induced by scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), a muscarinic antagonist, using the Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests. The chlorogenic acid significantly improved the impairment of short-term or working memory induced by scopolamine in the Y-maze test, and significantly reversed cognitive impairments in mice as measured by the passive avoidance test. In addition, chlorogenic acid decreased escape latencies in the Morris water maze test. In a probe trial session, chlorogenic acid increased the latency time in the target quadrant in a dose-dependent manner. Ex vivo, chlorogenic acid inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Chlorogenic acid also decreased malondialdehyde levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. In vitro, chlorogenic acid was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity (IC(5)(0)=98.17 mug/ml) and free radical scavenging activity (IC(5)(0)=3.09 mug/ml) in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that chlorogenic acid may exert anti-amnesic activity via inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde in the hippocampus and frontal cortex.
