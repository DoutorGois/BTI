The development of statistical models that accurately describe the stochastic structure of neural oscillations is a fast growing area in quantitative research. In developing a novel statistical paradigm based on Bayes' theorem and the theory of point processes, we focused our recent research on two applications. The first studies how hippocampal neural activity represents and transmits information, whereas the second is aimed at characterizing activity of the central autonomic network as involved in cardiovascular control.
