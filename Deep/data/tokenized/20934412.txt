Clinical data has shown that stroke exacerbates dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Previous work, combining rat models of AD and stroke have shown that neuroinflammation may be the common mediator between AD and stroke toxicity. This study examined the effects of triflusal (2-acetoxy-4-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid) in APP(23) transgenic mice receiving strokes. Six month-old APP(23) mice over-expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP) were used to model AD in this study. Unilateral injections of a potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1, into the striatum were used to mimic small lacunar infarcts. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to examine AD-like pathology and inflammatory correlates of stroke and AD. APP(23) mice showed increases in AD-like pathology and inflammatory markers of AD in the cortex and hippocampus. Endothelin-induced ischemia triggered an inflammatory response along with increases in AD pathological markers in the region of the infarct. Triflusal reduced inflammation surrounding the endothelin-induced infarct only. At the dose used, anti-inflammatory treatment may be beneficial in reducing the AD and inflammatory correlates of stroke in a combined AD-stroke mouse model.
