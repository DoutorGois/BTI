The accumulated evidence suggests that the overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) is involved in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neurotoxicity. Using NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) antibody immunohistochemistry, the possible overexpression of nNOS and iNOS was investigated in the brains of mice treated with METH. The number of positive cells or the density of positive fibers was assessed at 1 h, 24 h and 1 week after METH injections. There were no clear positive iNOS cells and fibers demonstrated in the brains of mice after METH treatment. In contrast, METH caused marked increases in nNOS in the striatum and hippocampus at 1 and 24 h post-treatment. The nNOS expression normalized by 1 week. There were no statistical changes in nNOS expression in the frontal cortex, the cerebellar cortex, nor in the substantia nigra. These results provide further support for the idea that NO is involved in the neurotoxic effects of METH.
