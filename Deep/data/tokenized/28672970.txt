The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of vitamin D (VD) on the learning and memory ability of fetal growth restriction (FGR) rat and the expression of NMDA receptor in hippocampus. The FGR models of rat were established through passive smoking, and divided into two groups randomly, i.e. the control group and the observation group. Rats were fed regular diet with the addition of VD in the observation group. The serum level of 25(OH)-D3 was assayed in both groups of the rats at different time points using ELISA, and the learning and memory ability of rat aged 30 days were evaluated using Morris water maze and passive avoidance test. In addition, we also compared the brain weight of rats at different age and detected the mRNA expression of NRI subunit of NMDA receptor of hippocampus of rats aged 30 days using quantitative RT-PCR. After 7 days, the serum level of 25(OH)D3 in rats of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.05); during the Morris water maze, we found no significant difference in comparison of the latency between the two groups in the first 2 days (P>0.05), but from the 3rd day, the latency of the observation group was shorter than that in the control group (P<0.05); in the passive avoidance test, no significant difference was identified when comparing the electric shock times between the two groups in the first 2 days, but from the 3rd day, the electric shock times in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05); the brain weight of rats in the observation group on the 1st, 7th and 14th day were all lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), but the comparison of brain weight at 21st and 30th day showed no significant difference (P>0.05) between the two groups. We also found that the mRNA and protein expression of NRI subunit of NMDA receptor in hippocampus was significantly higher in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.05). VD can increase the learning and memory ability of FGR rats, significantly ameliorating the cognitive dysfunction of FGR rat and improving the learning and memory ability of rats, which may be related to the upregulation of NRI subunit of NMDA receptor.
