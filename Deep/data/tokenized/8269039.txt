The perforant path fibers from the entorhinal cortex form synapses with both granule cells and GABAergic, parvalbumin-containing (PARV) nongranule cells. The authors recently reported a persistent reduction of PARV-positive dendrites in the termination zones of entorhinal fibers in the hippocampus proper and fascia dentata after lesion of the entorhinal cortex. In the present study the authors analyzed the effects of de-entorhination on the ultrastructure of postsynaptic PARV-positive dendrites in the molecular layer of the fascia dentata. PARV immunocytochemistry was performed 2, 8, 55, and 360 days after an ipsilateral entorhinal lesion and, for comparison, 10 days after an ipsilateral fimbria-fornix transection that disconnects the hippocampus from its septal and commissural afferents. Two days after entorhinal lesion, the authors observed swelling of the tissue close to the hippocampal fissure. Adjacent distal dendritic tips of PARV-positive dentate neurons appeared bloated and reduced in number. Reduction of PARV-positive dendrites in the former perforant path termination zone persisted 55 days after entorhinal lesion and could still observed after postlesional survival times for 1 year. Degenerating axon terminals were still present 55 days following lesion and PARV-positive dendrites exhibited abnormal invaginations. Fimbria transection did not result in similar dendritic changes in PARV-positive neurons. The results indicate a long-lasting process of reorganization in the molecular layer of the fascia dentata following entorhinal lesion and persisting changes in the morphology of PARV-immunoreactive dendrites. Entorhinal fibers seem to play a specific role for the maintenance of these dendrites, since similar changes did not occur following removal of septal and commissural fibers.
