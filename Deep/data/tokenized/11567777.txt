A potential function for inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70i) expression in the pathophysiology of ischemic brain has been well documented. The recently cloned hsp70 superfamily member, hsp110, was shown to be highly expressed in the brain and suggested to have a similar functional property as members of the hsp70 family. In this study, as an initial step to probe for its physiological significance in the ischemic brain, cerebral activation and distribution of hsp110 mRNA was comparatively evaluated with that of hsp70i mRNA by in situ hybridization. A rat focal cerebral ischemia model was employed to examine the distribution and localization of hsp110 and hsp70i mRNAs in both affected (ipsilateral) and unaffected (contralateral) hemispheres of the same animal. Our results demonstrated a significant accumulation of hsp110 as well as hsp70i mRNAs following ischemia; although the magnitude and kinetics of induction differ slightly, spatial expression profiles of hsp110 and hsp70i mRNAs were highly correlated in the affected region. In control brain, limited hybridization signal was observed with 3'-untranslated region (UTR) containing hsp110 probe, suggesting a possible existence of inducible hsp110 and a selective recognition of our 3'-UTR containing probe for the inducible hsp110 mRNA species. Subsequent 2D western analysis with Hsp110 specific Ab was consistent with our view, which resolved constitutive and inducible immunostained spots in rat ischemic brain. Considering a regulatory similarity as well as previously documented structural and functional similarities between hsp110 and hsp70i, we propose that coordinated cerebral activation of hsp110 and hsp70i is likely to be of significant relevance in the context of pathophysiology of ischemic brain. Further study is required to characterize the genetic and biochemical nature of rat inducible hsp110 identified in the current study.
