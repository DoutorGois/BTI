BACKGROUND: Human neuronal protein (hNP22) is a gene with elevated messenger RNA expression in the prefrontal cortex of the human alcoholic brain. hNP22 has high homology with a rat protein (rNP22). These proteins also share homology with a number of cytoskeleton-interacting proteins. METHODS: A rabbit polyclonal antibody to an 18-amino acid epitope was produced for use in Western and immunohistochemical analysis. Samples from the human frontal and motor cortices were used for Western blots (n = 10), whereas a different group of frontal cortex and hippocampal samples were obtained for immunohistochemistry (n = 12). RESULTS: The hNP22 antibody detected a single protein in both rat and human brain. Western blots revealed a significant increase in hNP22 protein levels in the frontal cortex but not the motor cortex of alcoholic cases. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the increased hNP22 protein expression in all cortical layers. This is consistent with results previously obtained using Northern analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed a significant increase of hNP22 immunoreactivity in the CA3 and CA4 but not other regions of the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that this protein may play a role in the morphological or plastic changes observed after chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal, either as a cytoskeleton-interacting protein or as a signaling molecule.
