Anxiety-related disorders are complex illnesses that underlying molecular mechanisms of these complicated emotional disorders are poorly understood. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is the most important regulator of the antioxidant defense system. Its protective actions are not only limited to antioxidative transactivation, but also plays important roles in encountering various physiological and pathological stresses. In this study, we evaluated whether silencing of Nrf2 plays a role in development of anxiety-related behavior. In this regard, we exerted small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Nrf2 in dorsal third ventricle and subsequently examined the effect of this silencing on anxiety-related behavior along with supposed molecular mechanisms. Therefore, we evaluated apoptotic markers and mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activity in three brain regions: hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. Based on our result, Nrf2-silenced rats exhibited greater anxiety-like behavior compared to control group. Furthermore, Nrf2 silencing increased activity of ETC complexes. Also, Bax/Bcl2 ratio of all mentioned areas of the brain and cleavage of caspase-3 in hippocampus increased in Nrf2 silenced group, however, with a distinct pattern.
