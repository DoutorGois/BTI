To elucidate the anatomical distribution of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, we identified serotonin transporter (5-HTT) in the hippocampus of rats and monkeys by immunohistochemistry. A widespread and heterogeneous distribution of 5-HTT-immunoreactive fine fibers was noted in the rat brain. However, in monkeys, punctuate 5-HTT-immunoreactive deposits and fewer fibers were observed. The species difference in 5-HTT immunohistochemical staining pattern may be caused by differences in localization of 5-HTT between species.
