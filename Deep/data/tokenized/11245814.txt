Midkine (MK) is a growth factor with neurotrophic activities, and is expressed during the early stages of experimental cerebral infarction in rats in the zone surrounding the infarct. To evaluate in vivo activity of MK in preventing neuronal death, MK produced in yeast (Pichia pastoris) was administered into the brain ventricle immediately before occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery of Mongolian gerbils. MK administration at the dose of 0.5-2 microg immediately before occlusion was found to ameliorate delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region caused by transient ischemia 7 days after the insult. The hippocampal neurons of the MK-administered gerbils tended to degenerate 14 and 21 days after the insult, but their numbers remained higher than those in saline-administered controls; however, the hippocampal neurons were degenerated 28 days after the insult. MK administration at 2 h after occlusion did not ameliorate the neuronal death. These findings suggested that the therapeutic time window was narrow. The two to four times repeated administration of 2 microg MK immediately before and at 1, 2, or 3 weeks after the occlusion were not significantly different for the hippocampal neuronal death at 28 days after the insult compared with a single injection, but were significantly effective compared with vehicle administration alone. These findings suggested that the therapeutic time window was relatively narrow. The potent neuroprotective activity of MK observed in vivo suggested that MK might be useful as a therapeutic reagent for prevention of neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases.
