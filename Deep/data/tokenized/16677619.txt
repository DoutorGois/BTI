Post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) is a postsynaptic adaptor protein coupling the NMDA receptor to downstream signalling pathways underlying plasticity. Mice carrying a targeted gene mutation of PSD-95 show altered behavioural plasticity including spatial learning, neuropathic pain, orientation preference in visual cortical cells, and cocaine sensitisation. These behavioural effects are accompanied by changes in long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. In vitro studies of PSD-95 signalling indicate that it may play a role in regulating dendritic spine structure. Here, we show that PSD-95 mutant mice have alterations in dendritic spine density in the striatum (a 15% decrease along the dendritic length) and in the hippocampus (a localised 40% increase) without changes in dendritic branch patterns or gross neuronal architecture. These changes in spine density were accompanied by altered expression of proteins known to interact with PSD-95, including NR2B and SAP102, suggesting that PSD-95 plays a role in regulating the expression and activation of proteins found within the NMDA receptor complex. Thus, PSD-95 is an important regulator of neuronal structure as well as plasticity in vivo.
