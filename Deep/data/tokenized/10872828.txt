cDNAs encoding two splicing variants of a serine protease, termed hippostasin, were isolated by a PCR-based cloning strategy. The difference of 5' nucleotide sequence resulted in the variation in the amino terminal ends of the two, brain and prostate, types of human hippostasin. The longest ORF of the brain-type was 250 amino acids with a putative signal peptide, while that of the prostate-type was 282 amino acids. Homology search using the amino acid sequence revealed that prostate-type hippostasin was identical to TLSP (PRSS20), which is expressed in human primary keratinocytes (1). Transient expression analysis showed that both brain- and prostate-type TLSP/hippostasin were secreted into the conditioned medium as about 40 kDa proteins. Human TLSP/hippostasin showed 47% and 45% identity to trypsinogen II and kallikrein, respectively. In fact, the recombinant human TLSP/hippostasin efficiently cleaved Bz-Phe-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide, a kallikrein substrate, and weakly cleaved other substrates for kallikrein and trypsin. Northern blot analysis detected a 1.3 kb band in the whole brain and a 1.4 kb band in the prostate and the lung. In situ hybridization revealed that it was expressed preferentially by the pyramidal neurons in the human hippocampus and secretory epithelial cells in the prostate. These results indicated that TLSP/hippostasin is involved in the functions of the human central nervous system and prostate and that it is a multifunctional protease present in various organs.
