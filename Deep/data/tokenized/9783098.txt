The work discusses the neurochemical correlates of rat brain dopamin-synaptic activity after injection of 0.5 mg/kg rudotel (medazepam) as compared with intact animals. The parameters of functioning of D2-receptors in [3H]-dopamine binding, the content of catecholamines and their metabolites (high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection) were studied in the dopaminergic system in different brain areas (the striatum, frontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and accumbence).
