The regional and cellular distribution of serotonin type 2C receptor messenger RNA was investigated in autopsy samples of human brain by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The main sites of serotonin receptor type 2C messenger RNA expression were the choroid plexus, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, some components of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra, the substantia innominata and the ventromedial hypothalamus, suggesting that this receptor might be involved in the regulation of different brain functions. Interestingly, in all regions examined, the serotonin type 2C receptor messenger RNA was always restricted to subpopulations of cells, suggesting a specific role, perhaps determined by regionality. A comparison of the in situ hybridization results with those previously obtained by means of radioligand binding experiments suggested that in most of the areas analysed the serotonin type 2C receptors were located at axon terminals.
