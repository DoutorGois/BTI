Several studies of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients have investigated the relationship between the seizure focus and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). There have also been a few reports in other types of partial epilepsy. We examined the relationship between the seizure focus and the reduction in N-acetylaspartate: creatine (NAA : Cr) ratio using 1H-MRS in both TLE and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) patients. We studied 21 patients with unilateral TLE and seven patients with unilateral FLE. We used a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance unit (Signa Horizon; General Electric). Approximately 15 x 15 x 20 mm3 voxel of interest (VOI) was placed over the anterior portion of the bilateral hippocampus in the TLE patients, and the anterodorsal position of bilateral frontal lobe in the FLE patients. The seizure focus was identified by interictal scalp electro-encephalogram (EEG). In the TLE patients the NAA : Cr ratios were reduced in the seizure focus, while in the FLE patients they were not always reduced in the seizure focus. In the TLE patients the coincidence rate between the seizure focus and the reduction in the NAA:Cr ratio was 90% (19 of 21 patients), while in the FLE patients the coincidence rate was only 57% (four of seven patients).
