The metabolism of GABA and other amino acids was studied in the substantia nigra, the hippocampus and the parietal cortex of rats following microinjections of GAMMA-vinyl-GABA during status epilepticus induced by lithium and pilocarpine. GABA metabolism showed striking regional variations. In controls, both GABA concentration and rate of GABA synthesis were highest in the substantia nigra and lowest in cortex, as expected. In substantia nigra, status epilepticus resulted in a 2 1/2 fold decline in the rate of GABA synthesis and in a 307% increase in the turnover time of the GABA pool. In hippocampus, the rate of GABA synthesis was not altered significantly, but the turnover time of the GABA pool was 284% of controls, and the size of that pool increased to 208% of controls. By contrast, in cortex, where seizure activity is limited in this model, the rate of GABA synthesis increased to 230% of controls while pool size and turnover time did not change. Aspartate concentration decreased in all three brain regions. These data suggest that the observed reduction of the rate of GABA synthesis in substantia nigra could play a key role in seizure spread in this model of status epilepticus.
