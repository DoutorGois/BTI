An ovarian steroid-dependent cycle of synaptogenesis and synapse shedding occurs naturally in the hippocampus of the adult female rat. The newly formed axospinous synapses in CA1 may differ functionally from extant axospinous synapses, e.g., in terms of their modifiability. Here we assess whether estradiol alters the induction of homosynaptic long-term depression of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in vitro. Sprague-Dawley rats were bilaterally ovariectomized and, beginning 6-8 days later, received a series of injections of either 17beta-estradiol or sesame oil sc. Field potentials were recorded in hippocampal slices. In estradiol-treated animals, asynchronous, low-frequency stimulation led to significant long-term depression of the activated synapses in CA1 s. radiatum and no change of the inactive synapses in s. oriens. In contrast, this conditioning stimulation did not significantly alter any CA1 responses in oil-treated control animals. Subsequent high-frequency conditioning stimulation significantly potentiated the activated s. radiatum synapses in both estradiol- and oil-treated animals. Thus, given the stimulation conditions used here, estradiol enables the induction of homosynaptic long-term depression at the CA3-CA1 synapses in adult females.
