Extra- and intracellular recording from hippocampal slices of the rat revealed the following effects when baclofen (BF) (0.1-10 microM) was added to the perfusion fluid: a block of synaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of stratum radiatum; a direct hyperpolarization and a conductance increase (for potassium ions) of CA1 pyramidal cells. All this activity was found in the L- none in the D-enantiomer. D-BF did not antagonize the action of L-BF.
