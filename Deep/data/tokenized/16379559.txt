D-003 is a mixture of very-high-molecular-weight aliphatic acids purified from sugar cane wax (Saccharum officinarum), which inhibits platelet aggregation and lipid peroxidation. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of D-003 on cerebral ischemia induced by ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) in Mongolian gerbils. Two experimental series were conducted. The first series investigated the effects of D-003 on cerebral edema, neurological symptoms, and mortality in Mongolian gerbils with cerebral ischemia induced by I-R, while the second series investigated the effects on histological markers of cerebral injury, such as edema intensity (vacuolization) and cerebral necrosis. Animals were randomly distributed in five experimental groups: a sham-operated group experiencing surgical handling except the clamping and orally treated with Tween/water vehicle and four groups subjected to the I-R surgical procedure. One of these groups was treated with the same vehicle, and the other three groups received D-003 at 25, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively. All treatments were administered for 14 days. D-003 (200 mg/kg) significantly reduced the cerebral edema and clinical symptoms provoked by I-R compared with the positive control group, whereas lower doses (25 and 100 mg/kg) were not effective. Positive control animals showed an injury profile characterized by swelling (tissue vacuolization) and necrosis of neurons in all areas of the brain studied (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum). The results of the histological study were consistent with those observed by determining cerebral edema and symptoms observation. Thus, D-003 at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced histological markers of brain injury (swelling and necrosis) compared with the control group. It is concluded that D-003 administered orally at 200 mg/kg for 14 days protected against cerebral damage caused by bilateral cerebral ischemia in Mongolian gerbils.
