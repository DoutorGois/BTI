In our previous report [Tsukada, M., Aihara, T., Saito, H., Kato, H., 1996. Neural Netw. 9, 1357-1365], the temporal pattern sensitivity of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 neurons was estimated by using Markov chain stimuli (MS) with different values of the serial correlation coefficient rho1 between successive interstimulus-intervals. In this paper, the effect of chaotic stimuli (CS) on induction of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 area was investigated in comparison with that of MS and periodic pattern stimuli (PS). The CS were produced by a modified Bernoulli map, so that interstimulus sequences with various values of rho1 can be generated by changing the parameter B. These stimuli had an identical first order statistics (mean interstimulus-interval), but their higher order statistics such as the serial correlation coefficients were different. The LTP induced by CS at B = 2 was significantly larger in magnitude than that of PS and MS, and also depended on the initial value of CS at B = 2 and 3. These results suggest that chaotic signals play an important role for memory coding in the hippocampal CA1 network.
