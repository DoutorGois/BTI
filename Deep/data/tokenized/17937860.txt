OBJECTIVE: Gap junctions, the clusters of intercellular channels, play an important role in synchronizing electrical activity. This study investigated the effect of gap junction blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) on epileptic activity in pentylenetetrazo (PTZ)-kindled rats. METHODS: Thirty adult male SD rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, PTZ-kindled and CBX-treated groups (n=10 each). The rats from the PTZ-kindled and the CBX-treated groups were intraperitoneally injected with PTZ (35 mg/kg x d) to induce epilepsy. After epilepsy kindling, they were intraperitoneally injected for 3 days with CBX (10 mg/kg) (CBX-treated group) or with normal saline (PTZ-kindled group). The control group received intraperitoneal injections of normal saline. Anti-GFAP, anti-Fos, and anti-NMDARZ immunohistochemical ABC methods were used to detect the expression of GFAP-Li, Fos-Li and NMDAR2-Li in the hippocampus respectively. RESULTS: Spontaneous seizures occurred in PTZ-kindled epileptic rats. CBX administration reduced spontaneous seizures. The NMDAR2-Li and Fos-Li neurons as well as GFAP-Li astrocytes in hippocampi increased in PTZ-kindled epileptic rats compared with controls. The numbers of Fos-Li (93.75 +/-7.94 vs 165.25 +/-15.87, P < 0.05) and NMDAR2-Li neurons (61.47 +/-3.62 vs 148.72 +/-14.53, P < 0.01) in the CBX-treated group were significantly less than in the PTZ-kindled group. There were no significant differences in the GFAP-Li expression between the CBX-treated and the PTZ-kindled groups. CONCLUSIONS: CBX may inhibit spontaneous seizures and decrease the numbers of Fos-Li and NMDARZ-Li neurons, thus providing anti-epileptic effects.
