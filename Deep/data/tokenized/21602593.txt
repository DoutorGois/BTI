Activation of the NF-kappaB pathway plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and blocking NF-kappaB pathway activation has been shown to attenuate cognitive impairment. Diabetic metabolic disorder contributes to beta-amyloid protein (Abeta) generation. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of minocycline on Abeta generation and the NF-kappaB pathway in the hippocampus of diabetic rats and to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanisms of minocycline for the treatment of diabetic metabolic disorder. The diabetic rat model was established using a high-fat diet and an intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (STZ). Behavioral tests showed that the capacity of learning and memory was significantly lower in diabetic rats. The levels of NF-kappaB, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha after the STZ injection were significantly increased in the hippocampus. Significant increases in Abeta, BACE1, NF-kappaB, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were found in diabetic rats. The levels of Abeta, NF-kappaB, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were significantly decreased after minocycline administration; however, minocycline had no effect on BACE1 expression. In sum, diabetes contributes to the activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and upregulates BACE1 and Abeta. Minocycline downregulates Abeta in the hippocampus by inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation.
