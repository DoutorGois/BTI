There are previous evidences of biochemical and functional interhemispheric asymmetry for central dopaminergic systems. The purpose of the current study was to establish an evidence of the existence of mechanisms for interhemispheric regulation of dopaminergic systems. The initial hypothesis was that to compensate the spontaneous interhemispheric asymmetry, the brain side with lower dopamine (DA) concentration show a higher DA turnover. The ratio of metabolite/neurotransmitter was computed as an index of presynaptic turnover rate. Both striatum and hippocampus showed a DOPAC/DA index higher in the brain side with a lower DA concentration. In addition, we found an inverse relation between the interhemispheric index of DA and interhemispheric index of DA turnover. Taken together the present data provide evidence of an interhemispheric regulation for the DA-innervation of both striatum and hippocampus in normal unlesioned rats.
