Neuroligins are a family of cell adhesion molecules critical in establishing proper central nervous system connectivity; disruption of neuroligin signaling in vivo precipitates a broad range of cognitive deficits. Despite considerable recent progress, the specific synaptic function of neuroligin-1 (NL1) remains unclear. A current model proposes that NL1 acts exclusively to mature pre-existent synaptic connections in an activity-dependent manner. A second element of this activity-dependent maturation model is that an alternate molecule acts upstream of NL1 to initiate synaptic connections. SynCAM1 (SC1) is hypothesized to function in this capacity, though several uncertainties remain regarding SC1 function. Using overexpression and chronic pharmacological blockade of synaptic activity, we now demonstrate that NL1 is capable of robustly recruiting synapsin-positive terminals independent of synaptic maturation and activity in 2-week old primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. We further report that neither SC1 overexpression nor knockdown of endogenous SC1 impacts synapsin punctum densities, suggesting that SC1 is not a limiting factor of synapse initiation in maturing hippocampal neurons in vitro. Consistent with these findings, we observed profoundly greater recruitment of synapsin-positive presynaptic terminals by NL1 than SC1 in a mixed-culture assay of artificial synaptogenesis between primary neurons and heterologous cells. Collectively, our results contend multiple aspects of the proposed model of NL1 and SC1 function and motivate an alternative model whereby SC1 may mature synaptic connections forged by NL1. Supporting this model, we present evidence that combined NL1 and SC1 overexpression triggers excitotoxic neurodegeneration through SC1 signaling at synaptic connections initiated by NL1.
