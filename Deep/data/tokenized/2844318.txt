Adenosine influence on cAMP and cGMP levels in cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum was studied. It was established that adenosine and inhibitor of its reuptake--dipyridamole change cyclic nucleotide levels in some structures of brain (intraperitoneal injection). It was shown that cAMP and cGMP were in reciprocal relations in cortex, but not in hypothalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum.
