To test whether changes in basic biochemical membrane constituents were reflected in membrane fluidity measurements, protein, total lipids, triglycerides, lecithin, cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase were determined in frontal cortex, hippocampus, putamen and nucleus basalis Meynert (NbM) of DAT brains and controls and compared to differential scanning thermograms. Biochemical changes were most pronounced in the hippocampus, while thermostability was altered in the NbM and the frontal cortex. The results indicate that changes in protein content, but not in lipid composition were reflected in alterations of thermostability of the brain regions examined.
