The influence of the non-pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome (YNPAR) on the sizes of the hippocampal intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fiber (IIPMF) terminal fields were examined in wild house mice. For this purpose selection lines for short attack latency (SAL), long attack latency (LAL), and their respective congenics for the YNPAR were used. We found an incremental effect of the (non-aggressive) LAL YNPAR, combined with an additive effect of the line background on the sizes of the IIPMF terminal fields. In contrast, only the line background affected attack latency. The implications of this finding for the previously observed correlation between the size of the IIPMF and aggression in male house mice are discussed.
