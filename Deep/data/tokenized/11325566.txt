The immunohistochemical localization of c-fos protein in the CNS neurons was studied in a model of generalized epilepsy induced by the intraperitoneal injection of 4-aminopyridine to adult Wistar rats. This specific blocker of the voltage-dependent potassium channels proved to be suitable for use in the investigation of epileptogenesis. Following the treatment of adult rats with 5 mg kg of 4-aminopyridine, the animals experienced generalized seizures. At the end of the experiment, the rats were briefly anesthetized and perfused with fixative. Frozen coronal plane sections were cut and processed for immunohistochemistry, using polyclonal c-fos antibody. The number and distribution of immunostained cell nuclei in the hippocampus were analyzed in detail with the help of a digital microscope camera and a morphometry program. The highest level of immunostaining was detected in most of the structures at 3 h, but the level had decreased to the control level by 5 h following 4-aminopyridine injection. In the dentate fascia, immunostaining was highest at 1 h and then decreased slowly until 5 h post-injection. The activated neuronal assemblies were analyzed with the aid of parvalbumin c-fos double immunostaining. These countings revealed the highest inhibitory interneuronal activation in every part of the hippocampus (including the dentate fascia) at 3 h post-injection. The results indicate that systemic 4-aminopyridine induces limbic seizures, which are probably initiated in the entorhinal cortex.
