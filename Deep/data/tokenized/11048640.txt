Electroconvulsive shock (ECS) has been suggested to affect cAMP signaling pathways to exert therapeutic effects. ECS was recently reported to increase the expression of PDE4 isoforms in rat brain, however, these studies were limited to PDE4 family in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Thus, for comprehensive understanding of how ECS regulates PDE activity, the present study was performed to determine whether chronic ECS treatment induces differential changes in the expression of all the PDE isoforms in rat brains. We analyzed the mRNA expression of PDE isoforms in the rat hippocampus and striatum using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We found chronic ECS treatment induced differential changes in the expression of PDE isoform 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 at the rat hippocampus and striatum. In the hippocampus, the expression of PDE1A/B (694%), PDE4A (158%), PDE4B (323 %), and PDE4D (181%) isoforms was increased from the controls, but the expression of PDE2 (62.8%) and PDE7 (37.8%) decreased by chronic ECS treatment. In the striatum, the expression of PDE1A/B (179%), PDE4A (223%), PDE4B (171%), and PDE4D (327%) was increased by chronic ECS treatment with the concomitant decrease in the expression of PDE2 (78.4%) and PDE3A (67.1%). In conclusion, chronic ECS treatment induces differential changes in the expression of most PDE isoforms including PDE1, PDE2, PDE3, PDE4, PDE5, and PDE7 in the rat hippocampus and striatum in an isoform- and brain region-specific manner. Such differential change is suggested to play an important role in regulation of the activity of PDE and cAMP system by ECS.
