Effects of nutritional status on the levels of tryptophan (Trp), serotonin (5HT), and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) in six brain regions of rats were investigated. 1) A low-protein high-carbohydrate diet decreased Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA levels in the cortex and hippocampus, and those of 5HT and 5HIAA in the hypothalamus. This diet did not affect the contents of Trp and 5HT in the midbrain, but decreased 5HIAA. No significant changes of Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA were observed in the pons and medulla and striatum. 2) A low-carbohydrate high-protein diet increased the levels of Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA in the striatum, and 5HT and 5HIAA in the cortex, but showed no effect on the contents of Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA in the hippocampus, midbrain, pons and medulla and hypothalamus. 3) An energy-restriction low-carbohydrate diet increased Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA contents in the striatum, and 5HT and 5HIAA in the cortex and pons and medulla. In the hypothalamus, only 5HIAA was increased by this diet. The diet did not influence Trp, 5HT and 5HIAA contents of the midbrain and hippocampus. These results suggest that i) lowered fat and carbohydrate intakes enhance 5HT synthesis and metabolism in the cortex and that lowered carbohydrate intake enhances them in the striatum, ii) energy restriction enhances the 5HT metabolism in the cortex, pons and medulla and hypothalamus, and 5HT synthesis in the cortex and pons and medulla, iii) lowered protein intake inhibits 5HT metabolism in the cortex, midbrain, hippocampus and hypothalamus, and 5HT synthesis in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus.
