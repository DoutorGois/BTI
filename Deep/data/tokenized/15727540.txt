Models of hippocampal function have proposed different functions for hippocampal regions CA3 and CA1, commonly proposing that CA1 performs a match-mismatch comparison of memory retrieval with sensory input. The study by I. Lee, M. R. Hunsaker, and R. P. Kesner (2005) tested these models using selective lesions of hippocampal subregions (see record 2005-01705-014). Their data suggest that CA3 and the dentate gyrus play an important role in the process of detecting the mismatch when a familiar object is placed in a new spatial location. Lesions of the dentate gyrus and CA3 strongly reduce the enhanced exploration associated with displaced objects, beyond the reduction caused by CA1 lesions. This supports the importance of convergent input to CA3 as well as CA1. Along with recent electrophysiological data, this provides a framework for more specifically modeling the role of CA3 and CA1 in matching sensory input with context-dependent retrieval for memory-guided behavior in different tasks.
