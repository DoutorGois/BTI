We have previously reported that neonatal isolation significantly enhanced the magnitude of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) recorded from freely moving male rats tested at 30 days of age. The present study extends this work to examine the effects of neonatal isolation on hippocampal LTP in male and female juvenile rats. Changes in dentate granule cell population measures, i.e., EPSP slope and population spike amplitude (PSA), evoked by tetanization of the medial perforant pathway were used to assess the effects of neonatal isolation on LTP over a period of 96 hrs. Prior to tetanization, significant sex differences were obtained for input/output (I/O) response measures of EPSP slope and PSA, with males showing consistently higher values than females. No significant effect of treatment was obtained within either sex for baseline measures. Following tetanization significant sex differences were also obtained for both measures, with males showing significantly greater enhancement than females. Comparisons made at 1 hr post-tetanization (establishment of LTP) indicated that isolated males showed significantly greater enhancement than any other group. On the other hand, treatment differences were not obtained from females. At 96 hrs (maintenance of LTP), however, both neonatally isolated males and females showed significantly greater enhancement than either non-isolated siblings or unhandled controls. These results indicate that males and females exhibit different enhancement profiles with respect to both the magnitude and duration of LTP, and that neonatal isolation alters these profiles in a sex-specific manner.
