Cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rat were disrupted in a specially designed tissue-press and prepared as a 2 percent suspension in 10 percent buffered Ficoll medium and fractionated by density-gradient centrifugation in the B XIV zonal rotor. The suspension was injected into a buffered 30 percent Ficoll, 58 percent sucrose discontinuous gradient previously loaded in the B XlV zonal rotor spinning at 3500 revolutions per minute. Intact neuronal perikarya were recovered as a discrete band in the dense sucrose zone of the gradient after centrifugation at 35,000 revolutions per minute for 45 minutes.
