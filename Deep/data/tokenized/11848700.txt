Hypocapnia induced by hyperventilation (HV) has powerful effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. We have studied the effect of hyperventilation on the phase-locked oscillatory components of the evoked responses in the human brain. We recorded visually evoked magnetoencephalographic responses before, during, and after voluntary hyperventilation to pattern-reversal checkerboard stimuli. Gamma-band (30-45 Hz) responses phase-locked to the stimuli were generated in the occipital visual cortex. A wavelet-based time-frequency analysis revealed that the gamma responses increased during HV whereas their frequency did not change significantly. A recent in vitro study in the rat hippocampus demonstrated that the stability of spontaneous gamma activity increases during hypocapnia as a result of enhanced GABAergic transmission. To test if a similar mechanism could account for our findings, we performed simulations on a network of 100 Hodgkin-Huxley neurons connected by inhibitory synapses. We found that enhanced GABA(A) transmission, paired with enhanced excitability, can explain the increase in evoked gamma activity without changing the frequency.
