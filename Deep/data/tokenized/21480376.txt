BACKGROUND: The ratio of high amyloid-beta peptide40 (Abeta40) and low Abeta42 in plasma predicts the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with episodic recall in depression. We thus examined the relationship between plasma Abeta levels and brain volumes. METHODS: Homebound elders (N = 352) who had undergone brain MRI were used. Plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were measured by ELISA. Volumes of medial temporal regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus, were manually measured. RESULTS: Amygdala volume was associated with log(10) of plasma Abeta1-42 (beta = +0.19, SE = 0.07, p = 0.005) after adjusting for AD, infarcts, white matter hyperintensities and demographics. In the absence of dementia, decreasing quartiles of plasma Abeta1-42 (Mean + SD ml: Q4 = 4.1 +/- 0.8; Q3 = 3.9 +/- 0.7; Q2 = 3.6 +/- 0.8 and Q1 = 3.7 +/- 0.8, p = 0.01) and increasing quartiles of plasma Abeta1-40/1-42 ratio were associated with smaller amygdala volume. Those depressed subjects with a high plasma Abeta1-40/1-42 ratio had smaller amygdala (Mean + SD ml: 3.3 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.8, p = 0.04) and total brain volume (Mean + SD liter: 0.95 +/- 0.07 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.12, p = 0.005), and had a higher rate of MCI (67 vs. 36%, p = 0.02) than those with a low plasma Abeta1-40/1-42 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low plasma Abeta1-42 concentration and atrophy of the medial temporal lobe structures, which regulates mood and cognition, may represent a biomarker for a prodromal stage of AD.
