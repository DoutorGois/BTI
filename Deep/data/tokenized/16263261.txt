The study of population dynamics in hippocampal place cells has emerged as one of the most powerful tools for understanding the encoding, storage and retrieval of declarative memory. Recent work has laid out the contours of an attractor-based hippocampal population code for memory in recurrent circuits of the hippocampus. The code is based on inputs from a topographically organized, path-integration-dependent spatial map that lies upstream in the medial entorhinal cortex. The recurrent networks of the hippocampal formation enable these spatial inputs to be synthesized with nonspatial event-related information.
