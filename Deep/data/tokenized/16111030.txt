OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of prenatal methylmercury exposure on learning and memory ability of mice and ultrastructure of hippocampus neurons in mice. METHODS: Methylmercury in doses of 0 and 4mg/(kg x d) were fed to pregnant mice at 7th-9th day after conception. Learning and memory ability of the mice offspring was detected. The ultrastructure of hippocampus neurons was observed by electron microscope after the completion of the experiment. RESULTS: The learning and memory ability of the mice offspring of 4 mg/(kg x d) dose group was lower than those of 0 mg/(kg x d) dose group (P < 0.05). Changes in the ultrastructure of hippocampus neurons were obvious in 4 mg/(kg x d) dose group as compared with the 0 mg/(kg x d) dose group. CONCLUSION: Methylmercury could affect the growth and development of central nerve system. The learning and memory ability of mice offspring was greatly damaged and the ultrastructure of hippocampus neurons was changed by methylmercury.
