Glucocorticoids are secreted from the adrenal gland in very high amounts after stress. In the brain, these stress hormones potently modulate ionic currents, monoaminergic transmission, synaptic plasticity and cellular viability, most notably in the hippocampus where corticosteroid receptors are highly enriched. Here we show that at least some of these actions require DNA binding of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) homodimers.
