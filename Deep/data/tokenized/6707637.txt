The rate of removal of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in nine rat brain areas (striatum, nucleus accumbens, tuberculum olfactorium, hypothalamus, lateral hippocampus, occipital cortex, brain stem, cerebellum, and retina) was calculated from its exponential decline after monoamine oxidase inhibition by pargyline. The experiments were carried out with rats pretreated with either saline or haloperidol. It appeared that the efficiency with which DOPAC was removed from the brain (expressed by the fractional rate constant k) varied considerably throughout the brain. Haloperidol dramatically decreased the k values, and in addition these effects differed widely in the various brain areas. Similarly to DOPAC, haloperidol had a pronounced retarding effect on the efflux of homovanillic acid (HVA) from the brain. These findings strongly suggest that great care should be taken when drug-induced alterations in DOPAC and HVA concentrations are interpreted as changes in dopaminergic activity. The dopamine (DA) concentrations were measured in the same experiments, but it appeared that the pargyline-induced rise in DA was of limited use for the estimation of the synthesis rate of the amine. We calculated the rate of catecholamine synthesis in the nine brain areas from the rise of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) during decarboxylase inhibition. In saline- as well as in haloperidol-pretreated rats it was found that the total catecholamine synthesis rate in the typical dopaminergic areas (striatum, nucleus accumbens, and tuberculum olfactorium) was of the same order of magnitude as the DOPAC rate of removal. This confirms that DOPAC formation is quantitatively the main route of degradation in these brain areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
