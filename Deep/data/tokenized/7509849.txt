Antibodies to different phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tau epitopes have been used to identify three histologically distinct types of neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. Intracellular tangles (Type 1) were identified by antibodies recognizing epitopes throughout the tau molecule, including the NH2-terminus. Compact extracellular tangles (Type 2) were characterized by the loss of NH2-terminal immunoreactivity and retention of other tau epitopes. Dispersed extracellular tangles (Type 3) were characterized by the presence of epitopes associated with the microtubule binding region and the COOH-terminus. These three types of tangles, found in situ in hippocampus, could be created experimentally by proteolytic treatment of brain sections. These findings suggest that three stages of neurofibrillary degeneration can be understood as a sequential stripping of paired helical filaments in which the loss of amino-terminus epitopes, followed by loss of phosphorylated epitopes, results in the appearance of dispersed extracellular tangles containing PHF-core epitopes.
