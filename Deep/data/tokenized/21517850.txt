Calcineurin is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase that regulates neurotransmission, neuronal structure and plasticity, and neuronal excitability in mood disorders, including depression. Increasing evidence has suggested that calcineurin is involved in the regulation of depressive-like behavior. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the mood-regulating effects of calcineurin. We investigated the potential mechanism by which calcineurin mediates the development of depressive-like behavior and the involvement of calcineurin in the action of antidepressant medication in the chronic mild stress (CMS) model. The results showed that rats exposed to CMS had decreased calcineurin activity, measured by increased phospho-synapsin I S62/67 (pSynapsin) and decreased calcineurin-Aalpha levels, specifically in the CA3 but not CA1 or dentate gyrus (DG) subfields of the hippocampus. Calcineurin inhibition in the CA3 but not DG by microinfusion of cyclosporine-A (2 mug) induced depressive-like behavior in normal rats and exacerbated depressive-like performance in CMS-treated rats. Additionally, calcineurin inhibition in the CA3 but not DG reversed the antidepressant-like activity of venlafaxine. Calcineurin inhibition in the CA3 also reduced metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor (mGluR2/3) expression levels. mGluR2/3 activation by its agonist LY354740 (100 ng) in the CA3 reversed the depressive-like behavior induced by cyclosporine-A administration. Finally, chronic venlafaxine (40 mg/kg) treatment increased calcineurin activity, reflected by decreased pSynapsin and increased calcineurin-Aalpha protein levels in the CA3 but not CA1 or DG. These findings indicate that CA3 calcineurin signaling probably mediated through mGluR2/3 participates in the development of depression and the behavioral responses to antidepressant treatment.
