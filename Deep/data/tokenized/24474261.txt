PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess imaging and pathologic characteristics of limbic tumors. Our hypothesis was that temporal lobe limbic tumors have distinctive features from extralimbic tumors. METHODS: This retrospective radiologic-pathologic correlation study of primary temporal lobe tumors (excluding glioblastoma) distinguished limbic from extralimbic tumors based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Limbic tumors were categorized according to Yasargil's classification into (1) mediobasal temporal (mbT), (2) insular-temporo-opercular (I-TO), and (3) fronto-orbital-insular-temporopolar (FO-I-TP). RESULTS: A total of 50 cases with a mean age at diagnosis of 38 +/- 19.9 years (14 women, 36 men) were included. Pathologic diagnoses were as follows: 20 anaplastic astrocytomas, 11 gangliogliomas, 8 astrocytomas (World Health Organization grade II), 3 pilocytic astrocytomas, 2 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors, 2 oligodendrogliomas (grade II), 2 anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, 1 low-grade glioneuronal tumor, and 1 atypical extraventricular neurocytoma. In all, 36 tumors were limbic and displayed consistent growth patterns (16 mbT, 11 I-TO, 8 FO-I-TP, and 1 pantemporal) and 14 were extralimbic. There were no differences between limbic and extralimbic tumors with regard to age, sex, pathologic diagnosis, and presentation with seizures. mbT tumors had more frequent neuronal differentiation (50 %) than I-TO (0 %) and FO-I-TP (25 %) tumors (chi-square = 7.8, df = 2, p = 0.02). Neuronal differentiation correlated with lower grade (r = 0.52, p < 0.01) and younger age (r = 0.52, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Limbic tumors displayed consistent growth routes. mbT limbic tumors had more frequent neuronal differentiation, which may result from proximity to the neurogenic subgranular zone of the hippocampus. Neuronal differentiation was maximal in mbT and lowest in I-TO and FO-I-TP tumors and correlated with lower tumor grade and younger age at diagnosis.
