A cellular biochemistry analysis system was integrated on a quartz glass microchip with a microchamber for cell culture followed by a microchannel for detecting with a thermal lens microscope (TLM). Nerve cells from rat hippocampus were successfully cultured to form neural networks in the microchip. An aqueous solution of glutamate, which is known as a neurotransmitter, was introduced to stimulate the cultured neuron to release a retrograde messenger, arachidonate which is considered to be critical for neuronal plasticity, especially for long-term potentiation (LTP). After the introduction, the solution that flowed through the culture chamber was analyzed using the UV-TLM (excitation wavelength, 244 nm). The measured signal intensity was dependent on glutamate solution concentration, and the neurons were considered to release the retrograde messenger according to the glutamate concentration. This system is suitable for time-course monitoring of ultra trace amounts of chemicals released from very small amount of cultured cells.
