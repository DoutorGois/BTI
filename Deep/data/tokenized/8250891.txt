Pyramidal neurons of the hippocampal CA1 are known to be particularly vulnerable to transient ischemia resulting in "delayed neuronal death". Recent studies using aurintricarboxylic acid suggested that ischemia- or excitotoxin-induced neuronal death should share intracellular mechanisms in common with apoptosis. It is, however, unclear about involvement of endonucleases. Here using a transient (5 min) forebrain ischemia model in gerbils, we found that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation developed between 48 and 54 hr recirculations, accompanied with simultaneous or slightly preceding destruction of microtubule-associated protein 2. These results suggest that endonucleases, maybe activated by elevated intracellular Ca2+, play an important role in delayed neuronal death as well as in apoptosis.
