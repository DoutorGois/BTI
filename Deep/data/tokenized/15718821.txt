Nearly 80% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have some types of lesion identified by conventional 1.5 tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We performed high-field 3 T MRI in a 5-year-old patient with recurrent complex partial seizures who was diagnosed as having right temporal lobe epilepsy based on the results of single photon emission computed tomography and ictal video-electroencephalogram monitoring, because 1.5 T MRI failed to detect any abnormalities in the suspected region. High-field 3 T MRI revealed a small high-intensity lesion on fast spin-echo short inversion time inversion-recovery images of the hippocampus, possibly responsible for the seizures. This is the first report detecting a hippocampal lesion by 3 T MRI, which could not be found by conventional 1.5 T MRI.
