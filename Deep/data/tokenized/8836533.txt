The effects of hippocampal and lateral septum lesions were compared in rats tested in a water maze spatial memory task, and the effect of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) was examined. There was a significant interaction for lesion and CDP in the septal lesioned subjects, with the lesioned animals performing worse than control animals, and CDP improving the performance of lesioned animals. CDP had no effect on impaired performance in hippocampal lesioned animals.
