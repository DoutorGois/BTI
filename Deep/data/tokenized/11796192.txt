Stress induces neuronal atrophy and death especially in the hippocampus. Alterations in the expression of neurotrophic factors are implicated in stress-induced hippocampal degeneration. In the hippocampus, stress decreases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels. In oriental medicine, acupuncture has long been employed as a treatment of numerous disorders. The objective of this study was to examine whether electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation can influence BDNF expression in the hippocampus of rats exposed to immobilization stress. Rats were immobilized in plastic bags, and then subjected to EA at ST36 Zusanli. After treatment, the animals were decapitated and the hippocampi were rapidly removed and processed for RNA isolation and reverse transcription. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that EA stimulation significantly restored BDNF mRNA expression declined by immobilization stress. The results suggest that EA may relieve neuropathological effects of stress by modulating neurotrophic factor expression.
