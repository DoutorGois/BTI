To observe the effects of different acupuncture manipulations on blood pressure and target organ damage in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), this study used the reinforcing twirling method (1.5-2-mm depth; rotating needle clockwise for 360 degrees and then counter clockwise for 360 degrees , with the thumb moving heavily forward and gently backward, 60 times per minute for 1 minute, and retaining needle for 9 minutes), the reducing twirling method (1.5-2-mm depth; rotating needle counter clockwise for 360 degrees and then clockwise for 360 degrees , with the thumb moving heavily backward and gently forward, 60 times per minute for 1 minute, and retaining needle for 9 minutes), and the needle retaining method (1.5-2-mm depth and retaining the needle for 10 minutes). Bilateral Taichong (LR3) was treated by acupuncture using different manipulations and manual stimulation. Reinforcing twirling, reducing twirling, and needle retaining resulted in a decreased number of apoptotic cells, reduced Bax mRNA and protein expression, and an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in the hippocampus compared with the SHR group. Among these groups, the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio was highest in the reducing twirling group, and the Bcl-2/Bax mRNA ratio was highest in the needle retaining group. These results suggest that reinforcing twirling, reducing twirling, and needle retaining methods all improve blood pressure and prevent target organ damage by increasing the hippocampal Bcl-2/Bax ratio and inhibiting cell apoptosis in the hippocampus in SHR.
