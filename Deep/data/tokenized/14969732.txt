In the present study, the P(2)X(7) receptor expression in the gerbil hippocampus and GABA-mediated responses of its expression was investigated in order to identify the roles of the P(2)X(7) receptor on seizure activity and recovery mechanisms. P(2)X(7) receptor immunoreactivity in seizure-resistant (SR) gerbils was similar to that in pre-seizure group of seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbils. The administration of baclofen, a GABA(B) receptor agonist, P(2)X(7) receptor immunoreactivity was decreased in the mossy fiber, compared with that of non-treated gerbils, whereas treatment with phaclofen, a GABA(B) receptor antagonist, elevated P(2)X(7) receptor expression. Neither the treatments with GABA(A) receptor agonist nor antagonist affected P(2)X(7) receptor expression in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that altered P(2)X(7) receptor expression may not be involved in the epileptogenesis or seizure activity in gerbils, and presynaptic GABA(B) receptor-mediated actions may be closely related with the regulation of P(2)X(7) receptor expression in the gerbil hippocampus.
