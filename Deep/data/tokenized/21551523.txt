Male rats received bilateral frontal cortex contusions and were injected with 100 mg/kg of EGb 761 or an equal volume of vehicle beginning 5 min after injury and then with 1 injection/day for 7 days. The rats were tested for spontaneous motor behavior on days 1, 5, 10, and 15 postinjury and then for 10 days of spatial navigation performance in the Morris Water Maze (MWM), beginning on the day 8 after the contusion. Brain tissue was removed for examination on the 18th day after injury. Contused rats given EGb 761 performed more like intact rats on measures of spontaneous motor activity while vehicle-treated counterparts remained more active than either shams or EGb 761-treated animals by the conclusion of testing. Contusion-only rats were worse than shams on spatial performance, while those given EGb 761 were less impaired. Histological analyses indicated that EGb 761 failed to prevent loss of tissue at the primary site of impact. However, the extract reduced retrograde degeneration of neurons, gliosis in the thalamus, and ex vacuo hydrocephalus. EGb 761 treatment also decreased the loss of ChAT-positive neurons in the dorsomedial caudate-putamen and in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). The results of this study indicate that EGb 761 could be a possible treatment for traumatic brain injury.
