Methotrexate (MTX) is a cytostatic agent widely used in combination with other agents as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and is associated with cognitive impairment as a long-term side effect in some cancer patients. This paper aimed to identify a neurobiological mechanism possibly responsible for this cognitive impairment using an animal model. The first study explored the hypothesis that MTX reduces neuronal cell proliferation. A dose-dependent long-lasting decrease in hippocampal cell proliferation was shown with Ki-67 immunocytochemistry, following a single intravenous injection of MTX (37.5-300 mg/kg). Animals treated with MTX also showed a dose-dependent transient decrease in body weight gain. In the second study, the effect of MTX (250 mg/kg) on two spatial learning tasks was examined. Animals treated with MTX learned the Morris water maze task adequately; however, these animals showed a longer latency time to cross the platform location in the probe trial, reflecting an impairment of spatial memory function. In the novel object recognition task, animals treated with MTX failed to distinguish a novel object from a familiar one, indicating a decrease in the comparator function of the hippocampus. Our studies indicated that, in the rat, MTX has a dose-dependent negative effect on hippocampal cell proliferation, and on cognitive behavior. These findings suggest that adverse effects of certain cytotoxic agents on hippocampal cell proliferation may have a potential contributory role in cognitive impairment observed in humans after chemotherapy.
