The effects of acute and subchronic administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) on [3H][3-methyl-histidyl2]thyrotropin-releasing hormone binding to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors in membrane preparations from various regions of rat brain were examined. Acute administration of CDZ (50 mg/kg x 3 within 24 h) did not alter either the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) or the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) in cerebellum (CB), olfactory bulbs (OB), frontal cortex (Cx), hypothalamus (HT) or corpus striatum (ST). However, the Kds of the pyriform cortex/amygdala (PC/A) (Kd = 3.6 +/- 0.1 nM compared to 1.9 +/- 0.1 nM in the control group; p less than 0.01) and the hippocampus (HP) (Kd = 7.8 +/- 0.7 nM compared to 2.1 +/- 0.1 nM in the control group; p less than 0.01) were increased. There were no changes in Bmax. Subchronic administration of CDZ (50 mg/kg/day for 7 days) increased the Kd of the PC/A complex (p less than 0.05), the OB (p less than 0.05) and the HP (p less than 0.01) without altering in Bmax. These results, showing regional differences in the response of TRH receptors to acute and subchronic CDZ administration, suggest that reduced affinity of TRH receptors in the PC/A complex, OB and HP may be related to some of the neurobiological actions of CDZ and/or its metabolites.
