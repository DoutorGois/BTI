The ultrastructure of hippocampal neurons in mice subjected to heat treatment for 40 min at 42 degrees C was studied. Such a treatment has been shown to result in significant changes in the structure of pyramidal neurons. An increased chromatin condensation in the nuclei was found in addition to deep invagination of their envelopes and reduction or fragmentation of the reticulum cisterns. These changes were accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and increased number of clathrine vesicles around the Golgi complex. The heat exposure followed by feeding on vitamins and beta-carotin appeared to diminish chromatin condensation and kept the cisterns invariable.
