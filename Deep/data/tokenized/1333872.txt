One week after complete destruction of the mediobasal hypothalamus, immunoreactive adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and beta-endorphin levels were determined in cerebrospinal fluid, trunk blood, as well as in brain and pituitary tissue samples collected from anaesthetized and cisternally cannulated rats. Control rats were sham operated. In lesioned rats we observed: (a) 60% decrease in the immunoreactive beta-endorphin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, (b) decreased immunoreactive ACTH and beta-endorphin levels in the hypothalamus, in the thalamus and in the amygdala, (c) unaffected immunoreactive ACTH/beta-endorphin levels in the septum and in the hippocampus, (d) decreased immunoreactive beta-endorphin levels both in the anterior and neurointermediate pituitary but unchanged immunoreactive ACTH contents in the anterior lobe, and (e) unaffected immunoreactive ACTH and beta-endorphin levels in the plasma under stressful conditions. From these findings the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) more than 50% of the beta-endorphin-like peptide content of the cerebrospinal fluid originates from the periventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and thalamus in the rat; (2) the loss of the hypothalamic control probably enhances the intracellular proteolytic degradation of beta-endorphin both in the anterior and neurointermediate pituitary lobe; (3) rats with mediobasal hypothalamic lesion cannot react to the stressful stimuli of ether anaesthesia or cisternal cannulation with elevated plasma immunoreactive ACTH and beta-endorphin levels.
