Aging impairs multiple memory systems. The neurochemical substrates of normal memory differ between memory systems. In this issue of Neuron, Ramos et al. find that activation of protein kinase A, which has been reported to improve hippocampal-dependent spatial memory in aged animals, has the opposite effect on prefrontal cortex-dependent working memory in aged animals.
