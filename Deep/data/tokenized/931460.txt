Experiments were conducted to determine the effects of propranolol administration in rats lesioned in the hippocampal area. Chronic oral administration of propranolol to intact rats produced a significant decrease in mean systolic blood pressure. No significant changes in blood pressure were produced with propranolol treatment in rats lesioned in the septal or anterior hypothalamic areas, whereas, in rats lesioned in the hippocampal area, a significant elevation of blood pressure was observed. These findings confirm previous results that suggest that the hypotensive effects observed with chronic propranolol administration are mediated via the hippocampus.
