The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of long-term pinealectomy on serotonin metabolism in the amygdala and the hippocampus of male rats. Pinealectomy did not significantly alter either tryptophan or serotonin concentrations in the amygdala or the hippocampus. However, statistically significant decreases in 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid levels and tryptophan hydroxylase activity were found in the amygdala. Monoamine oxidase activity was unchanged in both regions. These results support the involvement of the amygdaloid serotoninergic system in mediating the functions of the pineal gland.
