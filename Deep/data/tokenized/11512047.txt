RATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, "ecstasy") administration produces neurotoxic degeneration of 5-HT nerve endings in several regions of rat brain. Administration of the GABAmimetic drug clomethiazole protects against this damage. OBJECTIVE: We wished to see whether the enantiomers of AR-A008055 (1-4-methyl-5-thiazolyl-1-phenyl-methylamine), a compound structurally related to clomethiazole, were also neuroprotective against MDMA-induced degeneration. METHODS: (R)-(+)-AR-A008055 or (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 (100 mg/kg IP) was injected 5 min prior to and 55 min after MDMA (15 mg/kg IP) administration to Dark Agouti rats. Rectal temperature was measured during this time and the concentration of 5-HT and 5-HIAA measured in hippocampus, cortex and striatum 7 days later. [3H]-Paroxetine binding was also measured in cortex. RESULTS: Both enantiomers abolished the acute MDMA-induced hyperthermia and attenuated the subsequent neurotoxic loss of 5-HT, 5-HIAA and [3H]-paroxetine binding. When rats given the enantiomer plus MDMA were warmed to keep their rectal temperature elevated to near that of animals given only MDMA, the neuroprotective effect of (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 was still seen, while the effect of (R)-(+)-AR-A008055 was abolished. Protection was also seen when (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 (50 mg/kg) was given, a dose which produced only a modest attenuation of MDMA-induced hyperthermia. CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggest that a major proportion of the neuroprotective action of (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 did not involve an attenuating effect on MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The protection afforded by (R)-(+)-AR-A008055, which is not a GABA agonist, appears to be solely due to its action on body temperature, strengthening the contention that abolishing the acute MDMA-induced hypothermia can produce neuroprotection. Since (S)-(-)-AR-A008055 has a similar pharmacology to clomethiazole, these data suggest that drugs which increase GABAA receptor channel opening are neuroprotective against MDMA-induced damage.
