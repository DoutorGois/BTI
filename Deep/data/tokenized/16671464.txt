A stable model of neuronal damage after ischemia is needed in mice to enable progression of transgenic strategies. We performed transient global ischemia induced by common carotid artery occlusions with and without maintaining normal rectal temperature (Trec) in order to determine the importance of body temperature control during ischemia. We measured brain temperature (Tb) during ischemia/reperfusion. Mice with normothermia (Trec within +/- 1 degrees C) had increased mortality and neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of hippocampus, which did not occur in hypothermic animals. If the Trec was kept within +/- 1 degrees C, the Tb decreased during ischemia. After reperfusion, Tb in the normothermia group developed hyperthermia, which reached > 40 degrees C and was > 2 degrees C higher than Trec. We suggest that tightly controlled normothermia and prevention of hypothermia (Trec) during ischemia are important factors in the development of a stable neuronal damage model in mice.
