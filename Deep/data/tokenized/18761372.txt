Functional studies in neurons often require controllable simultaneous delivery of different molecules to individual cells within networks. Microinjection represents a suitable and alternative method to deliver cDNAs, oligonucleotides, siRNAs, peptides or antibodies for expression, expression knockdown or loss-of-function studies, respectively. Moreover, molecules can be systematically applied to individual neurons in a controlled manner without affecting neighbouring cells. Establishment of microinjection is often complicated and time consuming. Here we describe a simple and reliable protocol for molecular cell biologists to establish injection of various molecules (ng to microg range) to living neurons in a reasonable period of time.
