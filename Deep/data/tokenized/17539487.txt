Many genes are likely involved in the control of iron metabolism in brain and in peripheral tissues, and genetically-defined murine strains present the opportunity to investigate genetic variations in iron metabolism. Weanling C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2 (D2) mice were divided into two treatment groups receiving distilled water with or without 5000 ppm ferric chloride ad libitum as their sole fluid source for 100 days. Iron overload increased liver, spleen and plasma iron levels in male and female B6 and female D2 mice. In D2 males, liver iron was increased relative to control, but spleen and plasma iron remained unaffected. Brain iron content was not different between control and iron-treated mice in ventral midbrain, caudate, pons or hippocampus, but D2 iron overloaded mice displayed lower iron levels in nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. We conclude that genetic background influences the accumulation of excess iron in the periphery and iron regulation in the central nervous system.
