Immunofluorescence double-labelling and immunoenzyme double-staining methods were used to examine the location of glycogen phosphorylase brain isozyme with the astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S-100 protein in formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded slices from adult rat brain. Astrocytes in the cerebellum and the hippocampus, which express GFAP or S-100 protein immunoreactivity, show glycogen phosphorylase immunoreactivity. Regional intensity and intracellular distribution of the three antigens vary characteristically. In ependymal cells, glycogen phosphorylase immunoreactivity is co-localized with S-100 protein immunoreactivity, but not with GFAP immunoreactivity. These findings confirm that glycogen phosphorylase in the rat brain is exclusively localized in astrocytes and ependymal cells. All astrocytes, as far as they express GFAP or S-100 protein, do contain glycogen phosphorylase.
