This article investigates the long-term effects of soybean isoflavones (ISO) on the changes of calbindin D-28k (CB) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus in middle-aged ovariectomized female rats as well as middle-aged control female and male rats to identify any correlation between calcium and phytoestrogens. In the CA1 region, CB immunoreactivity in the ovariectomized females was similar to that of the control females, whereas CB immunoreactivity in the males was significantly lower than that of the control females. In the dentate gyrus, CB immunoreactivity in the ovariectomized females and males was significantly lower than that of the control females. CB immunoreactivity in all groups was increased dose-dependently after ISO treatment in the CA1 region and dentate gyrus. This result suggests that ISO treatment enhances the expression of CB immunoreactivity in the hippocampus in the middle-aged rats.
