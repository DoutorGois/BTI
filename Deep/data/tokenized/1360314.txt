We assessed the effect of a broad spectrum glutamatergic receptor antagonist, kynurenic acid (500 mg/kg) on ischemia-induced hippocampal glutamate release and neuronal damage. Kynurenic acid significantly decreased glutamate release during ischemia but had no effect on the hippocampal lesion. Some protection was observed in the cortex and in the striatum. These data suggested that the extracellular accumulation of glutamate during forebrain ischemia does not play a major role in the hippocampus.
