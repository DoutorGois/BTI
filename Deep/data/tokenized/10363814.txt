Induction of long-term potentiation within the hippocampal formation can be modulated by afferent influences from a number of subcortical structures known to be involved in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. This study performed on freely moving rats investigated the effects of stimulation of the noradrenergic locus coeruleus nucleus and the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus on spontaneously decaying posttetanic long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus and the hippocampal CA1 area, respectively. High-frequency electrical stimulation of the locus coeruleus or the dorsal raphe elicited a well-expressed behavioural reaction of exploratory or defensive type, respectively, but did not significantly alter transmission at perforant path-dentate gyrus or Schaffer collateral-CA synapses, when delivered either before tetanic stimulation of the perforant path or the Schaffer collaterals or long (hours and days) after previously induced long-term potentiation had completely decayed. However, when locus coeruleus or dorsal raphe stimulation was delivered with the same parameters during a limited time (minutes and hours) after marked or even complete decay of tetanus-induced long-term potentiation at perforant path-dentate gyrus or Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses, the potentiation was partially or entirely restored but never increased beyond the initial level of potentiation. In CA1, stimulation of ipsilateral and contralateral Schaffer collaterals demonstrated that the restoration of previously existing long-term potentiation by dorsal raphe stimulation was input-specific, occurring, like tetanus-induced potentiation, only in the pathway which had previously been tetanized. These findings suggest that the noradrenergic locus coeruleus and the serotonergic dorsal raphe can influence not only induction, but also spontaneous decay of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation. Since hippocampal long-term potentiation is thought to play a role in certain kinds of learning and memory, and association of tetanic stimulation with activation of ascending neuromodulatory systems is required for full expression of long-term potentiation, the restoration of hippocampal long-term potentiation by activation of a neuromodulatory system alone may serve as a mechanism of associative reminder which may underlie facilitation of memory retrieval after a period of forgetting, as has been observed in trained rats under similar conditions.
