Extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the hippocampus were measured by the microdialysis method in freely moving young (3-4 months old) and old (18-24 months old) female rats over a period of 24 h to examine the effect of aging on hippocampal ACh release. Hippocampal ACh release during a 24-h period exhibited a diurnal variation with higher levels during the dark cycle than during the light cycle in old rats as well as young rats. The present study suggests that a diurnal variation in ACh release is maintained fairly well until the rats are at least 24 months old.
