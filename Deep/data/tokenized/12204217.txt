The follitropin receptor knockout (FORKO) mouse undergoes ovarian failure, thereby providing an animal model to investigate the consequences of the depletion of circulating estrogen in females. The estrogen deficiency causes marked defects in the female reproductive system, obesity, and skeletal abnormalities. In light of estrogen's known pleiotropic effects in the nervous system, our study examined the effects of genetically induced estrogen-testosterone imbalance on this system in female FORKO mice. Circulating concentrations of 17-beta-estradiol (E2) in FORKO mice are significantly decreased (FORKO -/-: 1.13+/-0.34 pg/ml; wild-type +/+: 17.6+/-3.5 pg/ml, P<0.0001, n=32-41); in contrast, testosterone levels are increased (-/-: 37.7+/-2.3 pg/ml; wild-type +/+: 3.9+/-1.7 pg/ml, P<0.005, n=25-33). The focus was on the activities of key enzymes in the central cholinergic and peripheral nervous systems, on dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) capacity for neurite outgrowth, and on the phosphorylation state of structural neurofilament (NF) proteins. Choline acetyltransferase activity was decreased in several central cholinergic structures (striatum 50+/-3%, hippocampus 24+/-2%, cortex 12+/-3%) and in DRGs (11+/-6%). Moreover, we observed aberrations in the enzymatic activities of mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase) in the hippocampus, DRGs, and sciatic nerves. Hippocampal and sensory ganglia samples from FORKO mice contained hyper-phosphorylated NFs. Finally, explanted ganglia of FORKO mice displayed decreased neurite outgrowth (20-50%) under non-treated conditions and when treated with E2 (10 nM). Our results demonstrate that genetic depletion of circulating estrogen leads to biochemical and morphological changes in central and peripheral neurons, and underlie the importance of estrogen in the normal development and functioning of the nervous system. In particular, the findings suggest that an early and persisting absence of the steroid leads to neurodegenerative changes and identify several key enzymes that may contribute to the process. This model provides a system to explore the consequences of circulating estrogen deprivation and other hormonal imbalances in the nervous system.
