AIM: Diabetes mellitus-associated hyperglycemia and oxidative stress have been shown to have detrimental effects on the brain and may lead to impairment of cognitive functions. Resveratrol (Rsv), a polyphenolic antioxidant, has been shown to have moderate hypoglycemic and prominent hypolipidemic effects in diabetic rats. In the present study, we examined if Rsv improves the diabetic encephalopathy and explored its possible underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Male SD rats were treated with streptozotocin (65 mg/kg), and the diabetic rats were orally fed with Rsv (0.75 mg/kg, every 8 h) or normal saline for 4 weeks. Animals were then sacrificed and the brain tissues (hippocampus) processed for biochemical and histological studies. RESULTS: Neurodegeneration and astrocytic activation were noted in the hippocampus of the diabetic rats. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6 transcripts and nuclear factor-kappaB expression were increased in the brain. In addition, neuropathic alterations in the hippocampus were evident in diabetic rats, including increased blood vessel permeability and VEGF expression, decreased mitochondrial number and AMP-activated protein kinase activity. In Rsv-treated diabetic rats, the aforementioned abnormalities were all attenuated. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that Rsv significantly attenuated neurodegeneration and astrocytic activation in the hippocampus of diabetic rats. Our results suggested that Rsv could potentially be a new therapeutic agent for diabetic encephalopathy and neurodegeneration.
