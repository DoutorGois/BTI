OBJECTIVES: To analyze the value of ictal EEG recordings in patients with unilateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-identified hippocampal atrophy and concordant interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The ictal EEG patterns in 84 patients with pharmaco resistant epilepsy undergoing an anterior temporal lobectomy between 1992 and 1995 were reviewed. The concordance between the ictal EEG and MRI and the IEDs was examined. RESULTS: Two-hundred-and-thirty seizures (76.4%) were concordant and 11 seizures (3.7%) were discordant with the atrophic temporal lobe. Sixty seizures (19.9%) were indeterminate in localization. Sixty-three of the 69 patients (91.3%) with confirmatory and 14 of the 15 patients (93%) with non-confirmatory ictal EEG recordings, respectively, experienced an excellent operative outcome (P=0.629, Fisher's exact test). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with unilateral hippocampal atrophy and concordant IEDs are excellent surgical candidates even when video-EEG monitoring shows discordant or non-localizing seizures.
