The Interpedundular nucleus (IPN) is a small midbrain structure located deeply between the two cerebral peduncles. The strategic placement of this nucleus makes it a possible relay between structures involved in the modulation of hippocampal theta rhythm activity. In this study we aimed to investigate how reversible inactivation of IPN could affect the acquisition, consolidation and retrieval phases of memory in passive avoidance (PA) and Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. To support our data, molecular studies were performed in order to detect possible changes in the expression of proteins related to learning and memory in the hippocampus. To address this issue rats' IPN was reversibly inactivated by microinjection of lidocaine hydrochloride (4%). After the behavioral studies, the phosphorylation of CREB and P70, and c-fos expression levels in the hippocampus were determined using western blotting and immunohistochemistry respectively. Our results in the PA and MWM tasks showed that IPN reversible inactivation could impair immediate post training consolidation and retrieval while it had no effect on the acquisition phase. In addition, there was a deficit in the retention of the MWM working memory. Our data showed the ratio of pCREB/CREB, pP70/P70 and c-fos expression in the hippocampus significantly decreased after IPN reversible inactivation. Collectively, the results show that behaviorally defined changes could be due to what happens molecularly in the hippocampus after IPN reversible inactivation. It is concluded that IPN not only makes part of a network involved in the modulation of hippocampal theta rhythm activity, but also is actively engaged in hippocampal memory formation.
