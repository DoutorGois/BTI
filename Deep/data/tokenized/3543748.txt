N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) was detected immunohistochemically in the rat brain using an antiserum which recognizes carbodiimide-fixed NAAG. NAAG-like immunoreactivity is described in 5 areas of the brain; olfactory bulb, septal nuclear area, lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus and the entorhinal cortex/hippocampal formation. Mitral cells of the olfactory bulb and neurons concentrated in the medial septum were densely immunostained. A dense population of immunoreactive puncta was found in the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The LGN also contained immunoreactive neurons. The entorhinal cortex contained numerous immunoreactive cells in layers II-III while the hippocampus had few neurons that were NAAG-positive.
