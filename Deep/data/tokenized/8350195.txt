In order to elucidate the metabolic modifications induced in rat brain by low power He-Ne laser irradiation in vivo, the variations in the biogenic amine levels in cortex, striatum and hippocampus were studied. Noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) were evaluated by HPLC-EC on irradiated rats, untreated rats (controls) and rats which had undergone restraint stress (stressed). The results obtained on groups of four to eight rats assayed individually showed that irradiation caused a strong increase in 5-HT in striatum and hippocampus, a small but significant decrease in NA in cortex, and DA levels were not significantly affected. Restraint stress per se led to a considerable decrease in 5-HT and DA in striatum and hippocampus, but did not significantly alter the NA levels.
