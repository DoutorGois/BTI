MK-801 was found to be more potent than phencyclidine (PCP) as an inhibitor of N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced [3H]norepinephrine (NE) release and [3H]TCP binding in the hippocampus. On the other hand, MK-801 was slightly less potent than PCP to enhance kainate-stimulated [3H]NE release and to inhibit hippocampal [3H]NE uptake. Further, MK-801 was strikingly less potent than PCP as an inhibitor of striatal synaptosomal [3H]dopamine uptake. These data are discussed with reference to the therapeutic potential of MK-801.
