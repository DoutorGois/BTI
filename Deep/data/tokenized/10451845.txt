The spinal cord and hippocampal primary cultures were incubated with three neurotoxins (separately) known to impair the main components of the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton: 1) colchicine blocking the repolymerization of microtubules, 2) cytochalasin preventing elongation of actin filaments, and 3) beta, beta'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), causing disorganisation of neurofilaments. The distribution of surface membrane molecules on the surface of the neurons was evaluated in the ultrastructural study after treatment with the neurotoxins on the 5th, 12th, and 15th days in vitro (DIV). On the 12 DIV, the density of immunogold labelled neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) on IDPN-treated hippocampal neurons increased 1.45 times comparing to the controls. On the 5 DIV, the density of WGA (wheat germ agglutinin)-binding membrane glycoproteins increased 2.09 times on colchicine-treated neurons, and 3.98 times on cytochalasin-treated ones, whereas on the 12 DIV, the increase was 3.28 and 2.72 times, respectively, as compared to the control cultures of the same age. These data provide insights into the mechanisms of neurodegenerative changes in the nerve cells and into the relationship between the cytoskeletal elements and the surface molecules on the neuronal plasmatic membrane.
