Using the low-frequency kindling technique, we studied the effects of chronic MK-801 and chronic methamphetamine (MAP) administration on hippocampal kindling seizure development. In experiment 1, MK-801 (0.05, 0.1 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 2 h before each electrical stimulation until kindling developed into stage-3 seizure. In experiment 2, we started daily electrical stimulations two weeks after the last injection of chronic MAP administration (6 mg/kg/day, 14 days). The number of stimulating pulses required for the triggering of epileptic afterdischarge (pulse-number threshold, PNT) was used as an indicator of the seizure threshold. PNT, afterdischarge duration (ADD) and behavioral seizure stage (BSS) of each induced seizure in the initial stage of kindling; the kindling rates for stage 3 and stage 5 seizures; seizure parameters at the completion of kindling of the drug-treated groups were recorded and compared to the values of each saline-treated control group. Our result showed that MK-801 administration prior to each electrical stimulation selectively and significantly increased PNT in the initial stage of kindling without affecting other seizure parameters. Chronic pretreatment of MAP caused a selective and significant decrease of PNT of the first two stimulations in the kindling process. Taken together with the previous studies, these results suggest that long-term potentiation plays an important role in the development of the excitability of seizure focus but not of the induced seizure's propagation in the hippocampal kindling phenomenon. Clinically MK-801 seems to be a more efficacious drug in preventing the induction of seizures than in suppressing the acquired seizures.
