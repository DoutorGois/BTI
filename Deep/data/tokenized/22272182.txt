Present study is aimed to evaluate the ameliorative role of quercetin on PCBs-induced oxidative stress in hippocampus of Wistar rats. Group I rats received vehicle (corn oil) intraperitoneally (i.p); Group II received quercetin 50 mg/kg bwt/day (gavage); Group III received PCB 2 mg/kg bwt/day (i.p); Group IV received PCB (i.p) and simultaneously quercetin through gavage. After 30 days, rats were euthanized and hippocampus was dissected from each rat brain. Oxidative stress was assessed by determining the levels of H(2)O(2), LPO, Pcc, and alteration in the functional markers such as CK, AchE, and ATPases activities in the hippocampus of control and experimental animals. A significant increase in the levels of stress markers and decrease in level of functional markers were observed in PCBs-treated rats. Moreover DNA fragmentation and histological studies were ascertained to confirm PCBs toxicity. In conclusion, quercetin shows a protective role against PCBs-induced oxidative damage in rat hippocampus.
