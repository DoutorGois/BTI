In agreement with existing notion, in a waking animal, novel information during learning transfers from the neocortex to the hippocampus where creates a transient trace in the form of a distributed pattern of modified synapses. During sleep, due to reactivation of neuronal populations initially activated by novel stimulus, this information flows back to the neocortex thus facilitating permanent memory trace consolidation. Information transfer between the neocortex and hippocampal formation is realized, in general, via the entorhinal cortex whose intrinsic connections basically permit "messages" from the exit of the hippocampal formation to return to its entrances. In waking and sleeping rats, we demonstrated a possibility of the return of the excitatory waves to hippocampal field CA1 and dentate gyrus via perforant path fibers that initially enter the CA1 via potentiated Schaffer collateral synapses. During sleep the returned excitatory waves were of maximal amplitude and with a high probability elicited a discharge of dentate neurons. Thus, a novel stimulus that potentiates synaptic connections during waking in the hippocampus and probably in the entorhinal cortex creates conditions for reactivation of corresponding neuronal populations in the hippocampus during sleep by excitatory waves returning via the entorhinal cortex.
