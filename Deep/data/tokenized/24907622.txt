Metals such as aluminum, iron, copper, and zinc have been implicated in the etiology of certain neurodegenerative disorders. On the other hand, it is well known that citric acid enhances Al absorption through the diet, while melatonin may bind such metals and decrease ROS production. In this study, we determined the concentrations of Al, Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn in various tissues of Tg2576 Al-treated mice. Female mice and wild type littermates were exposed to 1mg Al/g plus 3.2% of citric acid and melatonin 10mg/kg/day for 15months. At 18months of age, metal concentrations were measured in bone, liver, kidney and spleen, as well as in three brain regions. In the citric plus Al group, Al levels were higher in hippocampus than in cortex and cerebellum, while Al concentration in bone was higher than those in kidney, liver and spleen, The current results show that exposure to Al plus citric acid did not produce relevant changes in metal levels related with genotype. Moreover, co-administration of melatonin with Al did not modify significantly metal concentrations in tissues. The present results do not support that melatonin can diminish Al or Fe concentrations in various tissues.
