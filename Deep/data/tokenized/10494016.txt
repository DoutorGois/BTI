Changes in intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) in cultured hippocampal CA1 neurons isolated from newborn rats were measured by a confocal laser scanning microscope, using the Ca(2+) indicator Fluo-3. The results showed that exogenous adenosine (100 microM) significantly attenuated the increase of neuronal [Ca(2+)](i) induced by acute anoxia. This effect of adenosine could be suppressed by the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyltheophylline. Moreover, potassium channel blockers, aminopyridine, and glipizide could also block the inhibitory role of adenosine, but tetraethylammonium had no effect. These results suggest that adenosine may activate 4-AP or ATP-sensitive potassium channels via an A1-receptor-mediated mechanism and consequently inhibit anoxia-induced [Ca(2+)](i) elevation in hippocampal neurons.
