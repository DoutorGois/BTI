Recent characterization of brain and pituitary RNA metabolism is reviewed. Relative to other tissues, the brain transcribes more of the unique, single-copy DNA. This transcriptional diversity reflects the inherent heterogeneity in organization and development of the brain. The end product of transcriptional regulation in the brain is a population of functional cytoplasmic mRNAs with multiple components, differing in complexity and abundance. Analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA provides evidence that both brain-specific synthesis and processing may determine the final mRNA population. Both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated RNA classes contribute significantly to the total brain polysomal mRNA fraction. Characterizations of individual species of mRNA from both brain and pituitary are described. One possible transcriptional modulator in both the pituitary and brain is the presence of steroid hormone at responsive sites. Functional consequences of steroid accumulation within the brain may be (1) interactions with neurotransmitter, especially catecholamine, metabolism and function, (2) developmental interactions with neuronal systems, and (3) differentiation of glial cell function. The pleiotropic nature of steroid hormone effects (both transcriptional and non-transcriptional) within one brain region is considered by examining the biochemical effects of glucocorticoids in the hippocampus.
