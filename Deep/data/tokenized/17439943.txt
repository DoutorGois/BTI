Although neuronal functions depend on their robust polarity, the mechanisms that ensure generation and maintenance of only a single axon remain poorly understood. Using highly sensitive two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics, we identified here a novel protein, single axon-related (singar)1/KIAA0871/RPIPx/RUFY3, which contains a RUN domain and is predominantly expressed in the brain. Singar1 expression became up-regulated during polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons and remained at high levels thereafter. Singar1 was diffusely localized in hippocampal neurons and moderately accumulated in growth cones of minor processes and axons. Overexpression of singar1 did not affect normal neuronal polarization but suppressed the formation of surplus axons induced by excess levels of shootin1, a recently identified protein located upstream of phosphoinositide-3-kinase and involved in neuronal polarization. Conversely, reduction of the expression of singar1 and its splicing variant singar2 by RNA interference led to an increase in the population of neurons bearing surplus axons, in a phosphoinositide-3-kinase-dependent manner. Overexpression of singar2 did not suppress the formation of surplus axons induced by shootin1. We propose that singar1 ensures the robustness of neuronal polarity by suppressing formation of surplus axons.
