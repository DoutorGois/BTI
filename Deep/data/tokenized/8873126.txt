Recent studies have explored certain changes with aging of neurons containing neuropeptides. The extent of loss in aged central nervous system (CNS) of neuronal cells containing neuropeptide Y (NPY) has not yet been established with certainty, and available data is often contradictory. Changes of NPY-containing neurons with aging in the cerebral cortex of aged rat were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. A major loss of NPY-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the aged rat brain was observed in the retrosplenial cortex, frontal cortex area 1 and 2, parietal cortex area 1 and 2, occipital cortex area 1 and 2, temporal cortex area 3, cingulate cortex and the hippocampus proper. A loss of NPY-ir neurons was observed mostly in layers V and VI; in addition, the number and length of dendritic branches appeared to be decreased and shortened in the age group. These results indicate the involvement of NPY-ir neurons in the aging process of cerebral cortex, and provide the first morphological evidence for the loss of NPY neurons in the cerebral cortex of aged rats.
