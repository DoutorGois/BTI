The aim of this study was to evaluate the episodic-like memory (ELM) and the transcriptional regulation of the enzymes involved in hippocampal allopregnanolone synthesis in young adult and middle-aged male and female rats. Young adult males, but not middle-aged ones, showed a good performance in the ELM task. In contrast, neither young nor middle-aged females were able to discriminate the spatial order in which the objects were presented. In females, aging decreased the transcription of steroidogenic-related genes. In addition, the mRNA levels of 5alpha-reductase-1 were higher and the methylation of its promoter was lower in young adult females than in males, suggesting an epigenetic control. Further studies are needed to establish correlations between ELM and the transcriptional regulation of hippocampal steroidogenic enzymes. Our results contribute to the knowledge of sex differences in gene expression, methylation and memory during aging.
