D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist, is a well-known cognitive enhancer. To investigate the effect of DCS in cognitive function following toluene exposure, eight-week-old male C3H/HeN mice were exposed to filtered air (0 ppm) or 50 ppm toluene for 6 h a day on 5 consecutive days a week for 6 weeks. The day after the day of final exposure, a spatial learning task was performed using a Morris water maze apparatus. During the learning task, some mice were treated with DCS intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg) 30 min before the first trial of the acquisition phase and probe trial. After completion of the spatial learning task, the hippocampus was collected from each mouse to examine memory function-related gene expression using the real-time RT-PCR method. During the acquisition phase, on day 3 and 4, toluene-exposed mice with DCS treatment showed significantly better learning performance than corresponding saline treated groups. Moreover, the toluene-exposed mice with DCS treatment also showed significantly improved memory retention during the probe trial and up-regulation of hippocampal NMDA receptor subunit 2B mRNA expression compared with the saline treated groups. Our findings indicate that a subunit-specific modulation of hippocampal NMDA receptor mRNA expression by DCS contributes to improvement of spatial learning performance in mice following toluene exposure.
