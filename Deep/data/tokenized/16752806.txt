Possible influence of embryonic cerebellar graft transplanted into the adult neurodegenerative brain in Lurcher mutant mice on long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampus was investigated. Evaluation of LTP ability and comparison with the tests of motor learning suggests similarities between magnitude of LTP and criteria of motor learning. Also interstrain differences were described. Our results support ideas about tight cooperation among brain structures which are involved in mechanisms of learning and memory.
