A defining characteristic of the brain is its remarkable capacity to undergo activity-dependent functional and structural remodelling via mechanisms of plasticity that form the basis of our capacity to encode and retain memories. The prevailing model of how our brain stores new information about relationships between events or new abstract constructs suggests it resides in activity-driven modifications of synaptic strength and remodelling of neural networks brought about by cellular and molecular changes within the neurons activated during learning. To date, the idea that a form of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity known as long-term potentiation, or LTP, and the associated synaptic growth play a central role in the laying down of memories has received considerable support. Beyond this mechanism of plasticity at the synapse, adult neurogenesis, i.e. the birth and growth of new neurons, is another form of neural plasticity that occurs continuously in defined brain regions such as the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Here, based on work in the hippocampus, we review the processes and mechanisms of the generation and selection of new neurons in the adult brain and the accumulating evidence that supports the idea that this form of neural plasticity is essential to store and lead to retrievable hippocampal-dependent memories.
