The perforant path (PP) connects two key components of the medial temporal memory system, the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Entorhinal layer II projects densely to the outer portion of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA2 and CA3 of the hippocampus. This study for the first time reports that the PP terminal zone originated from entorhinal layer II extends from the stratum lacunosum-moleculare into the stratum radiatum in CA2 but not in CA3 in both human and nonhuman primates. This result indicates that CA2 probably receives additional innervation from the PP compared with CA3 and thus may play a unique role in hippocampal memory networks.
