Tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of population action potentials at 22 degrees C was investigated in area CA1 of hippocampal slices prepared from hibernating (HH) and warm-acclimated Turkish hamsters (WH) and rats. LTP elicited at this temperature was significantly stronger in HH slices compared to WH and rat slices. Hibernation-related improvement of the ability to develop long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission at low temperatures is interpreted as supporting hippocampal function during arousal from hibernation.
