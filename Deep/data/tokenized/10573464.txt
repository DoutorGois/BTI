Central pontine myelinolysis is a disorder of unknown etiology linked to overly aggressive correction of hyponatremia. In addition to the typical location of demyelination with preservation of neurons and axon cylinders in the basis pontis, similar lesions have been described in extrapontine locations. Central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis usually occur together, and are identified at autopsy rather than in life because symptoms of extrapontine myelinolysis are often masked in the critically ill patient. Central pontine myelinolysis is described in children, usually in the clinical setting of hyponatremic dehydration. Extrapontine myelinolysis has not been described in children previously. We report three children with severe hypernatremia and extrapontine myelinolysis involving various combinations of thalamus, basal ganglia, external and extreme capsules, and cerebellar vermis. All three had additional involvement of the hippocampus seen on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. None of the three had detectable pontine lesions. Clinical features of the three cases were dehydration in a 28-month-old girl, respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in a 14-month-old girl, and acute respiratory failure due to anaphylaxis after consumption of walnuts in a 3-year-old boy. Peak sodium values in each child were 195, 168, and 177 mmol/L, respectively; each received aggressive treatment for hypernatremia. We believe this to be the first report of extrapontine myelinolysis in children, the first report of extrapontine myelinolysis without central pontine myelinolysis in children, and the first report in children of hippocampal formation involvement. The pathogenesis of the central and extrapontine myelinolysis complex in children is more complicated than previously believed, and might differ significantly from that of adults.
