The goal of this study is to investigate the influence of white matter conductivity anisotropy on the electric field strength induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). We created an anatomically-realistic finite element human head model incorporating tissue heterogeneity and white matter conductivity anisotropy using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor MRI data. The electric field spatial distributions of three conventional ECT electrode placements (bilateral, bifrontal, and right unilateral) and an experimental electrode configuration, focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST), were computed. A quantitative comparison of the electric field strength was subsequently performed in specific brain regions of interest thought to be associated with side effects of ECT (e.g., hippocampus and in-sula). The results show that neglecting white matter conductivity anisotropy yields a difference up to 19%, 25% and 34% in electric field strength in the whole brain, hippocampus, and insula, respectively. This study suggests that white matter conductivity anisotropy should be taken into account in ECT electric field models.
