Diabetes and obesity are associated with perturbation of adrenal steroid hormones and impairment of hippocampal plasticity, but the question of whether these conditions recruit glucocorticoid-mediated molecular cascades that are comparable to other stressors has yet to be fully addressed. We have used a genetic mouse model of obesity and diabetes with chronically elevated glucocorticoids to determine the mechanism for glucocorticoid-induced deficits in hippocampal synaptic function. Pharmacological inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis attenuates structural and functional impairments by regulating plasticity among dendritic spines in the hippocampus of leptin receptor deficient (db/db) mice. Synaptic deficits evoked by exposure to elevated corticosterone levels in db/db mice are attributable to glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transrepression of AP-1 actions at BDNF promoters I and IV. db/db mice exhibit corticosterone-mediated reductions in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and a change in the ratio of TrkB to P75NTR that silences the functional response to BDNF stimulation. Lentiviral suppression of glucocorticoid receptor expression rescues behavioral and synaptic function in db/db mice, and also reinstates BDNF expression, underscoring the relevance of molecular mechanisms previously demonstrated after psychological stress to the functional alterations observed in obesity and diabetes.
