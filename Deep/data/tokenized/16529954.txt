Oscillations at theta (3-8 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequencies co-occur during arousal, exploration, and rapid eye movement sleep and relate to information processing underlying learning and memory within neuronal networks. In hippocampus, gamma and theta frequency oscillations are associated with modification of synaptic weights, spatial learning, and short-term memory. These oscillations are referred to as network phenomena and, thereby, the role of single neuron oscillations in the generation of neuronal networks remains unclear. We report that an individual CA3 pyramidal cell can activate the CA1 neuronal network in vivo in rat hippocampus using electrical stimulations with simultaneous intracellular gamma and extracellular theta and slow (0.5-1 Hz) frequencies. These results suggest that an individual pyramidal cell can contribute to self-organization of a neuronal small-scale network.
