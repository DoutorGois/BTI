The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene confers an increased risk for the development of AD. The authors compared longitudinal rates of change in hippocampal volume as a function of APOE genotype in nondemented elderly individuals. Rate of volumetric loss was significantly greater among epsilon4+ compared with epsilon4- individuals. These results indicate that individuals positive for the APOE epsilon4 allele may show a greater rate of hippocampal atrophy than their epsilon4- counterparts, even in the absence of a diagnosis of AD.
