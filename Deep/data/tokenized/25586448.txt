The mode of action of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) has been extensively observed in different aspects of cell growth and proliferation. The transcription factor regulates various genes controlling inflammation and anti-inflammatory responses in different tissues. Thus, NF-kappaB signal gains a therapeutic prospect. The activation of NF-kappaB requires nuclear localization of its p65 subunit. Research also indicates an impact of phosphorylated p65 on the transcription of genes during cell growth and the immune response. Following the trends in investigations over decades, different observations suggest that NF-kappaB activation and phosphorylation of p65 regulate neuronal plasticity. Also, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation is a well-demonstrated way to attenuate inflammation. In addition to anti-inflammatory drugs, recent researches unwind a way to regulate regeneration and repair tissue damage. Thus, keeping a critical view on NF-kappaB signals, we propose the importance of natural or synthetic NF-kappaB activators for neurogenesis.
