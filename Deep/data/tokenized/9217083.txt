Suspensions of late embryonic hippocampal tissue were microinjected so as to be completely enclosed within the myelinated fiber bundles of the adult rat fimbria. Previous studies have shown that the axons from such transplanted neurons readily cross the graft/host interface and extend rapidly through the host fiber tract. The present study shows that the adult axons from the host fiber tract can also cross this interface in the opposite direction and enter the transplants. Biotin dextran tracing shows that the adult host fimbrial axons traverse the embryonic grafts and also form terminal arborizations within the transplants. Electron microscopy of orthograde electron-dense degeneration confirms that these host axons form synaptic terminals accounting for at least 6.6% of the synapses in the neuropil of the transplant. Thus, contact with embryonic nervous tissue can induce elongative growth by the adult fibers in a myelinated central tract.
