The effect of lead acetate administration during perinatal (1. prenatal, 2. prenatal and suckling period, 3. prenatal + suckling period + 4 weeks after weaning) development in combination with ethanol was investigated in Wistar rats at the age of 12 weeks on open-field behaviour and auditory startle response. Lead intoxication has on the investigated behavioural parameters the most pronouncing effect when applied during the days 5-15 of pregnancy.
