ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Polygonum multiflorum Thunb is a traditional Chinese medicine with anti-aging effect. 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG) is generally considered as the main active component in Polygonum multiflorum Thunb. However, the effect of TSG on memory in adult is unclear till now. AIM OF STUDY: 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG) is a polyphenols compound from Polygonum multi fl orum Thunb. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of chronic administration of TSG on hippocampal memory in normal mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Behavioral test, electrophysiology and golgi staining were used to evaluate the effect of TSG on hippocampus-dependent memory and synaptic plasticity. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of ERK1/2, CaMKII, and SIRT1. Real-time quantitative PCR was explored to measure miR-134. RESULTS: It was found that TSG enhanced hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory and novel object recognition, facilitated hippocampal LTP and increased dendrite spine density in the CA1 region of hippocampus. TSG obviously promoted the phosphorylations of ERK1/2, CaMKII, CREB and the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus, with upregulation of silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and downregulation of miR-134. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic administration of TSG promotes hippocampal memory in normal mice, suggesting that supplementary of TSG might serve as an enhancement of memory.
