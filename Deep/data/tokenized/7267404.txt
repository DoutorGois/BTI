Secretin immunoreactivity in rat and pig brain has been identified and characterized utilizing a highly specific radioimmunoassay and fractionation on a high pressure liquid chromatographic system reverse phase column. One immunoreactive peak from each brain extract was observed. Secretin immunoreactivity from rat brain and duodenum coelute, but eluted slightly ahead of the immunoreactivity from pig brain and duodenum and from synthetic porcine secretin. Immunoreactive secretin is widely distributed in the thalamus, hypothalamus and olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, midbrain, septum, striatum, hippocampus, medulla and pons. The highest concentrations occur in the pineal and the pituitary gland.
