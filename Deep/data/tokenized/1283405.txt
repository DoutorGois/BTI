1. The effect of the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), an inhibitor of ionotropic quisqualate receptor desensitization, on both evoked and spontaneous fast excitatory postsynaptic events was examined in cultured postnatal rat hippocampal neurons with the use of whole cell recordings. 2. WGA, at 580 nM, potentiated evoked fast excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by increasing the amplitudes by 100 +/- 27% (mean +/- SE) and the time constant of decay from 5.8 +/- 0.6 to 7.9 +/- 0.5 ms. The increases in these parameters were not accompanied by changes in the current-voltage (I-V) relationship or pharmacological profile of the fast EPSCs. 3. WGA did not alter the amplitude or time course of decay of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), and it did not alter neuronal input resistance or action potentials. 4. WGA increased the amplitude of spontaneous fast miniature EPSCs (MEPSCs), defined as spontaneous EPSCs recorded in the presence of tetrodotoxin, by 53 +/- 11% and increased the time required to decay to 50% of the peak amplitude by 48 +/- 23%. These changes were not associated with a change in the rate of MEPSC occurrence. 5. These results suggest that WGA augments hippocampal excitatory postsynaptic events via a postsynaptic mechanism. The results further imply that ionotropic quisqualate receptor desensitization can modulate the amplitude and time course of decay of fast excitatory synaptic events. Thus desensitization may be one factor that regulates fast excitatory synaptic transmission.
