A bicuculline-resistant and TPMPA-sensitive GABAergic component was identified in hippocampal neurons in culture and in acute isolated brain slices. In both preparations, total GABAergic activity showed two inactivation kinetics: fast and slow. RT-PCR, in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry detected expression of GABArho subunits. Immunogold and electron microscopy indicated that the receptors are mostly extrasynaptic. In addition, by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence we found GABArho present in amygdala and visual cortex.
