OBJECTIVE: To study the oxidative stress induced by decabromodiphenylether (PBDE-209) in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum of mice. METHODS: Twenty-eight male BALB/c mice were randomized divided into four groups with seven mice in each: solvent control, blank control, low (200 mg/kg) and high (500 mg/kg) dose groups. Test substances were administered by gavage and mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after treatment. Malonyldialdehyde (MDA), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione (GSH) in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum were examined. RESULTS: The content of MDA in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum and hippocampus in high dose group was (92.25 +/- 36.64), (4.24 +/- 1.15), (12.92 +/- 4.30), (12.12 +/- 6.39) nmol/mg pro respectively, higher than that in blank group [(56.713 +/- 6.44), (2.42 +/- 1.41), (4.05 +/- 2.23), (4.91 +/- 1.60) nmol/mg pro] and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); T-SOD activity in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum in low dose group was (182.48 +/- 11.59), (6.67 +/- 1.56), (35.48 +/- 21.98) U/mg pro respectively, lower than that in blank group [(277.76 +/- 106.70), (18.02 +/- 16.40), (63.57 +/- 20.83) U/mg pro] and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); in high dose group the T-SOD activity in hippocampus was(59.26 +/- 37.09) U/mg pro, lower than that in blank group [(93.28 +/- 21.75) U/mg pro] and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); The content of GSH in cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum in high dose group was (40.98 +/- 13.19), (3.55 +/- 1.55), (24.46 +/- 11.30) mg/g pro respectively, lower than that in blank group [(75.79 +/- 26.51), (8.01 +/- 3.23), (44.52 +/- 13.15) mg/g pro and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05); while the content of GSH in hippocampus was not decreased significantly compared with the blank group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: PBDE-209 could induce oxidative stress in nervous tissue. The tissue oxidative damage might be one of the primary mechanisms of neurotoxicity of PBDE-209.
