In rats, conditioned fear to context causes freezing immobility and cardiovascular changes. The dorsal hippocampus (DH) has a critical role in several memory processes, including conditioning fear to contextual information. To explore a possible involvement of the DH in contextual fear conditioning-evoked cardiovascular (mean arterial pressure and heart rate increases) and behavioral (freezing) responses, DH synaptic transmission was temporarily inhibited by bilateral microinjections of 500 nl of the nonselective synapse blocker, cobalt chloride (CoCl2, 1 mmol/l), at different periods of the experimental procedure. During re-exposure to the foot shock chamber in which conditioning had taken place, bilateral DH inhibition 10 min before the conditioning session had no effect on either behavioral or cardiovascular responses. Bilateral DH inhibition immediately after the conditioning session (10 min) decreased both behavioral and cardiovascular responses during the context test. Finally, 48 h after the conditioning session, bilateral DH inhibition 10 min before re-exposure to the foot shock chamber significantly reduced cardiovascular responses but not freezing responses. These results suggest that contextual fear conditioning acquisition does not depend on the DH. This structure, however, is crucial for the consolidation of contextual fear. Moreover, although the DH appears to be less important for the behavioral (freezing) changes induced by re-exposure to the aversive conditioned context, it may play an important role on the cardiovascular responses generated by this model.
