OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSP) on the oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in primary rat hippocampal neurons. METHODS: Primary cultured hippocampal neurons injury model by H2O2 was established. Morphological changes of neuron cells were visualized. The viability of hippocampal neurons was detected by MTT. The contents of malonidaldelyde (MDA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) in the cells were measured by chemochromatometry respectively. RESULTS: The cell activity decreased remarkably induced by 1 mmol/L H2O2 for 24 hours (P < 0.01), the levels of MDA and ROS were increased, and SOD, CAT, GSH-Px level were decreased in cells. GSP could reduce MDA and ROS level obviously, and increase SOD, CAT and GSH-Px level in cells. CONCLUSION: GSP has protective effect on hippocampal neurons injury induced by H2O2. The protective effect may be related to protecting cell membrane, increasing the activity of clearance enzyme of free radical and inhibiting lipid peroxidation.
