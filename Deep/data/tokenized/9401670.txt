Few studies have investigated neurobehavioral and neurochemical consequences of chronic consumption of low doses of ethanol. The present study shows that in rats exposure to 3% ethanol (v/v in drinking water) for 2 months decreased both calcium-dependent and -independent protein kinase C (PKC) activities in the cortex and in the hippocampus. This treatment also reduced ultrasonic calls (UCs), an index of emotional and motivational states of the animal. In addition, at cortical level of ethanol-treated rats, we observed a correlation between calcium-dependent activities and UCs. These results suggest that nonaddicting doses of ethanol affect brain PKC activities and that this enzyme may be involved in the ethanol modulation of emotional and motivational behaviors.
