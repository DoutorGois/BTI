The present study was designed to investigate the effects of combined treatment with a serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), and a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, scopolamine, on water maze (WM) navigation. Treatment with either 8-OH-DPAT or scopolamine before daily behavioral training disrupted spatial navigation at medium doses and cue navigation at high doses. Pretraining treatment with a combination of subthreshold doses of 8-OH-DPAT and scopolamine impaired WM spatial and cue navigation, but did not impair the WM performance if the drugs were injected post-training. In trained rats, combined injections of subthreshold doses of 8-OH-DPAT and scopolamine given pretraining did not impair the rats' ability to find the platform in a familiar or in a novel position. The combination of 8-OH-DPAT and scopolamine also disrupted WM navigation in rats with central 5-HT depletion. A combination of a peripheral muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist and 8-OH-DPAT had no effect on WM navigation. These data suggest that combined treatment with drugs blocking muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and activating 5-HT1A receptors greatly impairs WM learning/performance, but does not impair spatial memory per se.
