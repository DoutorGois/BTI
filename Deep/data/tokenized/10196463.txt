Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is disrupted in the brain in dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). We investigated whether the cAMP reduction is accompanied by an alteration in the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) downstream in DAT and control hippocampi. Immunoreactivity of pCREB was significantly decreased in DAT, while total CREB level was unchanged. These findings indicate that impaired cAMP signaling may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease.
