Studies have shown that oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). It is suggested that omega-3 (omega3) fatty acids are fundamental to maintaining the functional integrity of the central nervous system. The animal model used in this study displayed fenproporex-induced hyperactivity, a symptom similar to manic BD. Our results showed that the administration of fenproporex, in the prevent treatment protocol, increased lipid peroxidation in the prefrontal cortex (143%), hippocampus (58%) and striatum (181%), and omega3 fatty acids alone prevented this change in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, whereas the co-administration of omega3 fatty acids with VPA prevented the lipoperoxidation in all analyzed brain areas, and the co-administration of omega3 fatty acids with Li prevented this increase only in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Moreover, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was decreased in the striatum (54%) in the prevention treatment, and the administration of omega3 fatty acids alone or in combination with Li and VPA partially prevented this inhibition. On the other hand, in the reversal treatment protocol, the administration of fenproporex increased carbonyl content in the prefrontal cortex (25%), hippocampus (114%) and striatum (91%), and in prefrontal coxter the administration of omega3 fatty acids alone or in combination with Li and VPA reversed this change, whereas in the hippocampus and striatum only omega3 fatty acids alone or in combination with VPA reversed this effect. Additionally, the administration of fenproporex resulted in a marked increase of TBARS in the hippocampus and striatum, and omega3 fatty acids alone or in combination with Li and VPA reversed this change. Finally, fenproporex administration decreased SOD activity in the prefrontal cortex (85%), hippocampus (52%) and striatum (76%), and the omega3 fatty acids in combination with VPA reversed this change in the prefrontal cortex and striatum, while the co-administration of omega3 fatty acids with Li reversed this inhibition in the hippocampus and striatum. In conclusion, our results support other studies showing the importance of omega3 fatty acids in the brain and the potential for these fatty acids to aid in the treatment of BD.
