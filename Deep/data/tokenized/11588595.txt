Rat pups nursed from birth by mothers with increased plasma corticosterone show long-lasting biochemical and behavioral modifications. Here we have investigated nerve growth factor (NGF) concentrations in the basal forebrain, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of both male and female offspring at 11 days of age. Maternal hypercorticosteronemia was achieved by giving corticosterone-enriched water (200 microg/ml) from delivery. There was a significant increase of NGF in the basal forebrain of both sexes and no changes in the prefrontal cortex. In the hippocampus, an increase in NGF was found in males. These results indicate that a moderate increase of corticosterone in the lactating mother modulates NGF in the developing rat. We propose that these effects contribute directly to the long-lasting behavioral and biochemical modifications in pups nursed by hypercorticosteronemic mothers.
