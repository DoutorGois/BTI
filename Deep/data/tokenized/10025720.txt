We reported previously that administration of 1-oleoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (ODHPC), a kind of phosphatidylcholine, enhanced discriminatory shock avoidance learning in rats. Since long-term potentiation (LTP) of the hippocampus has been suggested to be a physiological substrate of some forms of memory, we investigated the effects of ODHPC on LTP in the rat hippocampal CA1 region. LTP in the amplitude of population spikes in the CA1 region was induced by tetanic stimulation in anesthetized rats. ODHPC significantly increased magnitudes of LTP in a dose-dependent manner when injected intraperitoneally 20 min before inducing LTP. However, administration of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine, in which only docosahexaenoyl residue of ODHPC was replaced with oleoyl residue, did not affect LTP. These results suggest that ODHPC enhances hippocampal LTP by its specific conformation.
