Hippocampal tissue taken from neonatal mice born of parents heterozygous for the reeler gene was transplanted into the brains of littermates. The great majority of transplants were from normal donors to normal hosts. A single case each of a reeler transplant into a normal host and a normal transplant into a reeler host is described. Reeler hippocampus transplanted into normal tissue retained the phenotype of reeler; normal hippocampus transplanted into reeler hippocampus was phenotypically normal.
