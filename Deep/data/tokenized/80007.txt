The authors studied the influence of a single intraperitoneal administration of corticosterone to rats on the content of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA), serotonin turnover in the hypothalamus, mesencephalon, dorsal hyppocampus, frontal and parietal cortex. In a dose of 1 mg per 1 kg of body weight corticosterone increased the content and the turnover of serotonin in the hypothalamus and the mesencephalon 30 min after its administration. 120 min after the administration of the hormone the content of serotonin was restored to control values. Corticosterone produced no influence on serotonin content and its turnover in other regions of the brain. Corticosterone in a dose of 10 mg/kg 30 min after its administration decreased the serotonin content and its turnover in the hypothalamus and the mesencephalon. The 5-HIAA content decreased considerably in the hypothalamus, but rose in the mesencephalon and the hyppocampus. The results obtained indicated that the influence of corticosterone on serotonin metabolism depended on the region of the brain under study, on the dose used and the time lapse after its administration.
