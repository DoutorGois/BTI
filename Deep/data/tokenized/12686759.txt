Aqueous extracts of Ginseng radix have traditionally been used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. In the present study, the effect of Ginseng radix on c-Fos expression in the hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats was investigated via immunohistochemistry. Decreased c-Fos expression in the CA regions of the hippocampus was observed in STZ-induced diabetes, and administration of Ginseng radix enhanced the STZ-induced inhibition of c-Fos expression both dose- and duration-dependently. These results suggest that hyperglycemia-induced suppression of Fos expression may trigger the diabetes-induced disruption of hippocampal information processing and that Ginseng radix may alleviate this diabetes-induced disturbance in hippocampal functions.
