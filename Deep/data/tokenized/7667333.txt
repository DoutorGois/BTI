The changes in the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins isolated from cell nuclei of hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of rats subjected for varying times to a chronic uncontrollable stress model were investigated. A brief duration (24 h) induced a substantial increase of the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins isolated from hypothalamus (270%), from the cerebral cortex (ca. 230%), and from the hippocampus (ca. 160%). More extended durations (96 and 168 h) were accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in the degree of phosphorylation of proteins.
