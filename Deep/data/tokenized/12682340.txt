Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is frequently associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and a history of febrile convulsions (HFC). The authors investigated 292 patients with TLE due to HS. Left HS occurred more frequently (57%) than right HS (43%, p = 0.01). Forty-seven percent of the patients had HFC. In patients with right HS, HFC occurred in 59.6%, whereas in patients with left HS, HFC was present in 37.5%, showing a highly significant lateralization difference.
