OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of beta-asarone on expression of immediately early gene c-fos in kindling epilepsy rat brain. METHOD: The rats were randomly divided in to beta-asarone groups (200, 100, 50 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), difetoin control group (36 mg x kg(-1)) and model group. The remedy was administered orally. The effects were observed in kindling epilepsy model induced by penicillin, then the expression of c-fos were determined by western blot (hippocampus) and immunohistochemical techniques (cortex). RESULT: Beta-asarone could significantly increase the expression of c-fos in kindling epilepsy rat brain, and show its quantity-effect relation. The expression of c-fos in hippocampus was (1139.45 +/- 155.56), (1109.56 +/- 134.03), (1103.73 +/- 235.82) CNT x mm2 in beta-asarone groups, 920.54 +/- 203.20 in model control group, and 1106.26 +/- 186.24 in difetoin group, respectively. The number of c-fos positive cell was 87.1 +/- 2.2, 76.3 +/- 1.3 and 59.9 +/- 1.3 in beta-asarone groups, 39.3 +/- 2.6 in model control group, and 95.2 +/- 1.1 in difetoin group, respectively. CONCLUSION: Beta-asarone can obviously increase the expression of c-fos in epilepsy rat brain. It is one of important response to epilepsy.
