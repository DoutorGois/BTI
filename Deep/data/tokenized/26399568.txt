BACKGROUND: Gestational alcohol exposure causes lifelong physical and neurocognitive deficits collectively referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Micronutrient deficiencies are common in pregnancies of alcohol-abusing women. Here we show the most common micronutrient deficiency of pregnancy-iron deficiency without anemia-significantly worsens neurocognitive outcomes following perinatal alcohol exposure. METHODS: Pregnant rats were fed iron-deficient (ID) or iron-sufficient diets from gestational day 13 to postnatal day (P) 7. Pups received alcohol (0, 3.5, 5.0 g/kg) from P 4 to P 9, targeting the brain growth spurt. At P 32, learning was assessed using delay or trace eyeblink classical conditioning (ECC). Cerebellar interpositus nucleus (IPN) and hippocampal CA1 cellularity was quantified using unbiased stereology. RESULTS: Global analysis of variance revealed that ID and alcohol separately and significantly reduced ECC learning with respect to amplitude (ps </= 0.001) and conditioned response [CR] percentage (ps </= 0.001). Iron and alcohol interacted to reduce CR percentage in the trace ECC task (p = 0.013). Both ID and alcohol significantly reduced IPN (ps < 0.001) and CA1 cellularity (ps < 0.005). CR amplitude correlated with IPN cellularity (delay: r = 0.871, trace: r = 0.703, ps < 0.001) and CA1 cellularity (delay: r = 0.792, trace: r = 0.846, ps < 0.001) across both tasks. The learning impairments persisted even though the offsprings' iron status had normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting our previous work, gestational ID exacerbates the associative learning deficits in this rat model of FASD. This is strongly associated with cellular reductions within the ECC neurocircuitry. Significant learning impairments in FASD could be the consequence, in part, of pregnancies in which the mother was also iron inadequate.
