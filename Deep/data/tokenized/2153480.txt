Two different developmental patterns of stimulation of phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism by excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors were observed during the postnatal maturation of various brain regions. A 'burst' in PI metabolism was seen at postnatal day 6 (PND6) in olfactory bulb and cerebellum and at PND9 in hippocampus. In cortex and thalamus/hypothalamus high levels of PI metabolism were observed initially, and then began to decline at PND15 and PND18, respectively. NMDA inhibition of PI metabolism was generally found to parallel the EAA activation but the persistence of inhibition varied in the different brain regions.
