It is well-established that the feed-forward connected main hippocampal areas, CA3, CA2, and CA1 work cooperatively during spatial navigation and memory. These areas are similar in terms of the prevalent types of neurons; however, they display different spatial coding and oscillatory dynamics. Understanding the temporal dynamics of these operations requires simultaneous recordings from these regions. However, simultaneous recordings from multiple regions and subregions in behaving animals have become possible only recently. We performed large-scale silicon probe recordings simultaneously spanning across all layers of CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions in rats during spatial navigation and sleep and compared their behavior-dependent spiking, oscillatory dynamics and functional connectivity. The accuracy of place cell spatial coding increased progressively from distal to proximal CA1, suddenly dropped in CA2, and increased again from CA3a toward CA3c. These variations can be attributed in part to the different entorhinal inputs to each subregions, and the differences in theta modulation of CA1, CA2, and CA3 neurons. We also found that neurons in the subregions showed differences in theta modulation, phase precession, state-dependent changes in firing rates and functional connectivity among neurons of these regions. Our results indicate that a combination of intrinsic properties together with distinct intra- and extra-hippocampal inputs may account for the subregion-specific modulation of spiking dynamics and spatial tuning of neurons during behavior.
