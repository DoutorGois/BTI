Experiments were performed to investigate whether intact intracellular Ca2+ pools are necessary for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. Thapsigargin (1 microM), which depletes most intracellular Ca2+ pools by blocking ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake into intracellular compartments, blocked the induction but not the expression of LTP. Thapsigargin had no effect on synaptic transmission or on responses mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation. These data suggest that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is required for the induction of LTP.
