BACKGROUND: The left cerebral hemisphere predominance in human focal epilepsy has been observed in a few studies, however, there is no related systematic study in epileptic animal on hemisphere predominance. The main goal of this paper is to observe if the epileptiform discharges (EDs) of Pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats could present difference between left hemisphere and right hemisphere or not. METHODS: The electrocorticogram (ECoG) and electrohippocampogram (EHG) from Pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats were recorded and analyzed using Synchronization likelihood (SL) in order to determine the synchronization relation between different brain regions, then visual check and cross-correlation analysis were adopted to evaluate if the EDs were originated more frequently from the left hemisphere than the right hemisphere. RESULTS: The data show that the synchronization between left-EHG and right-EHG, left-ECoG and left-EHG, right-ECoG and right-EHG, left-ECoG and right-ECoG, are significantly strengthened after the brain functional state transforms from non-epileptiform discharges to continuous-epileptiform discharges(p < 0.05). When the state transforms from continuous EDs to periodic EDs, the synchronization is significantly weakened between left-ECoG and left-EHG, left-EHG and right-EHG (p < 0.05). Visual check and the time delay (tau) based cross-correlation analysis finds that 10 out of 13 EDs have a left predominance (77%) and 3 out of 13 EDs are right predominance (23%). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the left hemisphere may be more prone to EDs in the Pilocarpine-induced rat epilepsy model and implicate that the left hemisphere might play an important role in epilepsy states transition.
