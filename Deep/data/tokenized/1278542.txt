Changes of electric activity of the rabbit cortical and subcortical structures were studied by means of spectrum-correlation analysis during sleep caused by low-frequency stimulation of the supraoptic hypothalamic nucleus. The electrosleep affected the similarity of the electric events in neocortex and subcortical structures. The disturbance of the spatial synchronization is supposed to be due to the activity of nonsynchronized autonomous bioelectric pace-makers in different brain structures.
