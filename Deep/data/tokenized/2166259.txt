Male Sprague-Dawley rats received LiCl (5 mEq/kg; sc) or saline 24 h prior to injection of cholinomimetics. Physostigmine (PHY, 0.54-0.80 mg/kg), diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP, 1.3-2.5 mg/kg), pilocarpine (PIL, 23-30 mg/kg), or saline was injected subcutaneously at time 0. Rats were observed for seizure activity for 2 h, survivors were killed 24 h later and edema was measured in samples from parietal and piriform cortices, dorsal thalmus, and hippocampus. None of the rats pretreated with saline had seizures when given doses of cholinomimetics alone. However, rats pretreated with LiCl had the following incidence of seizures: PHY 68%, DFP 71% and PIL 100%. Rats given cholinomimetic agents alone did not have brain edema. In contrast, all LiCl-pretreated rats that seized had pronounced brain edema which was greatest in the piriform cortex. Thus, these studies demonstrate that LiCl pretreatment potentiates cholinomimetic-induced seizures. Further, cholinomimetic-induced seizures produce brain changes resulting in edema.
