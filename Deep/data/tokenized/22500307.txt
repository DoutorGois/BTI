The structural MRI and auditory evoked potentials (odd-ball paradigm) were analyzed in juvenile patients at the remission stage after the first episode of endogenous psychosis. Eleven male patients and 11 male controls, aged 18-25, years were examined. There were no statistically significant between-group differences by averaged volume of grey matter in superior and middle frontal gyri, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and superior temporal gyrus in both hemispheres as well by P300 amplitude and latency. It can be assumed that the certain normalization of neurobiological processes can be seen at the studied stage of the disease.
