Postnatal rats at 7 and 21 days of age were subjected to unilateral hypoxia-ischemia (H/I) by right carotid artery ligation followed by 1.5 to 2 hours of hypoxia (8% oxygen). Brains were frozen at specific intervals of recovery from 0 to 24 hours. Western blots of samples of right and left forebrain were immunodeveloped with a monoclonal antibody specific for ubiquitin, RHUb1. An elevation of ubiquitin conjugate levels in the right compared with the left forebrain of 7-day-old animals was detectable immediately following H/I and increased by close to 60% of control level within 1 hour of recovery. The conjugate immunoreactivity remained at this level for 6 hours but had declined to control levels by 24 hours of recovery. No such increase was observed in response to hypoxia alone. Similar changes were observed in samples from the 21-day-old rat brain. However, the elevation of ubiquitin conjugate levels was of slower onset and persisted longer than observed for the 7-day-old animals. Immunocytochemical studies of brain fixed by immersion in formaldehyde/acetone/methanol showed that ubiquitin-like immunoreactivity was increased in the right, but not left, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of animals subjected to H/I. The data suggest that elevated ubiquitination may represent a neuroprotective response to H/I.
