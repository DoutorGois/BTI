OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are changes in the density of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the hippocampus of subjects with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Using in situ radioligand binding with semiquantitative autoradiography, we measured the density of [3H]MK-801, [3H]CGP39653, [3H]AMPA and [3H]kainate binding in hippocampi, obtained postmortem, from eight subjects with type 1 bipolar disorder and 8 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: In subjects with bipolar disorder there were significant decreases in the density of [3H]MK-801 binding in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) 3 (mean +/- SEM; 108.8 +/- 12.2 versus 166.2 +/- 18.0 fmol/mg ETE, p < 0.005) as well as the pyramidal (102.8 +/- 9.2 versus 136.6 +/- 11.2 fmol/mg ETE, p < 0.05) and polymorphic (21.73 +/- 6.5 versus 53.26 +/- 11.6 fmol/mg ETE, p < 0.05) layers of the subiculum. In addition, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a decrease in the density of [3H]CGP39653 binding across the hippocampal formation in bipolar subjects, which did not reach significance in any subregion. There were no changes in the densities of [3H]AMPA or [3H]kainate binding in these subjects. CONCLUSIONS: [3H]CGP39653 and [3H]MK-801 bind to the glutamate binding site and open ion channel of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, respectively. Therefore, these data suggest that there is a decrease in the number of open ion channels associated with no significant change in the apparent density of NMDA receptors in regions of the hippocampus from subjects with bipolar disorder.
