To examine the effects of soft-diet feeding on the dopaminergic system in a model rat for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we measured dopamine release in the hippocampus using a microdialysis approach and assessed learning ability and memory using step-through passive avoidance tests. Furthermore, we immunohistochemically examined the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is the origin of hippocampal dopaminergic fibers using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker enzyme for the dopaminergic nervous system. Feeding a soft diet decreased dopamine release in the hippocampus and impaired learning ability and memory in AD model rats in comparison with rats fed a hard diet; however, TH-immunopositive profiles in the VTA seemed not to be notably different between rats fed a soft diet and those fed a hard diet. These observations suggest that soft-diet feeding enhances the impairment of learning ability and memory through the decline of dopamine release in the hippocampus in AD rats.
