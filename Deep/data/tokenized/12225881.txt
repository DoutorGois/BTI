In the central nervous system, the junctional types that establish and maintain tissue architecture include gap junctions, for cytoplasmic connectivity, and tight junctions, for paracellular and/or cell polarity barriers. Connexins are the integral membrane proteins of gap junctions, whereas occludin and members of the multigene family of claudins form tight junctions. In the brain, there are no transendothelial pathways, as continuous tight junctions are present between the endothelial cells. Thus, they provide a continuous cellular barrier between the blood and the insterstitial fluid. However, several brain pathologies, including epilepsy, are known to alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier and to cause edema. Therefore, since claudins, as constitutive proteins of tight junctions are likely candidates for modulation under pathological states, we explored their normal pattern of expression in the brain and its modulation by seizures. We found that several members of this family are normally expressed in the hippocampus and cortex. Interestingly, claudin-7 is expressed in the hippocampus but not in the cortex. On the other hand, the expression of claudin-8 is selectively down-regulated in the hippocampus as kindling evolves. These results link for the first time the modulation of expression of a tight junction protein to abnormal neuronal synchronization that could probably be reflected in permeability changes of the blood-brain barrier or edema.
