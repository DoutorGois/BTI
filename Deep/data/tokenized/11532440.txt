Rapidly generated high-titer Semliki Forest virus (SFV) vectors can infect numerous mammalian cell lines and primary cell cultures, and result in high levels of transgene expression. SFV-based expression of transmembrane receptors has been characterized by specific ligand-binding activity and functional responses. Adaptation of the SFV technology for mammalian suspension cultures has allowed the production of hundreds of milligrams of recombinant receptor for purification and structural studies. The same SFV stock solutions used for the infection of mammalian cells in culture have also been successfully applied for efficient transgene expression in organotypic hippocampal slices, as well as in vivo in rodent brain.
