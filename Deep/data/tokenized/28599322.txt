Co-morbid depression is prevalent in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Here we report that monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) plays pathogenic roles in the comorbidity. We found that chronic intermittent hypoxia significantly increased the MAO-A expression in the rat hippocampus and markedly decreased the dendritic length and spine density in the pyramidal neurons with less pre- and post-synaptic proteins. The MAO-A upregulation resulted in increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid/serotonin ratio, oxidative stress, leading to NF-kappaB activation, inflammation and apoptosis. Also, the expression of cytokine-responsive indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) was significantly augmented in hypoxia, resulting in increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and lowered serotonin level in the hippocampus. Moreover, depressive-like behaviors were observed in the hypoxic rat. Administration of M30, a brain-selective MAO-A inhibitor with iron-chelating properties, prior to hypoxic treatment prevented the aberrant changes in the hippocampus and depressive behavior. In human SH-SY5Y cells expressing MAO-A but not MAO-B, hypoxia significantly increased the MAO-A expression, which was blocked by M30 or clorgyline. Collectively, the MAO-A upregulation induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia plays significant pathogenic role in oxidative stress, inflammation and IDO-1 activation resulting in serotonin depletion and neurodegeneration.
