Neuropathological examination of the brain of eight adult mentally handicapped patients showed mesial temporal sclerosis. Three patients had cerebral palsy, one had Down's syndrome, three were retarded, and one had an unspecific mental handicap. Although there was a suspicion of fits in most patients, temporal lobe epilepsy was not diagnosed in life.
