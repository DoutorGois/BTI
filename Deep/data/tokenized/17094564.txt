We experienced an 8-year-old-boy with non-herpetic acute limbic encephalitis (NHALE), who developed headache, convulsion, consciousness disturbance, and ataxia following cold like symptoms. Disturbance of short term memory and a change of character were recognized. Myoclonic seizures and generalized tonic clonic convulsions developed, that responded to antiepileptic agents. Although other symptoms resolved spontaneously, short term memory disturbance persisted. Brain MRI demonstrated the lesion involving the bilateral claustrum and right hippocampus. Three months later, the lesion in the claustrum disappeared, but the hippocampus still showed slight hyperintensity on FLAIR image of MRI. Autoantibodies against glutamine receptor were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, which suggested the involvement of immunologic disturbances in this disease. In NHALE, many cases have been reported in adults but not in children, and the further attentions should be paid to childhood-onset NHALE.
