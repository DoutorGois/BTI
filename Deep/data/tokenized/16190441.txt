We introduce a compact two-photon fluorescence microendoscope based on a compound gradient refractive index endoscope probe, a DC micromotor for remote adjustment of the image plane, and a flexible photonic bandgap fiber for near distortion-free delivery of ultrashort excitation pulses. The imaging head has a mass of only 3.9 g and provides micrometer-scale resolution. We used portable two-photon microendoscopy to visualize hippocampal blood vessels in the brains of live mice.
