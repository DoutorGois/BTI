Neurosteroid sensitivity of GABA(A) receptor mediated inhibition of the hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) is reduced in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, the properties and subunit composition of GABA(A) receptors mediating tonic inhibition in DGCs of epileptic animals have not been described. In the DGCs of epileptic animals, allopregnanolone and L-655708 sensitivity of holding current was diminished and delta subunit was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and its surface expression was decreased the in the hippocampus. Ro15-4513 and lanthanum had distinct effects on holding current recorded from DGCs of control and epileptic animals suggesting that the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors maintaining tonic inhibition in DGCs of epileptic animals were similar to those containing the alpha4betaxgamma2 subunits. Furthermore, surface expression of the alpha4 subunit increased and a larger fraction of the subunit co-immunoprecipitated with thegamma2 subunit in hippocampi of epileptic animals. Together, these studies revealed that functional alpha4betaxdelta and alpha5betaxgamma2 receptors were reduced in the hippocampi of epileptic animals and that novel alpha4bxgamma2 receptors contributed to the maintenance of tonic inhibition. The presence of alpha4betaxgamma2 receptors resulted in low GABA affinity and neurosteroid sensitivity of tonic currents in the DGCs of epileptic animals that could potentially increase seizure vulnerability. These receptors may represent a novel therapeutic target for anticonvulsant drugs without sedative actions.
