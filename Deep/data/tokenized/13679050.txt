One of the major roles of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is to promote the differentiation and support the survival of neurons in the central nervous system. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of BDNF on the fate of adult rat hippocampus-derived neural stem cells (AHPCs) transplanted into the developing rat retina. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant increase in the ratio of grafted AHPCs stained for MAP2ab (P<0.05) and a marked decrease in the ratio of nestin-positive grafted cells in the slow-releasing BDNF group compared with the control group. The respective changes in the ratios of MAP5 and GFAP-positive grafted cells were comparable for the two groups. The results reported here suggest a potentially beneficial role for extended delivery of BDNF in the differentiation of grafted neural stem cells, which may lead to a novel modification of stem cell transplantation.
