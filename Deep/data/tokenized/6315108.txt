It is suggested that the inhibitory action of phenazepam on the evoked potential (EP) in the CA1 area of the hippocamp in response to the stimulation of Schaffer's collaterals is mediated by phenazepam interaction with a specific benzodiazepine receptor (BR). Experiments were made to study the action of a specific benzodiazepine antagonist RO15-1788 on the phenazepam-induced inhibition in the hippocamp. After RO15-1788 administration (4 microM) the phenazepam-induced (2 microM) inhibition of evoked activity of hippocampal neurons was attenuated. The inhibition provoked by hexenal (2 microM) was not affected by antagonist administration. It is concluded that phenazepam effect on the EP is related to the interaction with BR. In most cases, RO15-1788 (4 microM) had an insignificant inhibitory effect on the EP. However, in individual experiments, it produced an opposite action, i. e. raised the evoked activity of neurons.
