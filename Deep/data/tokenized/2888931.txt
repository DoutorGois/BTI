Selective neuronal loss in the hippocampus following transient forebrain ischaemia appears to be excitotoxic in origin. The early cytological changes in the rat hippocampus (1-2 hours after 10 or 30 minutes of ischaemia) have the ultrastructural appearances of an excitotoxic lesion. Focal injection of an excitatory amino acid antagonist acting competitively on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (2-APH) in one hippocampus protects against the early cytopathology, and, when repeated 4 and 10 hours after the ischaemia, partially protects against selective nerve cell loss. Systemic administration of 2-APH or of a non-competitive antagonist at the NMDA receptor, ketamine, also protects against neuronal loss. Blockade of excitatory transmission at the NMDA receptor may provide a therapeutic approach to the acute treatment of cerebral ischaemia.
