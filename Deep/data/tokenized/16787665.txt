The present study describes the cytoarchitectonic and chemoarchitectonic organization of the canine entorhinal cortex (EC). We distinguished medial, laterodorsal, and latero-intermediate subdivisions based on the organization of cortical layers using Nissl and Timm staining and AChE histochemistry. The medial subdivision is located at the border of the parasubiculum and is characterized by a narrow cortex, wide layer II, and densely packed cells in layer V. At its caudal extent, distinct spherical groups of small cells are situated at the border of layer I/II. The laterodorsal subdivision is located along the rhinal sulcus and borders area 35 of the perirhinal cortex. Its cortex is wide and layers tend to merge. Layer II of the laterodorsal subdivision contains scattered "stellate" cells, which are not organized into islands. The latero-intermediate subdivision displays a complex layer organization. The most easily distinguished is layer II, which is comprised of two main cell populations; "stellate" neurons arranged into "islands" and small, round cells distributed within and below the stellate cells. Layer III contains sparse cells that are arranged into vertical clusters, whereas layer IV (lamina dissecans) is especially wide. Nine fields, named according to their rostral to caudal position, were distinguished based on further analyses of layer differentiation. The main features of the rostrocaudal differentiation are a gradual disappearance of "island" organization in layer II, increasing cortical thickness, and wider layers containing small and more densely packed cells. Cytoarchitectonic differentiation was determined by observation of specific histochemical patterns of AChE- and Timm-stained sections.
