We assayed various brain regions for levels of monoamines and their metabolites throughout the hibernation cycle of the golden-mantled ground squirrel Spermophilus lateralis. The tissue concentrations of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and their metabolites were determined in the parietal cortex, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and pons. Telencephalic regions exhibited the most significant variations in biogenic amine content. Cortical serotonin (5-HT) levels increased significantly at entrance (P less than 0.0001) relative to other periods of the hibernation cycle, suggesting a role for 5-HT in the initiation of hibernation. Among striatal dopamine (DA) metabolites, 3-methoxytyramine was detectable only during euthermia and arousal; from entrance through arousal, homovanillic acid (HVA) levels were half that found during euthermia (P = 0.0001); and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels increased during day 1 of hibernation (P less than 0.0005). Midbrain DA (P = 0.0295) and hippocampal HVA (P = 0.0194) levels also changed significantly across the hibernation bout. The absence of a consistent change in any monoamine or metabolite throughout the brain precludes the possibility of preferential temperature-dependent impairment of an enzyme involved in biogenic amine synthesis or degradation and suggests that the levels observed reflect changes in neural activity specific to each brain region. Together with previous studies of brain 2-deoxyglucose uptake throughout the hibernation cycle, these data indicate that a transient change in afferent monoaminergic metabolism and neurotransmission in the forebrain is a necessary component for the entrance to hibernation.
