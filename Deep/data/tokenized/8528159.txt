A model of a pair of electrotonically coupled CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons is presented. Each neuron is represented by a tapered equivalent cable attached to an isopotential soma. The synaptic potential in a neuron soma is determined as a consequence of electrical coupling to another soma that receives a synaptic input on its dendritic tree. Estimates of the coupling resistances, soma input resistances and soma-to-dendritic tree conductance ratio show that a substantial current may arise in a neuron as a consequence of synaptic activity in a neuron coupled to it. The small increase in decay time due to coupling in the model indicates that actual coupling is between more than just pairs of neurons.
