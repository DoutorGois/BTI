Thiopental-induced EEG beta activity recorded from mesial and lateral temporal lobe sites was analyzed both visually and by computer in 30 patients with complex partial seizures. All patients later received anterior temporal lobectomy. Volumetric cell densities and percentage of principal cell loss relative to normal controls were determined in several different areas of each resected temporal lobe. The percentage of drug-induced beta activity was then compared with the percentage of cell loss by (a) making precise topographic correlations between induced beta and cell loss, (b) relating the overall degree of left/right beta asymmetry to cell loss averaged over wide regions, and (c) comparing the likelihood of left/right beta asymmetries in patients with and without extreme cell loss. The results obtained were consistently negative and were unaffected by whether EEG data were analyzed by computer or visual inspection. These results indicate that the well-known loss of drug-induced beta activity found in epileptogenic regions is not an indicator of the degree of cell loss or sclerosis. The underlying focal dysfunction measured by EEG beta activity remains unknown, and factors such as focal hypoperfusion, hypometabolism, and the microanatomic features of the cells remaining in the focus should be investigated.
