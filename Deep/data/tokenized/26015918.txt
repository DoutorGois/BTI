BACKGROUND: A large number of natural products and dietary components have been evaluated as potential chemoprotective agents. In the present investigation we report the effects of treatment with the dietary antioxidant, pistachio, on cisplatin- or vincristine-induced neurotoxicity in male Wistar rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dietary pistachio (10%) was assessed for its neuroprotective effects through the alteration in performance of hippocampus- and cerebellum-related behaviors following chronic cisplatin (5 mg/kg) or vincristine (0.2 mg/kg) treatment in male rats. We also evaluated the effects of cisplatin, vincristine, and pistachio administration on nociception. Six behavioral tasks were used: open field, rotarod, grasping, Morris water maze (MWM), hot plate, and motor nerve conductive velocity (MNCV). RESULTS: We showed that the exposure of adolescent rats to cisplatin or vincristine resulted in a significant decrease in explorative behaviors and memory retention. Pistachio consumption somewhat improved memory and motor abilities in cisplatin- or vincristine-treated rats, while pistachio alone did not show any significant changes in these abilities compared to saline. Cisplatin and vincristine increased the latency of response to nociception, and pistachio did not reverse this effect. CONCLUSION: We conclude that pistachio in the diet following anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and vincristine might have a protective effect against anticancer drug-induced disruptions in motor and cognitive function. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms of this protective effect of pistachio.
