The effect of a toxin (JSTX) obtained from Nephila clavata (Joro spider) on the CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus was studied using slice preparations. JSTX blocked the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the pyramidal neuron evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation but was without effect on the antidromic action potentials or on the resting conductance. Depolarization induced by ionophoretic application of glutamate was readily suppressed by JSTX but aspartate-induced depolarization was much less sensitive to the toxin. Among preferential agonists activating 3 receptor subtypes for excitatory amino acids, quisqualate responses were most effectively suppressed by JSTX. Kainate responses were similarly suppressed but in some cells higher concentration of the toxin was needed to block the responses. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) responses were the least sensitive to JSTX but they were suppressed by +/- 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV). Long term potentiation (LTP) once it had taken place was not completely inhibited by APV. In the presence of JSTX, however, LTP was blocked and tetanic stimuli produced only a short-lived potentiation. In Mg2+ free solution, an orthodromic stimulation evoked repetitive spike responses which were superimposed on the depolarization following the initial spike. APV suppressed the depolarization and associated spikes leaving an orthodromic response which was sensitive to JSTX. The results suggest that JSTX blocks EPSPs in CA1 pyramidal neurons which are mediated by non-NMDA type receptors.
