A wide variety of species, including vertebrate and invertebrates, consume food in bouts (i.e., meals). Decades of research suggest that different mechanisms regulate meal initiation (when to start eating) versus meal termination (how much to eat in a meal, also known as satiety). There is a very limited understanding of the mechanisms that regulate meal onset and the duration of the postprandial intermeal interval (ppIMI). In the present review, we examine issues involved in measuring meal onset and some of the limited available evidence regarding how it is regulated. Then, we describe our recent work indicating that dorsal hippocampal neurons inhibit meal onset during the ppIMI and describe the processes that may be involved in this. We also synthesize recent evidence, including evidence from our laboratory, suggesting that overeating impairs hippocampal functioning and that impaired hippocampal functioning, in turn, contributes to the development and/or maintenance of diet-induced obesity. Finally, we identify critical questions and challenges for future research investigating neural controls of meal onset.
