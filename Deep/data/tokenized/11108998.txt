C-Fos and the Fos-related antigens (FRA) are induced by various stimuli. A novel 35-37 kDa FRA was induced much longer after the treatment using kainic acid (KA) and may be very important for neuronal survival after brain damage. To identify this long-term FRA, we have constructed a cDNA library derived from hippocampus after KA treatment and screened it with an antibody highly conserved M-peptide region of FRAs. One gene, MP13, was cloned with a 1662 bp open reading frame and coded for a 554-amino acid protein. MP13 has a leucine zipper region, a glutamine repeat region, and has high similarity to the activator of the small guanosine triphosphate (GTP)ase Rab5. Gel retardation analysis revealed that MP13 functions as a GTP regulation related factor.
