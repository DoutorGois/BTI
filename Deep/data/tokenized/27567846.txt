BACKGROUND: APOE varepsilon4 contributes to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis by amyloid-beta (Abeta)-dependent and Abeta-independent processes. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the APOE varepsilon4 influence on regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMglc) in the continuum of AD after Abeta adjustment. METHODS: We included 318 cognitively normal (CN) elderly, 498 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 178 AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. They had [18F] florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET conducted within 3 months of a clinical and cognitive assessment visit and APOE genotype. At first, the rCMglc differences between APOE varepsilon4 carriers (varepsilon4+) and non-carriers (varepsilon4-) were estimated on a voxel-based analysis using a 'two-sample t-test' design. In the second analysis, Abeta was added as covariate. RESULTS: In CN, varepsilon4+ showed reduced rCMglc compared to varepsilon4-in the bilateral frontal, temporal, and the left parietal regions. In MCI, varepsilon4+ showed reduced rCMglc compared to varepsilon4- in the bilateral posterior parietal, temporal, and left frontal regions. In AD, varepsilon4+ showed reduced rCMglc in the left hippocampus, right insular, and right temporal gyrus. However, after Abeta adjustment, the significant differences in the temporal regions were absent in CN and MCI, and none of the areas detected as significant in the first analysis were statistically significant in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that Abeta-independent APOE varepsilon4 influence on rCMglc is limited to the parietal and frontal, but not temporal lobes. These results suggest that APOE varepsilon4 may predispose for regional vulnerability according to Abeta-independent and Abeta-dependent processes.
