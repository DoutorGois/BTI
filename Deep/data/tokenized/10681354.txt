In a rabbit model of Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis, 5 mg of gemifloxacin mesylate (SB-265805) per kg/h reduced the bacterial titers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) almost as rapidly as 10 mg of ceftriaxone per kg/h (Deltalog CFU/ml/h +/- standard deviation [SD], -0.25 +/- 0.09 versus -0.38 +/- 0.11; serum and CSF concentrations of gemifloxacin were 2.1 +/- 1.4 mg/liter and 0.59 +/- 0.38 mg/liter, respectively, at 24 h). Coadministration of 1 mg of dexamethasone per kg did not affect gemifloxacin serum and CSF levels (2.7 +/- 1.4 mg/liter and 0.75 +/- 0.34 mg/liter, respectively, at 24 h) or activity (Deltalog CFU/ml/h +/- SD, -0.26 +/- 0.11).
