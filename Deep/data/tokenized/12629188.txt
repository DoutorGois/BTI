In the developing rat hippocampus, ictal epileptiform activity can be elicited easily in vitro during the first three postnatal weeks. Changes in neuronal ion transport during this time cause the effects of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-R) activation to shift gradually from strongly depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. It is not known whether the depolarizing effects of GABA and the propensity for ictal activity are causally linked. A key question is whether the GABA-mediated depolarization is excitatory, which we defined operationally as being sufficient to trigger action potentials. We assessed the effect of endogenous GABA on ictal activity and neuronal firing rate in hippocampal slices from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P30. In extracellular recordings, there was a strong correlation between the postnatal age at which GABA(A)-R antagonists decreased action potential frequency (P23) and the age at which ictal activity could be induced by elevated potassium (P23). In addition, there was a strong correlation between the fraction of slices in which ictal activity was induced by elevated potassium concentrations and the fractional decrease in action potential firing when GABA(A)-Rs were blocked in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Finally, ictal activity induced by elevated potassium was blocked by the GABA(A)-R antagonists bicuculline and SR-95531 (gabazine) and increased in frequency and duration by GABA(A)-R agonists isoguvacine and muscimol. Thus, the propensity of the developing hippocampus for ictal activity is highly correlated with the effect of GABA on action potential probability and reversed by GABA(A) antagonists, indicating that GABA-mediated excitation is causally linked to ictal activity in this developmental window.
