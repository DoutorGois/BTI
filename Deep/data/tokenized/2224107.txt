By the method of liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection dopamine level increase was shown within 2 min after immunization of rats with sheep red blood cells in n. caudatus. In 20 min after the immune response the acceleration of dopamine metabolism was observed in nuclei A9, A10, A11, accumbens, in amygdala, hypothalamus and hippocampus. In immunocompetent organs dopamine level was changed in 24 h after the immunization.
