A mix of peptides and amino acids obtained from porcine brain tissue (Cerebrolysin) has been shown to affect passive avoidance behavior in neonatal rats. To identify the active components and mechanisms of action, Cerebrolysin effects were studied in in vitro hippocampal slices. Cerebrolysin induced dose-dependent suppression followed by a small rebound increase of synaptic responses in the CA1 but not dentate gyrus neurons. These actions may be due to peptides present in Cerebrolysin and may contribute to its reported behavioural effects.
