Electrical stimulation of the hippocampus (HPC) and of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) were found to have the same 24 h delayed effect on choline acetyltransferase activity. Since previous experiments demonstrated that these treatments had the same effect on memory storage processes, the present finding and earlier neurochemical investigations suggest that HPC and LH stimulation might act through a common hippocampal cholinergic mechanism.
