Activity of histochemically determined glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, was qualitatively determined in layer III and V neurons of the sensorimotor cortex and neurons of the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus (CA3) in mature male Wistar rats with high and low locomotor activity in an open field. A negative correlation was revealed between locomotion of Wistar rats in the open field and activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the sensorimotor cortex, especially in efferent layer V neurons and neurons of the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens, which attested to different capacity of the brain in Wistar rats with high and low open-field locomotion to regeneration of phosphopyridine nucleotides (NADP(+)) and production of pentoses via the pentose phosphate shunt.
