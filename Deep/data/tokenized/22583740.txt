Magnetic resonance (MR) findings in cases of total asphyxia, whose lesions are mainly in the brainstem and deep nuclei, have not been clarified. In this study, we investigated MR images in neonates with total asphyxia. MR images of six infants (three males and three females; gestational age, 35-39 weeks; birth weights, 1880-3572 g) with total asphyxia were examined. In all subjects, neonatal cortical MR lesions were limited to the hippocampus with highlighting on T1-weighted imaging (T1-WI). The neonatal MR lesions of the cerebral white matter were limited to the white matter between the insula and putamen in four infants, and were diffusely involved in two infants. The ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus was hyperintense on T1-WI in all of the subjects. Other nuclei in the thalamus, the globus pallidus and the putamen were involved in neonatal MR images of all subjects. High intensity areas on T2- weighted imaging were observed at the dorsal areas in the midbrain, pons and medulla oblongata in all or most of the subjects at the neonatal period. Also, high intensity areas on T1-WI were observed in the tegmentum of the pons and the midbrain in five cases. Neonates with total asphyxia had lesions mainly in the tegmentem of the brainstem, thalamus, putamen and globus palludus. Some of the infants had extensive lesions of the white matter.
