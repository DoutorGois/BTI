Explants and cells of nervous tissue were cultivated in the presence of aethanol, tween 80, dimethylformamid (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO) and the influence upon the index of area, the growth rate and fiber index was observed. They are important to solutions of drugs for tests in vitro. At the beginning of the cultivation aethanol in vitro influenced the regeneration of nerve fibers from explants and cells. A significant increase of the index of growth was observed. After a long term influence of tween 80, DMF and DMSO an inhibition of differentiation of neurons in vitro was observed.
