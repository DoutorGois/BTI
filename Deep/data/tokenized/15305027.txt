We reported previously that chronic hypoperfusion induced by permanent occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (2VO) in rats caused progressive cognitive deficits and neuronal damage in the hippocampus and the white matter. These changes are similar to those observed in human dementia. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) differential display was carried out to identify mRNAs encoding the intrinsic factors involved in permanent ischemia from the 2VO rat brain. Over 20 clones which showed different expression levels in 2VO and sham-operated rats were isolated. One of these, named vof-16, was markedly enhanced the expression by 2VO. The whole sequence of vof-16 mRNA was 2098 nt. The distribution of vof-16 transcripts was examined by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. The results revealed that vof-16 was abundant in the hippocampus, the tenia tecta, the piriform cortex and the area around the aorta. The expression levels of vof-16 in 2VO and sham-operated rat hippocampus were determined by a quantitative PCR method. The expression was abundant in the hippocampus of rats with cognitive impairment induced by 2VO. In contrast, the expression levels of vof-16 were lower in the 2VO rats with no impairment and in sham-operated rats. These results suggest that the expression levels of vof-16 may be related to the cognitive impairment induced by chronic ischemia after 2VO.
