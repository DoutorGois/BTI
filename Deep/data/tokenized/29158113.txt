Treatment of fasted mice and rats with the nonselective muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine or atropine, causes convulsions after food intake. This study evaluated the effect of fasting on the expression of M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in the brain regions, the relationship between receptor expression and seizure stages, and the muscarinic receptor subtype which plays a role in the occurrence of convulsions. Mice were grouped as allowed to eat ad lib (fed) and deprived of food for 24h (fasted). Fasted animals developed convulsions after being treated with scopolamine (60%) or the selective M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (10mg/kg; 20% and 60mg/kg; 70%) and given food. Fasting increased expression of M1 receptors in the frontal cortex and M2 receptors in the hippocampus, but produced no change in the expression of both receptors in the amygdaloid complex. Food intake after fasting decreased M1 receptor expression in the frontal cortex and M1 and M2 receptor expression in the hippocampus. Seizure severity was uncorrelated with muscarinic receptor expression in the brain regions. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for the role of M1 muscarinic receptor antagonism and fasting-induced increases in M1 and M2 expression possible underlying mechanism in the occurrence of convulsions in fasted animals.
