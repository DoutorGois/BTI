Neurochemical and morphological effects of neonatal anoxia on monoamine systems were studied after 100% N2 exposure for 25 min at 30 h postnatally (postnatal day 2-P2). At 20 min after anoxia, reductions of tissue levels of cerebellar noradrenaline (NA) and striatal dopamine (DA) and metabolites were seen, while 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was increased in cortex and cerebellum. At P7, NA increased in cerebellum, while serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HIAA decreased in cortex and cerebellum. At P21, increased hippocampal NA and striatal homovanillic acid (HVA) were found, while striatal 5-HT decreased and 5-HIAA increased in striatum and hippocampus. At P60, striatal 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 5-HIAA levels were found to be enhanced. No effects were seen on 5-HT, tyrosine hydroxylase, or DARPP-32 immunostaining in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Thus, the neonatal anoxia induced both acute and persistent neurochemical abnormalities in monoamine systems that were not accompanied by morphological changes detectable with the methods used. The monoamine alterations found could be critically connected to the behavioral disturbances observed in rats after neonatal anoxia. The findings may also be of relevance to dysfunctions seen in humans after perinatal oxygen deficiency, e.g., the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder syndrome.
