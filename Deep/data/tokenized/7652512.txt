Cytokines consist of a group of polypeptides, whose main functions are considered to be mediating the non-specific immune reaction and promoting differentiation, proliferation and growth of white blood cells. But according to recent studies, these cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their receptors are also found in the central nervous system (CNS) and may play a role in modulating the physiological functions of neuronal and glial cells in CNS. In review, we summarize the representative studies concerning mainly the interleukins' effects on the hippocampus.
