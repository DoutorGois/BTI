Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindling represents a model of a primarily generalized epilepsy. We investigated the role of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in this model of epilepsy by destruction of this structure by colchicine, injected in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of rats. After a period of 7 days PTZ-kindling was started. The kindling development was slightly accelerated in colchicine treated animals compared to control rats. After kindling completion the learning performance of the rats was tested in a shuttle-box experiment. The learning deficit found in fully kindled rats was not influenced by colchicine pretreatment. However, colchicine itself impaired the learning performance of rats in the shuttle-box.
