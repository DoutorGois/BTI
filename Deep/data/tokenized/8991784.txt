In the present study, we measured the effects of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced status epilepticus on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in rats at postnatal age 10 (P10) or 21 days (P21). Seizures were induced by the repetitive injection of subconvulsive doses of PTZ until the onset of status epilepticus characterized as the loss of quadruped posture. The BBB permeability changes to the poorly diffusible amino acid [14C] alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) were measured by autoradiography at 10 min after the onset of status epilepticus. Seizures induced a generalized increase in BBB permeability to AIB that was significant in 22 and 26 regions out of the 34 studied at P10 and P21, respectively. Highest increases over control levels (> 250%) were recorded at both ages in interpeduncular nucleus, raphe nuclei and trigeminal nerve tractus. Quite high increases (> 150%) were recorded in cortical, inferior collicular and thalamic areas at P10 and in inferior colliculus, cerebellar cortex, hypothalamic and thalamic regions at P21. Cerebral blood volume measured with [14C]sucrose over a 2-min period was significantly increased over control levels in hypothalamus and cerebellum at P10 and in all brain regions, except hippocampus and brainstem, at P21. The widespread increase in BBB permeability is at least partly related to the blood pressure increase, 55 and 22% over control values at P10 and P21, respectively. In the P10 rat, generalized BBB leakage appears to be correlated to the widespread increase in cerebral metabolic and blood flow rates that we recorded previously in the same experimental conditions. Conversely, at P21, as previously shown in adults, there is a mismatch between the nature of the structures with increased BBB permeability and the regional distribution of cerebral blood flow and metabolism changes induced by PTZ seizures.
