PURPOSE: We determined how CA3-driven interictal discharges block ictal activity generated in the entorhinal cortex during bath application of 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 microM). METHODS: Field potential and [K+]o recordings were obtained from mouse combined hippocampus-entorhinal cortex slices maintained in vitro. RESULTS: 4AP induced N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent ictal discharges that originated in the entorhinal cortex, disappeared over time, but were reestablished by cutting the Schaffer collateral (n = 20) or by depressing CA3 network excitability with local application of glutamatergic receptor antagonists (n = 5). In addition, two types of interictal activity occurred throughout the experiment. The first type was CA3 driven and was abolished by a non-NMDA glutamatergic receptor antagonist. The second type was largely contributed by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor-mediated conductances and persisted during blockade of glutamatergic transmission. The absence of CA3-driven interictal discharges in the entorhinal cortex after Schaffer collateral cut facilitated the GABA-mediated interictal potentials that corresponded to large [K+]o elevations and played a role in ictal discharge initiation. Accordingly, ictal discharges along with GABA-mediated interictal potentials disappeared during GABAA-receptor blockade (n = 7) or activation of mu-opioid receptors that inhibit GABA release (n = 4). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CA3-driven interictal events restrain ictal discharge generation in the entorhinal cortex by modulating the size of interictal GABA-mediated potentials that lead to large [K+]o elevations capable of initiating ictal discharges in this structure.
