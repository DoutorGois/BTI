This work shows a comparative study on the effects of chronic mild stress upon learning and memory and immunity, in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Stressed BALB/c, but not C57Bl/6 mice, showed a poor learning performance, morphological alterations in the hippocampus with an increase in oxidative stress. A correlation between poor memory performance and the increase of the Th2/Th1 balance was found. Our results suggest that vulnerability to cognitive deficit associated with stress exposition could be related to a differential regulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, suggesting a better learning performance for individuals that produce Th1 type cytokine after stress exposition.
