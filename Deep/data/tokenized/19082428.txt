To detect the effect of PDZ1, domain of postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), on apoptosis of hippocampal neurons induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), Sprague-Dawley rat hippocampal neurons were infected with PDZ1-viruses after 21 days of plating. Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were treated with OGD for 1.5 h, then were incubated with DAPI and apoptosis-like cells were characterized, or were collected for co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. The results showed that: (1) PDZ1 overexpression was observed in hippocampal neurons; (2) Apoptosis induced by OGD was obviously decreased in neurons overexpressing PDZ1 (P<0.05); (3) Overexpression of PDZ1 prevented the binding of GluR6 to PSD-95; (4) Overexpression of PDZ1 inhibited MLK3 and JNK1/2 activation induced by OGD. These results indicate that overexpression of PDZ1 may prevent hippocampal neurons from apoptosis induced by OGD.
