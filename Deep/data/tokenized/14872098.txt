Calcium and its regulation play central roles diverse physiologic processes. Quantification of calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]) in small neuronal compartments is crucial to understanding Ca2+-dependent signaling. Here, we describe techniques that are optimized for 2-photon imaging of [Ca2+] dynamics in small compartments such as dendrites and dendritic spines.
