The male reproductive tracts of Drosophila display considerable variation in the relative size of their components, notably of the testes, but there are few structural differences between species. Here we report a remarkable coiled structure separating the testes from the seminal vesicles in the giant sperm species Drosophila bifurca. This evolutionary novelty, known as the 'sperm roller', seems to be an exaggeration in the size of the testicular duct as revealed by light and electron microscopic observations. It consists of a tubular monocellular epithelium lying on the basal laminae and muscle and conjunctive cells. The lumen of the roller contains crypts. The apical membrane of the epithelial cells presents numerous long microvilli protruding into the lumen. The sperm roller structure is probably involved in managing sperm during their transit through the male genital tract, because sperm are seen in bundles at the base of the testis, whereas they are singly rolled up by the time they enter the seminal vesicles. The hypercoiling of the individual spermatozoon within the roller probably occurs as the result of an osmotic process produced by features of the epithelial wall and the dramatically increased exchange surface. This is the first report of a specialized device of this type in Drosophila or, more generally, in insects.
