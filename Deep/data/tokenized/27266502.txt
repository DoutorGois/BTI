OBJECTIVE: To investigate the positive effects of mouse nerve growth factor(mNGF) on cognitive impairment in whole brain irradiation rats. METHODS: Fifty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control group, mNGF treated group, saline treated group.mNGF treated group and saline treated group were cranial irradiated at a single dose of 12 Gy by X-ray.30 days after radiation each group were treated with correspondent drugs.60 days after radiation, Morris water maze experiment, EB leakage of the brain, and expressions of neuN, vWF, ZO-1 in hippocampus by immunofluorescence, and expressions of neuN, vWF, ZO-1, VEGF and GFAP in hippocampus by Western blot were tested and analyzed. RESULTS: The escape latencies: normal control group< mNGF treated group< saline treated group; the numbers of crossing hidden platform in these 3 groups were 3.00+/- 1.08, 1.50+/- 1.08, 0.38+/- 0.48 times (P<0.01). EB leakage of these 3 groups were 0.14+/-0.14, 0.66+/-0.20 and 1.36+/-0.27 mug/g (P<0.05). In immunofluorescence, expressions of neuN, vWF and ZO-1: normal control group> mNGF treated group> saline treated group.In Western blot, expressions of neuN, vWF and ZO-1: normal control group> mNGF treated group> saline treated group, yet the expressions of VEGF and GFAP: normal control group< mNGF treated group< saline treated group. CONCLUSION: mNGF ameliorates cognitive impairment after whole brain irradiation.
