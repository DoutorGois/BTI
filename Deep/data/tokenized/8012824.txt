Untreated rats and rats given the A1 receptor adenosine agonist, R-phenylisopropyladenosine (R-PIA), were subjected to four vessel ischemia. The effect of R-PIA on hippocampal amino acid release, hippocampal neuronal damage, exploratory behavior, learning capacity and global neurological score were evaluated. R-PIA decreased by half the glutamate released during ischemia and improved the global neurological scores 3, 24, 48, 78 h and 7 days after ischemia. But R-PIA had no effect on taurine/GABA release (during ischemia), hippocampal neuronal damage (7 days post-ischemia), exploratory behavior (48 h post-ischemia) or learning capacity (7 days post-ischemia). Thus, a decrease in glutamate release by R-PIA is not systematically correlated with an improvement of histological damage or learning capacity. Reduced glutamate release is not therefore a sufficient criterion on which to evaluate the neuroprotective capacity of a drug.
