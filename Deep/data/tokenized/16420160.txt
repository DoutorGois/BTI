Rats received kindling stimulations to the perirhinal cortex (PRh), ventral hippocampus (VH), or dorsal hippocampus (DH) in 1 environment and an equivalent number of sham stimulations in a 2nd environment. The PRh-kindled rats displayed rapid kindling and a swift emergence of conditioned interictal defensiveness. In contrast, the VH- and DH-kindled rats displayed much slower kindling and slow or no conditioning, respectively. No effects of conditioning on the convulsions, comparable with those associated with amygdala kindling, were observed. These results establish the generality of some of the previously reported kindling-related conditioned effects, confirm the site specificity of some of these effects, and suggest that the convulsions, rather than the stimulations, function as the unconditioned stimuli for the conditioning of interictal behavior.
