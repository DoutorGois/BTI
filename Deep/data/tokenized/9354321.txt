The intact hippocampal formation (IHF) of neonatal or young rats can be kept alive for an extended period in a fully submerged chamber with excellent morphological preservation. Field or patch-clamp recordings, intracellular Ca2+ measurements, and 3-D reconstruction of biocytin-filled neurons can be performed routinely. The generation and propagation of network-driven activities can be studied within the IHF or between connected intact structures such as the septum and the hippocampus or two hippocampi, and the use of a dual chamber enables the application of drugs separately to each structure. This preparation will be useful to study intact neuronal networks in the developing hippocampus in vitro.
