To evaluate the possible contribution of bioenergetic failure in the particular brain regions to the pathomechanism of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (LCMRglue) was evaluated from [3H]-deoxyglucose uptake in frontal, visual and auditory cortex, striatum, cerebellum and medulla oblongata of rats with acute HE induced with a hepatotoxin--thioacetamide (TAA). HE caused a decrease of LCMRglue in all the regions studied. The strongest decrease (about 65%) was noted in hippocampus and cerebral cortex--the two regions rich in glutamatergic neurons. The results indicate a possible link between decreased energy metabolism and impaired excitatory, glutamatergic neurotransmission--the two factors whose contribution to HE has so far been implicated separately.
