Retention parameters (log k') of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives--a new class of 5-HT1A receptor ligands--were determined on the basis of reversed-phase HPLC experiments. Good correlations were found between the log k' values and the calculated log Pc, van der Waals volume of the R substituent (VR) as well as the 5-HT1A receptor affinity (Ki) of the investigated compounds. It was demonstrated that hydrophobic forces played a pivotal role in stabilizing the ligand-receptor bioactive complex for that group of compounds.
