Perinatal asphyxia (PA) was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats; pups were sacrificed 3 days, 3 weeks, and 3 months following the asphyctic insult, and hippocampal protein levels were determined by a gel-based proteomic method. Levels of antioxidant, metabolic, cytoskeleton, signaling, channel, proteasomal, chaperone, splicing, and synaptosomal proteins were dysregulated depending on the age following induction of PA. These proteins are proposed to be potential markers or pharmacological targets for PA.
