Brain gangliosides of rats trained in a conditioned avoidance Sidman task and undisturbed rats in their cages were studied. The (14C) acetate was injected intracerebrally seven days before the starting of 30 days training. Thirty-seven days after injection all rats were killed and ganglioside fractions were isolated from neocortex, hippocampus, brain stem, cerebellum and residual cerebral tissue of each one brain. Trained rats had higher levels of (14C)-labeled polysialogangliosides (G1, G2, G3) in hippocampus and neocortex than the controls. Regarding the rest of the brain areas, a significant increase of G2 in the residual cerebral tissue of the trained as compared with the controls was found. The results suggest that the sialic acid rich gangliosides of only certain parts of the brain are affected by the Sidman avoidance conditioning of the animals.
