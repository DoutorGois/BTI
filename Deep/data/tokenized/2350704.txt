Axons arising in the hippocampal formation form asymmetric synapses with glutamate decarboxylase-immunoreactive neurons in nucleus accumbens. The postsynaptic targets included many spines, and less frequently dendritic shafts and perikarya. Some immunolabelled neurons resemble medium-sized, spiny projection neurons which suggests that the input from the hippocampal formation exerts a strong and direct influence on output pathways of nucleus accumbens.
