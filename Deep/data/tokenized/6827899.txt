Local injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the median raphe nucleus of rats pretreated with desipramine decreases the serotonin content of the hippocampus and cortex. The turnover of acetylcholine, as measured by the rate of decline of acetylcholine content after hemicholinium-3, is not affected in the hippocampus or the striatum, but is increased in the cortex by such treatment. Local injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the dorsal raphe nucleus of desipramine-treated rats decreases the serotonin content of the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum. The turnover of acetylcholine is increased in the hippocampus and cortex, but not affected in the striatum. Thus, serotonergic neurons from the median raphe nucleus appear to tonically inhibit cholinergic neurons in the cortex, and serotonergic neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus appear to tonically inhibit cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. These serotonergic neurons do not appear to act tonically on striatal cholinergic neurons.
