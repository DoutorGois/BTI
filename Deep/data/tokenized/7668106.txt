AIM: To compare the densities of opioid receptors in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with those of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats in central nervous system which are related to the regulation of BP. METHODS: [3H] Etorphine, a nonspecific opioid ligand, was used to determine the distributions of opioid receptors in 16-wk-old SHR and WKY rats by quantitative autoradiography. RESULTS: The densities of [3H]etorphine in hippocampus (P < 0.01), periaqueductal gray, nucleus of the solitary tract, and thoracic (T4-6) spinal cord (P < 0.05) of SHR were lower than those of WKY rats. But in basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (P < 0.01), habenular nuclei (P < 0.05), and hypothalamic nuclei including arcuate nucleus (P < 0.01), higher densities of opioid receptors were found in SHR. No difference existed in interpeduncular nuclei between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The difference in distributions of opioid receptors is related to the hypertension in SHR.
