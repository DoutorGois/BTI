Because of the possible risk factor for the health, World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the study with animals on the developing nervous system concerning the exposure to radiofrequency (RF) field. A few studies related to hippocampal exposure are available, which indicate the impact of RF field in some parameters. The present study investigated the effect of exposure to mobile phone on developing hippocampus. Male and female Swiss albino mice were housed as control and mobile phone exposed groups. The pregnant animals in tested group were exposed to the effects of mobile phone in a room possessing the exposure system. The left hemispheres of the brains were processed by frozen microtome. The sections obtained were stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin. For cell counting by the optical fractionator method, a pilot study was first performed. Hippocampal areas were analyzed using Axiovision software running on a personal computer. The optical dissector, systematically and randomly spaced, was focused to the widest profile of the pyramidal cell nucleus. No significant difference in pyramidal cell number of total Cornu Ammonis (CA) sectors of hippocampus was found between the control and the mobile phone exposed groups (p > .05). It was concluded that further study is needed in this field due to popular use of mobile telephones and relatively high exposure to the developing brain.
