Protein kinase C was studied in various brain areas in aging Wistar rats. Histone-directed kinase activity from the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum did not change with aging. Using purified protein B-50 as a substrate, between 3 and 8 months a decrease in in vitro phosphorylation was detected in the membrane fraction of the cortex but after this age values remained stable. In hippocampal membranes, B-50 phosphorylation was increased in aged rats. PKC translocation was impaired in aged rats in both the cortex and the hippocampus. PKC alpha and beta mRNA decreased in the cortex between 3 and 8 months with no further decline in aged animals. Hippocampal mRNA for calcium-dependent PKC isoforms was not modified during aging, as assessed by Northern and in situ hybridization. Western blot analysis revealed a change in PKC gamma protein only, which was increased in hippocampal membranes from aged rats. The data indicate that the key PKC function that is impaired in aged rats is enzyme translocation irrespective of the brain area investigated.
