Portions of the ependyma were obtained from the hippocampus of adult rabbits and processed for scanning electron microscopy. The major part of the ependymal surface was covered with a dense layer of cilia, some of these cilia showed bulbous preterminal enlargements. Irregularly arranged pits of variable diameter were also seen. Pes hippocampi showed fewer cilia and deeper furrows than did the remainder of the hippocampus.
