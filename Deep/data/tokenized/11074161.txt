Limbic epilepsy is a chronic condition associated with a broad zone of seizure onset and pathology. Studies have focused mainly on the hippocampus, but there are indications that changes occur in other regions of the limbic system. This study used in vitro intracellular recording and histology to examine alterations to the physiology and anatomy of the basal nucleus of the amygdala in a rat model of chronic limbic epilepsy characterized by spontaneously recurring seizures. Epileptic pyramidal neuron responses evoked by stria terminalis stimulation revealed hyperexcitability characterized by multiple action potential bursts and no evident inhibitory potentials. In contrast, no hyperexcitability was observed in amygdalar neurons from kindled (included as a control for seizure activity) or control rats. Blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors unmasked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in epileptic pyramidal neurons. Control, kindled and epileptic inhibitory potentials were predominantly biphasic, with fast and slow components, but a few cells exhibited only the fast component (2/12 in controls, 0/3 in kindled, 3/10 in epileptic). Epileptic fast inhibitory potentials had a more rapid onset and shorter duration than control and kindled. Approximately 40% of control neurons exhibited spontaneous inhibitory potentials; no spontaneous inhibitory potentials were observed in neurons from kindled or epileptic rats. A preliminary histological examination revealed no gross alterations in the basal amygdala from epileptic animals. These results extend previous findings from this laboratory that hyperexcitability is found in multiple epileptic limbic regions and may be secondary to multiple alterations in excitatory and inhibitory efficacy. Because there were no differences between control and kindled animals, the changes observed in the epileptic animals are unlikely to be secondary to recurrent seizures.
