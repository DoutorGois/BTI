A fatal encephalomyelitis was developed after intracerebral and hind limb inoculation of in 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice by the inoculation of fixed rabies virus (CVS-11 strain), intracerebrally and into hind. After the intracerebral inoculation, virus antigens were detected in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus at 2 days postinoculation (PI), and later spread centrifugally to thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum, spinal cord and spinal ganglia. At 4 days PI, severe apoptosis and DNA fragmentation were observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. All mice infected intracerebrally were dead without limb paralysis at from 10 to 11 days PI. In contrast, mice infected with virus intramuscularly were persistently observed virus antigens in the myocytes at the site of inoculation from 2 days PI. At 4 days PI, the antigens were demonstrated in the spinal dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord and muscle spindles without their detection in the cerebrum and hippocampus. There were no apoptosis in the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia, however hind limb paralysis was found in all infected mice. Hind limb paralysis was progressed to quadriparalysis, and mice were dead from 11 to 13 days PI. From 4 days PI, necrosis of neuron was observed in the the spinal and dorsal ganglia with infiltration of lymphocyte. This study suggested that the necrosis of spinal neurons was more important to cause the paralysis of hind limb rather than the severe cerebral infection and apoptosis in C57BL/6J mice infected with CVS-11 strain. The virus primarily replicated in the muscles was ascended the spinal cord via afferent fibers and retrogradely invaded the cerebrum, and with subsequent spread to muscle spindles.
