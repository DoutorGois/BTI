Prophylactic drug injection directly onto a seizure focus has the potential to improve seizure control with fewer side effects than is produced by systemic therapy. Using a dose-response model, we evaluated the effectiveness of adenosine application for focal seizure prophylaxis in 12 rats. Total spikes and electroencephalographic ictal events were reduced significantly by treatment with adenosine compared to control (P < 0.0001). This study demonstrates effectiveness and feasibility in a model system using intracranial injection of adenosine to prevent epileptiform events.
