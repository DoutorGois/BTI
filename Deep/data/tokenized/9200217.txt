The possible protective action of pramiracetam, a pyrrolidinone nootropic drug, against hypobaric hypoxia was studied in two age groups of immature rats with implanted electrodes. Epileptic afterdischarges induced by hippocampal stimulation were used as a measure of hypoxic damage. Pramiracetam did not substantially change these afterdischarges in 12- and 18-day-old rat pups which were not exposed to hypoxia. Hypobaric hypoxia (simulated altitude of 7000 m for one hour) led to prolongation of the first afterdischarge in both age groups. Pramiracetam did not influence this prolongation in 12-day-old rats. The first afterdischarge was shortened significantly in 18-day-old animals but not to the level of rats not exposed to hypoxia. The afterdischarges elicited by repeated stimulations (four times at 10 min intervals) did not differ in pramiracetam-treated and control rats.
