The influence of pulsed magnetic fields (PMFs) on nonsynaptic potentials recorded from the central and peripheral nervous system in vitro has been investigated. The population spikes (PSs) recorded from hippocampal slices during antidromic stimulation and compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the segments of the sciatic nerve were used as indicators of neuronal activity. The potentials recorded from both preparations were significantly and permanently enhanced following PMF (0.16 Hz, 15 mT) exposure. The increase in the antidromic PS occurred even in the presence of potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA) and was accompanied by multiple spiking. Among all frequencies of PMF tested (0.5, 0.16, 0.07, 0.03, 0.0 Hz), the frequency of 0.5 Hz was the most effective in enhancement of potential amplitude. The influence of PMF on the amplitude of two CAPs evoked by the pair of electrical stimuli applied in rapid succession has also been evaluated. In control conditions the potential triggered by the second stimuli was slightly smaller expressing the phenomenon of short-term depression (STD). Although PMF exposure amplified the amplitude of both potentials, the increase in the size of the first potential was significantly greater increasing further the magnitude of STD. The blocking of potassium channels reversed STD into facilitation. One of the possible mechanisms involved in PMF action could be the modification of the axonal threshold, which was significantly reduced following exposure to PMF.
