The contribution of the Ca(2+) sensor S100A1 to in vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathobiology has not been elucidated although S100A1 regulates numerous cellular processes linked to AD. This study uses genetic ablation to ascertain the effects of S100A1 on neuroinflammation, beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaque deposition and Akt activity in the PSAPP AD mouse model. PSAPP/S100A1(-/-) mice exhibited decreases in astrocytosis (GFAP burden), microgliosis (Iba1 burden) and plaque load/number when compared to PSAPP/S100A1(+/+) mice at six and twelve months of age. The presence of detectable S100A1 staining in human AD specimens is consistent with a detrimental gain of S100A1 function in AD. S100A1 ablation also reduced plaque associated and increased non-plaque associated PO4-Akt and PO4-GSK3beta staining. S100A1.Akt complexes were undetectable in PC12 cells and AD brain tissue suggesting that S100A1 indirectly modulates Akt activity. In contrast, S100A1.RyR (ryanodine receptor) complexes were present in human/mouse AD brain and exhibited Ca(2+)-dependent formation in neuronal cells. This is the first direct demonstration of an S100A1. target protein complex in tissue/cells and identifies the RyR as a primary S100A1 target protein in the brain. Collectively, these data suggest that S100A1 inhibition may be a novel strategy for normalizing aberrant Ca(2+) signaling in AD.
