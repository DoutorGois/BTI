The aim of this study was to determine the effect of aging on the high-affinity choline uptake (HACU) and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) in the brain of Wistar male rats and to define more precisely the steps of the brain cholinergic degeneration in the course of the whole animal life. In 24-month-old rats, a substantial decrease in HACU values in the hippocampus (to 65-75%) and in the density of mAChR in the cortex (to 76%) was found in comparison with 3-month-old controls. The interaction of muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine with [(3)H]QNB indicated a decrease in low-affinity sites (M(2)) in 24-month-old rats. The first slight changes due to aging manifested themselves by the reduction in HACU values very early (between 6 and 12 months), the decrease of the muscarinic receptor density was observed in a later stage (19-month-old animals). Regression analysis indicated considerable dependence of the HACU values on age (the correlation coefficient r = -0.689, the slope b = -0.279 pmol/4 min per mg(prot) per month, P < 0.001) while the density of muscarinic receptors does not correlate with age so markedly (r = -0.415, b = -6.316 fmol/mg(prot) per month, P = 0.018).
