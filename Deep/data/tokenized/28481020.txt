A-type K(+) channels (IA channels) contribute to learning and memory mechanisms by regulating neuronal excitabilities in the CNS, and their expression level is targeted by Ca(2+) influx via synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) during long-term potentiation (LTP). However, it is not clear how local synaptic Ca(2+) changes induce IA downregulation throughout the neuron, extending from the active synapse to the soma. In this study, we tested if two major receptors of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ryanodine (RyRs), and IP3 (IP3 R) receptors, are involved in Ca(2+) -mediated IA downregulation in cultured hippocampal neurons of rats. The downregulation of IA channels was induced by doubling the Ca(2+) concentration in culture media (3.6 mM for 24 hrs) or treating with glycine (200 muM for 3 min) to induce chemical LTP (cLTP), and the changes in IA peaks were measured electrophysiologically by a whole-cell patch. We confirmed that Ca(2+) or glycine treatment significantly reduced IA peaks and that their effects were abolished by blocking NMDARs or voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (VDCCs). In this cellular processing, blocking RyRs (by ryanodine, 10 muM) but not IP3 Rs (by 2APB, 100 muM) completely abolished IA downregulation, and the LTP observed in hippocampal slices was more diminished by ryanodine rather than 2APB. Furthermore, blocking RyRs also reduced Ca(2+) -mediated PKA activation, indicating that sequential signaling cascades, including the ER and PKA, are involved in regulating IA downregulation. These results strongly suggest a possibility that RyR contribution and mediated IA downregulation are required to regulate membrane excitability as well as synaptic plasticity in CA3-CA1 connections of the hippocampus.
