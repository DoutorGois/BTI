The objective of study was to investigate changes caused by ovariectomy (OVX) on aversive and non-aversive memories, as well as on cytoskeleton phosphorylating system and on vitamin D receptor (VDR) immunocontent in hippocampus. The neuroprotective role of vitamin D was also investigated. Ninety-day-old female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: SHAM, OVX, VITAMIN D and OVX + VITAMIN D; 30 days after the OVX, vitamin D supplementation (500 IU/kg), by gavage, for 30 days was started. Results showed that OVX impaired short-term and long-term recognition, and long-term aversive memories. OVX altered hippocampal cytoskeleton phosphorylating system, evidenced by the hyperphosphorylation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), low molecular weight neurofilament subunit (NFL), medium molecular weight neurofilament subunit (NFM) and high molecular weight neurofilament subunit (NFH), and increased the immunocontent of c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNK), Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (PKCaMII) and of the sites phosphorylated lysine-serine-proline (KSP) repeats, Ser55 and Ser57. Vitamin D reversed the effects caused by OVX on cytoskeleton in hippocampus, but it was not able to reverse the effects on memory.
