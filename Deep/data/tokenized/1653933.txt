Benzodiazepines are psychoactive substances classically used for their anticonvulsant properties in neonates as well as in adults. In a previous work, we have shown that seizures lead to an age-dependent upregulation of central benzodiazepine binding sites measured in isolated rat cerebral membranes. However, information concerning regional changes in the receptor density was lacking. In our present study, the effects of bicuculline-induced seizures were investigated by quantitative autoradiography of central benzodiazepine receptors in developing rats and in adults. Animals were killed 30 min after an intraperitoneal injection of either saline or a convulsive dose of bicuculline. Benzodiazepine binding sites in brain sections were labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam. Generalized seizures induced a widespread increase in benzodiazepine receptors, with a marked enhancement in structures that mediate seizure activity, such as substantia nigra, amygdala, septum, and hippocampus. The addition of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid to the incubation medium increased benzodiazepine binding by the same order of magnitude whether rats were given saline or bicuculline, suggesting that additional benzodiazepine sites are also functionally linked to gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. The age-related postictal increase in benzodiazepine receptors might reflect a compensatory response for protection against recurrent seizures, especially in newborns.
