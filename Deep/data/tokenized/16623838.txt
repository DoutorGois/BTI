One hundred and seven cells were recorded extracellularly in hippocampal formation (HPC) slices during carbachol-induced theta. The data obtained provided evidence of a population of HPC neurons which, when activated cholinergically, participate in the generation of in vitro theta. The activity patterns of in vitro recorded theta-related cells were shown to be similar to those of theta-related cells recorded in vivo and cells recorded in vitro during cholinergically induced theta, and non-theta intervals were successfully classified according to previously developed criteria for in vivo recorded theta-related cells. The current in vitro experiments showed that, in addition to theta-on and theta-off cells, the HPC contained cells that were probably involved in programming the appearance and duration of theta epochs and the intervals between theta epochs. These novel types of cells were termed 'gating cells'.
