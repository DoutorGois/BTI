Tris-HCl or Laemmli sample buffer extracted frontal lobe and hippocampal samples from normal aged and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects were used to determine total ubiquitin (Ub), distribution of monomeric Ub and Ub-protein conjugates and amyloid enhancing factor (AEF) activity using the dot-blot, Western blot and mouse AEF bioassay techniques, respectively. The AD samples, as compared to the normals, demonstrated a 1.7-fold increase in total Ub, elevated levels of Ub-protein conjugates and an appreciably enhanced AEF activity. Many of the hippocampal Ub-protein conjugates were found to be soluble only in the Laemmli sample buffer. The possible roles of elevated Ub levels and of the association of AEF activity with Ub are discussed in regard to pathogenesis of brain amyloidosis.
