OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes in Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADDLs in brains of 3 month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice after six-month intervention with curcumin, in order to discuss the neuroprotective effect of curcumin. METHOD: APPswe/PS1dE9dtg mice were randomly divided into the model group, the Rosiglitazone group (10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and curcumin high (400 mg x kg9-1) x d(-1)), medium (200 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and low (100 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) dosage groups, with C57/BL6J mice of the same age and the same background in the normal control group. After 6 months, the immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and the Western blot method were used to observe the changes in positive cell of Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADDLs in hippocampal CA1 area, their distribution and protein expressions. RESULT: Both of the immunohistochemical staining and the Western blot method showed more positive cell of Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADDLs in hippocampal CA1 area and higher protein expressions in the model group than the normal group (P < 0.01). IHC showed a lower result in the Rosiglitazone group than the model group (P < 0.05), while Western blot showed a much lower result (P < 0.01). The number of Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADDLs positive cells and the protein expressions decreased in the curcumin high group, the medium group showed a significant decrease (P < 0.01), and the low dose group also showed reductions in the protein expressions of Abeta40 and Abeta42. CONCLUSION: The six-month intervention with curcumin can significantly reduce the expressions of hippocampal Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADDLs in brains of APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice. Whether curcumin can impact Abeta cascade reaction by down-regulating expressions of Abeta40, Abeta42 and ADDLs and show the neuroprotective effect needs further studies.
