In situ hybridization of mouse embryo sections demonstrated expression of mRNAs encoding two polypeptide inhibitors (p18INK4c and p19INK4d) of cyclin D-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and CDK6 in the central nervous system. No expression of two other INK4 members, p16INK4a and p15INK4b, was observed. The p19INK4d and p18INK4c proteins formed complexes with either CDK4 or CDK6 in a temporal pattern consistent with the results of in situ hybridization. Expression of INK4c was observed at embryonic day 13.5 in neuroepithelial zones of the developing brain, being restricted to dividing neuroblasts but absent from differentiating postmitotic neurons. In the neocortex, p18INK4c was expressed precisely at those developmental stages when neuroblasts switch from a symmetric to an asymmetric pattern of cell division with concomitant increases in their G1 interval. INK4d RNA was detected from embryonic day 11.5 onward, at higher levels than INK4c and with a distinctly different spatial and temporal pattern. Marked INK4d expression was seen in dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and focally throughout the brain, but primarily in postmitotic neurons. Neural expression of INK4d continued postnatally into adulthood in postmitotic cells of the dentate gyrus, the pyramidal layer of the hippocampus, and in discrete regions of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and brainstem. Downregulation of p19INK4d in the dentate gyrus after kainic acid-induced seizures indicated that its expression could also be modified in nondividing cells by excitotoxic stress. Therefore, p19INK4d may contribute to maintaining the quiescent state, acting as a buffer to prevent reactivation of cyclin D-dependent kinases in terminally differentiated cells.
