Field potential recordings were made in the primary retinal synaptic area, the stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale (SFGS), of an in vitro goldfish optic tectum preparation. Stimulation of the optic nerve at frequencies of 1 and 5 Hz produced a long-term potentiation (LTP) of the synaptic response which developed gradually. No potentiation was seen with lower or higher frequencies. These results demonstrate a significant LTP with a slow time course and restricted low-frequency dependence.
