Tetanic stimulation of the entorhinal area induces significant enlargement of the average dendritic spine area and perimeter in the middle and distal thirds of the dentate molecular layer 4 and 90 min following stimulation. Four minutes after stimulation, the differences between the stimulated and control animals were 20% for the dendritic spine area and 9% for the perimeter in the middle third, and in the distal third 32 and 14%, respectively. Ninety minutes after stimulation the differences were 28 and 11% for the area and perimeter in the middle third, and 33 and 18% in the distal third, respectively. Anisomycin at a dose of 25 mg/kg had no significant effect on the average spine area or perimeter in the various thirds of the dentate molecular layer in the 19 and 105 min post-application intervals. This dose of anisomycin given 15 min prior to the stimulation suppresses the stimulation-induced spine changes in the 4 min interval. In the 90 min interval when the effect of anisomycin on protein synthesis is largely terminated, spine enlargement reappears, being 21% higher than the controls in the middle and distal thirds. The differential effect of anisomycin on dendritic spines in the two post-stimulation intervals is discussed in relation to the effect of anisomycin on protein synthesis. The present experiments thus demonstrate that the stimulation-induced spine enlargement in the dentate fascia can be suppressed by a protein synthesis blocking drug.
