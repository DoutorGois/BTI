The actions of CCK-8 and putative CCK-8 antagonists were examined on synaptic transmission in the hippocampal slice preparation. CCK-8 (10(-7) M) caused a reversible depression of postsynaptic responses of the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse. CCK-mediated depression was unaffected by proglumide (10(-3) M) but was antagonized by a CCK analog (CCK27-33). The CCK analog alone had an excitatory effect on synaptic transmission. These results suggest that CCK has an inhibitory action on synaptic transmission.
