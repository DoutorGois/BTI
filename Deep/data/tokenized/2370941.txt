The changes in acetylcholine (ACh), monoamine and monoamine metabolite levels following cerebral ischemia in Mongolian gerbils were examined. In addition, the effects of Sho-saiko-to-go-keishi-ka-shakuyaku-to (TJ-960), which is a spray-dried mixture of 9 herbal drugs, on these changes were also examined. The dramatic decrement of ACh levels in ischemic gerbils was significantly inhibited by p.o. administration of TJ-960 at a daily dose of 3.5 g/kg or 700 mg/kg for one month. Norepinephrine (NE) was also reduced in all ischemic brain regions, and TJ-960 also recovered the level of NE. In ischemic gerbil brains, the dopamine (DA) levels decreased and its metabolites increased in the striatum, but DA and its metabolites in the thalamus + midbrain region increased. The serotonin (5HT) level was reduced in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. TJ-960 inhibited these monoaminergic changes in ischemic gerbils. This suggests that TJ-960 may provide anti-ischemic action and beneficial effects on various symptoms induced by ischemia.
