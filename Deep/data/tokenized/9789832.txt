To explore the correlations between short-term neurophysiological events initiated by over-activation of acetylcholine receptors, and long-lasting changes in brain function, we combined electrophysiology and PCR-based measurements in hippocampal slices or live mice subjected to stress or drug-induced cholinergic activation. Our findings reveal a common cascade of neuronal events resulting in delayed suppression of cholinergic transmission.
