It is commonly accepted that hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures, the most severe manifestation of central nervous system oxygen toxicity, are harmless. However, this hypothesis has not been investigated in depth. We used apoptotic markers to determine whether cells in the cortex and hippocampus were damaged by hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures in mice. Experimental animals were exposed to a pressure of 6 atmospheres absolute breathing oxygen, and were randomly assigned to two groups sacrificed 1h after the appearance of seizures or 7 days later. Control groups were not exposed to hyperbaric oxygen. Caspase 9, caspase 3, and cytochrome c were used as apoptotic markers. These were measured in the cortex and the hippocampus, and compared between the groups. Levels of caspase 3, cytochrome c, and caspase 9 in the hippocampus were significantly higher in the hyperbaric oxygenexposed groups compared with the control groups 1 week after seizures (p<0.01). The levels of two fragments of caspase 9 in the cortex were higher in the control group compared with the hyperbaric oxygen-exposed group 1h after seizures (p<0.01). Hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures activate apoptosis in the mouse hippocampus. The reason for the changes in the cortex is not understood. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the mechanism underlying these findings and their significance.
