The effects of (-) nicotine hydrogen tartrate (NHT) were examined on several cell types in the CA1 region of rat hippocampus. The results indicate that nicotine may have a preferential net inhibitory effect on basket cells and an excitatory effect on oriens/alveus interneurons. The resultant effects of nicotine on pyramidal cells may thus be a product of complex local circuit interactions.
