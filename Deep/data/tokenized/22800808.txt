Resveratrol, an ingredient in grapes, has been reported to exhibit anti-cancer activity, anti-inflammatory activity, and cardiovascular protection property. Interestingly, resveratrol has been recently reported to have neuroprotective effect. This study reports the neuroprotective effect of a resveratrol derivative, 3-[2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)vinyl]furan (DPVF). This synthetic DPVF conferred more protection than resveratrol against neuronal cell damage induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation in a rat hippocampal slice culture. In addition, DPVF inhibited ATP depletion following oxygen and glucose deprivation in the adult hippocampal slice. Moreover, we found that DPVF is neuroprotective against ischemic damage in rats. DPVF showed potent neuroprotection on a 4-velssel-occusion model and inhibited iron-induced malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in the rat brain tissue. These results demonstrate that DPVF might be a useful agent in reducing ischemic neuronal damage.
