The goal of this study was to identify factors contributing to hippocampal atrophy rate (HAR) in clinically normal older adults (NC) and participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Longitudinal HAR was measured on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and the contribution of age, gender, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 status, intracranial volume, white matter lesions, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels to HAR was determined using linear regression. Age-related effects of HAR were compared in Abeta positive (Abeta+) and Abeta negative (Abeta-) participants. Age and Abeta levels had independent effects on HAR in NC, whereas gender, ApoE epsilon4 status, and Abeta levels were associated with HAR in MCI. In multivariable models, Abeta levels were associated with HAR in NC; ApoE epsilon4 and Abeta levels were associated with HAR in MCI. In MCI, age was a stronger predictor of HAR in Abeta- versus Abeta+ participants. HAR was higher in Abeta+ participants, but most of the HAR was because of factors other than Abeta status. Age-related effects on HAR did not differ between NC versus MCI participants with the same Abeta status. Therefore, we conclude that even when accounting for other covariates, Abeta status, and not age, is a significant predictor of HAR; and that most of the HAR is not accounted for by Abeta status in either NC or MCI.
