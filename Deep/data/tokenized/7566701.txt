We investigated the effect of high-frequency stimulation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the medial perforant path (PP)-dentate gyrus (DG) synapses of anesthetized rats. A conditioning stimulation (100 pulses at 100 Hz) of the ipsilateral BLA did not change the DG synaptic potential. However, when the BLA conditioning stimulation was applied at the same time as a weak tetanic stimulation of PP (20 pulses at 20 Hz) which alone did not induce LTP, robust DG LTP was induced. Simultaneous application of contralateral BLA stimulation and PP weak tetanus did not induce LTP. Moreover, the ipsilateral BLA stimulation enhanced the magnitude of LTP induced by a moderate tetanic stimulation of PP (30 pulses at 60 Hz), but did not further enhance the LTP induced by a strong tetanic stimulation of PP (100 pulses at 100 Hz). These results suggest that the ipsilateral BLA neurons modulate the induction of DG LTP in vivo.
