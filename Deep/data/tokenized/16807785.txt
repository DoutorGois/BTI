1. A recently recognized complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus is the encephalopathy involving, among other regions, the hippocampus. Since estrogens bring neuroprotection in cases of brain injury and degenerative diseases, we have studied if estradiol (E2) administration counteracts some hippocampal abnormalities of streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic adult mice. 2. We first report the ability of E2 to modulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of diabetic mice. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label newly generated cells, a strong reduction in cell proliferation was obtained in DG and SVZ of mice sacrificed 20 days after STZ administration. The reduction was completely relieved by 10 days of E2 pellet implantation, which increased 30-fold the circulating E2 levels. 3. Diabetic mice also showed abnormal expression of astrocyte markers in hippocampus. Thus, increased number of GFAP(+) cells, indicative of astrogliosis, and increased number of apolipoprotein-E (Apo-E)(+) astrocytes, a marker of ongoing neuronal dysfunction, was found in stratum radiatum below the CA1 hippocampal subfield of diabetic mice. Both parameters were reverted to normal by the E2 regime that upregulated cell proliferation. 4. The studies demonstrated that hippocampal neuropathology of uncontrolled diabetes is a reversible condition and sensitive to estrogen treatment. Studies in animal models may open up new venues for understanding the beneficial role of steroid hormones in diabetic encephalopathy.
