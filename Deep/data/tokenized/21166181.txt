AIM: To establish the culturing of cortical, hippocampal and sympathetic ganglia neurons derived from neonatal rats and the whole-cell recording techniques of potassium and sodium currents in cultured neurons. METHODS: Cortex, hippocampus and sympathetic ganglion were isolated from neonatal rats (1-3 days) and digested by trypsin (0.125%). The neurons were cultured in polylysine covered petri dish (O35 mm) with DEME medium(high glucose) for seven days for electrophysiological experiments. RESULTS: The neurons cultured by this method were in good conditions and could be sealed easily in whole-cell recording. I(Na), I(A), and I(K) could be recorded respectively in cultured neurons by different recording paradigms in Ca2+ -free extracellular solution. CONCLUSION: It is a practicable and economical method for electrophysiological study of nervous system.
