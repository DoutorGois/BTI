Lipidomics has been an expanding field since researchers began to recognize the signaling functions of lipids and their involvement in disease. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry is a valuable tool for studying the distribution of a wide range of lipids in multiple brain regions, but in order to make valuable scientific contributions, one has to be aware of the influence that sample treatment can have on the results. In this article, the authors discuss different sample treatment protocols for rodent brain sections focusing on signal from the hippocampus and surrounding areas. The authors compare frozen hydrated analysis to freeze drying, which is the standard in most research facilities, and reactive vapor exposure (trifluoroacetic acid and NH3). The results show that in order to preserve brain chemistry close to a native state, frozen hydrated analysis is the most suitable, but execution can be difficult. Freeze drying is prone to produce artifacts as cholesterol migrates to surface, masking other signals. This effect can be partially reversed by exposing freeze dried sections to reactive vapor. When analyzing brain sections in negative ion mode, exposing those sections to NH3 vapor can re-establish the diversity in lipid signal found in frozen hydrated analyzed sections. This is accomplished by removing cholesterol and uncovering sulfatide signals, allowing more anatomical regions to be visualized.
