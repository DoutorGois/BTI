The effects of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) administered on the 15th gestational day, and of acetyl-L-carnitine treatment, on rat brain total and ribosomal RNA levels, were studied. In the brain of MAM-treated rats both total and ribosomal RNA concentrations were significantly reduced. Acetyl-L-carnitine treatment restored total and ribosomal RNA levels. The frontal cortex and the hippocampus were the brain areas most sensitive to acetyl-L-carnitine administration. Histochemical demonstration of tissue stores of nucleic acids showed that the loss of RNA induced by MAM occurs primarily within the cytoplasm of nerve cells in various telencephalic areas. Neuronal cytoplasmatic RNA is also sensitive to acetyl-L-carnitine treatment.
