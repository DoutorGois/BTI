Rhes is one of several signaling molecules preferentially expressed in the striatum. This GTP-binding protein affects dopamine-mediated signaling and behavior. Denervating the striatum of its dopaminergic inputs in adulthood reduces rhes mRNA expression. Here we show that dopamine depletion in adult rats by 6-hydroxydopamine caused a significant decrease in striatal Rhes protein levels as measured by Western blotting. The role of dopamine input on rhes mRNA induction during ontogeny was also examined. Rhes mRNA was measured on postnatal days 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 24 with in situ hybridization to determine its normal ontogeny. Signal in striatum was detectable, but very low, on postnatal day 4 and increased gradually to peak levels at days 15 and 24. Outside of the striatum, rhes mRNA was expressed at high levels in hippocampus and cerebellum during the postnatal period. Hippocampal signal was initially highest in CA3 and dentate gyrus, but shifted to higher expression in CA1 by the late postnatal period. Several other nuclei showed low levels of rhes mRNA during ontogeny. Depletion of dopamine by 6-hydroxydopamine injection on postnatal day 4 did not affect the ontogenetic development of rhes mRNA, such that expression did not differ statistically in lesioned versus vehicle-treated animals tested in adulthood. These findings suggest that although dopamine input is not necessary for the ontogenetic development of rhes mRNA expression, changes in both rhes mRNA and Rhes protein are integral components of the response of the adult striatum to dopamine depletion.
