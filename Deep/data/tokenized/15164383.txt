We report an adult autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) patient who developed transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) due to human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) reactivation. A 58-year-old female with Stage IIIA IgGkappa multiple myeloma received a melphalan (200 mg/m2) ASCT with discharge home after resolution of ASCT-related toxicities. She presented on D+20 with dyspnea, rash, and fever to 105 degrees F, followed by worsening dyspnea, hypotension, and capillary leak. Mental status (MS) changes were noted on D+23, but head CT and EEG were unremarkable. On D+29, a generalized seizure occurred with decline in platelet count and haptoglobin. TMA was noted on peripheral blood smear and therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was initiated on D+31. Lumbar puncture (LP) revealed CSF protein 74 mg/dL and white blood count 7,000/mm3 with 74% lymphocytosis. TPE was continued without improvement in her MS or thrombocytopenia despite improvement in microangiopathy. An MRI of the brain showed a left hippocampus abnormality, and an EEG was consistent with encephalopathy. Serum polymerase chain regimen (PCR) was negative for CMV, HSV1, and HSV2 but was strongly positive for HHV-6. Repeat LP protein was 597 mg/dL. Foscarnet was initiated, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR for HHV-6 revealed 1,400 DNA copies/mL. Her MS greatly improved within 48 hr of antiviral therapy, serum HHV-6 became negative, and TPE was tapered without recurrence of her TMA. TMA with HHV-6 reactivation is likely an underdiagnosed entity. Given its fulminant course and favorable response to therapy, HHV-6 reactivation should be considered a potential etiology in patients with TMA after ASCT.
