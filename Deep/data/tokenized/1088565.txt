Cell- and explantcultures of the hippocampus of 18 days old fetal rats and explantcultures of the ganglion trigeminal of 9 days old chick embryos were cultivated in Maximow-chambers. Orotic acid, Sodiumorotate and methylglucaminorotate by concentrations of 10(-3)...10(-7) g/ml medium were added to the cultures. By concentrations of 10(-7) g/ml medium in the CNS-cultures and 10(-6) g/ml medium in the PNS-cultures is stimulated the nerve fiber growth and is increased the nerve fiber index. After three weeks in vitro is a higher number of neurons in the cultures compared to the controls.
