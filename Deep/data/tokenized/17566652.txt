Ts1Cje and Ts65Dn are genetic mouse models of Down syndrome (DS). Like individuals with DS, these mice exhibit various hallmarks of hippocampal pathology, and deficits in hippocampal-based, declarative learning and memory tasks. Both spatial navigation and novel object recognition, two prototypical domains of declarative memory function, have been strongly characterized in the Ts65Dn DS model. Indeed, Ts65Dn mice show navigation problems in the Morris water maze, impaired alternation in a T-maze, and deficient working and reference memory in the radial arm maze task. They, likewise, show an inability to detect object novelty over time. In contrast to the Ts65Dn model, hippocampal-dependent cognition has been less well characterized in Ts1Cje. Although Ts1Cje mice have been found to exhibit spatial difficulties in the Morris water maze and reduced spontaneous alternation, their ability to process object-based information has never been examined. Here, we report that Ts1Cje mice perform normally in short-term and long-term novel object recognition tasks. The ability of Ts1Cje mice to detect object novelty, unlike Ts65Dn, may point to differences in the extent of hippocampal pathology in the two DS mouse models.
