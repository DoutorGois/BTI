The learning and recalling of a lever-press task (LPT) after brief unilateral extradural compression (EC) of the right sensorimotor cortex was studied in Wistar rats. All rats, regardless of the time-point for EC, were trained to lever press for food from D(day)1 to D6. On D8, the position of the active lever was changed to the right side of the operant box and performance was tested until D14. Total and active lever presses, as well as % errors were used to analyse the performance. Rats submitted to EC 24 h before initiating the LPT schedule (naive-compressed group) showed delayed task acquisition and impaired performance until D10. No significant impairments were detected by D3 on a beam-walking test, excluding paresis as the cause to the delay. Rats submitted to EC after they learned the LPT (trained-compressed group) showed only mildly impaired post-compression performance with no effects on the recalling of the task. Using a progressive ratio LPT, the maximum number of presses to obtain a food-pellet (breaking point) was significantly reduced 24h after EC suggesting reduced motivation for the task early after brain injury. The delayed acquisition of the LPT in naive-compressed rats was accompanied by consistent cortical, striatal and thalamic degeneration detected by Fluoro-Jade and anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining, whereas the improvement in the performance of this group was accompanied by a reduction of the cortical damage on D10. Recall of the LPT in trained-compressed rats was not altered by EC, suggesting the contribution of compensatory mechanisms.
