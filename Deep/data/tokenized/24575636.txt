INTRODUCTION: This study used the immunohistochemical method to follow the expression of cytoplasmatic protein somatostanin in the course of ischemia of rat brain. The aim of the study was to define all the areas of expression of somatostain and to show the protein distribution on the map. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the sections of telencephalon, diencephalon and midbrain were studied in resistant, and transitory ischemia, which enabled us to observe the reaction of neurons to an ischemic attack or to repeated attacks. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results of this study show that there is a difference in the reaction between the resistant and transitory ischemia groups of rats, especially in the parietofrontal cortex, area amygdaloidea anterior, clastrum, nc. reuniens and nc. suprachiasmaticus. The mapping shows the reaction in the structures of motor, sensitive and sensory cortex, mostly in the laminae I/Ill and V/VI, hippocampus- gyrus dentatus and CA1, CA2, CA3, endopiriform nucleus, paraventricular and periventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, corpus amygdaloideum, claustrum and caudoputamen. The more primitive sections of the brain - rhinencephalon, also showed a reaction, which led us to conclude that both newer and older brain structures reacted immunohistochemically. Histological data showed that small neurons are most commonly found while the second most common are big pyramidal cells of multipolar and bipolar type, with the different body shape. CONCLUSION: Our findings have confirmed the results of rare studies that dealt with these issues, and offered a precise and detailed map of cells expressing somatostanin in the rat brain following ischemic attack.
