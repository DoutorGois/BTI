Tissue distribution of nitric oxide-synthases was investigated in the rat hippocampus and visual cortex under nutritional changes induced by modification of the litter size. Young (30-45-days-old) rats, suckled in litters formed by 3,6 or 12 pups (called small, medium and large litters, respectively), were studied by using nicotine-adenine-dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase histochemistry (shortly, diaphorase), a simple and robust procedure to characterize tissue distribution of nitric oxide-synthases. We assessed morphometric features of the diaphorase-positive cells in visual cortex, and the neuropil histochemical activity in hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus using densitometry analysis. In the large-litter group, the labeled-cell density in white matter of area 17 was higher, as compared to the small-litter group. There was a clear trend, in the large-litter group, to lower values of soma area, dendritic field and branches per neuron, but the differences were not significant. Densitometry analysis of hippocampus revealed a significant increase in the relative neuropil histochemical activity of the dentate gyrus molecular layer in the larger litters, which may be associated to increased compensatory blood flow in the hippocampus. The pathophysiological mechanisms of the observed changes remain to be investigated.
