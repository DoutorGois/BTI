N-Oxidation of benzydamine (BZY) mediated by flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) was evaluated by microdialysis in vivo in different regions of rat brain and liver. The probe was implanted into local regions of the brain, such as the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum, or the hepatic lobe. By perfusing BZY via the probe, BZY N-oxide was identified in the dialysate. The estimated concentrations of BZY N-oxide in extracellular fluid were almost the same as those in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral cortex, half the concentration in the hepatic lobe; however, the concentration in the corpus striatum was lower and that in the cerebellum was higher than in the other regions. These results demonstrate that the extracellular concentration of BZY N-oxide formed in vivo was unexpectedly high in every brain region.
