In order to investigate a possible G-protein-mediated activation of phospholipase D (PLD) and its relationship to the activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), we measured the effects of aluminium fluoride and carbachol on choline release, the PLD-specific transphosphatidylation reaction (generation of phosphatidylpropanol) and the formation of inositol phosphates in rat hippocampal slices. Aluminium fluoride markedly enhanced the formation of choline and phosphatidylpropanol but failed to increase the formation of inositol phosphates. In contrast, the muscarinic agonist carbachol strongly stimulated PI-PLC but failed to activate PLD. We conclude that PLD in hippocampal slices is activated by a G-protein independently of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.
