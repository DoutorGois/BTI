It was shown for the first time that the endogenous cyclic dipeptide cycloprolylglycine (CPG) at concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-3) M and piracetam at a concentration of 10(-3) M increased the content of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the culture of neuronal cells in normal state and under conditions of glutamate and 6-oxydopamine neurotoxicity. This may indicate the possible involvement of BDNF in the mechanism of action of neuropeptide CPG and piracetam.
