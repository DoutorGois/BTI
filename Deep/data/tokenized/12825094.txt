Group II mGlu receptor agonists (eg LY379268 and LY354740) have been shown to reverse many of the behavioral responses to PCP as well as glutamate release elicited by PCP and ketamine. In the present set of experiments, we used in vivo microdialysis to show that, in addition to reversing PCP- and ketamine-evoked glutamate release, group II mGlu receptor stimulation also prevents ketamine-evoked norepinephrine (NE) release. Pretreating animals with the mixed 2/3 metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2/3) receptor agonist LY379268 (0.3-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited ketamine (25 mg/kg)-evoked NE release in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp). Ketamine hyperactivity was also reduced in a similar dose range. Following our initial observation on NE release, we conducted a series of microinjection experiments to reveal that the inhibitory effects of LY379268 on VHipp NE release may be linked to glutamate transmission within the medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, we were able to mimic the inhibitory effects of LY379268 on ketamine-evoked NE release by using a novel mGlu2 receptor selective positive modulator. (+/-) 2,2,2-Trifluoroethyl [3-(1-methyl-butoxy)-phenyl]-pyridin-3-ylmethyl-sulfonamide (2,2,2-TEMPS, characterized through in vitro GTPgammaS binding) at a dose of 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the NE response. Together, these results demonstrate a novel means to suppress noradrenergic neurotransmission (ie by activating mGlu2 receptors) and may, therefore, have important implications for neuropsychiatric disorders in which aberrant activation of the noradrenergic system is thought to be involved.
