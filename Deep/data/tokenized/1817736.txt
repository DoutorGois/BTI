We have found that injection of angiotensin II (AII) above the hippocampus in the intact rat blocks the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in perforant path-stimulated dentate granule cells. A minimum dose of 4.78 pmol AII was required for the complete blockade of LTP and this blockade was entirely prevented if the AII-specific antagonist saralasin was co-injected at a 50-fold molar excess. AII thus appears to act via AII receptors and does not cause non-specific inhibition. The injection of saralasin alone yielded LTP comparable to that obtained when vehicle was injected. Angiotensin III was found to be 40-50 fold less potent than AII in blocking LTP. Both AII and AII receptors of unknown function occur in the hippocampal formation. The results reported here suggest a role for these molecules in the control of hippocampal LTP.
