The microtubule-associated protein MAP2 is a cytoskeletal protein that plays a regulatory role in neuronal plasticity and in maintaining the morphology of differentiated neurons. MAP2 distribution was assessed in hippocampus and cerebellum of young and old rats by quantitative immunohistochemistry. In old vs young rats, densitometric analysis showed a significant decrease of MAP2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus CA1 field (-93%), whereas no difference was found in cerebellar MAP2 distribution. These preliminary data suggest that in areas of the brain involved in memory acquisition and consolidation, MAP2-dependent neuroplasticity and structural integrity are significantly decreased in aging.
