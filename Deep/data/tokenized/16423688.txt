In this issue of Neuron, Harata et al. use a novel quenching technique to provide compelling evidence that kiss-and-run is the dominant mode of vesicle fusion at hippocampal synapses and that the prevalence of kiss-and-run can be modulated by stimulus frequency. The increased incidence of kiss-and-run at lower frequencies may ensure that vesicles are available for use during periods of high demand.
