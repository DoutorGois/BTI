The Golgi architecture of the Fascia dentata and hippocampus is described in the cat. The main cell types are like those found in other species. The initial collaterals of granule cell axons were demonstrated and are commented on. The interneurons proved to be of several types and subtypes not observed in lower species. The intrinsic fibers and few of the afferents -- both in the dentate fascia and in the hippocampus -- are discussed.
