Homer1a regulates expression of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors type I (mGluR1 and mGluR5) and is involved in neuronal plasticity. It has been reported that Homer1a expression is upregulated in the kindling model and hypothesized to act as an anticonvulsant. In the present work, we investigated whether pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) would alter Homer1a and mGluR5 expression in hippocampus. Adult rats were subjected to pilocarpine-model and analyzed at 2h, 8h, 24h and 7 d following SE. mRNA analysis showed the highest expression of Homer1a at 8h after SE onset, while immunohistochemistry demonstrated that Homer1a protein expression was significantly increased in hippocampus, amygdala and piriform and entorhinal cortices at 24h after SE onset when compared to control animals. The increased Homer1a expression coincided with a significant decrease of mGluR5 protein expression in amygdala and piriform and entorhinal cortices. The data suggest that during the critical periods of epileptogenesis, overexpression of Homer1a occurs to counteract hyperexcitability and thus Homer1a may be a molecular target in the treatment of epilepsy.
