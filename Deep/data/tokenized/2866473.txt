High-affinity uptake, K+-induced release and Cl -dependent binding of radiolabelled glutamate were examined in vitro in tissue prepared from the dentate gyrus of rats in which long-term potentiation (LTP) had been induced in vivo by a brief train of high-frequency stimulation. Release of preloaded L-[14C]glutamate was significantly greater in slices prepared from potentiated tissue than from control tissue. Uptake and binding were not significantly different. Release and uptake of L-[3H]aspartate were also studied in the same tissue: no significant difference was seen between the two groups. These results provide further evidence for an association between LTP and increased glutamate release but are inconsistent with previous reports that LTP is accompanied by an increase in glutamate binding.
