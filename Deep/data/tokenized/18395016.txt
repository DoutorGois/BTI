Our previous reports show that apolipoprotein E (apoE) influences the dynamics of alpha tocopherol (vitamin E) in brain. In this investigation, the patterns of depletion of alpha tocopherol from tissues of apoE deficient and wild type mice were compared after the animals were fed vitamin E deficient diets. Alpha tocopherol concentrations in specific regions of the brain and peripheral tissues at different times were determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection. ApoE deficiency significantly retarded the rate of depletion of alpha tocopherol from all regions of the brain. In addition, comparison of the rates of depletion of alpha tocopherol in both apoE deficient and wild type animals showed that cerebellum behaved differently from other areas such as cortex, hippocampus and striatum. This reinforces the uniqueness of cerebellum with regard to vitamin E biology. Patterns of depletion of tocopherol from peripheral tissues were different from brain. Serum tocopherol was higher in apoE deficient animals and remained higher than wild type during E deficiency. Depletion of liver tocopherol also tended to be unaffected by apoE deficiency. Our current and previous observations strongly suggest that apoE has an important role in modulating tocopherol concentrations in brain, probably acting in concert with other proteins as well.
