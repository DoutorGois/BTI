Rats were trained during the severe inhibition of protein synthesis that follows intracerebral injection of acetoxycycloheximide. Amnesia was consistently observed 24 hours after training, but memory spontaneously returned within 6 days. There was, consequently, no evidence of interference by acetoxycycloheximide with the consolidation phase of memory, but rather a transient deficit in the retrieval phase. It is suggested that this deficit may be due to a deficiency in neurotransmitters.
