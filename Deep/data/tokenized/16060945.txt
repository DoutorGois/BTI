We report the case of a patient with severe partial epilepsy associated with a focal rolandic, pathologically proven, cortical dysplasia. By measuring intracellular calcium concentrations, functional antiglial non-glutamate receptor 3 (GluR3) autoantibodies were identified in the serum of this patient. Antineuronal autoantibodies, which interfere with GluR3-receptor function, also were detected. This observation provides new clues about the involvement of immunologic mechanisms in epileptic disorders.
