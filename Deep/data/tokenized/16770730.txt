Tau is a protein involved in regulation of microtubule stability, axonal differentiation and transport. Alteration of retrograde transport may lead to motor neuron degeneration. Thus alternative mRNA splicing and expression of tau isoforms were studied in a transgenic mouse model harboring the human SOD1 G93A mutation. The studies were performed on cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord of 64- and 120-day-old animals (presymptomatic and symptomatic stage) and wild type controls. Exon 10 was found in all studied tissues. The 2N isoform containing exons 2 and 3 (+2+3) and the 1N (+2-3) predominated over the 0N (-2-3) in brain regions of the studied mice. The 2N expression was significantly lower in cortex and hippocampus of symptomatic animals compared to analogue control tissues. The decrease in 2N expression resulted in lower levels of total tau mRNA and tau protein. No changes in tau expression were observed in spinal cord of studied animals.
