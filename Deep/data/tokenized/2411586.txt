An antiserum raised against taurine conjugated to bovine serum albumin by glutaraldehyde produced intense staining of hippocampal pyramidal neurons at the CA1/CA3 transition (including CA2) and of a small proportion of the granule cells. Strongly immunoreactive neurons were also found in a zone overlapping the second reflected blade in the hilus. Most glial cells were unlabeled.
