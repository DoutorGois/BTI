The NMDA receptor is an important subtype glutamate receptor that acts as a nonselective cation channel highly permeable to both calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+). The activation of NMDA receptors produces prolonged increases of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and thereby triggers downstream signaling pathways involved in the regulation of many physiological and pathophysiological processes. Previous studies have focused on how Ca2+ or Na+ affects NMDA receptor activity in isolation. Specifically, [Ca2+]i increase may downregulate NMDA channels and thus is considered an important negative feedback mechanism controlling NMDA receptor activity, whereas an increase in intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) may upregulate NMDA channel activity. Thus so that the activity-dependent regulation of NMDA receptors and neuroplasticity may be further understood, a critical question that has to be answered is how an individual NMDA receptor may be regulated when both of these ionic species flow into neurons during the same time period via neighboring activated NMDA receptors. Here we report that the gating of a NMDA channel is regulated by the activation of remote NMDA receptors via a functional Na+-Ca2+ interaction and that during the activation of NMDA receptors Na+ influx potentiates Ca2+ influx on one hand and overcomes Ca2+-induced inhibition of NMDA channel gating on the other hand. Furthermore, we have identified that a critical increase (5 +/- 1 mM) in [Na+]i is required to mask the effects of Ca2+ on NMDA channel gating in cultured hippocampal neurons. Thus cross talk between NMDA receptors mediated by a functional Na+-Ca2+ interaction is a novel mechanism regulating NMDA receptor activity.
