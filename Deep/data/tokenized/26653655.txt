OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of aluminum exposure on neuronal apoptosis of rats hippocampus and the correlation of and synaptic plasticity. METHODS: There were 40 SPF grade SD rats which were randomly divided into four groups: the control group, the low dose group, the medium dose group and the high dose group, 10 rats in each group. The rats were daily gavaged with aluminum lactate for 30 days. The hippocampal fEPSPs in rat was measured by electrophysiological grapher and the neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus was detected by Flow cytometer. In addition, the relative expression of gene which includes caspase-3, 8, 9 was measured by Real-time PCR. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the average of fEPSPs which after HFS 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 min was decreased at different time point in the low dose group, the medium dose group and the high dose group (P < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the rate of apoptosis was significantly increased in the medium dose group and the high dose group (P < 0.05). Compared to the control group, the relative expression of caspase-3 in the medium dose group and the high dose group was significantly increased in Real-time PCR (P < 0.05), and the relative expression of caspase-8 in the high dose group was significantly increased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Aluminum exposure may induced neuronal apoptosis in rats, and then affect hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
