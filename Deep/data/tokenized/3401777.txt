Estradiol, administered to ovariectomized rats, increased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the caudate nucleus, cortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, suggesting possibly widespread central cholinergic involvement in estrus-related behavior. Dexamethasone also, except in hypothalamus, increased ChAT activity, notably (50%) in hippocampus. ChAT activity changes did not correlate with reported regional hormone receptor density. Estradiol's effect in the caudate suggests that hormone receptor and affected enzyme may not necessarily coexist intraneuronally.
