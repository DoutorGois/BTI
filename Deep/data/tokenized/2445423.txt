Para-chloroamphetamine (PCA) has been used to deplete brain serotonin (5-HT) in numerous studies of serotonergic involvement in various behaviors and physiological functions. PCA is believed to cause long-lasting depletions of 5-HT by causing the selective degeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals, but the mechanism by which it exerts this neurotoxic effect is not understood. In this experiment, 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine (5,6-DHT), a serotonergic neurotoxin, was detected by high performance liquid chromatography in the rat hippocampus 0.5-4 h after a single 15 mg/kg i.p. injection of PCA. 5,6-DHT was also detected in the somatosensory cortex following PCA administration, but much less frequently than in the hippocampus. Degenerating nerve terminals were observed in the striatum and somatosensory cortex in silver-stained brain sections from rats injected with PCA 1 or 2 days prior to sacrifice. Laminae III and IV of the somatosensory cortex also contained degenerating neuronal perikarya. The neurochemical and histological effects of PCA are very similar to those produced by a large dose of methylamphetamine (MA) in that both drugs are toxic to serotonergic nerve terminals and neuronal perikarya in the somatosensory cortex. We hypothesize that the formation of 5,6-DHT, perhaps from endogenous 5-HT, may mediate the toxic effects of PCA, MA and other amphetamine-related drugs on serotonergic neurons and on a subpopulation of cortical neurons.
