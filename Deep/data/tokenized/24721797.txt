BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been shown to be involved in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. TLR9 is located in intracellular compartments and recognizes CpG-DNA. This study examined the effect of CpG-ODN on cerebral I/R injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice were treated with CpG-ODN by i.p. injection 1 hour before the mice were subjected to cerebral ischemia (60 minutes) followed by reperfusion (24 hours). Scrambled-ODN served as control-ODN. Untreated mice, subjected to cerebral I/R, served as I/R control. The effect of inhibitory CpG-ODN (iCpG-ODN) on cerebral I/R injury was also examined. In addition, we examined the therapeutic effect of CpG-ODN on cerebral I/R injury by administration of CpG-ODN 15 minutes after cerebral ischemia. CpG-ODN administration significantly decreased cerebral I/R-induced infarct volume by 69.7% (6.4+/-1.80% vs 21.0+/-2.85%, P<0.05), improved neurological scores, and increased survival rate, when compared with the untreated I/R group. Therapeutic administration of CpG-ODN also significantly reduced infarct volume by 44.7% (12.6+/-2.03% vs 22.8+/-2.54%, P<0.05) compared with untreated I/R mice. Neither control-ODN, nor iCpG-ODN altered I/R-induced cerebral injury or neurological deficits. Nissl staining showed that CpG-ODN treatment preserved neuronal morphology in the ischemic hippocampus. Immunoblot showed that CpG-ODN administration increased Bcl-2 levels by 41% and attenuated I/R-increased levels of Bax and caspase-3 activity in ischemic brain tissues. Importantly, CpG-ODN treatment induced Akt and GSK-3beta phosphorylation in brain tissue and cultured microglial cells. PI3K inhibition with LY294002 abolished CpG-ODN-induced protection. CONCLUSION: CpG-ODN significantly reduces cerebral I/R injury via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism. Our data also indicate that CpG-ODN may be useful in the therapy of cerebral I/R injury.
