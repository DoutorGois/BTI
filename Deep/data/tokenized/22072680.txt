Current therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) address a loss of cholinergic neurons, while accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide assemblies is thought central to molecular pathogenesis. Overlaps may exist between prionopathies and AD wherein Abeta oligomers bind to the cellular prion protein PrP(C) and inhibit synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus (Lauren et al., 2009). Here we applied oligomeric Abeta to neurons with different PrP (Prnp) gene dosage. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from dissociated neurons of the diagonal band of Broca (DBB), a cholinergic basal forebrain nucleus. In wild-type (wt) mice, Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2) evoked a concentration-dependent reduction of whole-cell outward currents in a voltage range between -30 and +30 mV; reduction occurred through a combined modulation of a suite of potassium conductances including the delayed rectifier (I(K)), the transient outward (I(A)), and the iberiotoxin-sensitive (calcium-activated potassium, I(C)) currents. Inhibition was not seen with Abeta(4)(2)(-)(1) peptide, while Abeta(1)(-)(4)(2)-induced responses were reduced by application of anti-PrP antibody, attenuated in cells from Prnp(0)/(+) hemizygotes, and absent in Prnp(0)/(0) homozygotes. Similarly, amyloidogenic amylin peptide depressed DBB whole-cell currents in DBB cells from wt mice, but not Prnp(0)/(0) homozygotes. While prior studies give broad support for a neuroprotective function for PrP(C), our data define a latent pro-pathogenic role in the presence of amyloid assemblies.
