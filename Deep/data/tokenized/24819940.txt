INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress increases brain lipid peroxidation, memory and motor deficits and progressive neurodegeneration. Tibolone, a treatment for menopausal symptoms, decreases lipid peroxidation levels and improves memory and learning. AIM: To study the effect of chronic administration of tibolone on lipid peroxidation, memory and motor deficits in ozone induced oxidative stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 male Wistar adult rats were randomly divided into 10 experimental groups: control (C) was exposed to an airstream for 60 days; C + tibolone, airstream exposure plus 1 mg/kg of tibolone for 60 days; groups 3-6 were exposed to ozone for 7, 15, 30, and 60 days, and groups 7-10 received 1 mg/kg of tibolone treatment by oral gavage for 7, 15, 30 and 60 days and were then exposed to ozone. We determined the effect of tibolone on memory and motor activity. Hippocampus was processed to determine the content of 4-hydroxynonenal and nitrotyrosine by Western blot. Four animals were perfused and processed for analysis of neuronal death. RESULTS: In the hippocampus, administration of 1 mg/kg of tibolone for 30 days prevented increased levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation, whereas after 60 days prevented neuronal death in the CA3 region caused by exposure to ozone. Therefore, tibolone prevents cognitive deficits in short- and long-term memory on the passive avoidance task and prevents a decrease in exploratory behavior and an increase in freezing behavior. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a possible neuroprotective role of tibolone as a useful treatment to prevent oxidative stress neurodegeneration.
