Although the expression and distribution of nuclear estrogen receptors in the hippocampus has been described, it has been proposed that the nuclear receptors may not explain all aspects of estrogen function in the hippocampus. Recently, a G protein-coupled receptor for estrogen, GPR30, was identified as a membrane-localized estrogen receptor in several cancer cell lines. In this study, we examined the expression and intracellular distribution of GPR30 in the rat hippocampal formation. We found expression of GPR30 in pyramidal cells of CA1-3 and granule cells of the dentate gyrus at both mRNA and protein levels. Specific markers for intracellular organelles and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that GPR30 was mainly localized to the Golgi apparatus and partially in the endoplasmic reticulum of the neuron but could not detect the protein at the cell surface. Expression levels were not different among male, female in proestrus and female in estrus at the adult stage, but were higher in newborn male than newborn female.
