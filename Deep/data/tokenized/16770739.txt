Adult male Wistar rats were given either a single training trial or one training trial per day during 3 days followed by a retention test trial in an inhibitory avoidance (IA) task. In animals given a single training trial, pretraining, but not pretest bilateral infusion of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist d,l-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) (5.0 microg) into the CA1 hippocampal area blocked IA retention. In animals given three training trials, infusions of AP5 given prior to each of the three training trials severely impaired, but did not block retention. The results indicate that NMDA receptors in the hippocampus are involved in the formation, but not in expression, of aversive memory. In addition, rats given repeated training were able to show a mild improvement of performance across training trials, possibly through mechanisms that do not depend on NMDA receptor activation in the dorsal hippocampus.
