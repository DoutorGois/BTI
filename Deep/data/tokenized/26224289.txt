Phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalanemia are inborn errors in metabolism of phenylalanine arising from defects in steps to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. Phe accumulation causes severe mental retardation that can be prevented by timely identification of affected individuals and their placement on a Phe-restricted diet. In spite of many studies in patients and animal models, the basis for acquisition of mental retardation during the critical period of brain development is not adequately understood. All animal models for human disease have advantages and limitations, and characteristics common to different models are most likely to correspond to the disorder. This study established similar levels of Phe exposure in developing rats between 3 and 16 days of age using three models to produce chronic hyperphenylalanemia, and identified changes in brain amino acid levels common to all models that persist for ~16 h of each day. In a representative model, local rates of glucose utilization (CMRglc) were determined at 25-27 days of age, and only selective changes that appeared to depend on Phe exposure were observed. CMRglc was reduced in frontal cortex and thalamus and increased in hippocampus and globus pallidus. Behavioral testing to evaluate neuromuscular competence revealed poor performance in chronically-hyperphenylalanemic rats that persisted for at least 3 weeks after cessation of Phe injections and did not occur with mild or acute hyperphenylalanemia. Thus, the abnormal amino acid environment, including hyperglycinemia, in developing rat brain is associated with selective regional changes in glucose utilization and behavioral abnormalities that are not readily reversed after they are acquired.
