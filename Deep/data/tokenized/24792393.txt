Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in memory consolidation. Previously, we found that the increased mature BDNF (mBDNF) levels in the hippocampal region at a specific time window after the acquisition trial are required for memory consolidation. In the present study, we investigated whether spicatoside A enhances memory consolidation, and whether its effects on memory consolidation are related to hippocampal mBDNF levels. Spicatoside A (2.5, 5, 10 or 20mg/kg) enhanced memory consolidation in a dose-dependent manner, and enhanced memory consolidation was also observed when spicatoside A was administered 1h after the acquisition trial. Concurrently, when spicatoside A was administered immediately or 1h after the acquisition trial, hippocampal mBDNF levels were similar or significantly increased at 9h after the acquisition trial compared to levels at 6h. These results suggest that increased mBDNF levels in the hippocampal region at 9h after the acquisition trial might play a pivotal role in memory consolidation and that spicatoside A might enhance memory consolidation by increasing hippocampal mBDNF levels.
