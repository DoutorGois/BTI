The central corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-ergic system plays a critical role in anxiety and other behavioral stress responses. It has been shown that atrial (ANP), brain (BNP) and C-type (CNP) natriuretic peptides exert anxiolytic-like effects in behavioral studies. Our previous findings demonstrated that various doses of centrally administered ANP selectively altered the CRF content in different brain areas. In the present study, CRF immunoreactivity was determined in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic brain regions after central injection of BNP or CNP in rats. A high dose (400 ng) of BNP significantly increased the CRF-like immunoreactivity (CRF-LI) in the hypothalamus and amygdala, while only a tendency towards an increase was found in the hippocampus. In the hypothalamus, the CRF-LI decreased after a high dose (400 ng) of CNP. The CRF-LI increased in the basal forebrain after a low dose (100 ng) of CNP. These results suggest that CRF may be involved in the mediation of some neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to BNP and CNP.
