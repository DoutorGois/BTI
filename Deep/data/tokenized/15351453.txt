Previously, we have used CsCl gradient-purified recombinant adenovirus (AdV) to successfully transfer genes into hippocampal neurons cultured on microisland substrate. Here, we report that purification of AdV particles is not required and efficient gene expression can be achieved using either crude AdV lysates or HEK 293 cells infected with AdV. The advantages of the simplified procedure are greatly reduced preparation time and reduced requirements for equipment and expertise.
