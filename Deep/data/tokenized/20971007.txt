We report on the neuroprotective effects of N,N-bis-(8-hydroxyquinoline-5-yl methyl)-benzyl substituted amines (HQNBA) in a model of oxidative stress-induced nerve cell death using mouse hippocampal-derived HT22 cells. The four derivatives (JLK1472, JLK1486, JLK1522 and JLK1535) protected the HT22 cells from death at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 muM. Their action is partially dependent on their ability to act as PPARgamma agonists. These analogues also maintain GSH levels suggesting that they have indirect anti-oxidant effects.
