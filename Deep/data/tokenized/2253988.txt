Bilateral electrical lesion at ventral hippocampal formation (VHF) did not affect some aspects of nonspecific immunity like total W.B.C. count, percentage of cells in differential count, their absolute count (lymphocyte and neutrophils) and neutrophil functions. The changes observed are due to non-specific craniocerebral trauma as the sham operated animals also showed a similar pattern of response. However the lesion at VHF increases the spleen cell count significantly whereas immunization in these animals decreases the spleen cell count. The thymus weight/body weight ratio also decreases in these animals. Our study confirms the neuroimmuno modulation and the influence of VHF on certain nonspecific immune parameters.
