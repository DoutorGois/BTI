Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide overproduction is one of the pathomechanisms contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Agonists of alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7 nAChRs) are under development as symptomatic treatments for AD, and clinical findings suggest that alpha7 nAChR agonists may improve cognitive functions in AD patients. However, interactions between Abeta and alpha7 nAChRs have been observed, implying that high levels of Abeta may modify the effects of alpha7 nAChR agonists. Therefore, we tested the alpha7 nAChR agonist FRM-17874, an analogue of encenicline, in 8-month-old Abeta overproducing 5xFAD mice in an in vivo neurophysiological assay with a high construct and predictive validity for testing procognitive drugs. By recording changes in brainstem-stimulation-elicited hippocampal oscillations, we identified previously undescribed neurophysiological impairments in 5xFAD mice, including significantly decreased power of theta and gamma oscillations and theta-phase-gamma-amplitude coupling. Compared with their saline controls, systemically administered FRM-17874 significantly increased stimulation-induced theta power by 30% in both 5xFAD and wild-type mice. However, FRM-17874 did not impact gamma oscillation or theta-phase-gamma-amplitude coupling in either wild type or 5xFAD mice, and it did not eliminate the significant differences in these parameters between the 2 groups.
