A fluorescein-based fluorescent probe has been designed and synthesised that selectively detects H2 S in aqueous medium, among various analytes tested. This fluorescein-based fluorescent probe has also been successfully utilised for real-time imaging of exo- and endogenously produced H2 S in cancer cells and normal cells. Moreover, the probe can also detect H2 S in the rat brain hippocampus at variable depths and in living nematodes.
