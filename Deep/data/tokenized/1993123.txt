Opioid receptors were found to activate two different types of membrane potassium conductance in acutely dissociated neurons from the CA1/subiculum regions of the adult rat hippocampal formation. Opioid-responsive neurons were distinguished based on their morphology and electrophysiological responses. In one population of neurons having a multipolar, nonpyramidal cell shape, mu-selective opioid agonists increased an inward rectifying potassium current. Opioid activation of the inward rectifying conductance resulted in small outward potassium currents at resting membrane potentials and increased inward currents at hyperpolarized potentials. In a second population of nonpyramidal neurons, mu opioid agonists increased a novel voltage-gated potassium current. This current was blocked by internal CsCl2, unaffected by external BaCl2 or CdCl2, irreversibly activated by intracellular GTP-gamma-S, and inactivated by sustained depolarization. In contrast to the inward rectifying conductance, the voltage-gated conductance was not activated at resting membrane potentials or hyperpolarized potentials. The opioid-activated, voltage-gated conductance represents a new class of G protein-regulated potassium current in the brain.
