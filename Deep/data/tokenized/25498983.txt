This ERP study explores how participants activate their own geographical perspective, while reading sentences describing a motion (to come or to go), or a static spatial relation (to be) referred either to the participant's current location or a distant place. The ERPs recorded at the place names revealed that, compared to "distant places", "close places" enhanced ERP's components, associated with motivational relevance, in the context of the deictic verbs of motion to come and to go, but not in the context of the static verb to be. Also, in the context of the verbs of motion source estimation showed that "close places" elicited more activity than "distant places" in the medial temporal cortex (around the parahippocampal gyrus), suggesting projection of the reader's self-relevant information, or retrieval of geographical episodic memories. Finally, sentences describing motions congruent with the self-perspective (e.g. "going to distant place") elicited less activation than sentences incongruent with the self-perspective (e.g. "coming to distant place") in the right fronto-polar cortex and in the posterior cingulate cortex, regions generally associated with the other's perspective or with self/other perspective conflict. These findings provide information on the brain processes underlying readers' perspective taking, guided by the deictic verbs of motion.
