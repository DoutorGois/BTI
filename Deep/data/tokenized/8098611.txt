Protocols that induce long-term potentiation (LTP) typically involve afferent stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that LTP induction does not require presynaptic activity. The significance of this hypothesis is underscored by results suggesting that LTP expression may involve activity-dependent presynaptic changes. An induction protocol using glutamate iontophoresis was developed that reliably induced LTP in hippocampal slices without afferent stimulation. Iontophoresis LTP was Ca2+ dependent, was blocked by MK-801, and occluded tetanus-induced LTP. Iontophoresis LTP was induced when excitatory postsynaptic potentials were completely blocked by adenosine plus tetrodotoxin. Our results suggest constraints on the involvement of presynaptic mechanisms and putative retrograde messengers in LTP induction and expression; namely, these processes must function without many forms of activity-dependent presynaptic processes.
