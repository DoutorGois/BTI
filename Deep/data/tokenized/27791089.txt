Declarative memory consolidation is hypothesized to require a two-stage, reciprocal cortical-hippocampal dialogue. According to this model, higher frequency signals convey information from the cortex to hippocampus during wakefulness, but in the reverse direction during slow-wave sleep (SWS). Conversely, lower-frequency activity propagates from the information "receiver" to the "sender" to coordinate the timing of information transfer. Reversal of sender/receiver roles across wake and SWS implies that higher- and lower-frequency signaling should reverse direction between the cortex and hippocampus. However, direct evidence of such a reversal has been lacking in humans. Here, we use human resting-state fMRI and electrocorticography to demonstrate that delta-band activity and infraslow activity propagate in opposite directions between the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Moreover, both delta activity and infraslow activity reverse propagation directions between the hippocampus and cerebral cortex across wake and SWS. These findings provide direct evidence for state-dependent reversals in human cortical-hippocampal communication.
