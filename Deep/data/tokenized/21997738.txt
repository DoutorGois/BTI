Our aim is to investigate the effect of 1.5 and 3.0% sevoflurane on the expression of M(1) acetylcholine receptor (mAChR M(1)) in the hippocampus and the cognitive function of aged rats. Forty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of 12-month old were randomly divided into five groups. All SD rats received 1.5 or 3.0% sevoflurane in a special glass anesthesia box for 2 h, respectively, except for the normal control group. Y-maze was used to test the ability of learning and memory after being received sevoflurane for 1 or 7 days at the same moment portion. The expression of mAChR M(1) in the hippocampus of rats was tested by RT-PCR. The results showed that 3% sevoflurane induced the decline of cognitive function and significantly decreased the mAChR M(1) expression at mRNA levels at 1 day in the 3.0% sevoflurane I group when compared with the normal control group. However, there was no significant difference among the other groups when compared with normal control group. Therefore, administration of sevoflurane might temporally affect the ability of cognitive function of rats through suppressing the mAChR M(1) expression at mRNA levels in hippocampus.
