UNLABELLED: Presynaptic facilitatory nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) on noradrenergic axon terminals were studied in slices of human or rat neocortex and of rat hippocampus preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA). During superfusion of the slices, stimulation by nicotinic agonists for 2 min only slightly increased [3H]NA outflow in the rat neocortex, but caused a tetrodotoxin-sensitive. Ca(2+)-dependent release of [3H]NA in rat hippocampus and human neocortex. In both tissues a similar rank order of potency of nicotinic agonists was found: epibatidine >> DMPP > nicotine approximately cytisine > or = acetylcholine; choline was ineffective. In human neocortex, the effects of nicotine (100 microM) were reduced by mecamylamine, methyllycaconitine, di-hydro-beta-erythroidine (10 microM, each) and the alpha3beta2/alpha6betax-selective alpha-conotoxin MII (100/200 nM). The alpha3beta4 selective alpha-conotoxin AuIB (1 microM), and the alpha7 selective alpha-conotoxin ImI (200 nM) as well as alpha-bungarotoxin (125 nM) were ineffective. Glutamate receptor antagonists (300 microM AP-5, 100 microM DNQX) acted inhibitory, suggesting the participation of nAChRs on glutamatergic neurons. On the other hand, nAChR agonists were unable to evoke exocytotic release of [3H]acetylcholine from human and rat neocortical slices preincubated with [3H]choline. IN CONCLUSION: (1) alpha3beta2 and/or alpha6 containing nAChRs are at least partially responsible for presynaptic cholinergic facilitation of noradrenergic transmission in human neocortex; (2) nicotinic autoreceptors were not detectable in rat and human neocortex.
