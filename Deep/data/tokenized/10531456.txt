EphA family receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-A ligands are involved in patterning axonal connections during brain development, but until now a role for these molecules in the mature brain had not been elucidated. Here, we show that both the EphA5 receptor and its ephrin-A ligands (2 and 5) are expressed in the adult mouse hippocampus, and the EphA5 protein is present in a phosphorylated form. Because there are no pharmacological agents available for EphA receptors, we designed recombinant immunoadhesins that specifically bind to the receptor binding site of the ephrin-A ligand (antagonist) or the ligand binding site of the EphA receptor (agonist) and thus target EphA function. We demonstrate that intrahippocampal infusion of an EphA antagonist immunoadhesin leads to impaired performance in two behavioral paradigms, T-maze spontaneous alternation and context-dependent fear conditioning, sensitive to hippocampal function, whereas activation of EphA by infusion of an agonist immunoadhesin results in enhanced performance on these tasks. Because the two behavioral tasks have different motivational, perceptual, and motor requirements, we infer the changes were not caused by these performance factors but rather to cognitive alterations. We also find bidirectional changes in gene expression and in electrophysiological measures of synaptic efficacy that correlate with the behavioral results. Thus, EphA receptors and their ligands are implicated as mediators of plasticity in the adult mammalian brain.
