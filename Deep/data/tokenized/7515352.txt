We have previously reported that focally evoked limbic motor seizures rapidly increase levels of mRNA encoding nerve growth factor (NGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in specific limbic system areas of the adult rat brain. The present studies examined the effect of both minimal and maximal electroconvulsive shock, applied via corneal electrodes, on NGF and bFGF mRNA levels in several limbic (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb) and extralimbic (striatum and cerebellum) brain regions. By 5 h following limbic motor seizures induced by low-intensity (minimal) electroshock (LES) (0.2 s, 50-70 mA; three times over a 1-h period), bFGF mRNA was significantly increased in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, but not in the other regions examined. In contrast, tonic extensor seizures evoked by maximal electroshock (MES) (0.2 s, 150 mA; three times over a 1-h period) were associated with a significant increase in bFGF mRNA in all limbic and extralimbic regions examined. In the same animals, increases in NGF mRNA were limited to entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Adrenal steroids were not required for the seizure-induced increase in NGF or bFGF mRNAs, based on the finding that adrenalectomized rats exhibited electroshock-induced increases in both NGF and bFGF mRNAs equivalent to the increase observed in sham-operated rats. It is suggested that the increase in mRNA levels for the neurotrophic factors occurs selectively in those regions which are especially activated by the specific seizure model, and represents an adaptive response to repeated noninjurious neuronal stimulation.
