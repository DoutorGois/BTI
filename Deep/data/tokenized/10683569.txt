We investigated whether the nucleus basalis lesion induced by quisqualic acid was associated with a more severe impairment of spatial navigation in a water maze, a greater reduction in frontal choline acetyltransferase activity and decrease in the number of choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the nucleus basalis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice than in control mice. We also studied the effect of ageing on water maze spatial navigation and cortical choline acetyltransferase activity in 16-month-old control and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. We found that the lesion decreased choline acetyltransferase-positive neurons in the nucleus basalis and frontal choline acetyltransferase activity equally in control and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. The nucleus basalis lesion had no effect on the initial acquisition in the water maze in control and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice after 25 or 106 days of recovery. However, the nucleus basalis lesion impaired the reversal learning in the water maze similarly in both strains after 25 days of recovery, but had no effect after 106 days of recovery. Finally, water maze spatial navigation and cortical choline acetyltransferase activity were similar in old control and apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. These results suggest that young and old apolipoprotein E-deficient mice do not have impairments in cholinergic activity or spatial navigation. Furthermore, apolipoprotein E deficiency does not increase the sensitivity to cholinergic and spatial navigation deficits induced by lesioning of the nucleus basalis with an excitatory amino acid and does not slow down the behavioral recovery.
