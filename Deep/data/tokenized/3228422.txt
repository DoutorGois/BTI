Female Long-Evans rats were given electrolytic lesions of either the medial fimbria bilaterally (Fi, n = 24), the dorsal fornix (Fo, n = 24), or both structures (FF, n = 24) at 31 days of age. Ten rats were given sham-operations. Ten days later, half the rats with lesions received bilateral intrahippocampal grafts of embryonic septal cell suspensions (FiT, FoT, FFT, respectively). As already reported in a separate publication (J.C. Dalrymple-Alford, C.R. Kelche, J.C. Cassel, G. Toniolo, V. Pallage, & B.E. Will, 1987, Experimental Brain Research, 210, 115-128), 7 months after transplant surgery, grafted rats were found to be more impaired in an eight-arm radial maze than nongrafted rats. The present report concerns a pharmacological study carried out in the same rats 11 months after grafting. We examined the effects of ip injections of physostigmine (0.01, 0.05, 0.10 mg/kg) and then of d-amphetamine (1.6 mg/kg), as compared with baseline control injections of saline. Just prior to the drug treatments, performances of grafted and nongrafted rats did not differ significantly, but impairments in grafted rats reappeared during subsequent no-injection and saline control trials. Physostigmine failed to affect significantly the performances in rats of any group. d-Amphetamine improved performances in grafted rats with medial fimbria lesions, impaired performances in grafted rats with dorsal fornix lesions, and did not change performances in grafted rats with both lesions, as compared with their respective nongrafted counterparts. Histological analysis revealed variable reinnervation of the host structure and substantial graft-induced lesions of the hippocampus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
