In this study we examined the impact of systemic treatment with the long-acting brain penetrant beta2-adrenoceptor agonist clenbuterol on NFkappaB activity and IkappaB expression in rat brain. Clenbuterol decreased NFkappaB activity (p65 DNA binding) in nuclear extracts prepared from rat cortex and hippocampus for up to 8h following a single treatment. This was accompanied by increased expression of IkappaBalpha mRNA and protein. The temporal increase in IkappaB protein expression paralleled the suppression of NFkappaB activity, suggesting that IkappaBalpha mediates the suppression NFkappaB activity observed. These actions of clenbuterol were prevented by pre-treatment with the non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, the beta2-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI-118,551, but not the beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol, suggesting that the effects of clenbuterol on IkappaBalpha expression and NFkappaB activity are mediated specifically by the beta2-adrenoceptor. In addition, the actions of clenbuterol were mimicked by systemic administration of another highly selective long-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonist formoterol. As neurodegenerative diseases are associated with inflammation we determined if clenbuterol could suppress NFkappaB activation that occurs in response to an inflammatory stimulus. In this regard we demonstrate that clenbuterol inhibited IkappaB phosphorylation and IkappaB degradation and inhibited NFkappaB activity in hippocampus and cortex of rats following a central injection of the inflammagen bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In tandem, clenbuterol blocked expression of the NFkappaB-inducible genes TNF-alpha and ICAM-1 following LPS administration. Our finding that clenbuterol and formoterol inhibit NFkappaB activity in the CNS further supports the idea that beta2-adrenoceptors may be an attractive target for treating neuroinflammation and combating inflammation-related neurodegeneration.
