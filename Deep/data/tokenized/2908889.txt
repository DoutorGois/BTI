Protein kinase C (PKC), a calcium- and phospholipid-dependent kinase, is highly enriched in rat brain, where it may function in signal transduction processes. We purified rat brain PKC to homogeneity by a three-column procedure of diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, and protamine-agarose with a yield of 16% and a final specific activity of 9,600 pmol of [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate bound/mg of protein. The pure protein consisted of a doublet of 80 and 78 kilodaltons. Rabbit antibodies prepared against a beta-type PKC synthetic peptide sequence (RAKIGQGTKAPEEKTANTISK) showed high specificity and sensitivity for PKC and recognized only the 78-kilodalton form of PKC. Micropunches (300 microns in diameter) of rat hippocampal subregions were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. PKC was visualized by 125I-protein A autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. The highest concentrations of PKC were found in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer (0.43 +/- 0.04 OD), with the lowest amounts in the CA3 and CA4 pyramidal cell layers (0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.085 +/- 0.006 OD, respectively). These results demonstrate a simple way of preparing antibodies against domains of PKC. We also describe a procedure for quantifying the relative amounts of PKC in discrete brain regions.
