OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of aluminum chloride on dissociated Ca(2+) in hippocampus neuron cells in mice and the relationship to the learning and memory. METHODS: Male ICR mice in the three intoxicated groups were administered with the double distilled water containing AlCl(3) (10, 50, 300 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) while those in the control group were administered with the double distilled water for 100 days. The methods of behavior toxicology such as Morris swim maze were used for studying the effect of aluminum chloride on the changes of learning and memory in mice. With calcium sensitive fluorescence indicator Fura-2 as the fluorescent probe, the influence of the subchronic exposure to Al on the dissociated Ca(2+) in hippocampus neuron cells was observed. RESULTS: The dissociated Ca(2+) in hippocampus neuron cells in the middle dosage group and the high dosage group [(412.25 +/- 53.20), (467.37 +/- 32.85) times] was lower than those in the control group [(293.91 +/- 32.21) times] respectively (P < 0.01), and correlated positively with the dose and dissociated Ca(2+) (r = 0.861, P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, the latent period was lengthened (P < 0.05) in the middle dosage and the high dosage group. CONCLUSION: The subchronic exposure to AlCl(3) in mice affects the dissociated Ca(2+) in hippocampus neuron cells. The increase of dissociated Ca(2+) in hippocampus neuron cells may be correlated with the disfunction of cognition in the aluminium intoxicated mice.
