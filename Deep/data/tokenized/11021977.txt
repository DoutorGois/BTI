We investigated the developmental expression of vasopressin and oxytocin receptor and peptide mRNA using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Southern blot hybridization. Messenger RNAs for both vasopressin receptor subtypes V(1)a and V(2)were present in the telencephalon from embryonic day 12 to day 20. Both V(1)a and V(2)receptor mRNA increased on day 13 and then remained stable from embryonic day 13 to day 20. Messenger RNA for the vasopressin peptide was also detected in the telencephalon from day 12 to day 20, indicating that vasopressin could be synthesized within the rat cerebral cortex during rat embryonic development. Oxytocin receptor mRNA expression was also present in the telencephalon, but expression levels varied considerably from day 12 to day 20. No oxytocin mRNA expression was detected during rat telencephalon development. Temporal patterns of vasopressin receptor and vasopressin peptide mRNA expression along with oxytocin receptor mRNA suggest a temporal role for vasopressin- and oxytocin-mediated actions during rat telencephalon development.
