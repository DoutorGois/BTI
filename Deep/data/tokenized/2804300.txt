5-HT1 receptors of the amygdala, midbrain's central gray substance, hippocampus and frontal cortex of the rats were investigated during the memory trace retrieval, using the model of "psychogenic" amnesia. It was found that specific binding of 3H 5-HT in amygdala and central gray substance was decreased in the rats with passive avoidance retention. 3H 5-HT binding in the amnesic rats didn't differ from the control animals. Absence of decrease of 5-HT1 receptors number could be considered as one of the possible mechanisms of the memory trace non-retrieval due to amnesia or its consequence.
