Various studies have demonstrated an increase in heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) synthesis in the brain following transiently induced ischemia, suggesting a protective role for HSP70 against ischemic insult. In this study, we determined the time course of HSP70 mRNA and protein induction in rat hippocampus following ischemia using Pulsinelli's four-vessel occlusion model, and suggested a protective role for HSP70 induction in limiting ischemic damage to neurons and delayed neuronal death. In Northern blotting analysis using human HSP70 DNA as a probe, the accumulation of HSP70 mRNA after 5 min ischemia became evident at 4 h, and continued until 16 h, while after 30 min ischemia, HSP70 mRNA appeared at 2 h, and continued above control level until 24 h after treatment. In immunoblot analysis using anti-HSP70 antibody, induction of HSP70 protein appeared 24 h and reached a maximum 48 h after 5 min ischemia. In immunohistochemical analysis using anti-HSP70 antibody, staining was not detected in CA1 neurons until 16 h after 5 min ischemia, but staining in CA1 gradually increased 1 day after ischemia and reached a maximum level 2 days after ischemia. Similar time profiles in the staining pattern of HSP70 protein were observed in CA3 and CA4 neuronal cells following 30 min ischemia. When rats pretreated with 5 min ischemia (non-lethal for CA1 pyramidal neurons) were exposed to a 30 min, lethal period of ischemia, 2 days after pretreatment, considerable staining of HSP70 was observed. Pretreated rats had much less neuronal damage in the CA1 sector than did rats subjected to lethal, 30 min ischemia alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
