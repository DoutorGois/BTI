Synaptotagmin IV (Syt IV) is a brain-specific isoform of the synaptotagmin family, the levels of which are strongly elevated after seizure activity. The dominant hypothesis of Syt IV function states that Syt IV upregulation is a neuroprotective mechanism for reducing neurotransmitter release. To test this hypothesis in mammalian CNS synapses, Syt IV was overexpressed in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, and acute effects on fast excitatory neurotransmission were assessed. We found neurotransmission unaltered with respect to basal release probability, Ca2+ dependence of release, short-term plasticity, and fusion pore kinetics. In contrast, expression of a mutant Syt I with diminished Ca2+ affinity (R233Q) reduced release probability and altered the Ca2+ dependence of release, thus demonstrating the sensitivity of the system to changes in neurotransmission resulting from changes to the Ca2+ sensor. Together, these data refute the dominant model that Syt IV functions as an inhibitor of neurotransmitter release in mammalian neurons.
