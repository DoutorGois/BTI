Magnetic resonance (MR) images in the sagittal plane display the lengths of the parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, dentate gyrus, hippocampus, fimbria, fornix, hippocampal fissure, choroidal fissure, and temporal horn, and the anatomic relationships of these structures to the surrounding brain. Correlation of these images with anatomic specimens provides criteria for identifying these structures confidently on routine clinical MR imaging.
