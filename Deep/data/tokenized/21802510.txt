The present study was designed to investigate the possible involvement of TLR4 pathway in the mouse hippocampus following toluene exposure. Male C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ (TLR4 defective) mice were exposed to 0, 5, 50 or 500 ppm of toluene for 6 weeks. The expressions of TLR4-related signal transduction pathway mRNAs in the hippocampi were examined using real-time RT-PCR and an immunohistochemical analysis. In C3H/HeN mice, the relative mRNA expression levels of TLR4 and NF-kappaB activating protein were significantly up-regulated in the groups exposed to toluene, but not in the C3H/HeJ mice. Heat shock protein 70, a possible endogenous ligand for TLR4, mRNA was increased in the C3H/HeN mice exposed to toluene. This is the first report to show that TLR4 may have a role in the neurotoxic effects in mice exposed to toluene.
