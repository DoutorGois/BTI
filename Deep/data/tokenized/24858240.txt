Exercise increases both the consumption of oxygen and the production of reactive species in biological tissues, and this is counterbalanced by antioxidant adaptations to regular physical training. When the intensity of exercise fluctuates between mild and moderate, it improves the status of reduction-oxidation balance in the brain and induces neuroplasticity. However, intense exercise can oxidize the brain and impair neurological function. The effect of the frequency of exercise, which is an important factor in physical training, is still unknown. The effect of periodic exercise on biomarkers of oxidative stress in the hippocampus of mice was evaluated in this study. Mice were made to run on a treadmill for 8 weeks, two, three, or five times per week, and their hippocampi and quadriceps femoris muscles were then dissected. Biomarkers of oxidative damage were negatively correlated with the frequency of exercise and mitochondrial muscular activity, while the sulfhydryl contents were positively correlated with exercise frequency. A logistic analysis revealed a dose-dependent effect of exercise on these biomarkers. In summary, these results suggested that manipulating the frequency of physical exercise could induce antioxidant-related adaptations in the hippocampi of adult mice.
