A cDNA for a putative novel serine protease, TLSP, was cloned from human hippocampus cDNA with polymerase chain reaction based strategies. The putative amino acid sequence of TLSP is similar to the trypsin-type serine proteases. TLSP mRNA is expressed in keratinocytes. Overexpressed TLSP protein in neuro2a cells was detected in culture medium.
