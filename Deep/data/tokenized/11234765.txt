Recent evidence suggests that alpha7 subunit-containing nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are involved in the processes underlying nicotine tolerance and withdrawal. The current study used in situ hybridization histochemistry with multiple radiolabelled probes to amplify mRNA signal, to examine the distribution of alpha7 nAChR subunit mRNA both in control brains and following chronic nicotine treatment (1.5 and 30.0 mg/kg/day). Low levels of alpha7 transcript were detected within substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), substantia nigra pars reticularis (SNpr) and VTA. Higher levels of alpha7 transcript were found within the cortex and hippocampus. Following chronic nicotine treatment, levels of alpha7 subunit mRNA were significantly elevated in SNpc, SNpr and VTA, but were unchanged in cortex and hippocampus.
