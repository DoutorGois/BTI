The aim of the present study was to investigate the agerelated alterations in hypertensive brain damage in the hippocampi of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and the underlying mechanisms. Aging resulted in a significant increase in the number of activated astrocytes and apoptotic cells in the SHR group, which was accompanied by increased expression of oxidative stress markers (iNOS and gp47phox) and apoptotic regulatory proteins (Bax and caspase3). In addition, the expression of PPARgamma and Bcl2 were progressively reduced with increasing age in the SHR group. The 32 and 64weekold SHRs exhibited significantly increased numbers of apoptotic cells, oxidative stress markers and proapoptotic proteins compared with agematched WKY rats, which was accompanied by reduced expression of PPARgamma. Compared with the 16 and 32weekold WKY group, the 64weekold WKY rats exhibited increased oxidative stress and proapoptotic markers, and increased levels apoptotic cells. In conclusion, the present study indicated that both aging and hypertension enhanced brain damage and oxidative stress injury in the hippocampi of SHRs, indicated by an increased presence of apoptotic cells and astrocytes. In addition, reduced expression of PPARgamma may contribute to the agerelated brain damage in SHRs.
