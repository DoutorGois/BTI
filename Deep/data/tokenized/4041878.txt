In this paper we present an in vitro model of epileptogenesis based on electrical stimulation rather than pharmacological or ionic manipulations. Hippocampal slices given a series of stimulus trains similar to those used in kindling exhibited 3 types of epileptiform activity in CA3: afterdischarges immediately following the trains; spontaneous bursts of multiple population spikes; and bursts triggered by single stimuli. The afterdischarges and spontaneous bursts may be comparable to those seen in vivo during kindling; also, the progression of these features in this model was similar to their progression during kindling. All epileptiform activities were long-lasting, persisting for up to 3.5 h following the last train. This stimulus train-induced population bursting should be valuable as an acute model of hippocampal epileptogenesis, and may also help elucidate hippocampal participation in the kindling process.
