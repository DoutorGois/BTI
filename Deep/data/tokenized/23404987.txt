BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether combined administration of celecoxib and sevoflurane after ischaemia produces additive neuroprotection against transient global cerebral ischaemia in rats. METHODS: Cerebral ischaemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion with haemorrhagic hypotension for 8 min. After ischaemia, no drugs were administered in the sham (n=4) and control (n=10) groups. In the celecoxib group (n=10), celecoxib 2 mg kg(-1) was administered after reperfusion. In the sevoflurane group (n=10), after reperfusion, sevoflurane 2.4% was inhaled two times for 5 min each at an interval of 10 min to achieve postconditioning. In the celecoxib+sevoflurane group (n=10), administration of celecoxib 2 mg kg(-1) and the sevoflurane postconditioning were performed simultaneously. Necrotic or apoptotic cells were examined in the hippocampus 7 days after ischaemia. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta were measured 2 h, and 3 and 7 days after ischaemia. RESULTS: Necrotic or apoptotic cells were observed more frequently in the control group than in the celecoxib or sevoflurane groups 7 days after ischaemia (P<0.05). Cytokine levels were higher in the control group when compared with the celecoxib or sevoflurane groups 2 h after ischaemia (P<0.05). However, the histological outcomes and cytokine levels were similar in all three groups treated with celecoxib or sevoflurane. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with celecoxib and sevoflurane after global cerebral ischaemia has no additive neuroprotective effects in rats.
