Previous studies on the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors intracellularly introduced into the postsynaptic neuron on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 region showed that given before the tetanic stimulation they only blocked the development of the maintenance phase of LTP and that given after the tetanus they did not affect the continued maintenance of established LTP. We now report different results in such experiments obtained by looking into the dose-effect relationship of the inhibitors given to the postsynaptic neuron and making use of a synergistic effect of two inhibitors given together. We used the following three PKC inhibitors: polymyxin B (PMB), PKC-(19-31), and H7. With the intracellular delivery of the inhibitor(s) beginning 30 min before the tetanus, PMB in adequate dosage or a combination of PMB and PKC-(19-31), each at a low dosage, could block the development of LTP completely including its initial induction phase. With the delivery beginning at the time of the tetanus, PKC-(19-31) or H7 slowly caused the established LTP to decline to the baseline; this decline was greatly accelerated when PMB and PKC-(19-31) or PMB and H7 were given together. PMB and PKC-(19-31) given together 75-90 min or even 3 h after the tetanus caused a decline of the maintained LTP similar to the decline observed when both inhibitors were given at the time of the tetanus. These results show that postsynaptic PKC is essentially involved in both the initial induction and the subsequent maintenance of LTP, contrary to current views on the subject.
