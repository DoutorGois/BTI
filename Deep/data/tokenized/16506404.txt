The use of electrophysiological recordings in brain slices is now routinely used to assess the actions of cannabinoid ligands within various central nervous system nuclei. In this chapter we describe common protocols involving both intracellular and extracellular recording techniques in the hippocampus, where the presynaptic modulatory effects of cannabinoid receptor activation have been studied in detail. In addition to describing the basic electrophysiological setup needed for these recordings, we will address common technical problems and limitations involved in working with highly lipophilic compounds, such as the cannabinoid ligands, in brain slices.
