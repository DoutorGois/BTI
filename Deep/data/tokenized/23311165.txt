OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of ginsenoside Rg1 on behavior and hippocampal amino acids in depressive-like rats. METHOD: SD rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, model, fluxetine, low dose ginsenoside Rg1 and high dose of ginsenoside Rg1. The chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was performed to induce depressive-like animal model. Fluxetine group was orally given fluxetine in dose of 10 mg x kg(-1) for 21 days, low dose ginsenoside Rg1 group was orally given ginsenoside Rg1 in dose of 20 mg x kg(-1) for 21 days, high dose ginsenoside Rg1 group was orally given ginsenoside Rg1 in dose of 40 mg x kg(-1) for 21 days. The control and model group was orally given saline for 21 days. The sucrose consumption was detected before and after the CUMS procedure. The horizontal and vertical activities of rats were determined by open-field test. HPLC was adopted to detect the contents of amino acids in hippocampus. RESULT: The sucrose consumption, horizontal and vertical activities in CUMS rats were decreased compared with those in control group. Compared with control group, the contents of glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) in hippocampus of CUMS group were increased, while the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and taurine (Tau) were decreased. Ginsenoside Rg1 treatment significantly increased the CUMS-induced decrease in sucrose consumption, horizontal and vertical activities. Administrated with ginsenoside Rg1 also decreased Glu and Asp and increased the GABA and Tau in hippocampus in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rg1 could alleviate the behavior changes of depressive-like rats, which might be related to regulate the levels of amino acids in hippocampus during CUMS and prevent the neuro-toxicity of excitatory amino acids.
