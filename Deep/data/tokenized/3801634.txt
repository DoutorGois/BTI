The activity of glutamate, succinate, malate and lactate dehydrogenases in neuronal and glial hippocampal cells during corazol kindling has been cytophotometrically assessed in the experiments on (CBA X C57BL/6)F1 mice. The kindling was induced by regular intraperitoneal corazol injections in subliminal dose of 30 mg/kg. Histochemical investigations were performed 30 min, 24 hours and 30 days after the corazol injections were discontinued. The changes in the enzymatic activity revealed suggest the biphasic nature of the disturbances in energy metabolism. During the first phase (24 hours after the last injection) the enzymatic changes do not have a noticeable influence on the predominant aerobic type of oxidation. In the second phase (30 days after the last injection) lactate dehydrogenase activity significantly increases, while the activity of other enzymes under study reduces.
