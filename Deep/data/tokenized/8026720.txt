1. Glutathione (GSH), injected by slow intravenous (i.v.) infusion (7.9 microliters/min, for 4 hr; total dose: 1.5 g/kg), starting 10 min after i.v. injection of kainic acid (KA; 12 mg/kg) in the rat reduced the decrease in local cerebral glucose utilization observed 48 hr following the administration of the neurotoxin. 2. Furthermore, it blocked the neuronal loss in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, and prevented, in the hippocampus, the development of edema and the marked depletion in the endogenous brain GSH pool. 3. One can speculate that this protective effect of exogenous GSH is correlated to its capacity to scavenge free radicals, thus preventing the accumulation of oxidant chemical species and the consequent reduction of cellular antioxidant defense.
