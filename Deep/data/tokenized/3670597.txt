The effects on hippocampal extra- and intracellular amino acids of focal injection of folic acid into the amygdala in the rabbit were studied with brain dialysis. Folate seizures were accompanied by pronounced elevations of extracellular alanine and phosphoethanolamine. The increase of extracellular alanine was related to an enhanced level of this amino acid in total hippocampal tissue, whereas phosphoethanolamine was unaltered in tissue biopsies. Folate seizures did not significantly affect extracellular aspartate and extracellular glutamate was only slightly elevated (50-75% over baseline values). The tissue concentration of glutamate remained at control levels during the seizures and tissue aspartate was decreased by 28%. Extracellular glutamine decreased rapidly after folate injection with a concomitant increase of total hippocampal glutamine. Neither extra- nor intracellular taurine was affected by folate epilepsy. The experiments also encompassed measurements of the extracellular purine catabolites inosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine. Folic acid-induced epilepsy produced changes in these compounds indicative of moderately accelerated degradation of adenosine 5'-triphosphate. The findings support the view of glutamate as a mediator of epilepsy-related brain damage. It is, however, questionable if the small enhancement of extracellular glutamate is enough to provoke neuronal necrosis associated with folate epilepsy.
