The inheritance of a complex illness such as schizophrenia likely involves the segregation of genetic factors, in combination with non-genetic or environmental abnormalities. This paper reviews several family studies of biological and clinical aspects of schizophrenia, that have attempted to observe such segregation in relationship to family history of schizophrenia to identify which factors appear to be related to the transmission of genetic risk.
