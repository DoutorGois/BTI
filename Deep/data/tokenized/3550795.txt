We used limbic seizures induced in rats by systemic injection of the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine (380 mg/kg; i.p.) to study the neuronal pathways within the basal ganglia that modulate seizure threshold. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (N-Me-D-Asp) is an excitatory amino acid derivative that is a powerful convulsant agent when injected into the cerebral cortex, amygdala, or hippocampus in rats. Bilateral microinjections of N-Me-D-Asp into the caudate-putamen, however, protected against limbic seizures induced by pilocarpine (injected systemically), with an ED50 of 0.7 nmol (range 0.5-1.0 nmol). Lesioning the caudate-putamen (by bilateral microinjection of the excitotoxin ibotenate) converted subconvulsant doses of pilocarpine into convulsant ones. The anticonvulsant action of N-Me-D-Asp in the caudate-putamen was reversed by blocking gamma-aminobutyrate-mediated inhibition in the substantia nigra pars reticulata or in the entopeduncular nucleus. The results suggest that the caudate-putamen and its gamma-aminobutyrate-dependent efferent pathways modulate the threshold for seizures in the limbic forebrain.
