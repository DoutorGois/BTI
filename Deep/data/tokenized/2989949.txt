The partial agonist [3H]para-aminoclonidine was used to label alpha 2-adrenergic binding sites in intact sections of the rat central nervous system using in vitro labeling receptor autoradiographic techniques. The distribution of alpha 2-agonist binding sites closely parallels the reported distribution of noradrenergic and adrenergic cell groups and their terminal fields, particularly the projections of the medullary catecholamine neurons. This distribution of alpha 2 binding sites confirms physiological studies which indicate that the anti-hypertensive actions of alpha 2-agonist compounds are mediated centrally in medullary and spinal centers involved in the control of parasympathetic and sympathetic outflow. Further, the high concentrations of alpha 2 binding sites in pontine and limbic areas such as the locus coeruleus, parabrachial nucleus, dorsal raphe, hypothalamus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, septum and entorhinal cortex offer an anatomical basis for understanding the anxiolytic and antidepressant actions of drugs like clonidine. The antagonists [3H]prazosin and [3H]WB4101 were used to study the distribution of alpha 1-adrenergic binding sites in the rat forebrain and biochemical studies were performed to analyze the marked differences that were initially seen in the distribution of [3H]prazosin and [3H]WB4101 binding sites. Several pieces of evidence derived from both biochemical and autoradiographic studies suggest that [3H]prazosin and [3H]WB4101 act at distinctly different binding sites. However, both sites may represent components of an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-effector complex since a high degree of overlap was seen in the binding site distribution of these two ligands and since kinetic interactions could be demonstrated in at least one region of the brain, the hippocampus. Differences noted in the relative displacements of [3H]prazosin and [3H]WB4101 binding in various forebrain regions could reflect differences in the coupling efficiency of the [3H]prazosin and [3H]WB4101 component of the hypothesized complex. Further, in some regions, [3H]WB4101 labeled a binding site that is different from the alpha 1-receptor. Thus, [3H]prazosin and [3H]WB4101 binding sites seen in forebrain regions such as lamina V of the cortex, thalamic nuclei and dorsal raphe probably represent alpha 1-adrenergic receptors and confirm electrophysiological and biochemical studies which demonstrate that adrenergic transmission in these regions can be mediated through an alpha 1-receptor.
