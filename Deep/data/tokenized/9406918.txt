Levels of the neurotransmitter somatostatin (SS) have previously been shown to be reduced in the cortex and hippocampus of demented parkinsonian patients and patients with Alzheimer's disease. In situ hybridisation histochemistry (ISHH) was performed with an 35S tail-labelled oligonucleotide DNA probe to human SS mRNA, to examine its expression within the striatum, medial medullary lamina (MML) and reticular thalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in matched controls. A chronic unilaterally MPTP-lesioned L-DOPA-naive primate model was also examined for comparison of SS mRNA expression with that in human L-DOPA treated PD subjects. Quantitation of SS mRNA expression on emulsion dipped sections revealed a significant increase (82%) in the MML of the globus pallidus in PD (56.5 microm2 of silver grain/cell, n = 9 cases) compared to controls (26.3 microm2/cell, n = 13 cases, p < 0.01, Student's t-test), paralleling the increase previously observed by this group for NOS mRNA. SS mRNA expression was higher in the dorsolateral than ventromedial putamen in controls (p < 0.001; DL: 24.89 +/- SEM 1.35; VM: 17.96 +/- SEM 2.63; n = 14) but this gradient was lost in PD cases (p > 0.05; DL: 22.68 +/- 1.94; VM: 22.17 +/- 2.94; n = 10). These findings suggest specific modification of basal ganglia SS-ergic pathways in PD.
