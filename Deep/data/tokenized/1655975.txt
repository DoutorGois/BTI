The role of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor (NGFR) in the regulation of cholinergic activity has been studied during the aging process. NGFRs were quantified in cortical membranes using a radioactive binding assay. NGF levels and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity were determined in cortex, hippocampus, neostriatum, and septum. These assays were performed in both adult (6-month-old) and aged (36-month-old) rats. High- and low-affinity 125I-NGF binding sites were present in cortex of adult and aged rats. Furthermore, we observed a decrease in number and affinity of both NGFRs in aged rats. ChAT activity in these rats was lower (approximately 30%) than in adult rats in all the brain regions examined. NGF levels were not modified in cortex and hippocampus and were decreased in neostriatum (55%) and septum (35%). In conclusion, our results suggest that, during the aging process, the cholinergic impairment is related to a decrease in NGF levels in neostriatum but not in cortex and hippocampus. The reduction in level of NGF protein in septum could be due to a decrease in number of high-affinity 125I-NGF binding sites.
