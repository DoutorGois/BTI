The factors leading to pronounced emotional stress accompanied by changes in electrical activity of hippocampus were studied in four dogs during elaboration of conditioned switching-over of heterogeneous instrumental reflexes. Objectively recorded signs of emotional stress were observed in two cases: when the animal was not accurate enough in discerning defensive and alimentary situations and throughout the improvement of instrumental defensive reflex. Pronouncement of hippocampal theta-rhythm increased at those stages of switching-over elaboration where the probability of successful avoiding pain stimulation was relatively low. The data obtained permit the conclussion that theta-rhythm is the correlate of the degree of the emotional stress and not only a manifestation of general arousal reaction depending on the level of sensory input.
