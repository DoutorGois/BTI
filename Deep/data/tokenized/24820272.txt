OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of polygona-polysaccharose (PP) on learning and memory ability in rats with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Forty five Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned into 3 groups. Rats in the sham-operated group were injected with normal saline. Rats in the Abeta group were injected with Abeta1-42. Rats in the PP group were injected with 16% PP solution for 45 days consecutively. The Morris water maze was used to investigate the ability of learning and memory in the rats. The effect of Abeta and PP on the hippocampus cells was observed by HE and Congo red staining of methanol. RESULTS: Rats in the sham-operated group had no obvious morphological change; and morphology of rats in the PP group was basicaly normal. The layer of pyramidal cells in the Abeta group was decreased. The cells appeared sparse and irregular and became smaller. Karyopyknosis and vacuolar degeneration cells were also found. More positive staining materials aggradated in the Abeta group compared with the PP group by Congo red staining (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Abeta infusion into the hippocampus results in the impairment of the neuronal degeneration in the rats, which shows similar characterizations of AD. PP can reduce the deposition of Abeta in the hippocampus.
