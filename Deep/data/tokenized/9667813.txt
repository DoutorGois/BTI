The present study was designed to evaluate possible presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations in the hippocampal cholinergic innervations that account for the hippocampus-related behavioral deficits found after prenatal drug exposure. Mice were prenatally exposed to either phenobarbital or heroin. On postnatal day 50, the hippocampi were removed and protein kinase C (PkC) activity, the amounts of Gi, Go, and Gq guanosine 5'-triphosphate binding proteins (G-proteins), and choline transports were determined. Basal PkC activity was higher than control levels in both phenobarbital and heroin treated mice, by 41% and 35%, respectively. The increase of PkC activity in response to carbachol was impaired in both treatment groups: in control mice, membrane PkC activity in hippocampal slices increased by 40%-50%, while no such response, or even slight reduction in PkC activity, was observed in the drug-exposed offspring. A significant increase was found in Gi and Gq G-proteins (18%-21%) in mice exposed to phenobarbital or to heroin compared with control levels. The amount of choline transporters, determined by hemicholinium binding, increased by 70% compared with the control level in mice prenatally exposed to heroin, and increased by 71% in mice prenatally exposed to phenobarbital. The alterations in basal and carbachol-stimulated hippocampal PkC activity after prenatal drug exposure may be related to an impairment in long-term potentiation (LTP); which plays an important role in hippocampal related behavioral abilities, changes in which are caused by prenatal drug exposure.
