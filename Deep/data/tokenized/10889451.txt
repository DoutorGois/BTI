Decomposition of lipid peroxides gives rise to a wide range of aldehydes. 4-Hydroxyalkenals and in particular 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) are often the most toxic products. Frequently, it is unclear at which stage in the tissue injury process HNE is formed, i.e., is it a late stage or an early stage in which HNE contributes to subsequent cell death? The present study was carried out using an antibody to HNE-modified proteins to elucidate the time course and distribution of HNE in the lesioned hippocampus after kainate injections. HNE was absent from normal neurons, but dense staining to HNE was observed in degenerating neurons after kainate injection. The increase in HNE staining occurred as early as 1 d postinjection, at a time when there was no histological evidence of cell death. HNE immunoreactivity was observed in the degenerating CA1 and CA3 fields at 3 d and 1 week postinjection, but was confined to a cluster of neurons at the edge of the degenerating CA fields, at 2 and 3 weeks postinjection. These observations suggest that HNE formation is an early event after this tissue injury, and may contribute to later cell death.
