We hypothesized that anesthetic dose of riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate neurotransmission, may affect the activity and/or expression of neuronal NOS (nNOS). Riluzole, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) and 7-nitro indazole (7-NI) produced a concentration-related inhibition of nNOS activity in vitro. Riluzole competed with 7-NI for inhibition of nNOS activity, but had no effect on nNOS or endothelial NOS (eNOS) protein expression. Also, nNOS activity was significantly decreased in riluzole-anesthetized rats (40 mg kg(-1) i.p., -32+/-6% from controls, P<0.05). Therefore, blockade of nNOS activity may be involved in the anesthetic effects of riluzole in vivo.
