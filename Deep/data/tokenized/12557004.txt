Excitotoxic activation of glutamate receptors is thought to play a key role in delayed neuronal death (DND) of highly vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons after transient global ischemia. DND can be prevented by a short sublethal preconditioning (PC) stimulus. Recently, we demonstrated that ischemic PC, but not a single period of 5-min ischemia elicits a transient up-regulation of hippocampal [(3)H]muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors. This indicates that activation of the GABAergic system may participate in the acquisition of neuroprotection. The present study was designed to test whether postischemic modulation of receptor binding also occurs in the ischemia-tolerant state, i.e., after a PC stimulus of 2.5-min ischemia and a subsequent normally lethal period of 5-min ischemia 4 days apart. Using receptor autoradiography, [(3)H]AMPA and [(3)H]muscimol binding to excitatory AMPA and inhibitory GABA(A) receptors was analyzed in hippocampal subfields CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus at recirculation intervals of 30 min, 8, 24, 48, 96 h and 3 weeks. Postischemic hippocampal ligand binding to AMPA receptors remained unchanged at any time point investigated, but [(3)H]muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors in CA1 neurons rendered tolerant to ischemia was up-regulated between 30 min and 48 h of recirculation. Our data suggest that a relative shift between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission may promote postischemic survival of CA1 neurons.
