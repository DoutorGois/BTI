The purpose of the present study is to clarify the effect of clonidine on the release of serotonin from the rat hippocampus in vivo. For this purpose, endogenous serotonin release was measured by brain microdialysis. Potassium-evoked serotonin release from the hippocampus of freely moving rats was significantly inhibited when clonidine (10(-5) M) was added to the perfusion solution, while the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid output remained unchanged. In catecholaminergically denervated rats, clonidine (10(-5) M) also inhibited the potassium-evoked serotonin release from the hippocampus and the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid output was unaffected by clonidine. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of clonidine on serotonin release from the hippocampus might reflect the activation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors which are localized on the serotonergic nerve terminals.
