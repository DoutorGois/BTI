Embryos and embryocultures can be successfully transplanted into various bodily organs. However immunosuppression or homogenicity are required for the success of such experimental manipulation. Since the brain is considered immunologically privileged, we transplanted 2-4 cell embryos of C57BL x BALB/c, embryonic stem cells (ES) or embryoid bodies (EB) cultures into the hippocampus of the heterogeneous mouse stock HS/IBg. Both ES and EB cultures developed into an extensive growth, eventually larger than the brain itself, causing the death of the host in less than 29 days. The growth was identified as teratoma, mostly made of immature cells and tissues of diverse origin. Thus, the overall histological picture was that of a malignant teratoma. On the other hand, no embryos were found at any time after the transplantation; apparently, they could not survive in the host brain. The growth rate and the relative lack of rejection suggest that the brain offers a unique medium for ES and EB cultures but, not to embryos.
