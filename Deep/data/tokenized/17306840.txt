In this paper, we propose an iterative learning rule that allows the imprinting of correlated oscillatory patterns in a model of the hippocampus able to work as an associative memory for oscillatory spatio-temporal patterns. We analyze the dynamics in the Fourier domain, showing how the network selectively amplify or distort the Fourier components of the input, in a manner which depends on the imprinted patterns. We also prove that the proposed iterative local rule converges to the pseudo-inverse rule generalized to oscillatory patterns.
