We describe two cases presenting with small cysts in the choroidal fissure of the temporal horn (choroidal fissure cyst). Both patients manifested solely complex partial seizure. On magnetic resonance imaging, the signal intensity of the cyst was identical to that of the cerebrospinal fluid, and the underlying hippocampus was compressed by the cyst. Since the cyst was thought to be of a neuroepithelial type, and therefore of benign nature, surgical intervention was avoided since satisfactory medical control of the seizures was obtained.
