OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of apoptosis after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats and elucidate the role of GM-1 by detecting the expression of Fas mRNA and apoptosis in hippocampi. METHODS: After creating the model of Marmarou cranio-cerebral trauma and offering GM-1 therapy, we observed the expression of Fas mRNA and apoptotic cell death using in situ hybridization and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin in situ nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique. RESULTS: Increased expression of Fas mRNA and increased apoptotic cells in hippocampi after TBI were observed. GM-1 could decrease the expression of Fas mRNA and apoptotic cell death. CONCLUSION: The increased expression of Fas mRNA may be a noteworthy cause of apoptotic cell death after traumatic brain injury. GM-1 may play a protective role by way of decreasing the expression of Fas mRNA and apoptotic cell death.
