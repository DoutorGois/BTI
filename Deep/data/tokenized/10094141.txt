NMDA and GABA(A) receptors are believed to be important CNS targets of alcohol action. In mouse hippocampal neurons, n-alcohols from ethanol to dodecanol enhanced GABA-activated ion current, whereas higher alcohols had no effect. Alcohols below pentanol affected NMDA receptors more potently than GABA(A) receptors. Increasing alcohol carbon chain length produced a greater average change in apparent binding energy and potency for modulation of GABA(A) than of NMDA receptor-channels, with the result that alcohols above pentanol affected GABA(A) receptors more potently than NMDA receptors. The anesthetic potency of n-alcohols in rats more closely reflected NMDA receptor modulatory potency for lower alcohols and GABA(A) receptor modulatory potency for higher alcohols. The results suggest that there may be fundamental differences in the sites through which alcohols affect NMDA and GABA(A) receptor function.
