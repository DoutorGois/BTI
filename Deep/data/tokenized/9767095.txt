This paper reports on the protocol for the determination of H2O2 in the brain using in vivo microdialysis coupled with fluorometry of dichlorofluorescin oxidation. We applied this protocol to monitor changes in the concentration of H2O2 in the brain, in vivo, during ischemia and reperfusion. Using this method, changes in the level of H2O2 in the brain during ischemia and reperfusion were effectively determined. The present protocol provides a novel tool to study the production of reactive oxygen species in the brain.
