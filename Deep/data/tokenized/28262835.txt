Sonic hedgehog (SHH) as a secreted protein is important for neuronal development in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanism about SHH release remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that SHH was expressed mainly in the synaptic vesicles of hippocampus in both young postnatal and adult rats. High, but not low, frequency stimulation, induces SHH release from the neurons. Moreover, removal of extracellular Ca(2+), application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), an inhibitor of voltage-dependent sodium channels, or downregulation of soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) proteins, all blocked SHH release from the neurons in response to HFS. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism to control SHH release from the hippocampal neurons.
