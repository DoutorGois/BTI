Psychotic and behavioral symptoms are common in patients with dementia. Thus, it is rational to assume that patients with dementia would gain benefit from combination therapy of an antipsychotic agent and a cognitive enhancer. Antipsychotics are not approved by the US FDA in elderly patients with dementia but their use is still prevalent in other population. In the current study, we investigate the effect of atypical antipsychotics on acetylcholine modulation by donepezil. In addition, the plasma pharmacokinetics on concurrent administration of these drugs was studied. Acetylcholine modulation was carried out in the ventral hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats using brain microdialysis technique. In a parallel group of animals, pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated on administration of donepezil (5.0 mg kg(-1), ip) alone and in combination with olanzapine, clozapine, or quetiapine. Donepezil produced 348% increase in hippocampal acetylcholine levels. Coadministration of olanzapine and donepezil produced 393% increase in extracellular acetylcholine, and the effect was supported by a significantly (p < 0.05) decreased clearance of donepezil in plasma. Whereas, other plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of donepezil "AUC(0-24h), T (1/2) and T (max)" were moderately altered after this combination treatment. Concurrent administrations of clozapine or quetiapine with donepezil produced a non-significant change in acetylcholine levels in comparison to donepezil alone. The plasma pharmacokinetics of donepezil was unaltered. Results from this preclinical investigation indicate that extrapyramidal side effects may precipitate upon coadministration of donepezil with olanzapine. Care must be exercised by physicians and caregivers while administering these two drugs together.
