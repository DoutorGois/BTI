Rat hippocampus membranes were treated with several protein modifying reagents (iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, tetranitromethane and N-acetylimidazole). The effects of these treatments on the binding sites of cyclopyrrolones ([3H] suriclone), a new chemical family of minor tranquilizers, and benzodiazepines ([3H] flunitrazepam) were investigated. Here we show that both ligands are similarly sensitive to cysteine alkylation: [3H] suriclone and [3H] flunitrazepam binding are reduced by iodoacetamide and slightly increased by N-ethylmaleimide. On the contrary they are clearly differenciated by tyrosine modification: [3H] suriclone binding is not changed whereas [3H] flunitrazepam binding is increased by tetranitromethane and decreased by N-acetylimidazole. Our present findings and published evidence suggest cyclopyrrolones and benzodiazepines bind to distinct sites or to different allosteric forms of the benzodiazepine receptor.
