In acute experiments on cats with pretrigeminal brain-stem section responses of 46 hippocampal neurons were investigated. Most neurons (71%) had small sizes of visual receptive fields. The responses of neurons to stationary stimuli were of phasic (66%), as well as tonic (34%) types. All neurons investigated responded to dark and bright spots moving across their receptive fields. 27% of sensitive neurons were direction-selective. Some neurons respond more intensively to moving dark spots in comparison with bright spots or bars. The results presented confirmed the suggestion that certain neurons in the CA1 field of the dorsal hippocampus have highly organized visual sensory input.
