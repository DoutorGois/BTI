Changes in hippocampal CA1 field potentials during and after tetanic stimulation were studied in rats pretreated with 5 mg/kg s.c. naloxone or saline. Stimuli consisted of successive tetani of increasing frequency; responses at threshold, midrange and asymptotic intensities were sampled. A several fold increase in response amplitude occurred during low frequency stimulation, with no significant differences between the groups. Post-tetanic responses showed depression at the lower frequencies but increases ranging up to 400% at higher frequencies, with the greatest potentiation at threshold; again there were no significant differences between naloxone and saline groups, suggesting that endogenous opiates are not involved.
