Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes containing the alpha4 subunit, particularly alpha4beta2 nAChRs, play an important role in cognitive functioning. The impact of the smoking cessation aid varenicline, a selective partial alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist, on (1) changes of central protein and mRNA expression of this receptor and (2) on memory deficits in a mouse model of cognitive impairment was investigated. Protein and mRNA expression of both the alpha4 and beta2 receptor subunits in mouse brain endothelial and hippocampal cells as well as hippocampus and neocortex tissues were determined by western blot and realtime PCR, respectively. The beta2 antibody showed low specificity, though. Tissues were examined following a 2-week oral treatment with various doses of varenicline (0.01, 0.1, 1, 3 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. In addition, episodic memory of mice was assessed following this treatment with an object recognition task using (1) normal mice and (2) animals with anticholinergic-induced memory impairment (i.p. injection of 0.5 mg/kg scopolamine). Varenicline dose-dependently increased protein expression of both the alpha4 and beta2 subunit in cell cultures and brain tissues, respectively, but had no effect on mRNA expression of both subunits. Scopolamine injection induced a significant reduction of object memory in vehicle-treated mice. By contrast, cognitive performance was not altered by scopolamine in varenicline-treated mice. In conclusion, a 2-week oral treatment with varenicline prevented memory impairment in the scopolamine mouse model. In parallel, protein, but not mRNA expression was upregulated, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism. Our findings suggest a beneficial effect of varenicline on cognitive dysfunction.
