Beta-adrenergic receptors (beta-ARs) critically modulate long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory storage in the mammalian brain. Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to mediate memory storage at the cellular level. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is one type of synaptic plasticity that has been linked to memory storage. Activation of beta-ARs can enhance LTP and facilitate long-term memory storage. Interestingly, many of the molecular signaling pathways that are critical for beta-adrenergic modulation of LTP mirror those required for the persistence of memory. In this article, we review the roles of signaling cascades and translation regulation in enabling beta-ARs to control expression of long-lasting LTP in the rodent hippocampus. These include the cyclic-AMP/protein kinase-A (cAMP-PKA) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase cascades, two key pathways known to link transmitter receptors with translation regulation. Future research directions are discussed, with emphasis on defining the roles of signaling complexes (e.g. PSD-95) and glutamatergic receptors in controlling the efficacy of beta-AR modulation of LTP.
