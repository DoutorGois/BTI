Previous studies from our laboratories have shown that the consumption of moderate quantities of ethanol by rat dams during pregnancy reduces N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist receptor binding and NMDA-mediated electrophysiological responses in the hippocampal formation of adult offspring. We hypothesized that prenatal ethanol exposure would produce similar effects on receptor number and agonist-mediated responses of two so-called "non-NMDA" subtypes of glutamate receptors, the ionotropic-quisqualate (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-sensitive and the kainate-sensitive receptors. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a liquid diet containing 3.35% ethanol, an isocalorically matched liquid diet, or lab chow ad libitum throughout gestation. No significant differences between offspring from these three groups in the agonist concentration-response curves for either AMPA-induced or kainate-induced depolarization of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were observed. Furthermore, no significant differences in the density of [3H]-AMPA or [3H]-vinylidene kainic acid binding sites in any of the apical dendritic field regions of dorsal or ventral hippocampal formation were observed between the groups. These results indicate that the ionotropic quisqualate and kainate receptors, located in the apical dendritic field regions of the principal hippocampal neurons, are not affected by the same degree of prenatal ethanol exposure, which is known to reduce NMDA receptor binding and function in these same regions.
