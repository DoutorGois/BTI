The effects of DSP-4 on brain NE levels and turnover in rats were investigated in six brain regions: cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, brainstem, hypothalamus and locus coeruleus. Administration of 50 mg/kg of DSP-4 significantly decreased NE levels in all brain regions; greatest reductions occurred in the cortex (86% decrease) and in the hippocampus (91% decrease). Doses of DSP-4 less than 50 mg/kg did not significantly lower NE levels in other brain regions, except within the cerebellum. Levels of the NE metabolite 3-methoxy, 4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol sulfate (MHPG-S04) declined in parallel with those of NE, except within the brainstem and the locus coeruleus. NE turnover, expressed as the ratio of the MHPG-S04 concentration to that of NE, was higher in the cortex and hippocampus than other regions in control animals, and NE turnover significantly increased only in these two areas after the administration of 50 mg/kg of DSP-4 (p less than 0.01). There were no significant changes in the levels of dopamine and a significant decrease of serotonin only in the striatum. These results indicate that DSP-4 is a neurotoxin with a strong predilection for noradrenergic neurons, that its effects vary according to brain region and that its administration increases NE turnover in those brain regions showing the greatest depletion of NE.
