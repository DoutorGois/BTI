Quantitative study of GABAergic and main cells in the hippocampus and piriform cortex of Krushinskii-Molodkina rats was performed 1 month after the incidence of seizure activity evoked by acoustic stimulation. The number of neurons significantly decreased in both regions and, particularly, in the hippocampus and central area of the piriform cortex.
