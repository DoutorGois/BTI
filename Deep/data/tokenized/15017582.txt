The human hippocampus is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because postmenopausal estrogen use may decrease the risk and delay the onset and progression of AD, possibly by a direct action on the hippocampal neurons, we used fluorescence immunocytochemistry to examine the colocalization of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta) in the hippocampus of elderly human controls and AD patients. Double-labeling cells (DLCs) of ERalpha and ERbeta can be divided into 3 types: double-cytoplasm-staining cells (DCCs), double-nucleus-staining cells (DNCs), and ERalpha nucleus-staining and ERbeta cytoplasm-staining cells (NCCs). There was no difference in the percentage of DLCs in total ERalpha-positive cells or in total ERbeta-positive cells in the CA1 to CA4 subfields of the hippocampus between controls and AD patients. Interestingly, the ratio of DNCs to the total ERalpha-positive cells (2.6% +/- 0.5%) or to the total ERbeta-positive cells (1.8% +/- 0.3%) in the CA1 subfield of the AD hippocampus was significantly decreased in comparison with controls (5.0% +/- 0.7% and 3.9% +/- 0.6%, respectively; P<0.001), suggesting that changes in the compartmentalization of these receptors could play a role in the pathogenesis of AD.
