We studied the neuronal mechanisms of the various emotional and motivational states in Wistar rats with different behavioral activities. Stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus had more pronounced effect on the frequency of action potentials in neurons of the dorsal hippocampus than stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus. However, stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus produced stronger effect on spatial and temporal characteristics of fi ring pattern than stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus. Neurons of the dorsal hippocampus in active rats were less sensitive to stimulation of the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus than in passive animals.
