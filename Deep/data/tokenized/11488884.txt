PURPOSE: To determine whether specific temporal lobe simple partial seizures (SPSs) are associated with an abnormal amygdala T2 (AT2) ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with intractable unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). AT2 relaxation time mapping is a sensitive method for the detection of abnormal tissue in the amygdala in patients with refractory TLE. The relation between an abnormal AT2 in the epileptic temporal lobe and amygdala seizure onset has not been established. METHODS: Fifty patients with intractable unilateral TLE and concordant data during presurgical evaluation were included. Patients with a foreign-tissue lesion on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were excluded. All had AT2 mapping. Fifteen types of SPSs were ascertained prospectively, systematically, and blinded to the results of AT2 mapping. The SPSs of patients with a normal AT2 (n = 25) were compared with those of patients with an abnormal AT2 ipsilateral to the seizure focus (n = 25). RESULTS: The group of patients with an abnormal AT2 reported a median of six types of SPSs (range 1-11), in comparison with a median of three types of SPSs (range, 0-7) for the group with a normal AT2 (p<0.01). Deja vu, a warm sensation, an indescribable strange sensation, a cephalic sensation, and fear were associated with an abnormal AT2. The combination of deja vu, a cephalic sensation, a warm sensation, a gustatory hallucination, and an indescribable strange sensation discriminated best between the 25 patients with a normal and the 25 patients with an abnormal AT2. CONCLUSIONS: A high number and the types of different SPSs provide clinical evidence for early involvement of the amygdala during seizures in patients with refractory unilateral TLE and an abnormal AT2 in the epileptic temporal lobe
