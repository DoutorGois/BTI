We report on a 28-year-old man with long-standing intractable complex partial and secondary generalized seizures, whose magnetic resonance imaging scans 4 years apart documented progressive decrease in the left hippocampal volume. Left anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy rendered the patient seizure free at 12 months' follow-up. The findings demonstrate that patients with uncontrolled temporal lobe seizures may develop progressive atrophy of the hippocampus, in the absence of status epilepticus.
