The influence on hippocampal glucose utilization was determined in male Wistar rats 7 days after a 10-min forebrain ischemia. Ischemia was induced by clamping of the carotid arteries and lowering blood pressure to 40 mm Hg. Despite severe neuronal damage as assessed by histological techniques, local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was significantly increased in the pyramidal and radiatum layer of the CA1 sector, while in layers of the CA2, CA3 and CA4 sector and dentate gyrus. LCGU was reduced compared to non-ischemic controls. The increases in LCGU are suggested to reflect long-lasting hyperexcitation in the selectively vulnerable CA1 sector, implicating a correlation between cellular hypermetabolism and neuronal damage.
