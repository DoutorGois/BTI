Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that chronic stress produces molecular, morphological, and ultrastructural changes in the rat hippocampus that are accompanied by cognitive deficits. Glucocorticoid attenuation of glucose utilization is proposed to be one of the causative factors involved in stress-induced changes in the hippocampus, producing an energy-compromised environment that may make hippocampal neuronal populations more vulnerable to neurotoxic insults. Similarly, diabetes potentiates neuronal damage in acute neurotoxic events, such as ischemia and stroke. Accordingly, the current study examined the regulation of the neuron-specific glucose transporter, GLUT-3, in the hippocampus of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats subjected to restraint stress. Diabetes leads to significant increases in GLUT-3 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus, increases that are not affected by stress. Collectively, these results suggest that streptozotocin-induced increases in GLUT-3 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus may represent a compensatory mechanism to increase glucose utilization during diabetes and also suggest that modulation of GLUT-3 expression is not responsible for glucocorticoid impairment of glucose utilization.
