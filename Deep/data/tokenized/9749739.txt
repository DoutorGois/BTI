The behavioural and electrographical abnormalities associated with seizures in epileptic (kindled) mice correspond with those of human epilepsy. In kindled mice, neuropsin was markedly increased in the hippocampus and cerebral cortices. A single intraventricular injection of monoclonal antibodies specific to neuropsin reduced or eliminated the epileptic pattern noted on electroencephalograms and, as a result markedly inhibited the progression of kindling. Therefore, neuropsin appears to be a key protein controlling pathogenic events in the hippocampus, and thus neuropsin inhibitors might be useful for treatment of epilepsy.
