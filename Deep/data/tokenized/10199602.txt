Insulin-like growth factor-1 has pleiotropic effects in the central nervous system and can act both as a survival and a differentiation factor. Insulin-like growth factor-1 can be proteolytically cleaved into des-N-(1-3)-insulin-like growth factor-1 and a N-terminal tripeptide fragment, glycine-proline-glutamate. Both insulin-like growth factor-1 and des-N-(1-3)-insulin-like growth factor-1 can improve neuronal survival after hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in vivo. The present study investigates the effects of glycine-proline-glutamate on different brain regions and neuronal populations after hypoxic-ischemic injury. Unilateral hypoxic-ischemic injury was induced in adult rats. Glycine-proline-glutamate (3 microg) was administered centrally 2 h after the injury and the extent of brain damage determined five days later. In a separate trial immunohistochemical techniques were used to determine the effects of glycine-proline-glutamate on specific populations of neurons in the striatum after the injury. Compared to the vehicle treatment, glycine-proline-glutamate (n=19) treatment reduced the extent of cortical damage and neuronal loss in the CA1-2 subregions of the hippocampus (P<0.05). In the striatum, there was a trend towards a reduction in neuronal loss after glycine-proline-glutamate treatment (P=0.053) compared to the vehicle (n=21)-treated animals. In a separate study, glycine-proline-glutamate (n=8) treatment prevented the loss of choline acetyltransferase (P<0.05), glutamate acid decarboxylase (P<0.05) and somatostatin (P<0.05) containing neurons in the ipsilateral striatum following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and also increased the numbers of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (P<0.05) containing neurons in the contralateral side. These studies suggest that in addition to neuroprotective effects, glycine-proline-glutamate can influence neuronal activity after hypoxic-ischemic injury.
