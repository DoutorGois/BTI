Neuronal cdc2-like kinase, nclk, is a heterodimer of cyclin dependent protein kinase 5, cdk5, and a 25 kDa subunit derived from a novel, neuron-specific, 35 kDa protein: p35. The characterization and regulation of nclk will be summarized in this minireview. The activity of nclk appears to be governed by highly complex regulatory mechanisms including protein-protein interaction, protein phosphorylation and isoforms. The histone H1 kinase activity of nclk is absolutely dependent of the interaction between the 25 kDa subunit and the catalytic subunit, cdk5. In addition, nclk interacts with other cellular proteins to form macromolecular complexes. The kinase activity of nclk is inhibited in vitro by the phosphorylation reactions of a weel-like protein tyrosine kinase and a protein serine/threonine kinase from bovine thymus. Northern blot analysis has revealed the existence of two populations of p35 mRNA of 2 and 4 kb. A novel cDNA encoding a p35 homologous protein has been obtained from a human hippocampus library.
