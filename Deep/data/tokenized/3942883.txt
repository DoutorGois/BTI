The amplitude of population spikes in the CA1 cell layer of rat hippocampal slices was transiently altered during stimulation of the tissue with DC and sinusoidal extracellular electric fields parallel to the dendrosomatic axis of the CA1 pyramidal neurons. Field threshold was about 50 mV/cm in the tissue. Independently, long-lasting (min) increases in population spike amplitude followed sinusoidal fields as low as 7 mV/cm parallel or perpendicular to the cell axis.
