1. The expression of the gene codifying for CD4, the most important human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) receptor molecule, was analyzed in 11 fetal brains at various gestational ages and in 9 human neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines. CD4 gene expression in fetal and malignant neural cells was then compared with that observed in a hematopoietic cell line and adult hippocampus. 2. In addition, CD4 mRNA was evaluated in two NB cell lines induced to differentiate in vitro with retinoic acid (RA) or 1-(5-isoquinolinyl-sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine (H7), a protein kinase C inhibitor. 3. All fetal brains and NB cell lines express a 1.8-kb signal when hybridized with pT4BcDNA probe, while a 3.0-kb signal such as observed in hematopoietic human cells was found in 1 of 11 fetal brains and in 0 of 9 NB cell lines. The 1.8-kb signal was lost in all analyzed poly(A)+ mRNA samples. 4. Moreover, CD4 gene expression was not induced in either RA- or H7-treated NB cells at any tested time and dose. The analysis of NB cells by polymerase chain reaction failed to demonstrate CD4 expression in either poly(A)+ or poly(A)- RNA. 5. In conclusion, the results show that the 1.8-kb signal observed in RNA extracted from fetal or transformed human neural cells is probably due to an aspecific hybridization. However, the gene codifying for CD4 can rarely be expressed by fetal brain cells early during gestation, in still unclear circumstances.
