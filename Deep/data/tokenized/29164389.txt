Although child abuse has become a serious social problem in most countries, the neural mechanisms by which it induces adulthood mental disorders is not yet fully understood. Mice exposed to early-life stresses, such as maternal deprivation (MD) during lactation, are a good model for studying the effects of neglect of humans in early life. Early-life stress induces structural/functional changes of neurons in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, and causes mental disorders in adulthood. In this study, we found motor coordination dysfunction in male MD mice. We also found that the expression levels of the aminomethylphosphonic acid receptor subunits GluA1 and GluA3 were high in the cerebellum of male MD mice. The basal activity of the cerebellum detected by field-potential analysis was higher in male MD mice than in male control mice. Caloric stimulation increased the activity of the cerebellum of control mice, but it did not significantly increase the activity of the cerebellum in male MD mice. We concluded that early-life stress induced a functional change in the cerebellum of MD mice and that this change induced motor coordination dysfunctions.
