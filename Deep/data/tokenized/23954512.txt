Temporal lobe epilepsy often shows pharmacoresistance, and well-known anti-convulsants sometimes are not effective for blocking chronic seizures. Botulinum neurotoxins are metalloproteases that act on presynaptic proteins and inhibit neurotransmitter release in both the peripheral and central nerve systems. That is why neurotoxins may elicit an effect for the restraint of the seizures. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that a property and the stability of neurotoxin activities differ among the types A-G, in which type A neurotoxin (ANTX) is, especially, the most stable and can continue having activity for a long term. The present study therefore investigated the effects of hippocampal injections of A2NTX on seizures derived in TLE model mice, received repeated kindling stimulations in the amygdala. The injections induced complete disappearance of grand mal seizures in half of the population of amygdala kindled mice for 4 days. The injections also induced reduction of the evoked seizure level significantly for at least 18 days after injections. Taken together, these results suggest that A2NTX prevents from epileptic seizures, proposing that A2NTX is available as a new antiepileptic reagent.
