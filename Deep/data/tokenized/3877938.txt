Male rats were treated with a combination of systemic fluoxetine and intraventricular xylamine (under ether anesthesia) to deplete brain norepinephrine (NE) in the projection areas of the locus coeruleus. Four days later, control and lesioned rats were tested following injections of either saline or 80 micrograms/kg LSD in a Behavioral Pattern Monitor which recorded the sequential patterns of their locomotor and investigatory (holepokes) responses. Liquid chromatographic measures of brain monoamines confirmed that xylamine reduced hippocampal NE by 80.8% and hypothalamic NE by 26% without affecting levels of serotonin or dopamine. Relative to controls, NE-depleted rats exhibited repetitive spatial patterns of locomotion with no alteration in the amount or rate of habituation of locomotor activity. Lesioned animals made fewer rearings and holepokes, particularly early in the hour test session. When given 80 micrograms/kg LSD, sham-lesioned rats exhibited the expected decreases in entries into and time spent in the center of the chamber, an increase in time spent in the corners, and fewer holepokes and rearings early in the session. With the exception of the effect on rearings and holepokes, the effects of LSD were diminished in rats depleted of brain NE. These results indicate that this profile of behavioral effects of LSD, which has been interpreted as a potentiation of neophobia, may be dependent upon the noradrenergic projections of the locus coeruleus.
