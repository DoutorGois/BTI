The neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) at 1 nM protects NMDA-/GABAA-receptor negative neural crest-derived PC12 cells from apoptosis. We now report that membrane-impermeable DHEA-BSA conjugate replaces unconjugated DHEA in protecting serum-deprived PC12 cells from apoptosis (IC50=1.5 nM). Protection involves phosphorylation of the prosurvival factor Src and induction of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and is sensitive to pertussis toxin. Binding assays of [3H]DHEA on isolated PC12 cell membranes revealed saturation within 30 min and binding of DHEA with a Kd of 0.9 nM. A similar binding activity was detectable in isolated membranes from rat hippocampus and from normal human adrenal chromaffin cells. The presence of DHEA-specific membrane binding sites was confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser microscopy of DHEA-BSA-FITC stained cells. In contrast to estrogens and progestins, glucocorticoids and androgens displaced DHEA from its membrane binding sites but with a 10-fold lower affinity than DHEA (IC50=9.3 and 13.6 nM, respectively). These agents acted as pure antagonists, blocking the antiapoptotic effect of DHEA as well as the induction of Bcl-2 proteins and Src kinase activation. In conclusion, our findings suggest that neural crest-derived cells possess specific DHEA membrane binding sites coupled to G proteins. Binding to these sites confers neuroprotection.
