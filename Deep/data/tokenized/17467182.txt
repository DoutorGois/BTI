The hippocampal formation is a plastic brain structure important for certain types of learning and memory, and also vulnerable to the effects of stress and trauma. Since hippocampal neurons express high levels of corticosteroid receptor, the morphological changes, including alterations in the size of soma, and the length and number of neurites and spines, in response to glucocorticoids released as a result of stress are intriguing. In order to highlight the morphology of neurons that express glucocorticoid receptor (GR), we have generated a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the GR promoter. We found strong green fluorescence in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 and CA2 regions and the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in brain sections of the transgenic mice. GFP fluorescence was observed not only in somas, but also in neurites including both dendrites and axons. In dissociated culture, we also observed GFP fluorescence in the soma, neurites including both dendrites and axons, and dendritic spines. Microtubule-associated protein 2 immunopositive pyramidal-shaped neurons clearly showed two different populations, GFP positive and GFP negative neurons. These results indicate that this transgenic mouse line should be useful for live imaging of neuronal structure in animals as well as GR-positive cultured cells using GFP as a specific indicator.
