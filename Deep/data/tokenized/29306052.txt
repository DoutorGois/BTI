Recent findings suggest that soluble forms of amyloid-beta (sAbeta) peptide contribute to synaptic and cognitive dysfunctions in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, neuroinflammation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme have gained increased interest as key factors involved early in AD, although the signaling pathways and pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying a link between sAbeta-induced neurotoxicity and inflammation are still unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of selective COX-2 enzyme inhibition on neuropathological alterations induced by sAbeta administration in rats. To this purpose, animals received an intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of predominantly monomeric forms of sAbeta and, 7days after, behavioral as well as biochemical parameters and neurotransmitter alterations were evaluated. During this period, rats also received a sub-chronic treatment with celecoxib. Biochemical results demonstrated that icv sAbeta injection significantly increased both COX-2 and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression in the hippocampus (Hipp) of treated rats. In addition, the number of hypertrophic microglial cells and astrocytes were upregulated in sAbeta-treated group. Interestingly, rats treated with sAbeta showed long-term memory deficits, as confirmed by a significant reduction of discrimination index in the novel object recognition test, along with reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and increased noradrenaline levels in the Hipp. Systemic administration of celecoxib prevented behavioral dysfunctions, as well as biochemical and neurotransmitter alterations. In conclusion, our results suggest that sAbeta neurotoxicity might be associated to COX-2-mediated inflammatory pathways and that early treatment with selective COX-2 inhibitor might provide potential remedies to counterbalance the sAbeta-induced effects.
