Similarities between age-related changes in the canine and human brain have resulted in the general acceptance of the canine brain as a model of human brain aging. The hippocampus is essentially required for intact cognitive ability and appears to be particularly vulnerable to the aging process. We observed changes in ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1, a microglial marker) immunoreactivity and protein levels in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1 region of adult (2-3 years) and aged (10-12 years) dogs. We also observed the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, protein levels in these groups. In the dentate gyrus and CA1 region of the adult dog, Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia were well distributed and their processes were highly ramified. However, in the aged dog, the processes of Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia were hypertrophied in the dentate gyrus. Moreover, Iba-1 protein level in the dentate gyrus in the aged dog was higher than in the adult dog. IFN-gamma expression was increased in the dentate gyrus homogenates of aged dogs than adult dogs. In addition, we found that some neurons were positive to Fluoro-Jade B (a marker for neuronal degeneration) in the dentate polymorphic layer, but not in the hippocampal CA1 region in the aged dog. These results suggest that Iba-1 immunoreactive microglia are hypertrophied in the dentate gyrus in the aged dog.
