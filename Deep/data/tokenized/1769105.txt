The postnatal evolution of depolarizing after-potentials (DAPs) and after-hyperpolarizations (AHPs) was studied in rat CA1 hippocampal neurones (5-68 days of age) using in vitro slices. Results were pooled into 4 age groups: P5-9, P10-16, P17-24 and P26-68. In P5-9 cells, DAPs were seen as passive signals, with a time constant similar to the time constant of the membrane. The evolution of the DAP was characterized by a decrease in amplitude, an increase in duration and a change in contour. In P10-16 and P17-24 cells, the DAPs often had a plateau or a hump-like shape which increased the probability of firing and the occurrence of spike doublets. The firing pattern and bursting behaviour of P10-16 CA1 neurones differed from the pattern typical of the adult. P5-9 and P10-16 cells had post-burst AHPs with a smaller amplitude and a more prolonged early phase than at late stages of development.
