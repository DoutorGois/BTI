It was shown that animals that differ in behavioral characteristics (August and Wistar rats) also differ in neurotransmitter and protein metabolism, which can be considered as tests that adequately reflect the functional condition of the central nervous system. These differences are expressed at the level of both subcortical structures (hippocampus and caudate nucleus) and various morphofunctional types of the sensorimotor cortex neurons (layers III and V). Studies on genetically different animals strains have revealed metabolic features that allow determination of individual behavioral features and estimation of individual brain structures in these processes.
