Controlled cortical impact injury was used to examine relationships between focal posttraumatic cortical damage and mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in the dentate gyrus in three mouse strains. Posttraumatic MFS was more robust when cortical injury impinged upon the hippocampus, versus contusions restricted to neocortex, and was qualitatively similar among CD-1, C57BL/6, and FVB/N background strains. Impact parameters influencing injury severity may be critical in reproducing epilepsy-related changes in neurotrauma models.
