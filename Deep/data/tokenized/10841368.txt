Event-related potentials (ERPs) to changes in the visual environment were recorded in rabbits. In the oddball condition, infrequently presented (deviant) stimuli occurred in a series of frequently presented (standard) stimuli. In the deviant-alone condition, standards were omitted. ERPs to oddball-deviants differed from those to standards in all recording sites (cerebellar cortex, visual cortex, dentate gyrus). No corresponding differences were found between ERPs to deviants in the oddball condition and those in the deviant-alone condition. However, because ERPs to deviants in the deviant-alone condition and those to standards did not differ either, ERPs to stimulus changes in the oddball condition seemed to be dependent on the presence of standards, thus representing an analogue to mismatch negativity (MMN) in humans.
