The peripheral type benzodiazepine binding site (PTBBS) has been proposed to be a good marker for reactive glial cells following brain insults. In the present study, homogenate binding of 3H-Ro5-4864 and quantitative autoradiography of 3H-PK-11195 binding (two ligands for the PTBBS) were used to assess the distribution, time-course and extent of reactive gliosis in the hippocampus following deafferentation by unilateral entorhinal cortex lesion or neuronal death produced by intrahippocampal colchicine injection. Intrahippocampal colchicine injections produced a 3-fold increase in 3H-Ro5-4864 binding in the dentate gyrus within 2 days. This effect was doubled in animals pretreated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. Quantitative autoradiography of 3H-PK-11195 binding 1 or 2 weeks after colchicine injection indicated that the increase in binding was restricted to the dorsal hippocampus both rostrally and caudally and was present in the dentate gyrus and CA1. Following a unilateral electrolytic lesion of the entorhinal cortex, the binding of 3H-Ro5-4864 to homogenates of the dentate gyrus was doubled 18 h after the lesion, reached a maximum at 4 days post-lesion, and returned to control values by 2 months after the lesion. A transient increase in binding was also observed 2 and 4 days post-lesion in the dentate gyrus contralateral to the lesion side. Autoradiography of 3H-PK-11195 binding indicated that the increase in PTBBS following entorhinal cortex lesion was restricted to the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
