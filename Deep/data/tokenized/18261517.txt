In this work, we developed a PDMS electrophoresis device able to carry out on-chip derivatization and quantification of amino acids (AAs) using naphthalene-2,3-dicarboxaldehyde (NDA) as a fluorogenic agent. A chemical modification of the PDMS surface was found compulsory to achieve the derivatization of AAs with NDA and a limit of detection (LOD) of 40nM was reached for glycine. Finally, we suggested the applicability of this microdevice for the analysis of real biological samples such as a rat hippocampus microdialysate.
