The effects of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonists on inositol phosphates (IP) accumulation were investigated in slices of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. EC(50) values for 1S, 3R-1-aminocyclopentane-1, 3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) did not differ significantly between various brain areas (range 10(-5) M), quisqualate was the most potent in all the brain areas (range 10(-7) - 10(-6) M), except the cerebellum (10(-5) M), ibotenate was the most potent in the striatum (range 10(-6) M) and the least potent in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (range 10(-4) M). The efficacy in the four brain areas showed the following trend of ranking order for ACPD and quisqualate: hippocampus > striatum > cerebral cortex > cerebellum, and for ibotenate: hippocampus > cerebral cortex > striatum > cerebellum, although the observed differences reached the level of statistical significance only in the case of ACPD (hippocampus and striatum vs cerebellum) and ibotenate (hippocampus vs cerebellum). Co-incubation of the agonists at maximally effective concentrations in any pairwise combination resulted in no substantial additivity of IP accumulation. D,L-1-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (AP3) and D,L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (AP4) at 0.5 mM concentration antagonized ACPD-induced IP accumulation by about 70 and 45 percent, respectively, without differences between brain areas. On the other hand, the antagonistic effects of L-serine-o-phosphate (SOP) at 1 mM concentration were the highest in the hippocampus (75 percent) and the lowest in the cerebellum (25 percent). The comparative data indicate considerable regional receptor heterogeneity, in terms of different ratios of response to the agonists (but not antagonists, except SOP). There is a robust responsiveness of mGluRs not only in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, but also in the striatum which exhibits the highest affinity to both quisqualate and ibotenate.
