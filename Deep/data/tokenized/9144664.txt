In hippocampal slices taken from 8-day-old rats, trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (tADA), a novel glutamatergic agonist acting preferentially at class I mGluR receptors, activates phosphoinositide and phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis with widely different potencies. Inositol phosphate formation was maximally increased at 10 microM tADA (EC50: 1.2 microM), while phospholipase D activation was observed at a tADA concentration of 1 mM. This is the first report of a tADA-induced phospholipase D activity.
