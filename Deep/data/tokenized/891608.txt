Dopamine metabolism was studied in various regions of rat brain by following the decline of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (HVA) from brain after treatment with pargyline, or from the accumulation of the acids after treatment with probenecid. The decline of DOPAC and HVA after pargyline treatment appeared exponential in all regions of brain studied with half-lives of about 13 min for HVA and 6.5 min for DOPAC. DOPAC was the major metabolite of dopamine, with various brain regions producing between 2-5 times more DOPAC than HVA. HVA accumulated after treatment with probenecid but the accumulation in 1 h did ot account for all of the HVA apparently eliminated from brain. DOPAC accumulated in some regions of brain (medulla, hypothalamus and midbrain) and not in others (cerebellum, cortex, striatum and hippocampus) after probenecid treatment. We conclude that dopamine metabolism is not uniform in brain and that the accumulation of DOPAC and HVA in brain after probenecid treatment only accounts for a minor fraction of the dopamine formed in brain.
