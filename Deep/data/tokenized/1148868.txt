The brain distribution and metabolism of progesterone were studied in female, rhesus monkeys. Adult monkeys were anesthetized with ketamine and were given a constant infusion of [3H]- or [14C] progesterone. Blood samples were obtained from cannulae inserted into the carotid artery, the jugular vein and lateral (transverse) sinus. The metabolic clearance rate of progesterone was 295 +/- 49 (S.E.) 1/day. The head extraction of progesterone was 30.4 +/- 8.3% (S.E.) and the brain extraction 26.0 +/- 9.18% (S.E.). The peripheral conversion ratios of progesterone to 20alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one (20alpha-OHP) and 5alpha-pregnan-3,20-dione (5alpha-DHP) were 10.0 +/- 1.3% (S.E.) and 2.4 +/- 0.3% (S.E.), respectively. These same conversion ratios for across the head were 4.8 +/- 1.0% (S.E.) and 1.5 +/- 0.6% (S.E.) and for across the brain 5.0 +/- 0.7% (S.E.) and 2.2 +/- 0.6% (S.E.). The concentration of radioactive progesterone was 2-5 times higher in brain tissues compared to the carotid arterial blood. The tissue concentrations of radioactive progesterone compared to a cerebrum 'control' sample: was lower in the central gray (P less than 0.05); were the same for the amygdala, hippocampus, preoptic-anterior hypothalamus, cerebellum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and anterior pituitary; and were higher in the cervical spinal cord, optic chiasm, mesencephalon, medulla oblongata and pons (P less than 0.1). The distribution pattern of 20alpha-OHP formed from progesterone was similar to that of progesterone. 5alpha-DHP formed from progesterone had a different distribution than progesterone, being highest in the central gray area. High concentrations of 5alpha-DHP were also observed in the mesencephalon, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus and low values in the anterior pituitary. Infusions of [3H]20alpha-OHP and [3H]5alpha-DHP were used to evaluate the in vivo metabolism of progesterone by different brain areas. [3H]Estradiol infused into one monkey had its highest concentration in the anterior pituitary which was 20 times higher than in the carotid arterial blood.
