Wnt signalling and its downstream effectors are well known for their roles in embryogenesis and tumourigenesis, including the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and differentiation. In the nervous system, Wnt signalling has been described mainly during embryonic development, although accumulating evidence suggests that it also plays a major role in adult brain morphogenesis and function. Studies have predominantly concentrated on memory formation in the hippocampus, although recent data indicate that Wnt signalling is also critical for neuroendocrine control of the developed hypothalamus, a brain centre that is key in energy balance regulation and whose dysfunction is implicated in metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Based on scattered findings that report the presence of Wnt molecules in the tanycytes and ependymal cells lining the third ventricle and arcuate nucleus neurones of the hypothalamus, their potential importance in key regions of food intake and body weight regulation has been investigated in recent studies. The present review brings together current knowledge on Wnt signalling in the hypothalamus of adult animals and discusses the evidence suggesting a key role for members of the Wnt signalling family in glucose and energy balance regulation in the hypothalamus in diet-induced and genetically obese (leptin deficient) mice. Aspects of Wnt signalling in seasonal (photoperiod sensitive) rodents are also highlighted, given the recent evidence indicating that the Wnt pathway in the hypothalamus is not only regulated by diet and leptin, but also by photoperiod in seasonal animals, which is connected to natural adaptive changes in food intake and body weight. Thus, Wnt signalling appears to be critical as a modulator for normal functioning of the physiological state in the healthy adult brain, and is also crucial for normal glucose and energy homeostasis where its dysregulation can lead to a range of metabolic disorders.
