Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening reaction that occurs in patients using drugs that elevate the serotonin level in the body. Excess serotonergic activity in the CNS and peripheral serotonin receptors results in neuromuscular hyperactivity, mental changes and autonomic symptoms. Hyperthermia is a characteristic feature of the syndrome. We describe neuropathological findings from two cases of lethal serotonin syndrome, both patients presenting with hyperthermia and neuromuscular symptoms. One of the patients had been taking amitriptylin and mirtazapin and the other had used amitriptylin and citalopram. They died, respectively, 10 days and 2(1/2) months after the onset of serotonin syndrome symptoms. Post-mortem examination of the brains showed subtotal loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells in both cases. In the case with shorter survival time, areas with partial loss of cerebellar granule cells were observed, whereas in the case with longer survival time general and extensive loss of granule cells was found. Cells in other areas of the brain known to be sensitive to hypoxic injury were not affected. Selective loss of Purkinje cells has previously been described in neuroleptic malignant syndrome and heatstroke, conditions that are characterized by hyperthermia. This suggests that hyperthermia may be a causative factor of brain damage in serotonin syndrome. This is the first report describing neuropathological findings in serotonin syndrome.
