The cause of Ammon's horn sclerosis in temporal lobe epilepsy has not yet been clarified. In the present study, the pathological effect of epileptic seizures on the hippocampus was investigated in surgically treated patients with brain tumor-induced temporal lobe epilepsy. Tumors involving the hippocampus were identified as the foci of epilepsy in 13 patients (seven male and six female) and resected after epileptic discharges were found at the hippocampus on intraoperative electrocorticogram. The mean age at operation was 29.8 +/- 11.5 years and the mean age of seizure onset was 19.9 +/- 10.8 years. Because only three of the 13 patients who underwent temporal lobectomy for brain tumors involving the hippocampus had Ammon's horn sclerosis pathologically, it was concluded that it was very unlikely that the Ammon's horn sclerosis was produced by the epileptic seizures. Two of the three patients with pathological signs of Ammon's horn sclerosis had episodes of coma, covulsion, high fever and cyanosis in their past histories that might have portended the appearance of Ammon's horn sclerosis later in their lives.
