It has been suggested previously that 30% sparing of the hippocampus is enough to support spatial learning of a reference memory task in a water maze provided the spared tissue is located septally (Moser et al. 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92:9697-9701). Therefore, the temporal hippocampus may not be involved in spatial memory. Place cells are also found in this part of the structure, and it has been suggested that these place cells have larger, less well-tuned place fields than are found in the septal hippocampus. We tested the possibility that the temporal hippocampus might be involved in spatial learning when the animals are required to distinguish between different contexts. Experiment 1 was a replication of the findings reported by Moser et al., using their protocol (8 trials/day, 6 days) and the groups with 20-40% hippocampus spared septally or temporally (volume assessed by quantitative volumetric techniques). In experiment 2, rats with also 20-40% sparing of the hippocampus either septally or temporally were trained in two water maze concurrently (four trials/day/water maze, 8 days). Rats with 20-40% hippocampus spared temporally were able to learn the two water maze tasks normally, and no difference was observed between rats with septal and temporal hippocampus spared across different measures of performance. In experiment 3, rats with 20-40% hippocampus spared septally or temporally were trained in one water maze as in experiment 1, but using a spaced training protocol similar to that of experiment 2 (four trials/day, 8 days). Rats with temporal hippocampus spared developed a preference for the training quadrant and acquired levels of performance indistinguishable from those of rats with septal hippocampus spared. The results suggest that the temporal hippocampus can support the learning of two, but also one, spatial water maze reference memory task, provided the training protocol is adequate.
