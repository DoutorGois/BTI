BACKGROUND: The present study investigates the effects of d-allose, a rare sugar, on the inflammatory response after transient forebrain ischemia in the gerbil and whether it reduces oxidative stress (8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine levels) and behavioral deficits. METHODS: Transient forebrain ischemia was induced by occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries for 5 minutes. d-Allose was intraperitoneally injected immediately after ischemia (400 mg/kg). Inflammatory cytokines and oxidative damage in the hippocampus and behavioral deficits were examined 3 days after ischemia. RESULTS: d-Allose administration reduced ischemia-induced cytokine production, oxidative stress, and behavioral deficits (motor and memory related). CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that d-allose reduces brain injury after transient global ischemia by suppressing inflammation as well as by inhibiting oxidative stress.
