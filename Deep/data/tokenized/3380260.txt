Perhaps cognitive and brain imaging measures have been pushed almost as far as they can go in helping diagnose or understand AD. Their value may increase with the development of better models of the disease and the addition of new types of measurements to the armamentarium (e.g., eye-tracking, olfactory, and dermatoglyphic evaluations). Together they may lead to a more precise definition of the "AD pattern."
