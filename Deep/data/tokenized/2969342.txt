Modified Washstein and Meisel's techniques were used for quantitative estimation of ATPases activity in the rat brain. The specific activity of Na+,K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase was higher in glial cells than in the neurons. The 24-hr REM-sleep deprivation resulted in an enhancement of the activity of ATPases in neurons of the hippocampus whereas the activity of the above enzymes lowered in the gliocytes. The findings can be due to the changes in excitability of the neurons and depolarization of glia during the sleep deprivation.
