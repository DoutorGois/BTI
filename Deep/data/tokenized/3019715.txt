In this study the binding to 'central' and 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptors in various brain areas in MR/N and MNR/N rat strains was investigated. The specific ligands [3H]BCCE and [3H]RO 5-4864 were used for binding to 'central' and 'peripheral' benzodiazepine receptors, respectively. Neither [3H]BCCE nor [3H]RO 5-4864 binding was changed in MNR/N strain in comparison to MR/N rat strain in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus and medulla-pons. Scatchard analysis of [3H]BCCE or [3H]RO 5-4864 binding to cerebellar membranes also revealed no changes in either affinity or density in both types of benzodiazepine receptors. Autoradiographic analysis of brain regions using microdensitometry shows no differences in [3H]flunitrazepam binding between the MR/N and MNR/N strains. Our results, therefore, fail to confirm a previous report showing alterations in benzodiazepine receptors in Maudsley rats.
