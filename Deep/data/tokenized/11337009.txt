Hypertension is the main cause of stroke that represents the second most common cause of death in the industrialized world and a leading cause of inability of the elderly. Lowering blood pressure reduces cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, but it is still controversial if blood pressure should be lowered in elderly individuals with concomitant cerebrovascular disease. The present study has analyzed comparatively the effect of treatment with the dihydropyridine-type Ca(2+) channel blockers lercanidipine, manidipine and nimodipine and with the non dihydropyridine-type vasodilator hydralazine on hypertension-dependent cerebrovascular changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Analysis included medium and small sized pial arteries and intracerebral arteries of frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum. In control SHR, systolic pressure (SBP) values were significantly higher in comparison with WKY rats. Pharmacological treatment significantly decreased SBP values, with nimodipine reducing only moderately SBP. In control SHR, thickening of arterial wall accompanied by luminal narrowing with consequent increase of the wall-to-lumen ratio occurred both in pial and intracerebral arteries. Dihydropyridine-type Ca(2+) antagonists and to a lesser extent hydralazine countered these morphological alterations. Lercanidipine displayed a particular activity on small sized intraparenchymal brain arteries, where it was more effective than other compounds tested. This activity of lercanidipine on small-sized intracerebral arteries might represent an interesting property for the treatment of hypertensive brain damage with concomitant ischemia.
