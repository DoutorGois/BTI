The developmental patterns of calmodulin-binding proteins (CaM-BPS) in rat brain were examined using biotinylated calmodulin overlays of one- and two-dimensional gels. Hippocampus showed the earliest onset of CaM-BP expression (postnatal day 5; PND5), followed by cerebral cortex and striatum, both of which had detectable levels of CaM-BPs by PND7. Cerebellum had the latest onset of CaM-BP expression; CaM-BPs were not detectable until PND9. Very few CaM-BPs were present in brain before PND5 and all regions reached near adult levels by PND20. However, several unique CaM-BPs were seen in embryonic brain and these proteins may have an important role in developing neurons. These data suggest an orderly, complex expression of CaM-BPs which increases during times of synaptogenesis and synaptic maturation.
