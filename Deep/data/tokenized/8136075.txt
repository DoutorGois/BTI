In 2 experiments, the effects of axon-sparing lesions of the hippocampus on performance in aversive and appetitive taste conditioning tasks were investigated. In Experiment 1, hippocampally lesioned rats showed no impairment of conditioned taste aversion learning relative to control subjects, but they did display an increased sensitivity to latent inhibition (LI). In Experiment 2, the same hippocampectomized rats acquired a conditioned taste preference but failed to show any evidence of extinction. The influence of the neurotoxic lesion on LI is in the opposite direction to the effect typically found following hippocampal damage induced by traditional methods. Accordingly, the data present challenges for most current theories of hippocampal function.
