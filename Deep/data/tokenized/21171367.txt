AIM: SD rats were utilized for the purpose of the exploration of effects of status epilepticus (SE) on their emotional behavior, spatial learning and memory, and explorating its molecular mechanism. METHODS: Forty maturity male SD rats, weighing (200 +/- 20) g were divided randomly and equally into SE group (SG) and normal control group (NG). The SG rats were induced by Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and the control animals received a saline (0.9%) solution. The change of emotional behavior in two groups were tested in elevated plus maze. Furthermore, Morris water maze was applied to evaluate the effects by SE on spatial learning and memory in rats. At the same time, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor NR1 subunit mRNA in the hippocampus was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In elevated plus test, SE rats increased the times of visits as well as the time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze (P < 0.01). In Morris water maze, the mean escape latency for the SE rats looking for hidden platform in the place navigation test prolonged (P < 0.01). The efficiency of their search strategy was poor (P < 0.05). The swimming time in platform region and the percentage of their swimming time decreased (P < 0.01). The number of times they crossed the platform area decreased (P < 0.01). Meanwhile the expression of NR1 subunit mRNA in hippocampus was lower (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The experimental results showed that SE could result in the change of emotional behavior and damage of spatial learning and memory in rats. NR1 might be involved in the patho- and physiological process in causing these behavioral changes.
