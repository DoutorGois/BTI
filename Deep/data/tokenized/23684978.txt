Volumetric abnormalities of the hippocampus and frontal cortex are of major interest in the study of borderline personality disorder (BPD). To our knowledge, no study has examined volumetric abnormalities in the hippocampal subregions (head, body, and tail). Our aims were to investigate hippocampal volumetric abnormalities as well as abnormalities in the gray and white matter of the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, and anterior cingulate cortex in BPD in a sample of BPD patients compared to healthy controls. Using manual volumetry as well as optimized voxel based morphometry (VBM) we assessed the volumetric differences in a sample of females with BPD (n=20), compared to healthy female controls (n=21) (HC). The analyses revealed reductions in the left hippocampal head, body, and tail, and the right hippocampal tail. Hippocampal changes were confirmed also using VBM and additional volumetric reductions were found in the caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the BPD group. Our study reaffirms the existence of hippocampal volumetric, prefrontal and caudate abnormalities in BPD and lends support to the stress-related explanation of these reductions, whilst also bringing new data to the topic in terms of the abnormalities found in the subregions.
