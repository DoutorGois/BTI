Long-term, activity-driven synaptic plasticity allows neuronal networks to constantly and durably adjust synaptic gains between synaptic partners. These processes have been proposed to serve as a substrate for learning and memory. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) has been observed at many central excitatory synapses and perhaps most extensively studied at Schaffer collaterals synapses onto hippocampal CA1 neurons. Multiple contradictory models were proposed to account for this form of LTP. However, recent evidence suggests that some synapses are initially devoid of functional AMPA receptors which can be incorporated during LTP. This new model appears to account for most, but not all, properties of this form of plasticity. Indeed, several mechanisms seem to act in parallel to specifically enhance AMPA-receptor mediated synaptic transmission.
