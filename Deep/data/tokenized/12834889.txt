In a previous study, we suggested that GABAergic neurons might be resistant to ischemic insult, because of the maintenance of the GABA shunt, which is one of the ATP synthetic pathways in neurons. In the present study, we identified Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactivity in the gerbil hippocampus in order to determine whether changes in Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactivity correlate with GABA shunt following ischemic insult. At 12 h after ischemia-reperfusion, Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactivity accumulated in some neurons in the CA1 region. However, the protein content of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase was not altered. Interestingly, the density of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactivity in neurons and the protein content in the CA1 region was intensified in the 24 h post-ischemic group. As a result of double immunofluorescence study, Na(+)-K(+) ATPase immunoreactive neurons were identified with GABAergic neurons. Therefore, our findings suggest that the increase of Na(+)-K(+) ATPase in GABAergic neurons may be able to explain the resistance of these cells to ischemic insult, and support our previous hypothesis that GABA may play an important role as a metabolite in the survival of GABAergic neurons after ischemic insult.
