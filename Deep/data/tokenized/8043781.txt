A comparative quantitative analysis of neuronal death was performed on mice hippocampal cell cultures, which were subjected to hypoxia only or to hypoxia with subsequent reoxygenation during equal time. It was shown that the number of dead neurons significantly increased after 5-7 hs hypoxia followed by 3 hs reoxygenation period, comparatively with neuronal death observed after 8-10 hs hypoxia without subsequent reoxygenation. These results demonstrate that neurodestructive processes initiated by hypoxia develop more intensively during the posthypoxic reoxygenation than during the equal time of hypoxia and suggest the role of free radical and peroxide compound formation in neuronal death after renewal of oxygen access to nerve cells.
