The present study established a rat model of post-stroke depression using incomplete ischemia induced by unilateral carotid artery ligation in combination with solitary raising and subcutaneous injection of a small dose of reserpine. After intragastric perfusion with 45 mg/100 g, 15 mg/100 g, and 7.5 mg/100 g of Xingnao Jieyu for 7, 14 and 21 days, neuronal morphology in the frontal lobe and hippocampus was improved, depression state and voluntary behaviors were also effectively improved in rats with post-stroke depression. Moreover, the effects of Xingnao Jieyu at a dose of 45 and 15 mg/100 g were similar to the traditional antidepressant Prozac.
