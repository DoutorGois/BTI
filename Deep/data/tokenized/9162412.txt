Distribution of activity of phosphate-activated glutaminase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase (gamma-Abu T) in brain hippocampal formation was studied in 6 people aged 23-65 years using histochemical methods. AST marks axonic systems in neuropil layers of Ammon's horn. Glutaminase is localised in perikarya and proximal segments of pyramidal and granular neurons dendrites. CAT is identified in terminal-like dotted structures in pyramidal and granular layers and also in certain nonpyramidal cells of stratum lacunosum molecular of field CAI. Product of histochemical reaction to gamma-Abu-T stains pericellular plexuses in basis layers of Ammon's horn and denticulate fascia. A generalizing scheme of neurochemical organization of hippocampal formation links is represented in the study.
