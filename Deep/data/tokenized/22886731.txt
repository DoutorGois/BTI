The nuclear factor one (NFI) family of transcription factors consists of four members in vertebrates, NFIA, NFIB, NFIC, and NFIX, which share a highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding domain. NFI genes are widely expressed in the developing mouse brain, and mouse mutants lacking NFIA, NFIB, or NFIX exhibit developmental deficits in several areas, including the cortex, hippocampus, pons, and cerebellum. Here we analyzed the expression of NFIA and NFIB in the developing and adult olfactory bulb (OB), rostral migratory stream (RMS), and subventricular zone (SVZ). We found that NFIA and NFIB are expressed within these regions during embryonic and postnatal development and in the adult. Immunohistochemical analysis using cell-type-specific markers revealed that migrating neuroblasts in the adult brain express NFI transcription factors, as do astrocytes within the RMS and progenitor cells within the SVZ. Moreover, astrocytes within the OB express NFIA, whereas mitral cells within the OB express NFIB. Taken together these data show that NFIA and NFIB are expressed in both the developing and the adult OB and in the RMS and SVZ, indicative of a regulatory role for these transcription factors in the development of this facet of the olfactory system.
