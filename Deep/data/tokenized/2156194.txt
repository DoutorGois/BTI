The neuropathological effects of tetanus toxin, microinjected in the rat CA1 hippocampal area, were studied by using a microscopical and autoradiographical approach. Tetanus toxin produced a dose- and time-dependent neuronal loss in the CA1 area accompanied by a reduction in the binding of gamma-[3H]aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) to GABAA but not GABAB sites in the pyramidal cell layer.
