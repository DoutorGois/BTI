After we identified several novel cDNAs by screening a neonatal (P1) heterozygous weaver (wv/+) cerebellar cDNA expression library with a rabbit anti-mouse granule cell antiserum, we characterized and sequenced one cDNA, GCAP-8 (standing for granule cell antiserum positive, clone number 8). In this study we examined its expression and cellular distribution in adult cerebellar mutant mice as evidenced by in situ hybridization histochemistry. In wild-type (+/+) brain, strong hybridization signal is seen in cerebellum, hippocampus, substantia nigra (SN), and cerebral cortex; in the cerebellum, hybridization signal is seen in granule cells, Purkinje cells, and in cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. In the granuloprival weaver (wv/wv) cerebellum, hybridization signal is seen mainly in Purkinje cells. GCAP-8 expression is reduced in wv/wv SN pars compacta, which is known to lose dopamine (DA) neurons. In Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd/pcd) mutants, granule cells show hybridization signal, but overall expression is decreased owing to the absence of Purkinje cells. In reeler (rl/rl) cerebellum, the strongest hybridization signal is found in a thin granule cell layer without the typical foliation pattern, while grain clusters representing ectopic Purkinje cells are observed in the subcortical white matter and the area of the deep cerebellar nuclei. GCAP-8 expression in the reeler hippocampus and cerebral cortex shows a mixing of layers, which is known to be an aspect of the histological phenotype of this mutant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
