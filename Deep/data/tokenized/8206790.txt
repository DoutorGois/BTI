In order to observe glucose transport into the brain, 6-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-6-deoxyglucose (NBDG), a non-metabolizable and fluorescent glucose analogue, was injected intravenously into mice. After ascertaining that this glucose analogue is non-metabolizable in the brain, the NBDG contents in the blood and brain were measured quantitatively by spectrofluorimetry at 0, 0.5, 2, 5, 10 and 30 min after intravenous injection. The NBDG content in the blood decreased markedly with time, whereas in the brain it rapidly decreased, then gradually increased after 2 min. Glucose transport into the hippocampus was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope. At 0.5 min, NBGD was seen to be highly concentrated on the vascular wall. Using the confocal mode, it was found that the fluorescence was unevenly distributed on the microvessel wall, suggesting local differences of glucose transport in the vascular wall. At 5 min, the fluoresent intensity of the vascular wall was markedly decreased, whereas relatively intense fluorescence was observed in the cerebral parenchyma of the stratum lacunosum-moleculare and stratum pyramidale of Ca3. At 10 min, a weak fluoresence was diffusely distributed in the hippocampus. As to the localization of NBDG in the brain, capillary endothelium (luminal and abluminal membrane), basement membrane, and the feet of the astrocytes are discussed.
