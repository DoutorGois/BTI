Rats with excitotoxic lesions of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus and control rats were trained on 2 spatial working memory tasks: the standard version of the radial maze with 8 baited arms and the non-matching-to-place procedure in the T maze. Dorsal lesions produced deficits in both tasks, whereas ventral lesions did not affect learning in either of them. A volumetric analysis of subicular damage showed that dorsal hippocampal lesions caused a deficit in the non-matching-to-place only when accompanied by damage to the dorsal subiculum; on the other hand, lesions to the dorsal hippocampus impaired performance in the radial-arm maze regardless of the extent of subicular damage.
