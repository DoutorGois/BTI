Vibratome sections of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were immunostained for alpha-tubulin using the TU-Ol monoclonal antibody. In all three regions, electron microscopy of the immunostained preparations revealed--in addition to the previously described reaction of pyramidal apical dendritic microtubules--consistent staining of the ribosomal apparatus of astrocytes.
