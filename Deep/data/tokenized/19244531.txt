Generation of fast network oscillations in the hippocampus relies on interneurons, but the underlying specific synaptic mechanisms are not established. The excitatory recruitment of fast-spiking interneurons during hippocampal sharp waves has been suggested to be critical for the generation of 140-200 Hz ("ripple") oscillations in the CA1 area. To directly test this, we used genetically modified mice (PV-DeltaGluR-A) with reduced AMPA receptor-mediated excitation onto parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons and studied hippocampal oscillations in freely moving animals. In PV-DeltaGluR-A mice, ripple-amplitude and associated rhythmic modulation of pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons were increased. These changes were not accompanied by concurrent alterations of firing rates. Neither theta nor gamma oscillations displayed marked alterations in the mutant. These results provide evidence that fast excitation from pyramidal cells to PV-positive interneurons differentially influences ripple and gamma oscillations in vivo.
