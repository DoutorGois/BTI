Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) were recorded from pyramidal neurons of the rat hippocampal slices as well as the AMPA and NMDA components. A strong enough correlation between the amplitudes of the components provided a reliable evidence of their generation by the same synapse. Both components revealed similar LTP following afferent tetanisation. The data obtained do not support postsynaptic mechanisms of the LTP maintenance but suggest that increased presynaptic release represents a basic mechanism of the early LTP maintenance.
