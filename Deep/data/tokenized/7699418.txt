Changes of glycosaminoglycan distribution in and around C6 glioma and ethylnitrosourea(ENU)-induced glioma in rats were investigated using monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize epitopes on chondroitin-0-sulfate proteoglycan (C-0-S), chondroitin-4-sulfate proteoglycan (C-4-S), dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DS), chondroitin-6-sulfate proteoglycan (C-6-S) and keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KS) after chondroitinase ABC digestion. In the normal brain tissues, C-0-S was located on the surface of the neurons. In addition, extracellular staining in the cerebral cortex and axoplasmic staining in the brain stem and the reticular thalamic nucleus were seen. C-0-S was negative, however, both in the C6 and ENU-induced gliomas. C-4-S or DS was detected only in some of the neurons in the normal brain tissues. They were detected in the peripheral part of the ENU-induced gliomas, but not in the C6 gliomas. C-6-S was located on the surface of some neurons and in the white matter of the normal brain, but it was not detected in C6 gliomas. In all ENU-induced gliomas, C-6-S was identified in the adventitia of the vascular structures within the tumor. In some of them, C-6-S appeared in the peripheral part of the tumor. KS was immunostained in the glial cells in the hippocampus, corpus callosum, brain stem, and the floor of the third ventricle. It was also detected in the peritumoral brain tissues both in the C6 and ENU-induced rat gliomas. The significance of glycosaminoglycans in these glioma models was discussed.
