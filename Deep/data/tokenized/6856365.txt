The experimental results obtained in the authors' laboratory as a result of multiple recording of slow biopotentials, the recording of neuronal activity and of mathematical modeling, are reviewed. The authors conclude that the elaboration of internal inhibition is followed, and determined to a great extent, by the restriction in conduction of excitations due to the increase of inhibitory hyperpolarization and discordance in the periodicity of slow potentials, reflecting oscillations in excitability of neuronal populations in the cortex and other brain structures.
