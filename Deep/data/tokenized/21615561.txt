Adenosine neuromodulation depends on a balanced activation of inhibitory A(1) (A(1)R) and facilitatory A((2)A) receptors (A((2)A) R). Both A(1) R and A((2)A) R modulate hippocampal glutamate release and NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) but ageing affects the density of both A(1) R and A((2)A) R. We tested the effects of selective A(1) R and A(2A) R antagonists in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in rat hippocampal slices from three age groups (young adults, 2-3 month; middle-aged adults, 6-8 months; aged, 18-20 months). The selective A((2)A) R antagonist SCH58261 (50 nm) attenuated LTP in all age groups, with a larger effect in aged (-63 +/- 7%) than in middle-aged adults (-36 +/- 9%) or young adult rats (-36 +/- 9%). In contrast, the selective A(1) R antagonist DPCPX (50 nm) increased LTP magnitude in young adult rats (+42 +/- 6%), but failed to affect LTP magnitude in the other age groups. Finally, in the continuous presence of DPCPX, SCH58261 caused a significantly larger inhibition of LTP amplitude in aged (-71 +/- 45%) than middle-aged (-28 +/-9%) or young rats (-11 +/- 2%). Accordingly, aged rats displayed an increased expression of A((2)A) R mRNA in the hippocampus and a higher number of glutamatergic nerve terminals equipped with A(2A) R in aged (67 +/- 6%) compared with middle-aged (34 +/- 7%) and young rats (25 +/- 5%). The results show an enhanced A((2)A) R-mediated modulation of LTP in aged rats, in accordance with the age-associated increased expression and density of A((2)A) R in glutamatergic terminals. This age-associated gain of function of A((2)A) R modulating synaptic plasticity may underlie the ability of A((2)A) R antagonists to prevent memory dysfunction in aged animals.
