In order to evaluate the influence of cerebral ischemia on the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, the alterations of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor binding sites and local cerebral blood flow were examined 6 h after occlusion of the right common carotid artery in the gerbil brain. The autoradiographic method developed in our laboratory enabled us to measure both parameters within the same brain. Animals attaining ischemic scores of more than 5, as assessed 1 h after occlusion, were utilized. The local cerebral blood flow was measured 6 h after occlusion by the [14C]iodoantipyrine method. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding sites were evaluated in vitro using [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as a specific ligand. The local cerebral blood flow fell below 15 ml/100 g per min in most of the cerebral regions on the occluded side. In contrast, a significant reduction in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding sites was noted only in the hippocampus CA1 on the occluded side. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding tended to decrease when the values of local cerebral blood flow were below 20 ml/100 g per min in this region. On the other hand, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor immunoreactivity in the brain examined with a monoclonal antibody against inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor protein did not reveal any differences between the ischemia and sham groups on both sides, suggesting that the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors may not undergo significant morphological degradation. These findings indicate that the suppression of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding in the hippocampus CA1 may be attributable to a regionally specific perturbation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate metabolism in this region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
