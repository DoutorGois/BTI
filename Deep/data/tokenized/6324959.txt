One approach to studying the neurophysiological correlates of long-term memory is to search for, and study properties of the nervous system that impart plasticity of synaptic efficacy. Within this context, we argue that long-term potentiation is, currently, the most plausible device for subserving or initiating long-term information storage in the mammalian brain. This argument is derived from examining features of LTP with respect to the constraints posed by our current concepts of learning and memory. In addition, we examine evidence for a role by LTP in behavioral learning. We conclude that studying LTP within the context of behavioral learning and memory may provide new insights into the neurophysiological bases of learning and memory.
