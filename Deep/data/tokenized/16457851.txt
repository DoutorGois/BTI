Although a variable degree of psychomotor delay/mental retardation is found in a considerable number of patients affected by methylmalonic acidemia, the mechanisms underlying the neuropathology of this disorder are still poorly defined. The present study investigated the effect of acute intrahippocampal administration of methylmalonic acid (MMA), the biochemical hallmark of this disease, on rat behavior in the open field task. Cannulated 60-day-old male Wistar rats received bilateral intrahippocampal injection of MMA (0.1-1.0 micromol) 10 min before training. Controls received 0.1-1.0 micromol NaCl. Testing session was performed 24 h later. We observed that rats administered with 1.0 micromol MMA, but not with lower doses, did not habituate in the open field task, reflecting a deficit of performance. Motor activity, assessed by the number of crossing responses, was the same at training for the groups infused with MMA or NaCl. The effect of MK-801 (15 nmol) and succinate (1.5 micromol) administered 30 min before MMA injection, and of creatine (50 mg/kg, i.p.) administered twice a day for 3 days on the behavioral alterations provoked by MMA in the open field task revealed that only the energetic substrate creatine prevented these effects, reflecting a possible compromise of brain energy production by MMA. The results indicate that high intrahippocampal concentrations of the major metabolite accumulating in methylmalonic acidemia compromises brain functioning, causing deficit of performance in the open field task that may be related to the psychomotor delay/mental retardation observed in the affected patients.
