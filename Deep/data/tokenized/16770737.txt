This work was performed in order to determine the level of oxidative damage and antioxidant enzymes activities late after acute and chronic electroconvulsive shock (ECS) in rats. We measured oxidative parameters in hippocampus, cortex, and striatum, at 45, 60, 90 and 120 days after a single or multiple ECS. We demonstrated an increase in lipid peroxidation after multiple ECS in the hippocampus and striatum. This was also the case for protein carbonyls in the single or multiple protocols. In this way, we demonstrated an increase in catalase in cortex in contrast to striatum and hippocampus, were there were decreases sometimes in chronic ECS. The superoxide dismutase activities decrease in different times after single and multiple ECS in the hippocampus. Our findings demonstrated that there is a delayed increase after ECS in oxidative damage and decrease in antioxidant enzymes activities in hippocampus and striatum.
