Neuroprotective effects of estrogens and progesterone have been widely studied in various experimental models. The present study was designed to compare possible neuroprotective effects of 17alpha-estradiol, 17beta-estradiol, and progesterone on oxidative stress in rats subjected to global cerebral ischemia. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in ovariectomized female rats by four vessel occlusion for 10 min. Following 72 h of reperfusion, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA, oxidative stress marker), and reduced glutathione (GSH, major endogenous antioxidant) were assessed in hippocampus, striatum and cortex of rats treated with either 17alpha-estradiol, 17beta-estradiol, progesterone or estradiol + progesterone beforehand. Steroid administration ameliorated ischemia-induced decrease in GSH and increase in MDA levels. Our data offers additional evidence that estrogens and progesterone or combination of two exert a remarkable neuroprotective effect reducing oxidative stress.
