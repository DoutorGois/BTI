The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is critical for brain functions including learning, memory, fear and pain. Long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP), a cellular model for learning and memory, has been reported in the ACC neurons. Unlike LTP in the hippocampus and amygdala, two key structures for memory and fear, little is known about the synaptic mechanism for the expression of LTP in the ACC. Here we use whole-cell patch clamp recordings to demonstrate that cingulate LTP requires the functional recruitment of GluR1 AMPA receptors; and such events are rapid and completed within 5-10 min after LTP induction. Our results demonstrate that the GluR1 subunit is essential for synaptic plasticity in the ACC and may play critical roles under physiological and pathological conditions.
