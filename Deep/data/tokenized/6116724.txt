The morphological organization of the somatostatin (SRIF)-positive neurons in the forebrain (telencephalon and diencephalon) of the warbling grass parakeet (Melopsittacus undulatus) was studied using the indirect immunohistochemical technique of Coons and co-workers ('58). In the telencephalon, a number of SRIF-positive neurons was detected in the lobus paraolfactorius, hippocampus, and paleostriatum. Furthermore, scattered SRIF-labeled cells were noticed in the area corticoidea dorsolateralis and area temporoparieto-occipitalis. A moderate density of immunoreactive fibers was found in the above areas. In addition, although the septal areas was devoid of SRIF-positive neurons, this area contained a moderate occurred in the following hypothalamic areas: (1) nucleus medialis hypothalami posterior, (2) lateral hypothalamus, and (3) mammillary nucleus. The bird hypothalamus also received a strikingly massive SRIF innervation. The heaviest concentration of SRIF-labeled fibers was detected in the medial eminence. Many SRIF-labeled fibers were also observed in other hypothalamic regions. Their locations roughly corresponded in many cases to the areas in which SRIF-positive neurons were disclosed. The overall distribution of the catecholamine system (CA) of the avian forebrain is also represented by means of histofluorescent technique. A possible interaction between SRIF and CA neurons systems is briefly discussed.
