D-Baclofen reduced the response to L-baclofen in the feline trigeminal nucleus, the spinal cord of the rat and in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, but not in slices of hippocampus or neocortex. The iontophoretic application of 10-20 nA L-baclofen depressed excitatory transmission in the trigeminal nucleus oralis, similar to the effect of 0.1-0.4 mg/kg L-baclofen, given intravenously. The concomitant iontophoresis of 10-20 nA D-baclofen reduced the effect of iontophoretically applied L-baclofen. However, larger doses of D-baclofen (30-60 nA) did not, while still larger doses (200-400 nA) by themselves depressed response of the neuron, similar to the action of small doses of L-baclofen. The iontophoresis of 30-40 nA L-baclofen had a stronger effect than that previously obtained with systemic administration and D-baclofen was not able to block it. These observations suggest that D-baclofen is a partial agonist at the GABAB receptor. Failure to observe a blocking effect of D-baclofen in slices of hippocampus or neocortex could be due to the larger doses used or to a difference in receptor types. The observations emphasise the need to test drugs at therapeutic concentrations in an appropriate model, in order to predict reliably their therapeutic actions.
