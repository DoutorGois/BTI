This study assessed the anticonvulsant effect of allopurinol (5 and 50 mg/kg, IP) on seizures kindled from the feline hippocampus. Allopurinol at a higher dose significantly reduced the behavioral seizures stage, but not afterdischarge duration, without producing any behavioral toxicity. The present results lend experimental support to the contention that allopurinol possesses anticonvulsant efficacy in the treatment of human epilepsy.
