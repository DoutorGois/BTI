MRI volumetric TLE studies show inconsistent evidence of hippocampal involvement in memory. Prior studies have not dissociated hippocampal and temporal lobe contributions to memory. We measured hippocampal and temporal lobe volumes and immediate/delayed memory performances in 64 TLE patients. Regression was used to dissociate hippocampal from temporal lobe contributions to memory. Results revealed reliable evidence for dominant hippocampal involvement in delayed verbal recall across three separate measures and less consistent evidence for nondominant hippocampal involvement. The findings point to a consistent relationship of dominant hippocampal volumes to delayed verbal recall but no involvement of the temporal lobe or nondominant hippocampus in memory.
