Rhynchophylline (Rhy) has been demonstrated protective effects on some neurological diseases. However, the roles of Rhy in the subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are still to be cleared. In the present study, the effects of Rhy on attenuation of early brain injury (EBI) after SAH have been evaluated. The adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (280-300g) were used to establish the SAH models using endovascular perforation method. Rhy was administered by intraperitoneal injection immediately following SAH. Brain edema was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24h after SAH. Neurological deficits, brain water content, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content in hippocampus were also evaluated. Immunofluorescence and western blot were used to explore the underlying protective mechanism of Rhy. The results showed that, following 10mg/kg Rhy treatment, the brain edema and neurological deficits, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption were significantly attenuated at 24h after SAH. Additionally, in hippocampus, MDA concentration, MPO activity and ROS content were markedly decreased. Meanwhile, the levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO-1) were increased, while the expressions of p-p53, cleaved-caspase-3 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were significantly decreased. Our results indicated that Rhy could attenuate early brain injury by reducing inflammation and apoptosis in hippocampus after SAH.
