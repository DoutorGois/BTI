Hippocampal malformations in patients with epilepsy usually are reported in the context of widespread cortical malformations. Isolated hippocampal malformations are more rarely identified in MRI studies with little documentation of their pathologic appearance. Postmortem examination revealed abnormal position and complex convolutional malformations isolated to the hippocampal formation in an adult with temporal lobe epilepsy in whom MRI demonstrated bilateral hippocampal abnormalities.
