Experiments on rats with chronic bipolar electrodes implanted into the frontal cortex (FC), dorsal hippocampus (DH) and midbrain reticular formation (RF) established that the neurotic state (model "conflict of afferent excitation") was characterised by the increase in structure excitability: FC--15.4% (P less than 0.01), DH--12.4% (P = 0.05) and RF--17.5% (P less than 0.001). The presence of free fatty acids (FFA) revealed by chromatograph Schimadzu in brain cortex (BC), hippocampus (H) and midbrain (MB) in acute experiments evidenced the increase in the level of linolinic acid in all matters within the limits of 64-162% (P less than 0.05) and also different changes in arachidonic acid in BC and subcortical structures. The level of arachidonic acid increased by 120% (P less than 0.01) in BC but it decreased in H and MB within the limits of 34-56%. AVP (1 micrograms/kg) decreased excitability of FC by 6% (P less than 0.001), of H--by 8% (P less than 0.01) and RF--by 6%. In this case FFA, especially arachidonic acid, was increased in H and MB (by 2.5-6 times). The quantity of palmitic, stearic and oleic acids increased.
