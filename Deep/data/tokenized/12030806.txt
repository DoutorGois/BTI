The aims of the present study were to investigate corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) concentrations in the brain, the adrenal glands, and the ovaries in rats with estradiol valerate (EV) induced polycystic ovaries (PCO). The effect of 12 electro-acupuncture (EA) treatments on CRF concentrations was also investigated. The CRF concentrations in the median eminence (ME) were significantly increased in rats with PCO (both the PCO control group and the PCO group receiving EA) compared with the healthy control group (veichle control group), indicating increased activity in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. The CRF concentrations in the ovaries were significantly reduced in the PCO group receiving EA compared with the PCO control group. Also, there was a decrease in comparison withthe healthy control group but the decrease was not as significant. This finding indicates that repeated EA treatments change the neuroendocrinological state in the ovaries, which may play an important role in reproductive failure.
