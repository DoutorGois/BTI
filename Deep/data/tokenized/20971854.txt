Neuroinflammation and associated neuronal dysfunction mediated by activated microglia play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD). Microglia are activated by aggregated forms of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), usually demonstrated in vitro by stimulating microglia with micromolar concentrations of fibrillar Abeta, a major component of amyloid plaques in AD brains. Here we report that amyloid-beta oligomer (AbetaO), at 5-50 nm, induces a unique pattern of microglia activation that requires the activity of the scavenger receptor A and the Ca(2+)-activated potassium channel KCa3.1. AbetaO treatment induced an activated morphological and biochemical profile of microglia, including activation of p38 MAPK and nuclear factor kappaB. Interestingly, although increasing nitric oxide (NO) production, AbetaO did not increase several proinflammatory mediators commonly induced by lipopolyliposaccharides or fibrillar Abeta, suggesting that AbetaO stimulates both common and divergent pathways of microglia activation. AbetaO at low nanomolar concentrations, although not neurotoxic, induced indirect, microglia-mediated damage to neurons in dissociated cultures and in organotypic hippocampal slices. The indirect neurotoxicity was prevented by (i) doxycycline, an inhibitor of microglia activation; (ii) TRAM-34, a selective KCa3.1 blocker; and (iii) two inhibitors of inducible NO synthase, indicating that KCa3.1 activity and excessive NO release are required for AbetaO-induced microglial neurotoxicity. Our results suggest that AbetaO, generally considered a neurotoxin, may more potently cause neuronal damage indirectly by activating microglia in AD.
