Duchenne muscular dystrophy is frequently associated with a non-progressive cognitive deficit attributed to the absence of 427,000 mol. wt brain dystrophin, or to altered expression of other C-terminal products of this protein, Dp71 and/or Dp140. To further explore the role of these membrane cytoskeleton-associated proteins in brain function, we studied spatial learning and ex vivo synaptic plasticity in the mdx mouse, which lacks 427,000 mol. wt dystrophin, and in the mdx3cv mutant, which shows a dramatically reduced expression of all the dystrophin gene products known so far. We show that reference and working memories are largely unimpaired in the two mutant mice performing a spatial discrimination task in a radial maze. However, mdx3cv mice showed enhanced emotional reactivity and developed different strategies in learning the task, as compared to control mice. We also showed that both mutants display apparently normal levels of long-term potentiation and paired-pulse facilitation in the CA1 field of the hippocampus. On the other hand, an increased post-tetanic potentiation was shown by mdx, but not mdx3cv mice, which might be linked to calcium-regulatory defects. Otherwise, immunoblot analyses suggested an increased expression of a 400,000 mol. wt protein in brain extracts from both mdx and mdx3cv mice, but not in those from control mice. This protein might correspond to the dystrophin-homologue utrophin. The present results suggest that altered expression of dystrophin or C-terminal dystrophin proteins in brain did not markedly affect hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation in mdx and mdx3cv mice. The role of these membrane cytoskeleton-associated proteins in normal brain function and pathology remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, the possibility that redundant mechanisms could partially compensate for dystrophins' deficiency in the mdx and mdx3cv models should be further considered.
