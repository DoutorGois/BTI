An artificial rearing procedure was used to expose neonatal rats to a formula containing 3.74% ethanol during postnatal days 4 through 10. This treatment produced a mean blood ethanol concentration of 379.8 +/- 17.3 mg/dl. When the pups were killed on the afternoon of postnatal day 10, brain weight to body weight ratio in the ethanol-exposed rats was reduced 22.4% and 21.5% compared to suckle and pair-fed controls, respectively. Ethanol exposure also resulted in a 16% reduction of neurons in hippocampal field CA4, compared to controls, but did not produce deficits in fields CA1 or CA3. There was also a 10% increase in the number of neurons (a population of cells in the midst of a proliferative phase at the time of the exposure) in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus. The ethanol exposure did not affect cell size in any of the four neuron populations measured. These results suggest, that within the dose and timing parameters examined, ethanol exposure during the third trimester equivalent appears to be preferentially harmful to specific populations of developing neurons.
