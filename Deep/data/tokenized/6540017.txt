Dynamics of dorsal hippocampal EEG changes were traced in cats during the short-term memory loads under conditions of the time deficit between the separate delayed reactions. Shortening the intervals between the tests from 3-5 min to 15-20 s led to an expressed ECoG desynchronization accompanied by an initial increase and later blockade of the hippocampal theta-rhythm. Hippocampal theta-activity changes under conditions of the time deficit was a result of emotional stress. The long emotional stress impaired the short-term image memory, and this was manifested in hippocampal theta-rhythm disappearance.
