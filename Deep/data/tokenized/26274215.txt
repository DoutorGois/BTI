Several experiments over the years have shown that the earth's magnetic field is essential for orientation in birds' migration. The most promising explanation for this orientation is the photo-stimulated radical pair (RP) mechanism. In order to define a reference frame for the orientation task radicals must have an intrinsic anisotropy. We show that this kind of anisotropy and consequently the entanglement in the model are not necessary for the proper functioning of the compass. Classically correlated initial conditions for the RP, subjected to a fast decoherence process, are able to provide the anisotropy required. Even a dephasing environment can provide the necessary frame for the compass to work and also implies fast decay of any quantum correlation in the system without damaging the orientation ability. This fact significantly expands the range of applicability of the RP mechanism providing more elements for experimental search.
