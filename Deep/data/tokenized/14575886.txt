The present study examined the activities of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and rolipram-sensitive phosphodiesterase (PDE4) on brain regions in learned helplessness rat in order to clarify the cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulation system in the depressive state. Rats exposed to inescapable footshocks once a day for 3 days exhibited a significant increase in escape failure on Day 1 (the day after the last inescapable shock day) and Day 7. The plasma corticosterone level in rats subjected to inescapable shocks was significantly higher than that of nonstressed control rats on Days 1 and 7. The PDE4 activity of the frontal cortex was significantly lower than that of nonstressed control rats on Day 1. However, on Day 7, the PDE4 and [3H]-rolipram binding activities were significantly increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of learned helplessness rats compared with those of nonstressed control rats. Forskolin-stimulated AC activity was significantly decreased in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of learned helplessness rats on Day 1, but not on Day 7. Thus, a decrease in both AC and PDE4 activities was noted in the acute depressive state. In contrast, increase of PDE4 activity was noted in the delayed depressive phase, although no change of AC activity was observed. Gel shift assays also showed the decrease of cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding activity relating to cAMP activity in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of learned helplessness rats on Days 1 and 7. These findings indicated a delayed increase in PDE4 activity leading to hypofunction of the cAMP-dependent signal transduction system in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of learned helplessness rats, suggesting that up-regulation of the cAMP-degradation system by PDE4 may play a pivotal role in pathological states of chronic depression.
