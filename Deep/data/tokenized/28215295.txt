One of the most characterized neurotrophic factors is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which regulates neuronal survival and differentiation, and functions in activity-dependent plasticity processes such as long-term potentiation, long-term depression (LTD), and learning memory. Similar to other growth factors, BDNF protein is produced by transcriptional and translational mechanisms. Nevertheless, a posttranslational mechanism, the proteolytic conversion of precursor BDNF into at least two fragments, bioactive BDNF and the prodomain, has not been well elucidated. Recently, we demonstrated that the BDNF prodomain, which is named the BDNF propeptide, was endogenously secreted from neuronal cells and facilitated a cellular mechanism of LTD, suggesting the manner through which this posttranslational mechanism multiplies the biological actions of BDNF. In this chapter, we focus on the BDNF propeptide, especially in synaptic plasticity, and discuss the role of this molecule in the brain. The findings regarding the BDNF propeptide would provide new insights for understanding the mechanisms of action of the propeptides of growth factors as well as the biological roles of neurotrophins.
