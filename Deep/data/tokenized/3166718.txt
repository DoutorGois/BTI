The acquisition and retention of a water maze task was examined in 12 intact, young Wistar rats. Acetylcholinesterase activity in 43 discrete brain regions was then measured in the same rats by quantitative histochemistry. Individual learning and retention indices were found to be significantly correlated with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in specific regions, e.g. cholinergic nuclei; the ventral pallidum and nucleus basalis; and in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. High levels of AChE in these regions predicted poor performance in the water maze. Thus cholinergic activity in selected regions of the rat brain might be involved in the performance of spatial memory tasks.
