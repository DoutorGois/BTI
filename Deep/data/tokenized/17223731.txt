Using histochemical analysis (NADPH-diaphorase, Fluoro-Jade B dye and bis-benzimide 33,342 Hoechst) we studied the influence of intraperitoneal administration of nicotine (NIC), kainic acid (KA) and combination of both these substances on hippocampal neurons and their changes. In experiments, 35-day-old male rats of the Wistar strain were used. Animals were pretreated with 1 mg/kg of nicotine 30 min prior to the kainic acid application (10 mg/kg). After two days, the animals were transcardially perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde under deep thiopental anesthesia. Cryostat sections were stained to identify NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons that were then quantified in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, in the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Fluoro-Jade B positive cells were examined in the same areas in order to elucidate a possible neurodegeneration. In animals exposed only to nicotine the number of NADPH-diaphorase positive neurons in the CA3 area of the hippocampus and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus was higher than in controls. In contrast, KA administration lowered the number of NADPH-diaphorase positive cells in all studied hippocampal areas and in both blades of the dentate gyrus. Massive cell degeneration was observed in CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus and in the hilus of the dentate gyrus after kainic acid administration. Animals exposed to kainic acid and pretreated with nicotine exhibited degeneration to a lesser extent and the number of NADPH-diaphorase positive cells was higher compared to rats, which were exposed to kainic acid only.
