BMY-14802, a selective sigma ligand currently under investigation as an atypical antipsychotic agent, was tested for potential anti-ischemic activity. BMY-14802 (10, 30 and 50 mg/kg) did not produce any stereotyped behavior, ataxia or seizures. When gerbils were pretreated with 10, 30 or 50 mg/kg of BMY-14802 30 min prior to bilateral occlusion of carotid arteries for 5 min, BMY-14802 significantly protected against ischemia-induced neuronal loss in the hippocampus. Thus, BMY-14802 may also be useful as an anti-ischemic agent that does not produce psychotomimetic effects.
