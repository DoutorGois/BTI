Lithium hydroxybutyrate influence on excitability, functional mobility and frequency range power of the cortex electrograms, midbrain reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus caudate nucleus, dorsal hippocampus, basolateral amygdala and medial thalamus in rabbits has been investigated. It has been shown that the drug suppresses the non-specific activating systems of the midbrain and posterior hypothalamus, intensifies work of the caudatocortical inhibitory mechanisms and the forebrain limbic formations (the hippocampus and amygdala).
