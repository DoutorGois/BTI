Neurotrophic factors have been shown to support the survival of injured neurons and promote their recovery. Here, we investigated whether acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) could modify programmed cell death caused by transient forebrain ischemia in the gerbil. The data show that systemic administration of 2.6 microg aFGF after 5 min ischemia followed by 7 days of brain reperfusion significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the occurrence of apoptotic cell death in CA1 neurons. These data suggest that aFGF would contribute to brain protection after acute stroke.
