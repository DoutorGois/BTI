It is becoming apparent that nitrogen monoxide (NO) such as nitric oxide has regulatory roles for neuronal cell functions. We examined the role of NO using NO donors on [3H]noradrenaline (NA) release from prelabeled rat hippocampal slices. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), which had no effect by itself, stimulated [3H]NA release in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 = 0.5 mM) in the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT). The stimulatory effect of SNP with DTT, but not high K+, was observed in an extracellular Ca(2+)-free buffer. The maximal effect of SNP was obtained after incubation for 1-2 h with DTT in buffer at physiological pH (7.4). The simultaneous addition of SNP and DTT to the slices induced a small effect, and the effect of SNP declined after 3.5 h. SNP stimulated cyclic GMP accumulation in the slices without DTT. NaNO2 and 1-hydroxy-2-oxo-3,3-bis(2-aminoethyl)-1-triazene (a generator of nitric oxide), which stimulated cyclic GMP accumulation by themselves, did not stimulate [3H]NA release in the presence and absence of DTT. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine HC1 (a generator of peroxynitrite) had no effect on the release. The stimulatory effect of SNP and DTT on NA release was inhibited 40% by nitric oxide scavengers such as oxyhemoglobin and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy-3-oxide, although cyclic GMP accumulation induced by NO donors was completely inhibited. These findings suggest that SNP reacts with DTT to produce unknown active species, and that cyclic GMP is not a mediator for SNP-stimulated NA release.
