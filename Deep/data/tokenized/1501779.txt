Intraperitoneal administration of kainic acid (KA) into adult rats caused a profound increase in nerve growth factor (NGF) mRNA and a significant reduction of NGF protein level in the hippocampus. Diazepam pretreatment suppressed both. The reduction of NGF level was apparent in the dorsal hippocampus at 2 h after KA administration, but a marked elevation of NGF protein was observed in the ventral hippocampus at 4 h. These results suggest that non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists negatively influence NGF synthesis or stimulate NGF protein degradation in the dorsal hippocampus involving the CA1 sector.
