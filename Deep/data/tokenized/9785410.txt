The Krushinsky-Molodkina rat CA1 hippocampal slices revealed an increased threshold of the epileptiform activity development, a depressed signal transmission in the presynaptic glutamatergic fibres, no long-term increase in excitability of the CA1 pyramidal neurons characteristic of Wistar rats following Mg2+ removal and K+ increase. These events suggest a protective adaptive mechanism preventing propagation of seizure activity into limbic structures of the rats.
