The chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor, COUP-TF I, and the protein ARP-1 (COUP-TF II) are two highly homologous orphan receptors of the nuclear hormone receptor family. In this study we investigated their expression patterns in the adult nervous system of the mouse. In situ hybridizations were performed on brain sections with 35S-labeled cRNA probes derived from the 3'-non-coding regions of the mARP-1 and mCOUP-TF I mRNAs. Both COUP-TF I and ARP-1 were shown to be expressed in the adult brain and they displayed restricted and distinct expression patterns. COUP-TF I transcripts were predominantly found in the rostral and caudal parts of the adult mouse brain, whereas ARP-1 transcripts prevaled in the middle part of the brain. High expression of COUP-TF I was detected in the olfactory nucleus, in neocortex layers I/II and V/VL, in the dentate gyrus and in areas CA1/CA3/CA4 of the hippocampus, and in the granular layer of the cerebellum. Only low amounts of COUP-TF I mRNA were detected in the ventral, the laterodorsal and in the interanteromedial thalamic nuclei. Small amounts of COUP-TF I transcripts were also found in the epithelial layer of the ventricle and in arachnoid membranes. High expression of ARP-I was detected in the reticular, the ventral lateral and the gelatinosus thalamic nuclei. Other hot spots of ARP-1 mRNA expression were the amygdaloid nucleus and the arachnoid membranes. Lower amounts of ARP-1 transcripts were found in the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and in the choroid plexus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
