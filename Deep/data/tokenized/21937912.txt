alpha-Synuclein is a major component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We recently showed that abnormal alpha-synuclein with resistance to proteinase K (PK) is deposited at presynapses of distinct brain anatomic regions from the early stages of PD and DLB. NUB1, a synphilin-1-binding protein, also accumulates in Lewy bodies, but it is not known whether abnormal alpha-synuclein is associated with NUB1. Here, we demonstrate that, in the brain of patients with PD and DLB, NUB1 accumulates in the presynapses in the hippocampus, cerebral neocortex, and substantia nigra in which PK-resistant alpha-synuclein is deposited. Endogenous NUB1 also accumulated with PK-resistant alpha-synuclein in the presynapses of transgenic mice that express human alpha-synuclein with an A53T mutation. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that NUB1 is localized to presynaptic nerve terminals where no abnormal filaments are seen. Biochemical analyses showed that NUB1 coexists with abnormal alpha-synuclein in the brain of DLB patients. These findings suggest that NUB1 along with abnormal alpha-synuclein is involved in the pathogenesis of Lewy body disease.
