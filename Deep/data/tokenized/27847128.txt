Neuropeptide Y (NPY)-Y2 receptors are G-protein coupled receptors and, upon activation, induce opening of potassium channels or closing of calcium channels. They are generally presynaptically located. Depending on the neuron in which they are expressed they mediate inhibition of release of NPY and of the neuron's classical transmitter GABA, glutamate or noradrenaline, respectively. Here we provide evidence that Y2 receptor binding is inhibited dose-dependently by GTPgammaS along Schaffer collaterals, the stria terminalis and the fimbria indicating that Y2 receptors are functionally coupled to G-proteins along these fiber tracts. Double immune fluorescence revealed coexistence of Y2-immunoreactivity with beta-tubulin, a marker for axons in the stria terminalis, but not with synaptophysin labeling presynaptic terminals, supporting the localization of Y2 receptors along axonal tracts. After kainic acid-induced seizures in rats, GTPgammaS-induced inhibition of Y2 receptor binding is facilitated in the Schaffer collaterals but not in the stria terminalis. Our data indicate that Y2 receptors are not only located at nerve terminals but also along fiber tracts and are there functionally coupled to G-proteins.
