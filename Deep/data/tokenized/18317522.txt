By analyzing interpoint comparisons, we obtain significant results describing the relationship in "hippocampus shape space" of clinically depressed, high-risk, and control populations. In particular, our analysis demonstrates that the high-risk population is closer in shape space to the control population than to the clinically depressed population.
