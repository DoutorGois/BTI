Super-delayed loss of muscarinic-1 (M1) receptors and the protective effect of propentofylline on these changes were examined in the gerbil hippocampus after transient ischemia with radioactive pirenzepine. M1 receptors were markedly decreased in the gerbil hippocampus 14 days after transient ischemia. Single administration of propentofylline (20 mg/kg, ip) just after transient ischemia almost completely prevented the ischemia-induced decrease in the number of M1 receptors, and had no effect in sham-operated controls. These findings suggest that one of the therapeutic efficacies of propentofylline is the result of the normalization of the dysfunction of the acetylcholine neuronal system in cerebrovascular disease.
