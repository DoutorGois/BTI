Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Since deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning are observed in diabetic rats and following stress, we examined the expression of nNOS mRNA and protein in the hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic rats and rats subjected to restraint stress. Stress did not modulate nNOS expression, while nNOS mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus of STZ diabetic rats. These results suggest that: (1) decreased expression of nNOS mRNA and protein may contribute to deficits in hippocampal dependent learning and LTP in diabetic rats; and (2) other mechanisms may be involved in stress mediated decreases in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
