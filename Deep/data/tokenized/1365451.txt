Using 32P-labelled oligonucleotides derived from the coding regions of dopamine D1, D2 and D3 receptor mRNAs we localized cells containing transcripts for these receptors in the human (hD1, hD2) and rat brain (rD1, rD2, rD3). Dopamine D1 receptor mRNA was detected at high levels in neurons of the caudate and putamen as well as in the nucleus accumbens in both human and rat brain. In the rat brain D1 receptor mRNA was also abundant in the olfactory tubercles and several thalamic nuclei. In both species D1 mRNA was absent from the neurons of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area as well as from the globus pallidus medialis in humans and entopeduncular nucleus in rats. In contrast, dopamine D2 receptor mRNA was found in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and of the ventral tegmental area. In addition high levels of D2 mRNA were detected in neurons of the caudate, putamen and accumbens nuclei, the olfactory tubercle and the anterior lobe of pituitary gland. In the rat the highest level of hybridization was found in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland. In the rat brain dopamine D3 mRNA was mainly detected in the Islands of Calleja and at lower levels in the anterior nucleus accumbens, the medial mammillary nucleus as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In general, a good agreement was found between the distribution of transcripts and binding sites labelled with the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or with the D2 ligand SDZ 205-502. For D1 receptors, the main exceptions were the absence of mRNA in the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra despite the high densities of binding sites in these regions. For D2 receptors, regions where binding sites but not mRNA were detected included the olfactory bulb, neocortex, hippocampus and superior colliculus.
