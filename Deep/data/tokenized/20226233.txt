We assessed the involvement of the hippocampus in recall of learned fear of a discrete visual stimulus using a fear-potentiated startle (FPS) procedure. Recall was measured by an increase in acoustic startle in the presence of a light that was paired with footshock. In Experiment 1, rats either received sham, dorsal, ventral, or complete (dorsal and ventral) NMDA-induced damage of the hippocampus following FPS acquisition. During the post-surgery retention test, only the rats with complete hippocampal damage showed a significant FPS deficit. In Experiment 2, we examined whether recent and remote memory for FPS would be differentially affected by complete hippocampal damage. Rats received sham or complete hippocampal damage 1- or 4-wk after FPS acquisition. During the retention test, sham rats exhibited significant FPS, whereas rats with hippocampal damage showed a large FPS deficit that was equivalent for recent and remote memories. In Experiment 3, we found that rats with complete hippocampal damage induced before conditioning showed levels of FPS that did not significantly differ from sham rats. Combined, these findings suggest that extensive damage to the hippocampus causes retrograde amnesia for a memory involving a light-shock association that is not temporally graded. The same damage does not cause anterograde amnesia in the same memory task. Partial damage of the hippocampus, whether of the dorsal or ventral region, was insufficient to cause retrograde amnesia. Thus, the hippocampus normally has a critical and long-lasting role enabling recall of fear conditioning to a discrete visual stimulus. In the absence of the hippocampus other memory systems support new learning.
