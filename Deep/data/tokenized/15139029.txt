We studied the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunoreactivity and mRNA in the ischemia-vulnerable cerebral hippocampal CA1 and cortical areas after permanent occlusion of bilateral internal carotid arteries. Four groups of rats were studied, including 1) young normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, 2) aged normotensive WKY rats, 3) young spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR), and 4) aged SHR. Each group contained rats from sham operation and 1 week, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after cerebral ischemia (n = 3-5 at each time point). Hematoxylin and eosin staining and in situ apoptosis detection showed no neuronal damage from 1 week to 8 weeks in all the ischemic rats. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot showed that BDNF immunoreactivity increased only at 1 week in the CA1 area of young WKY rats (P < .001) and SHR (P = .002) and decreased only at 8 weeks in the cortical area of aged WKY rats (P = .02). In situ hybridization and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR showed that BDNF mRNA decreased consistently from 1 week to 8 weeks in both CA1 and cortical areas in young SHR (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively) and in aged WKY rats (P < .01 and P < .05, respectively) but was not changed in young WKY rats or aged SHR (P > .05) compared with the sham-operated rats. Our study demonstrates an expression disparity of BDNF immunoreactivity and mRNA in the hippocampal CA1 and cortical areas, especially in the young SHR and aged WKY rats after mild cerebral ischemia. Our study suggests that, under permanent occlusion of bilateral internal carotid arteries, aging and the level of blood pressure may have influence on the expression of BDNF.
