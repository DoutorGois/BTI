Deficits in neuronal network synchrony in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex have been widely demonstrated in disorders of cognitive dysfunction, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. The atypical dopamine agonist SKF 83959 has been shown to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor signalling and suppress activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 in PFC, two processes important to learning and memory. The purpose of this study was to therefore evaluate the impact of SKF 83959 on oscillatory deficits in methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rat model of schizophrenia. To achieve this, local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of anesthetized rats at 15 and 90 min following both acute and repeated administration of SKF 83959 (0.4 mg/kg). In MAM rats, but not controls, repeated SKF 83959 treatment increased signal amplitude in hippocampus and enhanced the spectral power of low frequency delta and theta oscillations in this region. In PFC, SKF 83959 increased delta, theta and gamma spectral power. Increased HIP-PFC theta coherence was also evident following acute and repeated SKF 83959. In apparent contradiction to these oscillatory effects, in MAM rats, SKF 83959 inhibited spatial learning and induced a significant increase in thigmotactic behaviour. These findings have uncovered a previously unknown role for SKF 83959 in the positive regulation of hippocampal-prefrontal cortical oscillatory network activity. As SKF 83959 is known to have affinity for a number of receptors, delineating the receptor mechanisms that mediate the positive drug effects on neuronal oscillations could have significant future implications in disorders associated with cognitive dysfunction.
