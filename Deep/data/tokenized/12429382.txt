The aim of the present study was to establish whether estrogen and corticosteroids exert effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)(164) expression in the hippocampus and nucleus paraventricularis of the hypothalamus by in situ hybridization. Female mice were ovariectomized and treated either with estradiol benzoate or vehicle and male mice were either adrenalectomized or sham-operated. Ovariectomy plus estrogen reduced VEGF(164) expression in the nucleus paraventricularis but not in the hippocampus. Adrenalectomy did not influence VEGF(164) mRNA levels in the hippocampus and nucleus paraventricularis. Our results show for the first time an inhibitory effect of estrogen on VEGF(164) expression in the nucleus paraventricularis and suggest a role for estrogen in the regulation of VEGF(164) expression and function in the central nervous system.
