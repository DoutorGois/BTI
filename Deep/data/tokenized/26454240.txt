Monoamines such as norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) have shown to play an important role in motor recovery after brain injury. The effects elicited by these neurotransmitters have been reported as distal from the area directly affected. Remote changes may take place over minutes to weeks and play an important role in post-stroke recovery. However, the mechanisms involved in spontaneous recovery have not been thoroughly delineated. Therefore, we determined the NE and 5-HT content, in the pons and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) as well as motor deficit and spontaneous activity in rats after 3, 10 and 20 days cortical iron injection. Three days post-lesion the pontine NE content diminished, this effect was accompanied by deficient spontaneous activity and impaired sensorimotor evaluation. Ten and twenty days after lesion the NE levels were similar to those of control group, and animals also showed behavioral recovery. Monoamines content on DG 3 days post-lesion showed no differences as compared to controls. Interestingly, ten and twenty days after cortical injury, animals showed increased NE and 5-HT. These results suggest that behavioral recovery after brain damage involve changes on monoamines levels on DG, an important structure to plastic processes. In addition, the results herein support evidence to propose these neurotransmitters as key molecules to functional recovery in the central nervous system.
