Hippocampal spontaneous interictal spikes (SISs) were recorded during the course of daily tetanization (kindling) of afferent fibers to the hippocampal CA1 region. SISs were detected after 3-10 tetanizations. A clear variation of SIS rate with behavior was observed. SIS rate was high during slow-wave sleep (SWS), waking immobility, face-washing and chewing and low during rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), walking and rearing. Scopolamine hydrochloride (2.5-5 mg/kg i.p.) increased the SIS rate during walking. Despite the negative correlation of SIS occurrence with the theta rhythm in normal rats, abolishing the theta rhythm by medial septal lesions did not affect the suppression of SISs during REMS as compared to SWS. When interictal or postictal spikes were seen together with the theta rhythm, the spikes tended to occur at a phase of about 240 degrees after the positive peak of the alvear surface rhythm.
