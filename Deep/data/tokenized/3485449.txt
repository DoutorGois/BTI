The in vitro binding of a synthetic androgen, methyltrienolone ([3H]-R1881), to brain and pituitary (PIT) cytosol and nuclear extracts was determined in male and female rats. Purified cytosol was prepared from PIT or hypothalamic-preoptic area-amygdala (HPA) and incubated in the presence of 0.1 to 10 nM [3H]-R1881. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of a single, saturable, high-affinity binding site in PIT cytosol with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.42 X 10(-10) M in females and 0.95 X 10(-10) M in intact males. The Kd of HPA cytosol was much less in castrated males [0.47 +/- 0.05 (SEM) X 10(-10)M, n = 7] and females (0.63 +/- 0.1 X 10(-10) M, n = 4) than in intact males (5.8 +/- 1.1 X 10(-10) M, n = 8). Treatment of castrated males with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for 24 h (250 micrograms/100 g of body weight) increased the Kd of HPA cytosol only slightly (1.6 X 10(-10) M, mean of two replicates). Scatchard analysis of salt-extracted nuclear androgen receptor (ARn) showed a single, high-affinity binding site with similar Kd values in PIT and HPA of intact and castrated, DHT-treated male rats (PIT Kd = 7.3 X 10(-10) M, 9.3 X 10(-10) M; HPA Kd = 1.5 X 10(-9) M, 1.3 X 10(-9) M, respectively). Competition studies involving a range of several radioinert steroids revealed that the binding of [3H]-R1881 to cytosol (ARc) and nuclear extract was specific for androgen receptor when triamcinolone acetonide (10 microM) was added. The ARc and ARn levels were quantified in PIT, preoptic area (POA), hypothalamus (HT), amygdala, hippocampus, and cortex by single point estimation. Significantly (p less than 0.01) greater amounts of ARc were detected in PIT of ovariectomized females (32.7 +/- 2.9 fmol/mg of protein) than in that of orchidectomized males (22.33 +/- 1.6 fmol/mg of protein). The highest levels in the brain were seen in HT and POA. Pituitary ARc in females varied throughout the estrous cycle. Significantly (p less than 0.01) greater amounts were detected on estrus (45.8 +/- 2.2 fmol/mg of protein) and proestrus (39.0 +/- 1.9 fmol/mg of protein) than on diestrus (29.2 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg of protein). These data confirm the existence of specific receptors for androgen in male and female brain and PIT, and suggest an important role for androgen in the control of PIT hormone secretion in the female.
