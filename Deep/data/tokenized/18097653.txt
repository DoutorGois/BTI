RATIONALE: Hippocampal interneurons release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and produce fast GABA(A)- and slow GABA(B)-inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). The regulation of GABA(B) eIPSPs or the interneurons that produce them are not well understood. In addition, while both micro-opioid receptors (microORs) and cannabinoid CB1R receptors (CB1Rs) are present on hippocampal interneurons, it is not clear how these two systems interact. OBJECTIVES: This study tests the hypotheses that: (1) all interneurons can initiate both GABA(A) and GABA(B) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials; (2) GABA(B) responses are insensitive to mGluR-triggered, endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated inhibitory long-term depression (iLTD); (3) GABA(B) responses are produced by interneurons that express microOR; and (4) CB1R-dependent and microOR-dependent response interact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches were used in acute rat hippocampal slices. High resistance microelectrode recordings were made from pyramidal cells, while interneurons were stimulated extracellularly. RESULTS: GABA(B) responses were found to be produced by interneurons that release GABA via either presynaptic N-type or P/Q-type calcium channels but that they are insensitive to suppression by eCBs or eCB-mediated iLTD. GABA(B) IPSPs were sensitive to suppression by a microOR agonist, suggesting a major source of GABA(B) responses is the microOR-expressing interneuron population. A small eCB-iLTD (10% eIPSP reduction) persisted in conotoxin. eCB-iLTD was blocked by a microOR agonist in 6/13 slices. CONCLUSIONS: GABA(B) responses cannot be produced by all interneurons. CB1R or microOR agonists will differentially alter the balance of activity in hippocampal circuits. CB1R- and microOR-mediated responses can interact.
