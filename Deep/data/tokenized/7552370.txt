The subiculum may be the key structure in the transfer of relevant processed information from the hippocampal formation to cortical areas. We investigated the location of the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1B) in the hippocampus with the specific ligand serotonin-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl[125I]tyrosinamide in rat brain sections using in vitro autoradiography. A high density of 5-HT1B binding sites was found in the dorsal subiculum (DS), in the lacunosum moleculare, and in the most dorsal layer of the stratum oriens of the CA1 field. CA1 pyramidal neurons that contain 5-HT1B mRNA project primarily to the DS. We interrupted the pyramidal CA1 axons unilaterally by a stereotaxic knife cut. Histological analysis showed that the lesion was restricted to a trial of cells lost between CA1 and DS. Specific 5-HT1B binding site density was decreased in the DS on the ipsilateral side of the lesion compared to the contralateral side. We conclude that 5-HT1B receptors are located on CA1 pyramidal axon terminals in the DS. Serotonin, acting on these receptors, should inhibit CA1 neurotransmitter release and, in this way, modulate subicular functions.
