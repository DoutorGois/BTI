We have investigated the effect of tyrosine administration on the cognitive and neurochemical alterations caused by diet restriction (DR) in mice, as a possible model for some of the behavioral symptoms of patients with anorexia nervosa. Young female mice were fed to 100, 60, and 40% of the calculated daily nutritional requirements for a period of up to 18 days. Cognitive function was evaluated using a modified eight-arm maze with water as a reward. Animals fed to 60% of controls showed significantly improved maze performance while this was impaired in animals on DR to 40%. However, in these animals, injections of tyrosine (100 mg/kg/day) restored performance. Improved maze performance in the 60% DR and 40% DR + tyrosine animals was related to increased beta:alpha tone in the hippocampus- an area, together with the septum, responsible for spatial learning. This was associated with changes in alpha- and beta-receptor density (Bmax), without affecting affinity (Kd); and increased norepinephrine (NE) in the 40% DR + tyrosine group, and methoxyhydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in both groups. In the hypothalamus, the brain area responsible for energy metabolism, there was a progressive increase in alpha:beta tone with increasing DR associated with changes in Bmax. Tyrosine treatment reversed these alterations. Tyrosine improves some of the neurobiological disturbances of DR without causing an increase in body weight. Such a strategy might have important implications for the possible treatment of patients with anorexia nervosa.
