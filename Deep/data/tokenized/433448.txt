Experimental data are presented on dynamic rearrangment of corticofugal influences on subcortical structures during conditioning and conditioned performance, as well as data on the transition of diffusive influences, to selective ones. The mechanisms of plastic rearrangment of subcortical influences in the course of consolidation of the conditioned reflex are discussed on the basis of cortical-reticular and cortical-striate interactions. The significance of subcortical interactions in the integrative brain activity and in the organization of behaviour is discussed. Facts are presented on synchronization of several rhythms in rhythmical activity in the strio-thalamo-cortical system in the process of achievement of conditioned reflexes.
