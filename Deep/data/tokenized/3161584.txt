Repeated spaced injection of small amounts of beta-endorphin or Met-enkephalin into the hippocampus or posterior amygdala of the rat led to the development of kindled generalized convulsions. Similar injection of morphine into the hippocampus or anterior amygdala resulted in epileptiform spiking followed by tolerance. The epileptiform spiking and convulsive behavior varied in a dose-related manner. Naloxone blocked or greatly attenuated the electrographic seizure and convulsive behavior. Prior kindling with beta-endorphin or Met-enkephalin significantly facilitated electrical kindling of the amygdala. Handling or conspecific threat potentiated the epileptiform spiking and convulsive behavior in some cases. The results indicate that the epileptogenic response to intracerebrally applied opioid peptides is site-specific within the rat brain, and they support the idea that endogenous opioid mechanisms may play a role in convulsive seizures. They also suggest a possible opiate-based mechanism for the stress-induced exacerbation of seizures.
