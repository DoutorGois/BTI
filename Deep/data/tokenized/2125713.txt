Muscarinic receptors are involved in CNS neurotransmissions and have been shown to transduce their message by modulating cAMP, calcium, inositol phosphates, and more recently, by liberating arachidonic acid via phospholipase A1. We have previously shown that the alpha 1-adrenergic and 5-HT2 serotonergic neurotransmitter receptors cause the release of arachidonic acid from spinal cord and hippocampal neurons, respectively, in primary culture. In this study, we demonstrated a muscarinic receptor-mediated release of arachidonic acid in these two neural segments which occurred independent of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. This release of arachidonic acid was neuronal (not glial) in origin and exhibited M1 muscarinic receptor pharmacology.
