We studied the effects of orotic acid, a precursor of pyrimidine nucleotide, on delayed neuronal death of hippocampal CA1 neurones induced by global cerebral ischaemia in Mongolian gerbils. Neuronal damage was significantly reduced in animals treated with orotic acid 2 h before ischaemia at doses of 100, 200 or 300 mg kg-1, i.p. A dose of 300 mg kg-1 given 24 h after ischaemia also suppressed CA1 neuronal damage, but had no effect when given at 48 or 72 h. These results demonstrate a protective effect of orotic acid on ischaemic neuronal damage with a wide therapeutic time window.
