In the brain of aged rats (22-24 months old) choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in striatum and frontal cortex is lower than in young rats (4-5 months old). In contrast, ChAT activity in the hippocampus is similar in the two groups. Treating old animals with GM1 ganglioside, 30 mg/kg ip, for 30 or 45 days enhances ChAT activity in the striatum and frontal cortex, but has no effect on activity in the hippocampus. ChAT activity remains elevated in the striatum and frontal cortex for 15 days after discontinuing treatment with GM1.
