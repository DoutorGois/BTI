Simvastatin (SV) has been reported to improve cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we show that chronic administration of SV (20 mg/kg) for 30 days in adult mice (SV mice) enhanced spatial cognitive performance as assessed by Morris water maze and Y-maze. To explore mechanisms underlying SV-enhanced spatial cognition, we further examined synaptic properties and long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1, hippocampal alpha7nAChR expression, and Akt and ERK2 phosphorylation. In comparison with controls, the SV administration caused increase in presynaptic glutamate release and amplitude of NMDAr-dependent LTP (LTP-augmentation), and decrease in threshold of NMDAr-independent LTP induction (LTP-facilitation). The supplement of isoprenoid farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by applying farnesol (FOH) could abolish the spatial cognitive potentiation, increased glutamate release, and LTP-augmentation/facilitation in SV mice. Expression of alpha7nAChR, but not alpha4beta2nAChR, was increased in hippocampal pyramidal cells of SV mice with the reduction of transcription factor AP-2alpha, which were abolished by FOH. Levels of Akt and ERK2 phosphorylation in SV mice were elevated, which were suppressed by FOH or alpha7nAChR antagonist methyl-lycaconitine (MLA). In hippocampal slices obtained from SV mice, acute perfusion of MLA blocked the increased glutamate release, whereas FOH, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or MEK inhibitor U0126 could not. In the slices of SV mice, the perfusion of MLA or U0126, but not FOH, abolished the LTP-augmentation and LTP-facilitation. By contrast, LY294002 prevented the LTP-facilitation but failed to affect the LTP-augmentation. The findings indicate that the administration of SV through reducing FPP increases alpha7nAChR expression and alpha7nAChR-related Akt and ERK2 phosphorylation, leading to LTP enhancement and spatial cognitive potentiation.
