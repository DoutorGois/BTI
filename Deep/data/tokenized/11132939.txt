This study reports that postischemic apoptotic cell death of the hippocampal cornu ammonis (CA) 1 neurons is delayed in aged gerbils. Age-related changes in the process of CA1 neuronal death following transient ischemia was studied. Two groups of Mongolian gerbils were used in this study, which compared adult (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) animals by hematoxylin-eosin stain, in situ nick-end labeling (TUNEL method) and electron microscopy. In the process of neuronal death, neuronal loss of the aged group was histologically less severe than that of the adult group. TUNEL-positive cells were found on days 3-5 after ischemia in the adult group, while they were still found on day 7 in the aged group. The apoptotic process of the aged group was delayed compared to the adult group. Furthermore, lipofuscin was ultrastructurally observed inside the apoptotic body 5 days after ischemia in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the aged group. It is likely that colocalization of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D with lipofuscin might be associated with the age-related alteration of lysosomal system in the neurons. Altogether these data suggest that age-related lysosomal changes might affect the apoptotic cascade process in postischemic CA1 neurons.
