The size of distinct hippocampal sub-fields were measured in the apomorphine-susceptible and apomorphine-unsusceptible rat lines. Mossy fiber terminal fields were delineated using dynorphin B immunoreactivity and area measurements were taken from (1) the supra-pyramidal mossy fiber terminal field; (2) the intra- and infra-pyramidal mossy fiber terminal field; (3) the hilus of the fascia dentata (4) the non dynorphin B immunoreactive area of the regio inferior and fascia dentata and (5) the total area of regio inferior and fascia dentata. The data indicate that statistically significant differences in the morphometry of the hippocampal subfields of the apomorphine susceptible and unsusceptible rats are confined to the intra- and infra terminal field: the relative size of the left and right intra- and infra terminal field of apomorphine unsusceptible rats are significantly larger than those of the apomorphine susceptible rats. These data explain at least in part the differential response of these rats to novelty.
