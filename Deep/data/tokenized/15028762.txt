Identification of the molecular mechanisms that enable synchronous firing of CA1 pyramidal neurons is central to the understanding of the functional properties of this major hippocampal output pathway. Using microfluorescence measurements of intraneuronal pH, in situ hybridization, as well as intracellular, extracellular, and K+-sensitive microelectrode recordings, we show now that the capability for synchronous gamma-frequency (20-80 Hz) firing in response to high-frequency stimulation (HFS) emerges abruptly in the rat hippocampus at approximately postnatal day 12. This was attributable to a steep developmental upregulation of intrapyramidal carbonic anhydrase isoform VII, which acts as a key molecule in the generation of HFS-induced tonic GABAergic excitation. These results point to a crucial role for the developmental expression of intrapyramidal carbonic anhydrase VII activity in shaping integrative functions, long-term plasticity and susceptibility to epileptogenesis.
