The extracellular matrix molecule tenascin-C (TN-C) has been shown to be involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vitro. Here, we describe a deficit in hippocampus-dependent contextual memory in TN-C-deficient mice using the step-down avoidance paradigm. We further show that a fragment of TN-C containing the fibronectin type-III repeats 6-8 (FN6-8), but not a fragment containing repeats 3-5, bound to pyramidal and granule cell somata in the hippocampal formation of C57BL/6J mice and repelled axons of pyramidal neurons when presented as a border in vitro. Injection of the FN6-8 fragment into the hippocampus inhibited retention of memory in the step-down paradigm and reduced levels of long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In summary, our data show that TN-C is involved in hippocampus-dependent contextual memory and synaptic plasticity and identify the FN6-8 domain as one of molecular determinants mediating these functions.
