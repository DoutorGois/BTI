Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is induced by exposure to brief durations of transient ischemia, which results in ischemic tolerance to a subsequent longer or lethal period of ischemia. In the present study, the effects of IPC (2 min of transient cerebral ischemia) were examined on immunoreactivity of plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)BB and on neuroprotection in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region following lethal transient cerebral ischemia (LTCI; 5 min of transient cerebral ischemia). IPC was subjected to a 2min sublethal ischemia and a LTCI was given 5min transient ischemia. The animals in all of the groups were given recovery times of 1, 2 and 5 days and change in PDGFBB immunoreactivity was examined as was the neuronal damage/death in the hippocampus induced by LTCI. LTCI induced a significant loss of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region 5 days after LTCI, and significantly decreased PDGFBB immunoreactivity in the CA1 pyramidal neurons from day 1 after LTCI. Conversely, IPC effectively protected the CA1 pyramidal neurons from LTCI and increased PDGFBB immunoreactivity in the CA1 pyramidal neurons postLTCI. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that LTCI significantly altered PDGFBB immunoreactivity in pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region, whereas IPC increased the immunoreactivity. These findings indicated that PDGFBB may be associated with IPCmediated neuroprotection.
