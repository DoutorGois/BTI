Mutations in the KCNQ2 gene encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv7.2 cause early onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE). Most mutations have been shown to induce a loss of function or to affect the subcellular distribution of Kv7 channels in neurons. Herein, we investigated functional consequences and subcellular distribution of the p.V175L mutation of Kv7.2 (Kv7.2(V175L) ) found in a patient presenting EOEE. We observed that the mutation produced a 25-40 mV hyperpolarizing shift of the conductance-voltage relationship of both the homomeric Kv7.2(V175L) and heteromeric Kv7.2(V175L) /Kv7.3 channels compared to wild-type channels and a 10 mV hyperpolarizing shift of Kv7.2(V175L) /Kv7.2/Kv7.3 channels in a 1:1:2 ratio mimicking the patient situation. Mutant channels also displayed faster activation kinetics and an increased current density that was prevented by 1 mum linopirdine. The p.V175L mutation did not affect the protein expression of Kv7 channels and its localization at the axon initial segment. We conclude that p.V175L is a gain of function mutation. This confirms previous observations showing that mutations having opposite consequences on M channels can produce EOEE. These findings alert us that drugs aiming to increase Kv7 channel activity might have adverse effects in EOEE in the case of gain-of-function variants.
