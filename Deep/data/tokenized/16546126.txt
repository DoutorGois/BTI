Neuronal development requires several discrete morphological steps that are believed to involve the small GTPase Rac. For example, neural activity, through NMDA receptors and/or AMPA receptors, activates Rac leading to elaboration of dendritic arbors. In the current study, we have conducted studies which indicate that Rac might be an important molecule involved in morphological plasticity in the adult mouse. We demonstrate that Rac is expressed at synapses in the adult mouse hippocampus. We also demonstrate that treatment of hippocampal slices with NMDA induces membrane translocation and activation of Rac in area CA1. Interestingly, we also find that there is an increase in Rac that is associated with NMDA receptor complexes following NMDA receptor activation. Taken together, our data are consistent with the idea that Rac could be participating in NMDA receptor-dependent changes in morphology that occur during synaptic plasticity and memory formation in the adult mouse hippocampus.
