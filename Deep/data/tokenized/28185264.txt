beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42) is a self-assembling peptide that goes through many conformational and morphological changes before forming the fibrils that are deposited in extracellular plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The link between Abeta1-42 structure and toxicity is of major interest, in particular, the neurotoxic potential of oligomeric species. Many studies utilise reversed (Abeta42-1) and scrambled (AbetaS) forms of amyloid-beta as control peptides. Here, using circular dichroism, thioflavin T fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, we reveal that both control peptides self-assemble to form fibres within 24 h. However, oligomeric Abeta reduces cell survival of hippocampal neurons, while Abeta42-1 and Abetas have reduced effect on cellular health, which may arise from their ability to assemble rapidly to form protofibrils and fibrils.
