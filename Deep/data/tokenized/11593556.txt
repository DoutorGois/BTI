OBJECTIVE: Artificial neural network is first used in the measurement study of brain of Alzheimer's disease using MRI, and a completely new pattern discriminating method is adopted, so as to take advantage of MRI to diagnose and identify AD patients. METHODS: 12 patients with probable AD (aged 65.33 +/- 8.62 years) and 36 normal controls matched with age and gender (aged 65.81 +/- 74.37 years) were studied. MRI are performed on Siemens Magnetom IMPACT 1.0 T; eight interesting brain structures including sixteen regions (left and right) indices are measured and studied; SPSS software and BP network software made by authors respectively were used to process and analyze the measured data. RESULTS: Using artificial neural network to the same regions and data, both the sensitivity and accuracy were found higher than using the traditional discrimination function analysis method; the indices of amygdala, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal lobe, and temporal horn, these five structures could completely differentiate AD from normal controls; new cases were successfully diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural network combining with MRI is probable to become a useful and reliable clinical tool to diagnose AD patients.
