In the present study, we investigated age-related changes in IGF-I receptor localization in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Sprague-Dawley rats using immunohistochemistry. In the cerebral cortex of adult rats, weakly stained cells were seen in layers II-III and layer V/VI in several cortical regions. In aged rats, there was a significant increase in IGF-I receptor immunoreactivity in the pyramidal cells in the same cortical regions. In the hippocampus of adult rats, several moderately stained neurons were seen in CA1-3 areas and the dentate gyrus. Levels of IGF-I receptor protein increased substantially with age in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. Our first morphological data concerning the differential regulation of IGF-I receptors in aged cerebral cortex and hippocampus may provide insights into age-related changes in trophic support as well as basic knowledge required for the study of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
