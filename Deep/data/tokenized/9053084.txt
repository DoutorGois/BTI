Different efferent outputs of the hippocampal formation provide a differentiated control of the single unit activity in the region of the supraoptic nucleus. Responses of the neurosecretory cells to hippocampal and subicular stimulation were excitatory and inhibitory accordingly. The short-latency reactions were predominant. Amygdala were shown to activate the paraventricular neurones antidromically identified by the neurohypophysial stalk stimulation though to a lesser extent than hippocampus. Influences of the limbic structures were revealed to direct mainly to interneurones and other cells not projecting to the posterior lobe of the hypophysis.
