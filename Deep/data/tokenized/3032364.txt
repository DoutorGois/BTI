Despite the wide clinical use of lithium in the treatment of manic depressive illness there is no adequate explanation for its mechanism of action. In the light of lithium's suggestive effects on the second messenger system in the brain, we studied the effects of chronic dietary lithium treatment (achieving blood levels in the therapeutic range) on protein phosphorylation in different areas of rat brain. An increase in the phosphorylation of a 64-kDa membrane-associated protein was evident in the lithium-treated rats compared to controls. This increase was observed only under basal phosphorylating conditions and was abolished when the phosphorylation was performed in the presence of Ca2+ or Ca2+ and calmodulin. The possibility that this 64-kDa protein affected by lithium is the beta-subunit of the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or a different protein which co-migrates with it is discussed.
