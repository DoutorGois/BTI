The authors used surface-based anatomic mapping to detect features of hippocampal anatomy that correlated with surgical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis. Compared with a seizure-free group, hippocampal profiles for the non-seizure-free group had greater diffuse ipsilateral atrophy and more region-specific contralateral atrophy in the anterior, lateral hippocampus. These atrophic regions may indicate areas of increased epileptogenicity, contributing to poorer surgical outcomes.
