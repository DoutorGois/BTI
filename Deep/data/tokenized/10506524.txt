Kininogen localization has been determined by immunocytochemistry in rat spinal cord and brain using a kinin-directed kininogen monoclonal antibody. In the spinal cord, there were immunostained neurons and fibers in laminae I, II, VII, and IX, intensely stained fibers in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn, and immunoreactive glial and endothelial cells. Small neurons, satellite cells, and Schwann cells immunostained distinctly in the dorsal root ganglion. In the brain stem, there were immunoreactive neurons and fibers in the tractus solitarius and nucleus, trigeminal spinal tract and nuclei, periaqueductal gray matter, vestibular nuclei, cochlear nuclei, trapezoid body, medial geniculate nucleus, and red nucleus. Immunostained neurons and fibers were also found in cerebellum (dentate nucleus), cerebral cortex (layers III and V), hippocampus (pyramidal cell layer), and corpus callosum. Glia and endothelial cells stained in all brain regions. The widespread location of kininogen in neurons and their processes, as well as in glial and endothelial cells, indicates more than one functional role, including those proposed as a mediator, a calpain inhibitor, and a kinin precursor, in a variety of neural activities and responses.
