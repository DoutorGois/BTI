Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in humans and in animals leads to an acute and sustained increase in tissue glutamate concentrations within the brain, triggering glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are responsible for maintaining extracellular central nervous system glutamate concentrations below neurotoxic levels. Our results demonstrate that as early as 5 min and up to 2 h following brain trauma in brain-injured rats, the activity (Vmax) of EAAT2 in the cortex and the hippocampus was significantly decreased, compared with sham-injured animals. The affinity for glutamate (KM) and the expression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) were not altered by the injury. Administration of (R)-(-)-5-methyl-1-nicotinoyl-2-pyrazoline (MS-153), a GLT-1 activator, beginning immediately after injury and continuing for 24 h, significantly decreased neurodegeneration, loss of microtubule-associated protein 2 and NeuN (+) immunoreactivities, and attenuated calpain activation in both the cortex and the hippocampus at 24 h after the injury; the reduction in neurodegeneration remained evident up to 14 days post-injury. In synaptosomal uptake assays, MS-153 up-regulated GLT-1 activity in the naive rat brain but did not reverse the reduced activity of GLT-1 in traumatically-injured brains. This study demonstrates that administration of MS-153 in the acute post-traumatic period provides acute and long-term neuroprotection for TBI and suggests that the neuroprotective effects of MS-153 are related to mechanisms other than GLT-1 activation, such as the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels.
