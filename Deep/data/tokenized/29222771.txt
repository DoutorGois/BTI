Neurons cultured from rodent central nervous system tissues represent important tools in the study of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and neuroregenerative processes, including the survival- and axon growth-promoting properties of neurotrophic factors. This chapter presents a detailed protocol for the preparation of rat and mouse cortical, hippocampal, and striatal neuron cell cultures, using either embryonic or postnatal tissue with enzymatic digestion.
