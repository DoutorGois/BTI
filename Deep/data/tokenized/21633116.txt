Up to 22% of pregnant women smoke, which constitutes a major health concern. Nicotine, a cholinergic agonist, causes deleterious effects on brain development. However, most studies investigate its effects during rodents' gestation, which corresponds, in terms of neural development, to the first two trimesters of human gestation. Here, we focused on effects of nicotine on the brain cholinergic system during the third trimester equivalent of human gestation. From the 2nd to the 19th day of lactation, dams were exposed either to nicotine (6 mg/kg/day) or to saline via sc osmotic minipumps. Offspring were sacrificed during exposure (PN15, PN, postnatal) or at 2 days (PN21), 11 days (PN30), or 10 weeks (PN90) of withdrawal. In the cerebral cortex, midbrain, and hippocampus, we assessed nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) binding, [(3)H]hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) binding to the high-affinity choline transporter, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. Nicotine-exposed offspring presented nAChR upregulation during exposure in all brain regions, reduced HC-3 binding during and 11 days postexposure, and increased HC-3 binding on PN90. Effects on ChAT and AChE were dependent on the brain region and restricted to the withdrawal period: There were increased activities in the midbrain on PN30. In the hippocampus, AChE as reduced on PN30, whereas, for ChAT, the decrease was followed by late-emergent increased activity. These data indicate that maternal nicotine exposure during the third trimester equivalent of human gestation promotes cholinergic system alterations in the offspring's brain. In addition, detrimental effects are observable even long after the exposure has been interrupted.
