In the present study, we used the previously developed fluorescence probe, EPNP, to generate the first image of the distribution of mercuric ion in primary mouse neuron cultures. At postnatal day 1 (P1), the mice were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with mercuric chloride in doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.6 mug/g body weight. After 1, 2, 3, and 4 days exposure, primary nervous cell cultures and frozen brain and spinal tissue sections were prepared and dyed using EPNP. On the third day of repeated injections, Hg(2+) was visualized in primary cerebral neuron cultures as an increase of Hg(2+)-induced fluorescence at the doses >/= 0.1 mug/g. A similar accumulation of Hg(2+) was observed in frozen hippocampus tissue sections. In contrast, no Hg(2+) was observed in spinal cord neurons and spinal tissue sections. The detection of a low dose of IP injected mercury in mouse cerebral neurons facilitated the evaluation of the exposure risk to low-dose Hg(2+) in immature organisms. Moreover, the highly sensitive EPNP revealed Hg(2+) in the cerebral neurons of mice younger than P4, while the presence of Hg(2+) was not detected until >/= P11 in previous reports. Thus, this technology and the results obtained herein are of interest for neurotoxicology.
