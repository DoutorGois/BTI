Telemetric recordings of field potentials from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation of freely moving rats were analysed before and after injection of the enantiomeric hallucinogenic amphetamine derivatives R-DOB [(-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-aminopropane], R-DOM [(-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-amino-propane] and R-DOI [(-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane] as well as the nonhallucinogenic amphetamine derivatives S-MBDB [(+)-N-methyl-1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)butanamine] and S-MDMA [(+)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine] and S-(+)-amphetamine. The frequency analysis of the field potentials revealed a clearcut difference between them. The spectral patterns emerging after injection of the non-hallucinogens were characterized by a general decrease of power, the changes in the alpha2 and delta band being the most prominent, whereas only after the application of the hallucinogenic compounds was a contrasting increase of power observed in the alpha 1 frequency band, especially in the striatum. As increases in alpha 1 power have been correlated in the same pharmacological model to serotonergic control mechanisms, the results are in line with the hypothesis that 5-HT2 receptors, predominantly occurring in the striatum, might be involved in the hallucinogenic action of drugs.
