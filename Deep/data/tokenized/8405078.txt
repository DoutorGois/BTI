Diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) and midazolam (2.5-10 mg/kg i.p.) decreased acetylcholine release in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. This effect was antagonized by pretreatment with flumazenil (1 mg/kg i.p.). These results show that activation of benzodiazepine receptors reduces the in vivo release of acetylcholine in the hippocampus, suggesting that the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system, which has a major role in the regulation of cognitive functions, is under inhibitory control exerted by gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) neurons.
