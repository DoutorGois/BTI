Multiple hippocampal transection (MHT) is a novel surgical procedure that serves to disrupt seizure propagation fibers within the hippocampus without impairing verbal memory or the loss of stem cells. Given the paucity of literature regarding the utility and long-term outcome of MHT, a review is presented of the current literature to support the utility of this procedure in the treatment of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. Long-term outcome analysis of this technique has been reported by 2 independent groups. Both groups used intraoperative electrocorticography. All patients underwent multiple subpial transection on the neocortex and MHT on the hippocampus.
