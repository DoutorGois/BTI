The death of GABAergic interneurons has long been hypothesized to contribute to acquired epilepsy. These experiments tested the hypothesis that focal interneuron lesions cause acute seizures [i.e., status epilepticus (SE)] and/or chronic epilepsy [i.e., persistent spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs)]. To selectively ablate interneurons, Gad2-ires-Cre mice were injected unilaterally in the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus with an adeno-associated virus containing the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR). Simultaneously, an electrode, connected to a miniature telemetry device, was positioned at the injection site for chronic recordings of local field potentials (LFPs). Two weeks after virus transfection, intraperitoneal injection of DT consistently caused focal, specific, and extensive ablation of interneurons. Long-term, continuous monitoring revealed that all mice with DT-induced interneuron lesions had SRSs. Seizures lasted tens of seconds and interseizure intervals were several hours (or days); therefore, these interneuron lesions did not induce SE. The SRSs occurred 3-5 d after DT treatment, which is the estimated time required for DT-induced cell death; therefore, induction of SRSs occurred without the latent period typical of acquired epilepsy. In five of six DT-treated mice, SRSs stopped within days, suggesting that the DT-induced interneuron lesions did not usually cause epilepsy. In one mouse, however, SRSs occurred for >/=34 d after interneuron ablation, similar to epilepsy after experimental SE. Sham control mice had no detectable seizures, confirming that the SRSs were due to ablation of interneurons. These data show that selective interneuron ablation consistently caused SRSs but not SE; and, at least under the conditions used here, interneuron lesions rarely led to persistent SRSs (i.e., epilepsy).
