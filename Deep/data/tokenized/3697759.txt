The effect that extra-hypothalamic regions of the brain have upon prolactin secretion in humans was evaluated by performing electrical stimulations. Thirty-nine stimulations were performed, 22 to basolateral amygdala, 12 to hippocampus and 5 to orbitofrontal, supplementary motor and cingulate cortex. Only two stimulations causing high-frequency widespread limbic afterdischarges were followed by significant prolactin elevation. Four low-frequency afterdischarges involving amygdala and anterior hippocampus, one amygdala stimulus-dependent discharge and 19 amygdala, 8 hippocampal and 5 frontal sub-afterdischarge threshold stimulations had no prolactin elevation. These results fail to replicate earlier studies. We suggest that there is no evidence that the amygdala regulates serum prolactin within physiologic ranges, but that the regulation of prolactin may depend primarily upon other sub-cortical structures.
