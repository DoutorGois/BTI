Unilateral injections into the substantia nigra of GABA agonists or the GABA-related agents muscimol (5-50 ng), baclofen (10-50 ng) or B-aminobutyric acid (25-50 ug) induced intensive turning in the direction contralateral to the injected hemisphere. Intranigral injection of the GABA antagonist picrotoxin (100-500 ng) led to ipsiversive turning. Surgical removal of the whole telencephalon (including the neocortex, hippocampus, striatum, septal nuclei and amygdalae) influenced neither direction nor magnitude of the turning responses induced by these various drugs. A GABAergic system in the substantia nigra can, therefore, cause turning independent of telencephalic structures.
