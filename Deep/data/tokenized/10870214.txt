In hippocampectomised rats or in rats subjected to hippocampectomy combined with destruction of the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei, time conditioning could not be elaborated. The lesion of the suprachiasmatic nucleus alone, however, accelerated elaboration of the conditioned reflex. In denucleated rats, the hippocampectomy did not affect the time of a previous conditioning recovery.
