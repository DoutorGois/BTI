Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD), a type of synaptic plasticity, is characterized by a reduction in the synaptic response, mainly at the excitatory synapses of the neurons. The hippocampus and the cerebellum have been the most extensively studied regions in mGluR-dependent LTD, and Group 1 mGluR has been reported to be mainly involved in this synaptic LTD at excitatory synapses. However, mGluR-dependent LTD in other brain regions may be involved in the specific behaviors or diseases. In this paper, we focus on five cortical regions and review the literature that implicates their contribution to the pathogenesis of several behaviors and specific conditions associated with mGluR-dependent LTD.
