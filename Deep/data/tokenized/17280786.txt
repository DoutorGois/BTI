To assess the effects of increased hypothalamic tryptophan (TRP) availability on 5-HT content in preoptic area on thermoregulation and work production during exercise on treadmill, 20.3 microM of L-TRP (n=7) or 0.15M NaCl (n=6) was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle of male Wistar rats immediately before the animals started running (18 m min(-1) 5% inclination). Exercise time to fatigue (min), and workload (kgm) were analysed. Core temperature was measured by telemetry. At fatigue, brains were quickly removed and preoptic area (POA), hypothalamus (HP), frontal cortex (FC), hippocampi (HC) were rapidly dissected and frozen immediately in dry ice. Serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) were measured by HPLC. TRP-exercised rats showed the highest content of 5-HT in the POA and the lowest in the hippocampi compared to the rested and SAL-exercised rats. An inverse relationship between TF and a direct correlation with body temperature changes and POA-5HT levels were observed. A correlation between HC 5-HT content and TF was also found. However, there was no correlation between HC 5-HT content and changes in Tb at fatigue. Finally, our results bring further evidences that increased 5-HT content in POA is involved with an increase in heat production during exercise. In addition, the direct correlation of 5-HT level in hippocampi and TF of TRP-exercised rats suggests that this brain area is also related to motor activity control during exercise. In conclusion, our data indicated that tryptophan-induced central fatigue in exercising rats is related to serotonin content in preoptic area.
