We investigated the adverse effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on the hippocampus in Japanese breast cancer survivors with (n=44) and without (n=31) adjuvant chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in hippocampal volume (magnetic resonance imaging) or additionally in memory function (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised) between the two groups.
