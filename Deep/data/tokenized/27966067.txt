Amyloid-ss (Ass) precursor protein (APP) metabolism engages neuronal endolysosomal pathways for Ass processing and secretion. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), dysregulation of APP leads to excess Ass and neuronal dysfunction; suggesting that neuronal APP/Ass trafficking can be targeted for therapeutic gain. Cathepsin B (CatB) is a lysosomal cysteine protease that can lower Ass levels. However, whether CatB-modulation of Ass improves learning and memory function deficits in AD is not known. To this end, progenitor neurons were infected with recombinant adenovirus expressing CatB and recovered cell lysates subjected to proteomic analyses. The results demonstrated Lamp1 deregulation and linkages between CatB and the neuronal phagosome network. Hippocampal injections of adeno-associated virus expressing CatB reduced Ass levels, increased Lamp1 and improved learning and memory. The findings were associated with the emergence of c-fos + cells. The results support the idea that CatB can speed Ass metabolism through lysosomal pathways and as such reduce AD-associated memory deficits.
