A series of experiments were designed to study the role of the dorsal noradrenergic bundle (DNB) in the modulation of genomic remodeling in the mammalian brain. A series of experiments were designed to study the role of the dorsal noradrenergic system in relation to nonassociative tasks. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were either bilaterally lesioned in the DNB by intrabundle microinjection of 6-hydroxydopamine or were sham lesioned. All rats were given 50 microCi [3H-methyl]-thymidine and were sacrificed 0.5 h later. After the injection of the tracer, rats were either left undisturbed in the home cage or were exposed to a Lat-maze for 15 min after 15 min had passed from the time of injection. During the exposure to the maze, corner crossings and rearings were monitored. The rate of DNA synthesis was determined in several brain regions by measuring the amount of tracer incorporated into the DNA over a 0.5-h duration pulse. Under baseline conditions DNB-lesioned rats showed an increase in DNA synthesis in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and rest of the brain. On the other hand, following exposure to the Lat-maze, sham-lesioned rats only showed an increase in DNA synthesis in the hippocampus, as compared to baseline conditions. Conversely, DNB-lesioned rats did not show an increase in hippocampal DNA synthesis as in the sham-lesioned rats. In contrast, DNA synthesis was increased in the neocortex and rest of the brain. In conclusion, the data support a role for noradrenergic systems in modulating brain DNA synthesis, probably of the unscheduled type, during information processing and storage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
