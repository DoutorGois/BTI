Within the hippocampus, stimulus-transcriptional coupling plays an important role in post-seizure neuronal adaptation, post-ischemic cell death and the induction of long-term potentiation. To identify additional mediators of hippocampal transcriptional responses a targeted approach was developed and used to characterize the spectrum of nuclear hormone receptors expressed within this brain region. cDNAs encoding the DNA-binding domains of six different members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily were isolated. A majority were identical or closely related to receptors known to be expressed within the hippocampus. Two additional isolates, HZF-2 and HZF-3, encode the DNA-binding domain of novel members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.
