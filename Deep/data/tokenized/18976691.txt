While the vasomotor effects of pCO(2) modulation are well documented, the influence of the carbon dioxide-bicarbonate system on the ischemia tolerance of brain tissue itself is controversial. Guinea-pig hippocampal tissue was subjected to ischemia simulation in an interface environment and examined electrophysiologically. Characteristics of anoxic depolarization as well as the postischemic recovery of evoked potentials were registered. During ischemia simulation, pH was changed and afterwards restored to 7.4. pH of 7.6 (n=6), and 7.8 (n=6) were adjusted by increasing bicarbonate concentration without changing pCO(2), while pH 8.2 was reached either with normal pCO(2) (n=8) or with zero CO(2) (n=9). pH 7.1 was created by doubling pCO(2) (n=22) or reducing bicarbonate (n=21), while acid pH of 6.9 (high pCO(2) and low bicarbonate) led to erratic measurements in the interface setup. Alkalotic conditions did not improve electrophysiological stability of the tissue, and pH 8.2 impeded the recovery of evoked potentials. Hypercarbic pH 7.1 led to significantly longer latency of depolarization while the same pH with lowered bicarbonate did not. Evoked potentials, however, recovered only partially after ischemia at hypercarbic pH 7.1. Once the tissue had recovered from anoxic depolarization at control pH, hypercarbic acidosis did not have any further protective effect when ischemia simulation was repeated (n=12). These results do not strengthen the concept of hyperventilation in intensive care, while they suggest a potential of hypercarbia within broader strategies delaying the onset of secondary brain damage.
