Electrically evoked hippocampal afterdischarges are used as a model of partial epileptic seizures with a complex symptomatology and for testing anticonvulsants and toxic substances. Stimulating electrodes were implanted in the dorsal hippocampus of 16 laboratory rats and when the animals had recovered they were stimulated (15-s series, 8 Hz, pulse length 1 ms) with a voltage double the threshold value for a tissue response. The following features of the evoked afterdischarge were evaluated: the duration of the first phase of the afterdischarge, the duration of the non-active interphase, the duration of the second phase and the number of "wet dog shakes" (a constant accompaniment of hippocampal afterdischarges). Localization of the electrodes in the CA1 (n = 7) and CA3 (n = 7) region of the hippocampus made no difference to these parameters and in both cases the measured and evaluated data were the same. The afterdischarges were always accompanied by a marked orientation reaction. The study showed that when using macroelectrodes to stimulate the dorsal hippocampus, their localization in the CA1/CA3 is not of critical importance.
