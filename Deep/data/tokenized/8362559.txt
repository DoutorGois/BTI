The participation and the role of the brain formations in the genesis of emotional reactions of higher animals and man are discussed according to E.A. Asratian's concept of the nervous centre as a complex of brain structures, situated in different areas of the central nervous system, comprising the total morpho-functional unity and realizing a definite specific function. The data are given testifying that the frontal and temporal areas of the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus are correspondingly connected with reflecting-estimating, compensatory, transferring and reinforcing functions of emotions. The reinforcing function is phylogenetically the most ancient. It is connected with solution of the universal behavioural task of maximization-minimization of the appeared emotion, striving for "to" or "from". Replacing and transferring functions have been formed later, while reflecting-estimating one is the most young. It namely provides the wealth and diversity of emotions, based on complicated vital, social and cognitive needs. Such succession coincides with the evolution of the corresponding brain formations, with their phylogenetic age.
