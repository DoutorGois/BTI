The effects of various protein kinase inhibitors on acetylcholine release from the rat hippocampus induced by the local application of NS-3 (montirelin hydrate, CG-3703), a thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogue, into the medial septum-diagonal band were examined using in vivo microdialysis. Perfusion of NS-3 (1 microM) into the medial septum-diagonal band for 20 min produced a pronounced and prolonged increase in the hippocampal acetylcholine efflux. Pretreatment of the medial septum-diagonal band with either K-252a, a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor, or selective protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 almost completely blocked the acetylcholine efflux evoked by NS-3, and selective protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C inhibited the action of NS-3. On the other hand, NS-3 (0.1-10 microM) or TRH (1-100 microM) increased the cyclic AMP efflux from the medial septum-diagonal band in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured by microdialysis. These findings suggest that protein kinases A and C in the neurons of the medial septum-diagonal band are involved in the mechanism of the prolonged stimulation of acetylcholine release from the hippocampus induced by thyrotropin-releasing hormone and its analogue, NS-3.
