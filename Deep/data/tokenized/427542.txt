Interhemispheric transfer of discriminations of brightness and direction of movement, two types of stimuli which may be processed by midbrain visual areas, was compared to transfer of control patterns in cats with sections of the optic chiasm and forebrain commissures. Transfer in these split-brain cats was further compared to transfer in partially split-brain cats with sparing of either the splenium of the corpus callosum or the anterior commissure. An intact splenium was necessary for high levels of interhemispheric transfer of all of the discriminations, which implies a prominant role for cortical mechanisms in such tasks. However, animals with complete section of the corpus callosum often showed partial interocular transfer of both brightness and movement discriminations, which may reflect a limited but selective participation of subcortical areas in visual perception. Cats in which the anterior commissure was spared did not show greater transfer on any of these tasks than did cats with section of both callosum and anterior commissure.
