The hippocampus receives major noradrenergic and serotoninergic (5-HT) innervations which interact with corticosteroid-sensitive cells. However, the subregional localization of these actions and the corticosteroid receptor types involved have not been defined and current ligand binding techniques for estimating corticosteroid receptors are hampered by several methodological limitations. We have developed in situ hybridization histochemical techniques to allow specific and sensitive estimation of glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) mRNA expression in rat hippocampus. Investigation of the effects of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions of 5-HT neurons showed significantly reduced GR and MR mRNA expression in some hippocampal subregions. Both abnormal 5-HT neurotransmission and excessive corticosteroid secretion are associated with major affective disorder, particularly depression. The crucial interaction between these two systems may occur, at least in part, at the level of regulation of hippocampal corticosteroid receptor expression.
