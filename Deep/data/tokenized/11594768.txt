Islet antigen (IA)-2 is a novel autoantigen of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), and belongs to a new class within the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family characterized by lack of PTP enzymatic activity with conventional substrates. Its expression is restricted primarily to the pancreas, pituitary, and brain with the highest level in the brain. IA-2 mRNA expressions in the brain, pituitary and pancreas of 1-, 4-, and 8-week-old mice were examined. In situ hybridization of the brain revealed that IA-2 mRNA was expressed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, choroid plexus, hypothalamus, Purkinje cells, and granular layer of the cerebellum. In the pituitary, IA-2 mRNA was located in the anterior and posterior pituitary by in situ hybridization. The pattern of IA-2 mRNA expression in normal male mouse brain at 1, 4, and 8 weeks of age by the Northern blot analysis was similar to that in the pituitary by RT-PCR analysis. The expression level was higher at 4 weeks and lower at 1 week of age. In the pancreas, IA-2 mRNA expressions detected by RT-PCR were highest at 8 weeks of age. These results indicated that the amount of mRNA expression increased in accordance to development in brain, pituitary, and pancreas.
