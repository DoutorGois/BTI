Clustering of Lewy bodies (LB) was studied in four regions of the medial temporal lobe in 12 cases of dementia with LB (DLB). LB exhibited clustering in 67/70 (96%) brain areas analysed. In 34/70 (49%) analyses, LB were present in a single large cluster > or = 6400 microns in diameter, in 33/70 (47%) LB occurred in smaller clusters 200-3200 microns in diameter which exhibited a regular periodicity relative to the tissue boundary and in 3/70 (4%), LB were randomly distributed. A regular pattern of LB clusters was observed equally frequently in the cortex and hippocampus, in upper and lower cortical laminae and in 'pure' cases of DLB with negligible Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology compared with cases of AD with DLB. In cortical regions, there was no significant correlation between LB cluster size in the upper and lower cortical laminae. The regular periodicity of LB clusters suggests that LB develop in relation to the cells of origin of specific cortico-cortical and cortico-hippocampal projections.
