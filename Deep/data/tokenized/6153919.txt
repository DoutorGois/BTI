The neuroanatomical organization of the efferent connections of the septal area in the cat was analyzed by the use of anterograde ([3H]leucine radioautography) and retrograde (horseradish peroxidase histochemistry) tracing techniques. The results indicate that the lateral septal nucleus projects to the nuclei of the diagonal band, preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, and supramammillary region. The projections of the septofimbrial nucleus supply the nuclei of the diagonal band and the medial habenular nucleus. Projection targets of the vertical limb of the diagonal band are widespread and include the preoptic area, lateral hypothalamus, anterior limbic cortex, amygdala, medial habenular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus and hippocampal formation. The projection from the vertical limb to the hippocampal formation is organized in a topographical manner in such a fashion that cells positioned near the midline project to the dorsal hippocampus and adjoining subicular cortex while fibers originating from cells situated more laterally project to more ventral parts of the hippocampal formation. In general, the projections from the horizontal limb were similar to those from the vertical limb, but several differences were noted. Fibers arising from the horizontal limb are distributed to the ventral tegmental area and interpeduncular nucleus but this region seems to lack a projection to either the habenular complex or to the ventral aspect of the hippocampal formation. Fibers arising from the bed nucleus of the anterior commissure are distributed to the preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, supramammillary region, posterior aspect of the medial mammillary nucleus and lateral habenular nucleus.
