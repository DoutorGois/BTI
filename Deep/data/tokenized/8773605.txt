We studied 10 medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients prior to surgery using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to localize seizure foci. We found significantly elevated creatine/N-acetylaspartate (Cr/NAA) unilaterally in 8 and bilaterally in 2 patients. Five patients have been studied again 1 year after surgery. In the 2 patients with bilateral temporal seizure onsets, MRSI showed normalization of Cr/NAA in the unoperated contralateral tissue following surgical elimination of seizures. This study suggests that metabolic recovery can occur in contralateral temporal areas following surgical treatment of partial epilepsy.
