We have isolated a novel cDNA, vesl, that was induced during convulsive seizure in the rat hippocampus. The vesl gene encodes a protein of 186 amino acids that has significant homology to the EVH1 domain of the VASP/Ena family of proteins implicated in the control of microfilament dynamics. The expression of vesl mRNA was induced in the granule cell layer during persistent long-term potentiation (LTP) of the dentate gyrus in an NMDA receptor-dependent manner. Furthermore, vesl mRNA was expressed at a high level during hippocampal synaptogenesis. We suggest that the Vesl protein may be involved in the structural changes that occur at synapses during long-lasting neuronal plasticity and development.
