Recent studies indicate that Tau phosphorylation can be modulated by the compound FTY720-P, a global sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) agonist. The present work compared the effects of more selective S1PR agonists on Tau properties, using rat hippocampal slices as model system. Whereas Tau phosphorylation was not modified by the S1PR3 agonist CYM5541, Tau-Ser262 phosphorylation was significantly decreased by treatment with the S1PR1 agonist SEW2871. This effect appears to be quite restricted, as no changes in phosphorylation were elicited by the agonist on Tau-Ser199/202, Tau-Ser396 and Tau-Ser404 residues. In terms of molecular mechanisms, it is proposed that SEW2871-induced reduction of Tau-Ser262 phosphorylation depends on AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha) inactivation via a pathway requiring AMPKalpha dephosphorylation at Thr172 by the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).
