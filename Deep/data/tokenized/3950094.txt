Neurotensin-containing neurons in the hedgehog and sheep central nervous system were studied immunohistochemically. In both species, mapping of neurotensin neurons was achieved only after pretreatment with colchicine injected intracerebroventricularly 2 days prior to perfusion. Bipolar or multipolar neurotensin neurons, 10-30 micron in diameter, were observed in the following regions of the central nervous system of both species: medial amygdaloid nucleus, lateral septal nucleus, interstitial nucleus of the stria terminals, caudate nucleus, preoptic area, and hypothalamus. On the contrary, while immunoreactive neurons were found in the central amygdaloid nucleus, nucleus accumbens, nucleus of the diagonal band, subthalamus, superior central nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, central gray substance of the pons, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord of the hedgehog, respective regions of the sheep appeared to be devoid of immunoreactive perikarya. Also, in some regions, namely the hippocampal formation, the central gray substance of the midbrain, the locus coeruleus, and the nucleus of the solitary tract, neurotensin neurons were found exclusively in the latter species. The existence of these differences in the distribution pattern of neurotensin-immunoreactive neurons between the two species as well as between them and others already examined is briefly discussed.
