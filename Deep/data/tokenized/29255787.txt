Introduction: We present findings of a novel and ecologically relevant associative memory test, the Object Location Touchscreen Test (OLTT), which was posited as sensitive to early medial temporal lobe compromise associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: A total of 114 participants, including healthy young and older controls and patients with MCI, completed the OLTT and standard neuropsychological testing. The OLTT required participants to recall the location of objects under free and cued recall conditions, with accuracy evaluated using distance measures (i.e., a continuous error score), and a standard recognition format. Correlations between performance and volumetric data were evaluated from a subset of 77 participants. Results: Significant age effects were dwarfed by MCI effects across all test conditions. OLTT Cued Recall was strongly and specifically related to the volume of disease-relevant medial temporal lobe regions, generally more than traditional memory tests. Discussion: The OLTT may be sensitive to early structural compromise in regions affected by Alzheimer's disease.
