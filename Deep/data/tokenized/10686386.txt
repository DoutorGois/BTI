In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factors during brain aging. We provide the first evidence that NeuroD and ME2 are differentially expressed during brain aging. Modulation of their expression is specific to distinct areas of the aging brain. NeuroD expression is sustained at high levels in aging cerebellum, whereas it severely declines in aging hippocampus. In contrast, the bHLH E-protein ME2 remains expressed in both aged cerebellum and hippocampus, although at lower levels. These observations support the idea that a shift in the transcriptional dynamics controlling gene expression is associated with the progressive functional decline observed during brain aging.
