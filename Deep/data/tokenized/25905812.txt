For a long time, the mammalian brain has been perceived to be a static organ. However, the discovery of adult neurogenesis in most mammalian species, including humans, monkeys, and rodents, has disrupted this view. As this continuous regeneration has an effect on established behavioral patterns, it holds promising therapeutic potential. However, before harnessing this potential regenerative power, we must understand what effects new neurons have on existing brain circuits. Ongoing research contributes to several important steps toward bridging the gap between adult-born neurons, circuits, and behavior. The study of adult neurogenesis in different neurogenic regions from a systems neuroscience perspective will pave the way to understanding how it supports adaptive behavior and why its dysfunction correlates with some human brain disorders.
