OBJECTIVES: The study aims to investigate the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtypes in mediating the inhibitory effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (fluoxetine on brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (bdnf) expression in rat hippocampus. METHODS: In situ hybridization was used for regional determination of bdnf expression levels in hippocampal brain slices from normal, lesioned (5-hydroxytryptamine or noradrenaline) or adrenalectomized rats; treated with fluoxetine and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine selective ligands. KEY FINDINGS: Our study shows that the transient fluoxetine-induced down-regulation of bdnf gene expression depends on an intact 5-hydroxytryptamine but not noradrenaline system or circulating glucocorticoids. Pretreatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist SB-204070 blocked the overall fluoxetine-induced inhibition of bdnf levels in hippocampus, while pretreatment with the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 antagonists ketanserin had an effect in the CA3 but not in the dentate gyrus sub-region of hippocampus. The 5-hydroxytryptamine1A antagonist WAY-100635 and the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 antagonist granisetron were both ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found strong support for a primary effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine but not noradrenaline or circulating glucocorticoids in the mediation of fluoxetine-induced down-regulation of bdnf expression. More specifically, we also show that 5-hydroxytryptamine4 receptor-stimulation seems to play a pivotal role in this effect.
