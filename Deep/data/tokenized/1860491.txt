The composition of free fatty acids of lipids in different rat brain structures (the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and midbrain) in neurosis was studied by the gas chromatographic analysis. The difference in their spectra was established. A pronounced increase of arachidonic acid content in the cortex (by 120%, p less than 0.01) and a statistically significant elevation of linolic acid level in all studied structures were noted. The levels of pentadecanoic and myristic acids were also changed. In neurosis diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, 40 minutes before the investigation) produced a decrease in the brain cortex of levels of arachidonic, oleic and myristic acids. In the hippocampus the contents of oleic and myristic acids increased. Less pronounced changes were found in the striatum and midbrain.
