Systemically administered opiates inhibit or excite spontaneously active single units of the nucleus accumbens septi (NAS) but do not affect fimbria-evoked NAS responses. However, microinjections of morphine to the dopamine cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area (VTA-M) do inhibit these evoked responses. Since systemic heroin can reverse the inhibitory effect of VTA-M on the fimbria-evoked NAS responses, systemic opiates might exert actions on other brain regions that oppose the inhibitory effect of VTA-M on the NAS. Evidence is provided indicating that this opposing action can arise from opiate actions at the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus.
