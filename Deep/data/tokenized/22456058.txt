Neuronal migration plays a central role in the formation of the brain, and deficits in this process can lead to aberrant brain function and subsequent disease. Neuronal migration is a complex process that involves the interaction of the neuron with the surrounding environmental milieu, and as such involves both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Studies performed in rodent models to investigate the formation of brain structures have provided key insights into how neuronal migration is coordinated during development. Within the cerebral cortex, glutamatergic neurons derived from the cortical ventricular zone migrate radially into the cortical plate, whereas interneurons derived within the ventrally located ganglionic eminences migrate tangentially into the cortex. Within the embryonic cerebellum, cerebellar granule neuron progenitors migrate from the rhombic lip over the surface of the cerebellar anlage, before differentiating and migrating radially into the internal granule layer of the cerebellum perinatally. In this review, we focus on one family of proteins, the nuclear factor I transcription factors, and review our understanding of how these molecules contribute to the formation of the hippocampus and the cerebellum via the regulation of neuronal migration.
