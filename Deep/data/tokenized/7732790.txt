The topographic distribution of brain atrophy was quantified by image analysis of fixed coronal brain slices from four patients dying with cortical Lewy body disease (CLBD) all with Alzheimer-type pathology and compared to that in four other patients of similar age and gender dying with Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone. The pattern of atrophy in CLBD (+AD) was broadly similar to that in AD alone, suggesting that tissue loss was due mostly to parallel Alzheimer-type pathological changes and that the presence of Lewy bodies in cortical and subcortical neurons contributed little, if anything, to the overall degree of atrophy.
