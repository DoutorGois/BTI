We report pilomotor seizures in two patients who had piloerection or gooseflesh spreading in a pattern like the 'Jacksonian march', confined ipsilaterally to the lesion side. The first patient presented this in conjunction with complex partial seizures. Left anterior temporal lobectomy abolished pilomotor and other seizures. Pathological study demonstrated hippocampal sclerosis. A meningioma near the left sphenoid region, incompletely removed, is the likely cause of pilomotor seizures in the second patient. Carbamazepine reduced these attacks. To our knowledge, hippocampal sclerosis and meningioma have never been linked to pilomotor seizures.
