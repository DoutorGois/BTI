Long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus has been investigated in great detail over the past 40 years. Where and how LTP is actually expressed, however, remain controversial issues. Considerable evidence has been offered to support both pre- and postsynaptic contributions to LTP expression. Though it is widely held that postsynaptic expression mechanisms are the primary contributors to LTP expression, evidence for that conclusion is amenable to alternative explanations. Here, we briefly review some key contributions to the 'locus' debate and describe data that support a dominant role for presynaptic mechanisms. Recognition of the state-dependency of expression mechanisms, and consideration of the consequences of the spatial relationship between postsynaptic glutamate receptors and presynaptic vesicular release sites, lead to a model that may reconcile views from both sides of the synapse.
