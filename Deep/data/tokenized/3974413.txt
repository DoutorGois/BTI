Because of the similarity in the pattern of limbic sites damaged by both compounds, it has been suggested that trimethyltin (TMT) may be an excitotoxin like kainic acid (KA). KA produces seizures which eventually result in neuronal damage similar to that found in epilepsy. Anticonvulsants reduce both the seizures and pathology associated with KA. Because TMT may also produce seizures, we undertook to determine whether or not some of the TMT-induced limbic neuropathology could result from seizure activity. To do this, a single dose of TMT chloride (either 7.5 or 15 mg/kg) was given per os to rats, and then phenobarbital (30 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously in repeated doses. Treatment with phenobarbital did not prevent pathologic changes in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and pyriform or prepyriform cortex. Since phenobarbital did not protect against TMT-induced neuronal damage, as it has been reported by others to protect against KA-induced damage, the present findings suggest that these two toxicants probably produce hippocampal pathology via different mechanisms and that the TMT-induced pathologic changes do not require sustained electrical seizure activity.
