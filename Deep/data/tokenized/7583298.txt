A sensitive Western blotting technique, using a commercially available antibody, was developed herein to study glucocorticoid receptor (GR) autoregulation in brain tissue. A prominent immunoreactive band at approximately 94 kDa, representing the GR, was observed in soluble fractions prepared from rat hippocampus whereas two bands (approximately 97 and 94 kDa) were detected in frontal cortex preparations. Four-day adrenalectomy significantly increased immunoreactive GR levels in both brain regions. In contrast, adrenalectomized animals implanted with corticosterone pellets of varying concentrations displayed dose-dependent decreases in immunodetectable GR levels. Radioligand binding assays ([3H]dexamethasone +/- RU 28362), performed on these same tissue preparations, revealed a similar pattern of GR response to that measured by Western blotting. However, changes in GR binding capacity were generally greater in magnitude than corresponding changes in immunoreactive GR levels. This discrepancy was most pronounced in adrenalectomized animals administered a bolus of corticosterone 1 h prior to sacrifice where a 60-70% reduction in receptor binding sites occurred, in sharp contrast to the 25-30% decrease in immunoreactive GR levels. Taken together, our findings suggest that Western blotting can be used to study GR regulation in brain tissue and that changes in steroid-binding capacity may not necessarily reflect changes in receptor protein levels.
