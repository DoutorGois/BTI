BACKGROUND: At synapses between neurons in the brain, transmitter molecules are released from presynaptic terminals in multi-molecular packets called quanta. Excitatory synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus show a long-lasting increase in strength known as long-term potentiation (LTP), which may be important for some kinds of learning and memory. LTP can involve an increase in the number of quanta released, or in the size of the response each quantum produces in the postsynaptic cell, or both, depending on the initial condition of the synapse. These synapses also show two forms of brief potentiation: post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), which lasts for a minute or less and involves only modifications at the presynaptic terminal, and short-term potentiation (STP), which lasts rather longer. The significance of STP, the mechanisms whereby it is produced and its relationship to other forms of potentiation are poorly understood. We have studied STP electrophysiologically using slices of the rat hippocampus maintained in vitro. RESULTS: We found that STP, like LTP, can involve increases in either the number of quanta released, or their postsynaptic effect, or both. The rule governing the relative contribution from these two mechanisms appears to be the same as operates during LTP. Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic changes can develop equally rapidly and so must involve fast-acting messenger systems. CONCLUSIONS: STP seems to be a separate phenomenon from PTP, but appears closely related to LTP. The rapidity of its onset may require a reappraisal of current understanding of the messenger systems involved in bringing about changes in synaptic strength.
