Rapid modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity through synaptic estrogen receptors is an essential topic. We analyzed estradiol-induced modulation of CA1 dendritic spines using adult male ERalphaKO and ERbetaKO mice. A 2h treatment of estradiol particularly increased the density of middle-head spines (diameter 0.3-0.4 microm) in wild type mouse hippocampal slices. The enhancement of spinogenesis was completely suppressed by MAP kinase inhibitor. Estradiol-induced increase in middle-head spines was observed in ERbetaKO mice (which express ERalpha), but not in ERalphaKO, indicating that ERalpha is necessary for the spinogenesis. Direct observation of the dynamic estradiol-induced enhancing effect on rapid spinogenesis was performed using time-lapse imaging of spines in hippocampal live slices from yellow fluorescent protein expressed mice. Both appearance and disappearance of spines occurred, and the number of newly appeared spines was significantly greater than that of disappeared spines, resulting in the net increase of the spine density within 2h. As another type of synaptic modulation, we observed that estradiol rapidly enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced long-term depression (LTD) in CA1 of the wild type mouse hippocampus. In contrast, estradiol did not enhance NMDA-LTD in ERalphaKO mice, indicating the involvement of ERalpha in the estrogen signaling.
