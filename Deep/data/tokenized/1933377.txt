The effect of local pressure application of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) in the synaptic layer of CA1 pyramidal cells was investigated in the guinea pig hippocampal slice preparation using extracellular recording technique. Application of NMDA produced a transient depression and a subsequent 30-60 min potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) seen as an increase of the initial slope and amplitude of the EPSP. The increase in amplitude was consistently greater than that of the initial slope. Prior tetanization that caused saturation of long-term potentiation prevented the generation of an NMDA-induced potentiation of the initial slope for more than 1-2 h, but not the generation of an increase of the amplitude.
