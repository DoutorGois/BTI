The major excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain is glutamate (GLU). GLU release from nerve terminals is both calcium-dependent and -independent, yet these mechanisms of release are not fully understood. Potassium, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and veratrine are commonly used depolarizing agents that were studied for their ability to stimulate GLU efflux from brain slices. These agents produced significant regional variations in GLU efflux from rat brain slices. Potassium was the most potent of the three secretogogues tested. 4-AP produced a significant GLU efflux only in the cerebellum. Veratrine produced consistent stimulation of GLU efflux from all brain regions tested. Potassium was the only depolarizing agent tested that stimulated GLU release from primary astroglial cultures of rat cerebral cortex. All three agents also demonstrated an ability to inhibit GLU reuptake in brain slice preparations. This data suggest that both GLU release and uptake are modulated in a regionally selective manner, and that commonly used depolarizing agents affect not only calcium-dependent neuronal release, but also uptake and glial responses.
