The membrane glycoproteins gE and gI are encoded by pseudorabies virus (PRV), a neurotropic, broad-host-range alphaherpesvirus of swine. PRV gE and gI are required for anterograde spread to a restricted set of retinorecipient neurons in the brain after infection of the rat retina. A related alphaherpesvirus, encoding gE and gI homologs, is called bovine herpesvirus 1.1 (BHV-1.1). BHV-1.1 is a respiratory pathogen of highly restricted host range and, in contrast to PRV, is unable to propagate in or cause disease in rodents. We have shown previously that the BHV-1.1 gE and gI proteins are capable of complementing the virulence functions of PRV gE and gI in a rodent model (A. C. Knapp and L. W. Enquist, J. Virol. 71:2731-2739, 1997). We examined the ability of the BHV-1.1 gE and gI homologs to direct circuit-specific invasion of the rat central nervous system by PRV. Both complete open reading frames were cloned into a PRV mutant lacking the PRV gE and gI genes. Recombinant viruses were analyzed for the ability to invade the rat brain after infection of the retina. Surprisingly, in a portion of the animals tested, the BHV-1.1 gE and gI proteins functioned autonomously to promote spread of PRV to a subset of retinorecipient regions of the brain. First, the presence of BHV-1.1 gI alone, but not PRV gI alone, promoted viral invasion of the optic tectum. Second, expression of BHV-1.1 gE alone facilitated PRV infection of a subset of neurons in the hippocampus not normally infected by PRV. When both BHV-1.1 proteins were expressed in a coinfection, all retinorecipient regions of the rat brain were infected. Therefore, depending on the viral source, homologs of gE and gI differentially affect spread between synaptically connected neurons in the rat.
