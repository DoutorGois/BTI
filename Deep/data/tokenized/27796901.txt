It is well proved already that neurogenesis does take place in mammals' brain, including human brain. However, neurogenesis by itself is not able to compensate for brain tissue loss in serious neurological diseases, such as stroke, brain trauma or neurodegenerative disorders. Recent evidences show that neural stem cell niches are present not only in classical locations, such as subventricularor subgranular zones, but in other areas as well, including tissues contiguous to the brain (meninges and choroid plexus).In this chapter we revise the relationship of neural stem cells with interstitial cells (mainly telocytes), which we think is significant, and we describe what is known about the juxtacerebral tissue neurogenesis potential.
