Effect of minaprine on hypoxia- or hypoxia/hypoglycemia (ischemia)-induced impairment of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake by rat hippocampal slices was evaluated. Since minaprine was found to possess both a stimulating effect on acetylcholine release and a blocking effect on 5-HT2 receptors, the improving effect of minaprine on impaired 2DG uptake was compared to the findings obtained with oxotremorine, ketanserin and pentobarbital. Hippocampal slices were exposed to 20-min ischemia, and then these slices were returned to oxygenated and glucose-containing buffer for 6 hr. Ischemia reduced 30 mM KCl-induced 2DG uptake by the hippocampus. Pretreatment with minaprine, oxotremorine, pentobarbital and ketanserin attenuated the ischemia-induced decline of 2DG uptake. In addition, minaprine, oxotremorine and pentobarbital relatively recovered the increase of 2DG uptake in the hippocampal slices under hypoxia for 45 min. The present results suggest that minaprine exerts a neuroprotective action against ischemia-induced deficit of energy metabolism in vitro.
