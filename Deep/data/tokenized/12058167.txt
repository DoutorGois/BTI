ZNC(C)PR can facilitate the learning and memory in rat. Transgenic experiments have revealed that long-term memory depended on cyclic AMP-response element binding protein, CREB. CREB phosphorylation at serine-133 is essential for it's transcriptional activity. Here, it was demonstrated that ZNC(C)PR could induce CREB phosphorylation at serine-133 in both rat hippocampus and rat hippocampus slices. ZDC(C)PR antagnist of ZNC(C)PR , PTX(inhibitor of G(o)/G(I) protein coupled receptor), GF109203x(inhihitor of PKC), PD98059( inhibitor of MAPK ) but not KN-62(inhibitor of CaMKII) could inhibit the phosphorylation of CREB induced by ZNC(C)PR.
