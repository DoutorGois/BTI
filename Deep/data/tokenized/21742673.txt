The purpose of the present study was to characterize the expressions of phosphorylated Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (p-CaMK-II), total CaMK-II, and L-type Ca(2+) channel in offspring hippocampus that was induced by prenatal restraint stress. Pregnant rats were divided into two groups: the control group and the prenatal stress (PNS) group. Pregnant rats in the PNS group were exposed to restraint stress on day 14-20 of pregnancy three times daily for 45 min. Adult offspring rats were used in this study. The results demonstrated that prenatal restraint stress induced a significant increase in the expression of p-CaMK-II, total CaMK-II, and L-Ca(2+) channel by western blot analysis in offspring hippocampus. The immunohistochemistry results revealed that PNS increased the expressions of CaMK-II and L-Ca(2+) channel in the hippocampal CA3 of offspring rats. These data suggest that PNS can have long-term neuronal effects within hippocampal structure involved in the feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.
