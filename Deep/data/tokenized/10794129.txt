In order to characterize the possible regulation of taurine release by GABAergic terminals, the effects of several agonists and antagonists of GABA receptors on the basal and K+-stimulated release of [3H]taurine were investigated in hippocampal slices from adult (3-month-old) and developing (7-day-old) mice using a superfusion system. Taurine release was concentration-dependently potentiated by GABA, which effect was reduced by phaclofen, saclofen and (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) at both ages, suggesting regulation by both GABA(B) and GABA(C) receptors. The involvement of GABA(A) receptors could not be excluded since the antagonist bicuculline was able to affect both basal and K+-evoked taurine release. Furthermore, several GABA(B) receptor effectors were able to inhibit K+-stimulated taurine release in the adults, while the GABA(C) receptor agonists trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (TACA) and cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA) potentiated this release. The potentiation of taurine release by agents acting on the three types of GABA receptors in both adult and developing hippocampus further indicates the involvement of transporters operating in an outward direction. This inference is corroborated by the moderate but significant inhibition of taurine uptake by the same compounds.
