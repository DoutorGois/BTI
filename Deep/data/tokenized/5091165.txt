Tritiated Delta(1)-tetrahydrocannabinol was injected intraperitoneally into rats and its distribution measured in the brain for up to 30 days after administration. The results showed that there was no selective distribution in any one area of the brain. The maximum levels of radioactivity occurred 1 h after the injection of the tetrahydrocannabinol, thereafter the levels fell very slowly, with demonstrable activity still present at the end of 30 days.
