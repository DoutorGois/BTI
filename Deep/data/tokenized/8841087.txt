The effect of chronic administration of naltrexone, an opioid receptor antagonist, on the activity of the dopamine transporter in brain regions and spinal cord was determined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a pellet containing 10 mg naltrexone for 7 days. Rats serving as controls were implanted with a placebo pellet. Two groups of rats were used. In one, the pellets were left intact, and in the other they were removed 16 h prior to sacrificing. The dopamine transporter was labeled with [3H]GBR 12935. The binding of [3H]GBR 12935 in rats in which naltrexone pellets were left intact was decreased by 63 and 31% in corpus striatum and spinal cord, respectively, when compared to placebo pellet implanted controls. The decrease in binding in the striatum was due to changes in the Bmax value of [3H]GBR 12935; the Kd values did not differ. In hypothalamus, pons-medulla, hippocampus, midbrain, cortex, and amygdala of naltrexone and placebo pellet implanted rats, the binding of [3H]GBR 12935 did not differ. In naltrexone-treated rats from which pellets had been removed, the binding of [3H]GBR 12935 was decreased in hippocampus, amygdala, and spinal cord by 68, 77, and 61%, respectively, in comparison with tissues from the control rats. The results indicate that chronic blockade of opioid receptors results in downregulation of dopamine transporter in selected brain regions and spinal cord.
