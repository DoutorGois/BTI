BACKGROUND/AIMS: The beta amyloid aggregations present in Alzheimer's disease affect neurons through various toxic alterations. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (an accelerator of vitamin D catabolism), and the L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channel A1C (LVSCC-A1C) in hippocampal neurons in response to beta amyloid and vitamin D treatments to test the protective effects of vitamin D and the probable effects of beta amyloid on vitamin D catabolism. METHODS: The expression of the VDR, 24-hydroxylase (24OHase) and LVSCC-A1C mRNAs were studied using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the cytotoxicity levels were determined by an ELISA in primary hippocampal neuron cultures prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat embryos. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that beta amyloid suppressed the expression of VDR mRNA and induced the expression of 24OHase and LVSCC-A1C mRNAs. CONCLUSION: Beta amyloid may disrupt the vitamin D-VDR pathway and cause defective utilization of vitamin D by suppressing the level of the VDR and elevating the level of 24OHase.
