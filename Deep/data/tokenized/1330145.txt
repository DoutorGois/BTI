Ultrastructural investigations of different parts of rat brain after diazepam administration revealed benzodiazepine receptors on the neuronal surface and plasma membrane of astrocytes of the sensorimotor cortex, hippocampus and central grey substance. Subsuperficial cisternae that replenish deficit of plasma membrane required for coated vesicles formation were only seen in the neurons and were absent from the astrocytes. The fate of internalized diazepam in the nerve and glial cells were different: in the neurons, ligand is destroyed in lysosomes and multivesicular bodies, while in the astrocytes, exceptionally in lysosomes.
