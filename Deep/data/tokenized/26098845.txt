In tests of spatial ability, males outperform females both in rats and in humans. The mechanism underlying this gender differential learning ability and memory in spatial tasks remains unknown. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is considered the basis for spatial learning and memory. The aims of this work were (a) to assess spatial learning and memory in male and female rats in the radial and Morris mazes; (b) to assess whether basal synaptic activity and LTP in the hippocampus are different in male and female rats; and (c) to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for the gender differences in LTP. We analyzed in young male and female rats (a) performance in spatial tasks in the radial and Morris water mazes; (b) basal synaptic activity in hippocampal slices; and (c) LTP and some mechanisms modulating its magnitude. The results reported allow us to conclude that female rats show larger AMPA receptor-mediate synaptic responses under basal conditions, likely due to enhanced phosphorylation of GluR2 in Ser880 and increased amounts of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors in postsynaptic densities. In contrast, the magnitude of tetanus-induced LTP was lower in females than in males. This is due to reduced activation of soluble guanylate cyclase and the formation of cGMP, leading to lower activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylation of GluR1 in Ser845, which results in lower insertion of AMPA receptors in the synaptic membrane and a lower magnitude of LTP. These mechanisms may contribute to the reduced performance of females in the radial and Morris water mazes.
