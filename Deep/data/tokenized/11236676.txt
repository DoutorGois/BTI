AIM: To study the effects of hypoxic-preconditioning on anoxia-tolerance and IL-1 beta expression in cultured rat hippocampal neurons after anoxia. METHODS: 12 day cultured hippocampal neurons in control and hypoxic-preconditioning group were exposed to anoxic environment(0.9 L/LN2 + 0.1 L/LCO2) for 2, 4, 8 and 12 h. The neurons were immunocytochemically stained using the anti-serum against rhIL-1 beta, The number of survival neurons and the mean optical density (OD) of IL-1 beta expression were investigated. RESULTS: The morphological changes and IL-1 beta expression induced by acute anoxia in hypoxic-preconditioning neurons were significantly less than those in control. The number of survival neurons was higher in the hypoxia-preconditioning group than that in control group after acute hypoxia. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia-preconditioning can induce the development of anoxia-tolerance in cultured hippocampal neurons. The decreased IL-1 beta in hippocampal neurons may be an adaptive reaction to acute anoxia.
