A new radiocytochemical technique is reported for ultrastructural localization of diffusible substances, using negatively stained ultra-cryostat sections. A sheet of film interposed between the cryostat section and the emulsion layer has rendered negative-staining autoradiography (NSA) practical. The rationale of NSA is that the film completely shields the section from all moisture-producing autoradiographic processes, so that phosphotungstic acid (PTA) can stain the section either before or after autoradiography (ARG), without the possibility of ultrastructural damage by alkaline solutions, interference between PTA and photoprocessing compounds, and superimposed images of a gelatin layer stained with PTA. As a model to demonstrate the newly developed procedure of NSA, rat brains were labeled with [125I]-triiodothyronine, fixed with tannic fixative, immersed in a cryoprotectant, frozen in liquefied propane, and cryostat sectioned. The resulting higher yield of radioactivity (85%) on the section was confirmed by a radiation counter. The retention rate was approximately 20% greater than that of conventional sections. Developed silver grains were found on synaptic vesicles and mitochondria in the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus. In this report we will also discuss the problems associated with cryostat sectioning of fresh tissues, the concept of ARG resolution, the distribution pattern of developed silver grains, and the possible applications of NSA.
