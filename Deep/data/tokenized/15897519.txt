This paper reports a 59 year old woman with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Her brain magnetic resonance imaging scan showed bilateral posterior thalamic hyperintensities, similar to the "pulvinar sign". Her symptoms included progressive psychiatric disturbance and resembled the initial symptoms of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Clinicians should consider this treatable disorder in the differential diagnosis of vCJD.
