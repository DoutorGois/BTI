The extent to which regenerative action potentials invade hippocampal CA1 pyramidal dendrites is dependent on both recent activity and distance from the soma. Previously, we have shown that the amplitude of back-propagating dendritic action potentials can be increased by activating either protein kinase A (PKA) or protein kinase C (PKC) and a subsequent depolarizing shift in the activation curve for dendritic K+ channels. Physiologically, an increase in intracellular PKA and PKC would be expected upon activation of beta-adrenergic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively. Accordingly, we report here that activation of either of these neurotransmitter systems results in an increase in dendritic action-potential amplitude. Activation of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system, which is also expected to raise intracellular adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and PKA levels, increased action-potential amplitude in only a subpopulation of neurons tested.
