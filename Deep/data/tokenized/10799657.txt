L-Deprenyl, an irreversible MAO-B (monoamine oxidase B, EC 1.4.3.4) inhibitor, is used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and to delay the progression of Alzheimer's disease. L-Deprenyl also exhibits protective effects against neuronal apoptosis which are independent of its ability to inhibit MAO-B. The purpose of this study was to compare the antiapoptotic efficacy of L-deprenyl against different types of apoptotic inducers in three neuronal cell culture models. The level of apoptosis was quantified by measuring the activation of caspase-3 enzyme, which is the main apoptotic executioner in neuronal cells. MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase, EC 1. 1.1.27) assays were used to demonstrate the cytotoxic response of apoptotic treatments. Our results showed that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A, induced a prominent increase in caspase-3 activity both in cultured hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons as well as in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, L-deprenyl offered a significant protection against the apoptotic response induced by okadaic acid in all three neuronal models. The best protection appeared at the concentration level of 10(-9) M. L-Deprenyl also provided a protection against apoptosis after AraC (cytosine beta-D-arabinoside) treatment in hippocampal neurons and Neuro-2a cells and after etoposide treatment in Neuro-2a cells. However, L-deprenyl did not offer any protection against apoptosis caused by serum withdrawal or potassium deprivation. Okadaic acid treatment in vivo is known to induce an Alzheimer's type of hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, formation of beta-amyloid plaques, and a severe memory impairment. Our results show that the okadaic acid model provides a promising tool to study the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease and to screen the neuroprotective capacity of L-deprenyl derivatives.
