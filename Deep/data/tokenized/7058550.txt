The content of GABA decreases in the hippocampus and cortex and increases in the medulla oblongata 1 hour after injection of hydrocortisone (5 mg/100 g of mass). At the same time it is shown the decrease in the glutamate decarboxylase activity in homogenates of the hippocampus and medullar oblongata. The content of GABA increases in the hippocampus, medulla oblongata, diencephalon and cerebellum but decreases in the middle brain 4 hours after the hormone injection. The glutamate decarboxylase activity increases in the hippocampus and lowers in the medulla oblongata. On the basis of the calculated value of the excitation coefficient a supposition is made on the hippocampus and medulla oblongata exitation changes under the effect of single hydrocortisone administration.
