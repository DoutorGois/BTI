BACKGROUND: In order to clarify the correlation between morphological characteristics and clinical features in epilepsy patients with unilateral hippocampal abnormality, morphological and morphometric magnetic resonance imaging studies were performed. METHODS: We selected a series of childhood-onset epilepsy patients with unilateral hippocampal abnormality. The volume of hippocampal formation and anterior temporal lobe were measured, and the hippocampal morphology was compared with their clinical features. The morphological characteristics of the hippocampal formation were classified into three groups: group I, diffuse and severe volume reduction of the hippocampal formation and anterior temporal lobe with abnormal signal; group II, focal atrophy or focal abnormal signal in the hippocampal formation; and group III, no significant volume reduction but an enlargement of the temporal horn. RESULTS: All of the patients in group I had a history of status epilepticus in infancy. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was found in three of four patients. Group II contained TLE in three and frontal lobe epilepsy in one. One patient with intractable TLE had a history of status epilepticus in infancy. Group III contained miscellaneous epilepsies, including benign partial epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes in three of seven patients. Five patients in group III showed some characteristic features of hippocampal malrotation, which refers to incomplete hippocampal infolding. CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse and severe volume reduction of the hippocampal formation and anterior temporal lobe with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis was strongly associated with status epilepticus in infancy. Both hippocampal sclerosis and hippocampal malrotation suggest significant roles in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
