Carboxypeptidase A-6 (CPA6) was recently discovered in the human genome. To gain information regarding the potential function of this novel protein, the mouse homolog of CPA6 was identified using a combination of bioinformatics and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, homologs in rat, chicken, and frog were identified using a bioinformatics approach. The distribution of CPA6 mRNA in mouse tissues was examined using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. A strong RT-PCR signal is detectable in olfactory bulb, and much lower levels are present in other regions such as the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, striatum, and medulla. In peripheral tissues, a moderate RT-PCR signal is present in epididymis, and low levels are detectable in colon and spleen. The high level of CPA6 in adult mouse brain olfactory bulb was confirmed by in situ hybridization. Lower levels of CPA6 mRNA were found to be present in the cingulate cortex, lateral septum, pontine nucleus, and inferior olivary nucleus of the hindbrain. Within the olfactory bulb, CPA6 mRNA is enriched in the mitral and granular layer. A lower level of CPA6 mRNA is present in the internal and external plexiform layers, and no signal is detectable in the olfactory nerve layer. The distribution was also examined in whole embryos at embryonic day 14.5 and CPA6 mRNA was found to be enriched in eye, ear, osteoblasts, stomach, skin, dorsal root ganglia, and throughout the CNS. The presence of CPA6 mRNA in the rectus muscle layer of the eye at embryonic day 14.5 is consistent with the observation that the CPA6 gene is disrupted in a patient with Duane syndrome, a congenital eye defect. Taken together, the distribution of CPA6 suggests a specific role in a limited number of tissues, and it is possible that this role involves an aspect of cell migration.
