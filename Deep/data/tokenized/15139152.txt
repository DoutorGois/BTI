OBJECTIVE: To study the mechanism of Shu Di-huang in improving the function of learning and memory. METHOD: On the rats model with thalamic arcuate nucleus dameged by MSG, the improving function of Shu Di-huang on learning and memory was observed by step down task and Morris water maze task, and the expression of c-fos and NGF in hippocampi was observed by immunohistochemical means. RESULT: Shu Di-huang could decrease the times of mistakes and prolong the incubation period in step down task, and shorten the incubation period of seeking the platform, and improve the percentage rate through the platform position in Morris water maze task. Shu Di-huang also increase the expression of hippocampal NGF, c-fos. CONCLUSION: Shu Di-huang can improve the function of learning and memory of MSG rats, and its mechanism may be related with the increase of the expression of hippocampal c-fos and NGF.
