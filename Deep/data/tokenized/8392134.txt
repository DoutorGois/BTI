GABAB binding was performed in rat brain membranes incubated with pertussis toxin (PTX; 7-15 micrograms/mg protein) or vehicle during postnatal development. In peripubertal rats, GABAB binding was reduced by PTX in corpus striatum and hippocampus but not in cortex or cerebellum, while in sexually mature adults binding was reduced in all areas except the corpus striatum. These data may indicate regional differences in the postnatal development of GABAB receptor-G protein linkage.
