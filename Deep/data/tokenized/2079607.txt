Combined lipase deficiency (cld) is a genetic abnormality in mice resulting in the production of enzymatically inactive lipoprotein lipase (LPL). After suckling, these mice have markedly elevated levels of circulating triglyceride. An alteration of LPL gene expression in cld mice may affect the amount and/or the distribution of LPL mRNA in different cell types. Therefore, we performed in situ hybridization for LPL mRNA in tissues from normal and cld pups and adult mice using an antisense 35S-labeled cRNA probe. LPL mRNA had the same pattern of distribution in both cld and normal newborn mice; the probe hybridized strongly to pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, heart myocytes, and hepatocytes. Despite the lack of noticeable fat stores, LPL mRNA was found in the dermal layer of the skin of cld mice and normal littermates. In adult mice, the cRNA probe for LPL hybridized to the hippocampus, to the heart, and to localized areas of the kidney. We conclude that despite great variation in plasma triglyceride levels, LPL gene is similarly expressed in animals with or without LPL activity.
