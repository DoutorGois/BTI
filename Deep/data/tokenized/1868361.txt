The Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) of rats has been selectively bred to have increased sensitivity to cholinergic agonists. However, these rats exhibit altered responsiveness to a number of noncholinergic agents, such as apomorphine, buspirone and ethanol. This study compared the FSL and control Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats in terms of their hyperthermic response to the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor agonist, MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg SC) and their MK-801 binding characteristics. We have found that FSL rats react with a delayed hyperthermia, having a significantly lower hyperthermia for the first 120 min of observation. Thereafter the response does not differ in FSL and FRL rats. Both groups had similar affinities and numbers of [3H]MK-801 binding sites in the hippocampus/cerebral cortex. Pretreatment with scopolamine (1 mg/kg SC) failed to affect MK-801-induced hyperthermia in either line of rats. These findings suggest that selective breeding of FSL rats attenuated the secondary mechanisms involved in the PCP receptor-mediated hyperthermic response. However, by itself cholinergic supersensitivity does not appear to be a major factor in the blunted responsiveness of FSL rats to MK-801.
