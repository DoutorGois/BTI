GABAergic synapses in the granule cell layer of the rat dentate gyrus were examined light and electron microscopically with glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) immunocytochemistry. GAD-immunoreactive synaptic boutons formed synapses with axon initial segments and somatic spines as well as somata and dendritic shafts of the granule cell. Most of these synapses were symmetrical, while a few were asymmetrical.
