OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of taurine on lead-induced damage to the ability of learning and memory. METHODS: Using NADPH-d histochemistry method to study the change of rat NOS positive neurons in hippocampus. Rats in experimental groups were fed with different doses of lead in drinking water (0.011, 0.110 g/L), and different doses of taurine (5, 10 g/kg). RESULTS: Taurine (10 g/kg) could increase the number of NOS positive neurons in CA1 and dentate gyrus subregion in hippocampus of rats exposed to lead. The number of NADPH-d positive neurons in CA1 and dentate gyrus subregion for low lead (0.011 g/L) and high taurine (10 g/kg) group (51.80 +/- 4.68, 47.40 +/- 4.20, respectively) were higher than those in the low lead (0.011 g/L) group (41.20 +/- 5.32, 39.87 +/- 3.81, respectively, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Taurine may antagonize lead-induced damage to the ability of learning and memory.
