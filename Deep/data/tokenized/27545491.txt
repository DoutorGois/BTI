The present study focused on the RGM (repulsive guidance molecule) a and RGMb expression in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of newborn mice with maternal lead exposure. Lead exposure initiated from gestation to weaning. Lead acetate was dissolved in deionized water with concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.5% groups respectively. On the 21st postnatal day, lead in blood and tissue levels was examined by GFAAS. The protein expressions of RGMa and RGMb in hippocampus and cerebral cortex tissues were tested by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Comparing with the control group, the lead levels in blood, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of newborn mice in 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.5% lead exposure groups were remarkably higher (P<0.05). Compared with the control group, the RGMa and RGMb expression in hippocampus were upregulated in lead exposed groups (P<0.05), and the RGMa and RGMb expression in cerebral cortex were also higher (P<0.05). The increased expression of RGMa and RGMb in hippocampus and cerebral cortex may lead to the neurotoxicity in the context of maternal lead exposure.
