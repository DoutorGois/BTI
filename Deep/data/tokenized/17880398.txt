theta (4-12 Hz) and gamma (40-90) oscillations are prominent rhythms in the mammalian brain. A striking feature of these rhythms, possibly vital to memory encoding, is their specific coordination in a manner that has been termed 'nesting', i.e. the preferred occurrence of bouts of gamma activity during specific phases of theta. Both rhythms are shaped by the neuromodulator acetylcholine, but it is unknown to what degree their coordination is influenced by cholinergic neuromodulation. Here, we investigated the effects of a blockade of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by atropine on theta and gamma oscillations, and their interaction, in mouse hippocampus in vivo. Multi-site recordings from area CA1 of freely moving mice showed that under control conditions gamma activity was amplitude-modulated at theta frequencies. This coordination of theta and gamma oscillations, as assessed by cross-correlation of theta with the gamma envelope, was prominent in basal and apical dendritic laminae but not in intermediate laminae. It was stronger during active exploration than during awake immobility. Atropine (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) altered several aspects of the individual and nested rhythms. It rendered theta activity irregular, decreased theta oscillation frequency and reduced gamma power. Atropine also reduced the amplitude-modulation of gamma oscillations at theta frequencies, in part by perturbing the coordination of the rhythms on a short time scale. Thus, our findings demonstrate that phase locking of the amplitude of gamma oscillations to theta in hippocampal area CA1 is partially governed by neuronal elements harbouring muscarinic receptors.
