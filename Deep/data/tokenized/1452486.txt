In order to study the factors responsible for glucose uptake in the mouse hippocampus, microvessel and astroglial cell densities were measured and compared in each laminal region. Microvessel density was examined on histologically prepared sections after injection of Indian ink and measured by means of an image analyser. Astroglial cell density was determined after the cells were stained immunohistochemically. Microvessel and astroglial cell densities were determined in 10 different hippocampal structures. Microvessel and astroglial cell densities were strongly correlated in all layers except the pyramidal cell layers. The highest density of perfused microvessels was found in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare, compared with other regions, and the lowest values were found in the stratum lucidum and dentate granular cell layer. Among pyramidal cell layers, microvessel density in sector CA3a was significantly higher than that in CA1.
