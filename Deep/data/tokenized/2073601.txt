The origins of two new strains of seizure-prone mice are provided, and some of their behavioral characteristics are described. Comparison of the hippocampal granule cell layer of one of the new strains with the two inbred strains from which it was derived revealed strain differences in the diameter of granule cell nuclei and in the number of granule cells in the suprapyramidal blade. Basket cell counts did not differ between the strains, but both basket cell and granule cell number were consistently higher for the suprapyramidal blade than for the infrapyramidal blade. The existence of these and other blade differences suggests that the two blades will prove to be functionally distinctive neuronal systems.
