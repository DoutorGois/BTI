Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most important mycotoxins in cereal-based foods or other food productions, produced by Fusarium species. Because of the high occurrence of DON in food combined with vast consumption of cereals and grain worldwide, the DON-contaminated food is a very harmful factor for human and animal health. DON has been reported to induce anorexia at lower or chronic doses in animal models. However, further researches for DON-induced anorexia are limited. Previous publications demonstrated a close link between Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, two kinds of gut microbiota, with weight loss and the effect of low administration of DON on neurotransmitters in the frontal cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus and pons/medulla. These data are similar to other studies, which show selective 5HTalpha receptor agonists apparently causing hyperphagia whereas 5HT1beta agonists appear to induce anorexia. Thus, the neurochemical effects of lower DON exposure can be as a result of peripheral toxicological events such as emesis, which overwhelmed its more subtle feed refusal activity. Besides, changes in the microbiota have an impact on stress-related behaviors like anxiety and depression, which can lead to weight loss through decreased feed intake. Gut dysbiosis is also associated with brain dysfunction and with behavioral changes. These conclusions illustrate as well a potential explanation for DON-induced anorexia.In this review, we summarize information about DON-induced anorexia from previous studies and provide our opinion for future investigations that could establish a link between gut microbiota, neurotransmitters, anorexia and weight loss under the DON exposure.
