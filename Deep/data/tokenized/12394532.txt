In this study we investigated whether electroconvulsive stimuli (ECS) altered the regional brain protein concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in Sprague Dawley rats. Electroconvulsive stimuli were administered once daily for 8 days. At the end of the experiment, rats were killed, the brains were dissected into five regions, and the neurotrophic factors were extracted and measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Electroconvulsive stimuli increased the concentrations of NGF in the frontal cortex and concentrations of BDNF in the hippocampus, the striatum, and the occipital cortex. In contrast, ECS decreased GDNF concentrations in the hippocampus and the striatum. Our data indicate that neurotrophic factors play a role in the mechanism of action of ECS and, by extrapolation, may play a role in the mechanism of action of electroconvulsive treatment.
