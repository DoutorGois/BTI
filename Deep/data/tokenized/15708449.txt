The DMT1(Nramp2/DCT1) is a newly discovered proton-coupled metal-ion transport protein. The cellular localization and functional characterization of DMT1 suggest that it might play a role in physiological iron transport in the brain. In the study, we evaluated effects of dietary iron and age on iron content and DMT1 expression in four brain regions: cortex, hippocampus, striatum, substantia nigra. Total iron content in all regions was significantly lower in the low-iron diet rats and higher in the high-iron diet rats than that in the control animals, showing that dietary iron treatment for 6-weeks can alter brain iron levels. Contrary to our expectation, there was no significant alternation in DMT1(+IRE) and (-IRE) mRNA expression and protein content in all brain regions examined in spite of the existence of the altered iron levels in these regions after 6-weeks' diet treatment although TfR mRNA expression and protein level were affected significantly, as was expected. The data demonstrates that expression of DMT1(+IRE) and (-IRE) was not regulated by iron in these regions of adult rats. The lack of response of DMT1 to iron status in the brain suggests that the IRE of brain DMT1 mRNA might be not really iron-responsive and that DMT1-mediated iron transport might be not the rate-limiting step in brain iron uptake in adult rats. Our findings also showed that development can significantly affect brain iron and DMT1(+IRE) and (-IRE) expression but the effect varies in different brain regions, indicating a regionally specific regulation in the brain.
