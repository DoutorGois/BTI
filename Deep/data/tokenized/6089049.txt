In the slice preparation of the guinea pig hippocampus, the effects of (+/-) baclofen added to the Krebs-Ringer solution on dentate granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells were investigated by means of intracellular recording techniques. In a 10-25 microM concentration, baclofen reduces the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials of the granule cells evoked by electrical stimulation of the perforant path and hyperpolarizes the granule cell membrane slightly. The reduction of both, the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials of CA3 pyramidal cells evoked by mossy fiber stimulation, however, is accompanied by a strong hyperpolarization and conductance increase. Further, repetitive discharges of granule cells elicited in the presence of the convulsant bicuculline (25 microM) are hardly affected by baclofen (50 microM), whereas those of CA3 neurons are blocked.
