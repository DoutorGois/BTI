An agarose gel slip containing L-glutamate oxidase (GluOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a dye DA-64 is proposed as a tool for visualizing ischemia-induced L-glutamate release in hippocampal slices in a flow system. The agarose slip with a detection limit of 6.0 +/- 0.8 mumol L(-1) for L-glutamate enabled us to visualize L-glutamate fluxes in a flow system. The leak of a dye from the agarose gel was negligible and a diffusion blur due to spreading of Bindshedler's Green (BG) within the gel was suppressed. Monitoring the time-dependent change of ischemia-induced L-glutamate fluxes at neuronal regions CA1, DG and CA3 of hippocampal slices is demonstrated.
