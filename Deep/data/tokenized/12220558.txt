We investigated how transient cerebral ischemia affects the gene expression, immunoreactive protein levels, and the function of the A1 subtype of adenosine receptor in the rat hippocampus at different times following reperfusion. A1 receptor mRNA levels were altered significantly in different hippocampal subfields as early as 6 h following insult. However, these changes in mRNA levels were not paralleled at the protein level, as western blotting with A1 receptor-specific antibodies revealed that hippocampal A1 adenosine receptor prevalence did not differ from sham control at either 6 or 24 h following insult. The lack of change in A1 receptor prevalence was consistent with functional examinations, as only marginal changes were observed in the ability of A1 receptors to attenuate excitatory post-synaptic potentials in the CA1 subfield at 24 h following reperfusion. These data illustrate that although the mRNA expression levels of the A1 adenosine receptor are altered by transient cerebral ischemia, the immunoreactive prevalence and function of this receptor are maintained in the post-ischemic hippocampus at times preceding the death of the vulnerable neurons.
