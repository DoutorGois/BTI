Bacopa monniera is a rejuvenating herb for brain cells enhancing learning and cognitive ability. In the present investigation, the ameliorative effects of Bacopa monniera were examined against lead-induced oxidative stress in different regions of rat brain. Male rats were divided into five groups: control (1000 ppm sodium acetate) and exposed (1000 ppm lead acetate) for 4 weeks; DMSA (Meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid)-treated (90 mg/kg body weight/day); Bacopa monniera-treated (BM) (10 mg/kg body weight/day) and a combination of BM + DMSA for seven consecutive days after 4 weeks of lead exposure. After treatment, the whole brain was isolated by sacrificing rats and four regions were separated namely cerebellum, hippocampus, frontal cortex and brain stem. Results indicated a significant (p < 0.05) increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation products (LPP) and total protein carbonyl content (TPCC) in association with tissue metal content in all the four regions of brain for exposed group compared with their respective controls. However, the lead-induced ROS, LPP, TPCC and tissue metal content were lowered on treatment with Bacopa monniera, almost reaching the control group values in all the above brain regions compared to DMSA and a combination therapy. Results suggest that Bacopa monniera can mitigate the lead induced-oxidative stress tissue specifically by pharmacologic interventions which encompass both chelation as well as antioxidant functions.
