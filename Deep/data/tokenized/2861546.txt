N alpha-acetyl-gamma-endorphin (Ac gamma E) was identified in the rat neurointermediate pituitary, based on its immunological properties, comigration with synthetic Ac gamma E on HPLC and resistance to aminopeptidase-M degradation. The peptide appeared to be the main form of gamma-endorphin (gamma E) in this tissue and in brain areas remote from the hypothalamus (hippocampus, septum, amygdala). The anterior pituitary, the hypothalamus and the thalamus contained almost exclusively the non-acetylated form of gamma E. In contrast to gamma E, Ac gamma E was completely devoid of specific affinity for brain opiate binding sites. Yet, the peptide mimicked gamma E in that it potently attenuated passive avoidance behaviour in rats, when injected topically into the nucleus accumbens. It is concluded that Ac gamma E is an endogenous neuropeptide with non-opioid biological activity. N alpha-acetylation may not merely represent a mechanism for the inactivation of opioid activities of endorphins, but rather allow the organism to select specific sets of biological activities that reside in the endorphin structure.
