The aim of this study was to study the changes of inducible and constitutive Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) after brain injury. In order to brain injury 42 wistar rats were submitted and divided in 7 groups. Nitric oxide synthase activities were assayed at different times after injury. Present results showed that a significant increase of iNOS and cNOS activity 8 h after lesion. In conclusion, both isoformes of NOS increase at different time after brain injury.
