The purinergic system, which includes the anticonvulsant and antikindling neuromodulator adenosine and the neurotransmitter ATP, modulates second messenger systems, neurotransmitters, energy metabolism and different behaviors, such as sleep, motor activity, cognition, memory, aggressive behavior and social interaction. At the same time, mania is characterized by similar behavioral changes and a molecular basis to explain the pathological activation observed during manic episodes has been also associated with second messenger systems dysfunction and kindling. This hypothesis put forward an integrative model of neuronal communication, associating a reduced adenosinergic activity, mostly at A1 receptors, with the complex network of changes on neurotransmitters pathways related to manic behavior.
