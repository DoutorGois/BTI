Levels of messenger RNAs for brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3, and their high-affinity receptors, TrkB and TrkC, were analysed in the brains of genetically fast and slow kindling rats using in situ hybridization. Basal expression of neurotrophins and Trk messenger RNAs in the hippocampal formation, amygdala, frontoparietal and piriform cortices did not differ between the two strains. At 2 h after the third generalized grade 5 seizure, induced by kindling stimulations in the amygdala, increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA was detected in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer, amygdala, frontoparietal and piriform cortices of the fast kindlers. Similar seizure-evoked increases of brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA levels were also observed in the amygdala and piriform cortex of slow kindlers. However, in these animals, brain-derived neurotrophic factor messenger RNA expression was not significantly altered by the seizures in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer and frontoparietal cortex. Furthermore, the seizure-induced increase of nerve growth factor, TrkB and TrkC messenger RNAs and decrease of neurotrophin-3 messenger RNA levels in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer was only observed in fast, but not in slow, kindlers. The neurotrophins are believed to regulate synaptic plasticity and efficacy and to facilitate long-term potentiation and kindling epileptogenesis. The present data suggest that the slow and fast kindling rates in the two strains studied here might partly be due to differences in seizure-evoked neurotrophin and Trk synthesis.
