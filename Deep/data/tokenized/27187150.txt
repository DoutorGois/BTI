PKMzeta is a persistently active PKC isoform proposed to maintain late-LTP and long-term memory. But late-LTP and memory are maintained without PKMzeta in PKMzeta-null mice. Two hypotheses can account for these findings. First, PKMzeta is unimportant for LTP or memory. Second, PKMzeta is essential for late-LTP and long-term memory in wild-type mice, and PKMzeta-null mice recruit compensatory mechanisms. We find that whereas PKMzeta persistently increases in LTP maintenance in wild-type mice, PKCiota/lambda, a gene-product closely related to PKMzeta, persistently increases in LTP maintenance in PKMzeta-null mice. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find PKMzeta-antisense in hippocampus blocks late-LTP and spatial long-term memory in wild-type mice, but not in PKMzeta-null mice without the target mRNA. Conversely, a PKCiota/lambda-antagonist disrupts late-LTP and spatial memory in PKMzeta-null mice but not in wild-type mice. Thus, whereas PKMzeta is essential for wild-type LTP and long-term memory, persistent PKCiota/lambda activation compensates for PKMzeta loss in PKMzeta-null mice.
