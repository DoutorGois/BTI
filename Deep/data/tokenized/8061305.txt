The distribution of the N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 receptor was investigated in human hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex by means of in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. Expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 receptors was observed in layers II-VI of the frontal cortex with the highest density of positive neurones in layer IV, V and VIa. The entire human hippocampus was labelled, with marked differences in intensity between the CA 1 and CA 2/3 region. Furthermore we found marked differences in the intracellular localization of the protein between granule and pyramidal cells. In the cerebellum granule and Purkinje cells stained positive, as revealed by both in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry. These findings suggest that the receptor has a less restricted cell specific expression than previously thought, although the distribution is largely in accordance with the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 mRNA in the rat.
