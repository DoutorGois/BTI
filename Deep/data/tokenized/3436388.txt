Using solution hybridization analysis and Northern blotting with complementary RNA probes labelled to high specific activity, levels of proenkephalin A and B mRNA were analyzed throughout prenatal development in the hippocampus and striatum of fetal pigs. A differential time course for the appearance of these opioid precursor mRNAs was observed: in hippocampus, both mRNAs increased linearly throughout development with proenkephalin B mRNA increasing faster than proenkephalin A mRNA. In striatum, both mRNAs behaved similarly, increasing to a maximum level around mid-gestation and declining thereafter. The differences might be attributed to differential localization of the two precursor systems in the tissues and might be of functional relevance.
