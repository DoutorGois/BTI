The distribution of antidiabetic sulfonylurea [( 3H]glibenclamide) binding sites is heterogeneous in rat brain. Pyramidal and extrapyramidal motor system contain the highest densities of sites, particularly in the substantia nigra and in the globus pallidus. Only low levels are present in the hypothalamic nuclei and the main medulla oblongata regions. In hippocampal formation the stratum lucidum and the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA3 show an important density of glibenclamide binding sites. Electrophysiological studies with hippocampal slices show that glibenclamide blocks hyperpolarization induced by anoxia, suggesting the involvement of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channel in this early hyperpolarization event.
