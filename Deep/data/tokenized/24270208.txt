The abnormal phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is a prominent aspect of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considerable evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) are involved in normal and pathological tau phosphorylation. However, the mechanisms underlying a shift of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance that leads to abnormal tau phosphorylation remains unknown. The canonical Wnt pathway negatively regulates GSK3beta activity, and this signaling pathway has also been found to be dysregulated in the AD brain. Here, we report that the Wnt antagonist Dkk-1 selectively increases tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus of aged rats at Ser199/202, Ser396/404, and Ser214 sites. In the aged hippocampus, the inhibition of Wnt signaling is also accompanied by reduced PP2A activity. This study suggests that aging promotes tau hyperphosphorylation after Wnt inhibition, due to an imbalance between GSK3beta and PP2A activities.
