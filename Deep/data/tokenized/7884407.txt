Excitatory amino acids may have a neurotoxic effect in acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Glutamate mediated Ca-influx into the cell is caused by activation of the NMDA-receptor. In addition to the competitive binding site there is a glycine binding site at the NMDA-receptor, where in an agonistic function glycine leads to opening of the ion channel. Antagonists at this glycine binding site may reduce the Ca-influx and thereby have a neuroprotective effect. The affinity of HA-966 to the glycine binding site in human hippocampus brain tissue is in the low micromolar range (Ki = 8.1 +/- 1.5 microM). So HA-966 may play a role as a neuroprotective substance.
