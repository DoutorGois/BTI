2-Aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was infused into the lateral ventricles of behaving rats. A 10 or 20 microgram dose of APV attenuated the hippocampal theta rhythm and the theta phase-shift at the apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 region. A selective suppression of the atropine-sensitive theta rhythm was suggested.
