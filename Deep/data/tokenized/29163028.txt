Many transporters such as the solute carriers belonging to the Major facilitator superfamily Pfam clan are orphans in that their tissue and cellular localization as well as substrate profile and function are still unknown. Here we have characterized the putative solute carrier UNC93A. We aimed to investigate the expression profile on both protein and mRNA level of UNC93A in mouse since it has not been clarified. UNC93A staining was found in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum. It was found to be expressed in many neurons, but not all, with staining located in close proximity to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we aimed to extend the starvation data available for Unc93a in hypothalamic cell cultures from mouse. We investigated the Unc93a alterations with focus on amino acid deprivation in embryonic cortex cells from mice as well as 24 h starvation in adult male mice and compared it to recently studied putative and known solute carriers. Unc93a expression was found both in the brain and peripheral organs, in low to moderate levels in the adult mice and was affected by amino acid deprivation in embryonic cortex cultures and starvation in in vivo samples. In conclusion, the membrane-bound UNC93A is expressed in both the brain and peripheral tissues and responds to nutrient availability in mice.
