Whole cell and single channel Ca2+ currents were compared for hippocampal neurons of normal and ethanol-tolerant long-sleep and short-sleep mice. The properties of these currents were equivalent for normal LS and SS mice. In contrast, the peak amplitude of the whole cell Ca2+ current increased significantly for neurons isolated from LS but not SS mice chronically ingesting ethanol. Since there were no changes in the functional properties of single channel events, these data indicate that chronic ingestion of ethanol causes an increase in the number of functional Ca2+ channels in the membrane of hippocampal neurons of LS mice.
