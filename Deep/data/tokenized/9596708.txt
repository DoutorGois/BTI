The neurotoxicity of epsilon-toxin, one of the major lethal toxins produced by Clostridium perfringens type B, was studied by histological examination of the rat brain. When the toxin was injected intravenously at a lethal dose (100 ng/kg), neuronal damage was observed in many areas of the brain. Injection of the toxin at a sublethal dose (50 ng/kg) caused neuronal damage predominantly in the hippocampus: pyramidal cells in the hippocampus showed marked shrinkage and karyopyknosis, or so-called dark cells. The dark cells lost the immunoreactivity to microtubule-associated protein-2, a postsynaptic somal and dendric marker, while acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers were not affected. Timm's zinc staining revealed that zinc ions were depleted in the mossy layers of the CA3 subfield containing glutamate as a synaptic transmitter. The cerebral blood flow in the hippocampus was not altered significantly before or after administration of the toxin, as measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry, excluding the possibility that the observed histological change was due to a secondary effect of ischemia in the hippocampus. Prior injection of either a glutamate release inhibitor or a glutamate receptor antagonist protected the hippocampus from the neuronal damage caused by epsilon-toxin. These results suggest that epsilon-toxin acts on the glutamatergic system and evokes excessive release of glutamate, leading to neuronal damage.
