Electrophysiological investigations of extracellular Ca ions the influence on the mechanism of frequency accommodation were carried out on isolated rat hippocampal neurones. It is established that interpulse interval during potential generation action linearly depended on quantity of Ca ions, which enter the cell through Ca2+ channels. Analysis of the results has shown that Ca ions influenced the forming and parameters of frequency accommodation in hippocampal neurones, probably via activation of Ca-dependent outward K-currents. Theoretical model that quantitatively describes the mechanisms of frequency adaptation is proposed. Adequacy of model to experimental data on frequency accommodation and electrical activity of hippocampal neurones is estimated.
