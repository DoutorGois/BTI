BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fodrin, a neuronal cytoskeleton protein, is proteolyzed by calpain after ischemic insult. We examined proteolysis of fodrin induced by global forebrain ischemia in gerbil hippocampus in spatial terms by using the antibody specific to the calpain-proteolyzed form of fodrin. METHODS: In gerbils, a 10-minute forebrain ischemia was produced by occlusion of both carotid arteries. After recirculation, the hippocampus was processed for immunohistochemical and immunoblot study with the antibody against the calpain-proteolyzed form of fodrin. Additionally, short-term ischemia was studied to find the threshold of fodrin proteolysis. RESULTS: Three phases of fodrin proteolysis distinct in chronology and distribution arose: (1) an early predegeneration phase in the molecular layer and stratum oriens of the CA1 and CA3 sectors within the first 15 minutes, which lasted up to 4 hours; (2) a late predegeneration phase in the whole CA1 sector, except for the pyramidal cells, between 12 hours and 2 days; and (3) a postdegeneration phase in the cytoplasm of the CA1 neurons, which arose in 3 to 7 days. A 4-minute (not a 3-minute) forebrain ischemia induced the late predegeneration phase of fodrin proteolysis and delayed neuronal death in CA1. Immunoblotting showed that the primary product of calpain action was further proteolyzed by an unidentified protease. CONCLUSIONS: Calpain induced proteolysis of fodrin in ischemic hippocampus, and the late predegeneration phase of the proteolysis was closely associated with the delayed neuronal death in the CA1 sector. Calpain and another protease may play a role in the development of neuronal death after transient forebrain ischemia.
