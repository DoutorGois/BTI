Projections from the hippocampus, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) form interconnected neural circuits that converge in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to participate in the regulation of executive functions. The present study assessed the roles that the MD and VTA play in regulating the hippocampal-PFC pathway using extracellular single-unit recordings in urethane-anesthetized rats. MD stimulation inhibited PFC neuron firing (approximately 100 msec duration) evoked by fimbria/fornix (FF) stimulation in a majority of neurons tested. However, this effect was reduced if activation of thalamocortical inputs occurred almost simultaneously (10 msec) with stimulation of the FF. In a separate population of neurons, burst stimulation of the MD produced a short-term (approximately 100 msec) inhibition or facilitation of FF-evoked firing in 66 and 33% of PFC neurons, respectively. Moreover, tetanic stimulation of the MD caused a longer-lasting (approximately 5 min) potentiation of FF-evoked firing. Burst stimulation of the VTA inhibited FF-evoked firing in a frequency-dependent manner: firing evoked by higher-frequency trains of pulses to the FF was less inhibited than firing evoked by single-pulse stimulation. The inhibitory actions of VTA stimulation were augmented by D1 receptor antagonism and attenuated by D2 and D4 antagonists. Moreover, stimulation of the MD 10 msec before stimulation of the FF attenuated the VTA-mediated inhibition of evoked firing. Thus, both the MD and VTA exert a complex gating action over PFC neural activity, either facilitating or inhibiting firing in the hippocampal-PFC pathway depending on the frequency and relative timing of the arrival of afferent input.
