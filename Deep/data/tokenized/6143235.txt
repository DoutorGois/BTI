In transversely sectioned rat hippocampal slices, the effects of low (20 Hz, 600 pulses) and high (400 Hz, 200 pulses) frequency tetani of Schaffer collaterals were examined on the CA1 population spike as well as on the binding of 3H-glutamate. The population spike was suppressed while 3H-glutamate binding greatly enhanced following a low frequency tetanus. Verapamil (1 micron), which does not block long-lasting potentiation (LLP), counteracted the depression of the population spike as well as the associated increase in 3H-glutamate binding. The high frequency tetanus induced LLP of the population spike but caused no change in the amino acid binding. These results indicate that the increase in the number of glutamate receptors is not a requirement for LLP.
