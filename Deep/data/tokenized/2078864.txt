Excretion, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of the above-mentioned drug after oral doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg were investigated. The drug is completely and rapidly resorbed from the digestive tract. It shows relatively large renal and metabolic clearance, it is extensively distributed in the tissues This results in its rapid elimination from plasma (t1/2 approximately 3 h) and, on the other hand, higher concentrations of radioactive drugs in tissues. Penetration and specific binding of VUFB 15468 in the murine brain in dependence on the administered dose were tested (ED50 approximately 4 mg/kg). Autoradiographic examination of the rat brain demonstrated an increased concentration of radioactive drugs in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypophysis and central ganglia.
