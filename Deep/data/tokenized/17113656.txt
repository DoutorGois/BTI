Physical activity may have the potential to improve cognitive function. Here we show that forced treadmill-running results in selective improvements in hippocampal plasticity. Rats that underwent exercise training demonstrated enhanced expression of long-term potentiation in dentate gyrus and enhanced object recognition learning. Spatial learning in the Morris watermaze was unaffected by exercise. These changes were associated with an increase in expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the dentate gyrus.
