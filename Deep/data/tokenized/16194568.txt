Changed neuropeptide Y (NPY) system in the hippocampus has been reported in various experimental epileptic models. However, there have been little data concerning the alteration in the NPY system in the epileptic hippocampus following treatment of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). In the present study, therefore, we performed analyses of effects of vigabatrin (VGB) and zonisamide (ZNS) treatment on the NPY system in the hippocampus of the seizure sensitive (SS) gerbils. In SS gerbil, NPY immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was lower than that in seizure resistant gerbil. Following VGB treatment, the number of NPY immunoreactive neurons and NPY mRNA expression were increased in the hilus and the hippocampus proper. In contrast, ZNS treatment markedly elevated only the density of NPY immunoreactive fibers in the dentate gyrus, not in the hippocampus proper, as compared with saline-treated animals. These patterns were observed in the dose-dependent manners. These findings suggest that AEDs treatments may distinctly affect the NPY system in the SS gerbil hippocampus.
