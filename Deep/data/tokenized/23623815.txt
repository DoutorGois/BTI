It is well established that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in brain plasticity-related processes, such as learning, memory and drug addiction. However, changes in expression of BDNF splice variants after acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of cue-elicited morphine seeking behavior have not yet been investigated. Real-time PCR was used to assess BDNF splice variants (I, II, IV and VI) in various brain regions during acquisition, extinction and reinstatement of morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) in mice. Repeated morphine injections (10mg/kg, i.p.) increased expression of BDNF splice variants II, IV and VI in the hippocampus, caudate putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Levels of BDNF splice variants decreased after extinction training and continued to decrease during reinstatement induced by a morphine priming injection (10mg/kg, i.p.). However, after reinstatement induced by exposure to 6 min of forced swimming (FS), expression of BDNF splice variants II, IV and VI was increased in the hippocampus, CPu, NAcc and prefrontal cortex (PFC). After reinstatement induced by 40 min of restraint, expression of BDNF splice variants was increased in PFC. These results show that exposure to either morphine or acute stress can induce reinstatement of drug-seeking, but expression of BDNF splice variants is differentially affected by chronic morphine and acute stress. Furthermore, BDNF splice variants II, IV and VI may play a role in learning and memory for morphine addiction in the hippocampus, CPu and NAcc.
