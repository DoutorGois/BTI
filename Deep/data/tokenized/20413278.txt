We used magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) on hippocampal T(2) relaxation time in first episode psychosis patients at baseline and after 12 weeks of follow-up. There was an increase in T(2) in the placebo group but not in the E-EPA group, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of E-EPA treatment. In addition, the smaller the increase in T(2), the greater the improvement in negative symptoms.
