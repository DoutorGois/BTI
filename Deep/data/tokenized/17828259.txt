We report that temporal spike sequences from hippocampal place neurons of rats on an elevated track recurred in reverse order at the end of a run, but in forward order in anticipation of the run, coinciding with sharp waves. Vector distances between the place fields were reflected in the temporal structure of these sequences. This bidirectional re-enactment of temporal sequences may contribute to the establishment of higher-order associations in episodic memory.
