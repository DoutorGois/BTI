The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) structure is of central importance for the regulation of cellular anabolism, stress response, and signal transduction. Generally continuous, the ER can temporarily undergo dramatic structural rearrangements resulting in a fragmented appearance. In this study we assess the dynamic nature of ER fission in pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures stimulated by depolarizing concentration of potassium (50 mM). The slices were obtained from transgenic mice expressing fluorescent ER-targeted DsRed2 protein. We employed live tissue confocal microscopy imaging with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to monitor the extent of structural rearrangements of the ER. In control slices, the ER structure was continuous. Potassium stimulation resulted in extensive fragmentation (fission), whereas return to basal potassium levels (2.5 mM) led to ER fusion and normalization of ER structure. This ER fission/fusion could be repeated several times in the same neuron, demonstrating the reversibility of the process. Blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) with the antagonist D-AP5 or removal of extracellular Ca(2+) prevented depolarization-induced ER fission. ER fission is sensitive to temperature, and decreasing temperature from 35 degrees C to 30 degrees C augments fission, implying that the altering of ER continuity may be a protective response against damage. We conclude that events that generate membrane depolarisation in brain tissue lead to the release of endogenous glutamate that may regulate neuronal ER continuity. The rapid and reversible NMDAR-mediated changes in ER structure reflect an adaptive, innate property of the ER for synaptic activation as well as response to tissue stress, injury, and disease.
