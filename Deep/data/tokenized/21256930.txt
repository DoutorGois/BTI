Calmodulin (CaM) and neurogranin (Ng) are two abundant neuronal proteins in the forebrain whose interactions are implicated in the enhancement of synaptic plasticity. To gain further insight into the actions of these two proteins we investigated whether they co-localize in principle neurons and whether they respond to high frequency stimulation in a coordinated fashion. Immunohistochemical staining of CaM and Ng in mouse hippocampal slices revealed that CaM was highly concentrated in the nucleus of CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas Ng was more broadly localized throughout the soma and dendrites. The asymmetrical localization of CaM in the nucleus of pyramidal neurons was in sharp contrast to the distribution observed in pyramidal cells of the neighboring subiculum, where CaM was uniformly localized throughout the soma and dendrites. The somatic concentrations of CaM and Ng in CA1 pyramidal neurons were approximately 10- and two-fold greater than observed in the dendrites, respectively. High frequency stimulation (HFS) of hippocampal slices promoted mobilization of CaM and Ng from soma to dendrites. These responses were spatially restricted to the area close to the site of stimulation and were inhibited by the N-methyl-D-asparate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid. Furthermore, HFS failed to promote translocation of CaM from soma to dendrites of slices from Ng knockout mice, which also exhibited deficits in HFS-induced long-term potentiation. Translocated CaM and Ng exhibited distinct puncta decorating the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons and appeared to be concentrated in dendritic spines. These findings suggest that mobilization of CaM and Ng to stimulated dendritic spines may enhance synaptic efficacy by increasing and prolonging the Ca2+ transients and activation of Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzymes.
