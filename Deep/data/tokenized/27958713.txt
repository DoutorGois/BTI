The rationale for using M1 selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activators for the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with psychiatric and neurodegenerative disease is well-established in the literature. Here, we investigate measurement of inositol phosphate accumulation, an end point immediately downstream of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signaling cascade, as an in vivo biochemical readout for M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activation. Five brain penetrant M1-subtype selective activators from three structurally distinct chemical series were pharmacologically profiled for functional activity in vitro using recombinant cell calcium mobilization and inositol phosphate assays, and a native tissue hippocampal slice electrophysiology assay, to show that all five compounds presented a positive allosteric modulator agonist profile, within a narrow range of potencies. In vivo characterization using an amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity behavioral assay and the inositol phosphate accumulation biochemical assay demonstrated that the latter has utility for assessing functional potency of M1 activators. Efficacy measured by inositol phosphate accumulation in mouse striatum compared favorably to efficacy in reversing amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, suggesting that the inositol phosphate accumulation assay has utility for the evaluation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activators in vivo. The benefits of this in vivo biochemical approach include a wide response window, interrogation of specific brain circuit activation, an ability to model responses in the context of brain exposure, an ability to rank order compounds based on in vivo efficacy, and minimization of animal use.
