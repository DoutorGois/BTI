The electrical activity of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus and of the anterior and posterior neocortex is described and illustrated during the development of trained operant behavior in water-deprived cats learning to bar-press for water reward under three operant conditioning schedules: (a) continuous reinforcement; (b) alternating 10 sec periods of reinforcement and non-reinforcement; and (c) mixed reinforcement and non-reinforcement with special auditory and visual cues. In addition, the contrasting effects of 100 c/sec electrical stimulation of the medial and lateral hypothalamic systems upon hippocampal electrical activity and operantly trained behavior are reported. During the early stages of learning to bar-press for water reward, when close attention to the bar and water-well are required, hippocampal electrical activity manifests synchrony (theta rhythm) and neocortical electrical activity is desynchronized. Subsequently, as bar-pressing performance improves and requires little attention to the manipulanda, the pattern of hippocampal and neocortical electrical activity is one of irregular slow waves mixed with low voltage high frequency activity, characteristic of relative inattention and automatic performance. During alternating or mixed reinforcement and non-reinforcement schedules of operant training differential effects are observed during reinforcement and non-reinforcement periods, the latter being characterized generally by lower voltage, mixed low and high frequency activity, except when orienting and shifting of attention occurred with associated theta rhythm bursts. Stimulation of the medial hypothalamic system has a striking inhibitory effect upon bar-pressing for water reward. Bar-pressing ceases for many minutes but its eventually resumed at the pre-stimulation rate. In contrast, stimulation of the lateral hypothalamic system only interrupts bar-pressing for a matter of seconds. Possible causes of these differential effects, and especially the prolonged inhibition of bar-pressing induced by medial hypothalamic stimulation, are discussed.
