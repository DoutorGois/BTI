The hormonally active fragment of the intestinal hormone cholecystokinin applied microiontophoretically or under pressure to the hippocampal neurons (fascia dentata and CA3 field) more or less depressed their spontaneous firing rate depending on the dosage. The neurons sensitivity to L--glutamate did not essentially change, at that. Neurons with burst--like firing started to reveal a regular patterns of firing. These data suggest an important role of the cholecystokinin octapeptide in central mechanisms of positive reinforcement.
