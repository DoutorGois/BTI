Rodents experience hippocampal damage after status epilepticus (SE) mainly in pyramidal cells while sparing the dentate granule cell layer (DGCL). Hippocampal damage was prevented in rats that had been preconditioned by brief seizures on 2 consecutive days before SE. To identify neuroprotective genes and biochemical pathways changed after preconditioning we compared the effect of preconditioning on gene expression in the CA1 and CA3 pyramidal and DGCLs, harvested by laser capture microscopy. In the DGCL the expression of 632 genes was altered, compared to only 151 and 58 genes in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers. Most of the differentially expressed genes regulate tissue structure and intra- and extracellular signaling, including neurotransmission. A selective upregulation of energy metabolism transcripts occurred in CA1 pyramidal cells relative to the DGCL. These results reveal a broad transcriptional response of the DGCL to preconditioning, and suggest several mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of preconditioning seizures.
