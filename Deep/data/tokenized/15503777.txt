OBJECTIVE: To study the changes of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid content in hippocampus of epileptic rats treated with volatile oil of A. tatarinowii, and explore the possible antiepiletic mechanism. METHOD: The volatile oil was extracted through Supercritical-CO2 Fluid Extraction (SFE-CO2), and epileptic models were built up by kainic acid (KA) lateral ventricle injection. The content of amino acid in hippocampus of epileptic rats treated with volatile oil was calculated. RESULT: The content of GABA increased and Glu decreased prominently (P < 0.05) after volatile oil 35 mg x kg(-1) intraperitoneal injection. CONCLUSION: The volatile oil of A. tatarinowii can modulate the balance of excitatory and inhibitory amino acid in epileptic rats, thereby exerting its antiepileptic effect.
