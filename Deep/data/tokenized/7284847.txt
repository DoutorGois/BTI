The influences of morphine and opioid peptides on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were investigated using intracellular recordings from the in vitro slice preparation. Morphine applied to somal and basal dendritic areas of CA1 cells via a pressure ejection system confirmed a number of excitatory actions of opiates and opioid peptides in this brain region. These included an increase in the amplitude and duration of orthodromically (radiatum) elicited EPSPs and a decrease in amplitude of the following IPSP. The increase in EPSP amplitude was accompanied by a reduction in stimulus intensity necessary for eliciting the action potential. Morphine delivered to the slice in this manner induced synaptically elicited and spontaneous multiple spike burst discharges. In slices maintained in 10(-4) M pentobarbital, morphine reversed the presumably GABA mediated long-duration depolarization following orthodromic stimulation. Finally, depending on the specific site of application (apical or basal dendritic region) of the opiate, morphine produced two different effects on the resting membrane potential and input resistance of CA1 pyramidal cells. These findings are discussed as to whether opiates act directly upon excitatory influences in the hippocampus, or via blockade of GABA mediated inhibitory mechanisms.
