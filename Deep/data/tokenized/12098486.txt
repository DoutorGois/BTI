Apoptotic death is known to be an active process requiring the activation of several apoptotic proteins. Depending on the tissue studied and the stimulus used, these processes are distinct. In this work, we studied if there is a putative implication of the p53 and the caspase-3 proteins in kainic acid (KA) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced apoptosis in organotypic cultures and if there is any relationship between their respective expressions. We found that KA and NMDA both induce apoptosis but only KA-induced apoptosis is p53- and caspase-3-dependent. This demonstrates that KA and NMDA induce apoptosis following different intracellular pathways.
