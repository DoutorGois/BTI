A single dose of ethanol has been shown to affect both striatal and hippocampal high-affinity choline uptake. This effect is probably mediated through effects of ethanol on acetylcholine release. Choline uptake has also been shown to be altered in ethanol-dependent animals, and these effects may be coupled to alterations in dopamine neurons which are produced by chronic ethanol feeding and withdrawal.
