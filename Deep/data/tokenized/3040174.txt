The effects of two CCK antagonists, benzotript and proglumide, and of sulfated and non-sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-S and CCK-8-NS), were studied in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampal slice. Both benzotript and proglumide shifted presynaptic volley (prevolley) vs population spike input/output (I/O) curves for Schaffer collateral-commissural synaptic transmission to the right. This result indicates that the antagonists had a net depressant effect on synaptic transmission. CCK-8-S shifted prevolley vs population spike I/O curves to the left, indicating a net excitatory effect. Analysis of component I/O curves indicated that CCK-8-S and the CCK antagonists were acting postsynaptically by changing CA1 pyramidal cell threshold. CCK-8-NS had no significant effect on overall or component I/O functions. These findings suggest that endogenous CCK is released, directly or indirectly, upon stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural fibers and increases the excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells.
