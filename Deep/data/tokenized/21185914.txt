Direct evidence that the mammalian neocortex is an important generator of intrinsic activity comes from isolated neocortical slices that spontaneously generate multiple rhythms including those in the beta, delta and gamma range. These oscillations are also seen in intact animals where they interact with other areas including the hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia. Here we show that thick isolated neocortical slices from hooded seals intrinsically generate persistent spontaneous activities, both repetitive non-rhythmic activity with activity states lasting for several minutes, and oscillating activity with rhythms that are much slower (<0.1 Hz) than the rhythms previously described in vitro. These intrinsic activities were very robust and persisted for up to 1 h even in severely hypoxic conditions. We hypothesize that the remarkable hypoxia tolerance of the hooded seal nervous system made it possible to maintain functional integrity in slices thick enough to preserve intact neuronal networks capable of generating these slow oscillations. The observed activities in seal neocortical slices support the notion that mammalian cortical networks intrinsically generate multiple states of activity that include oscillatory activity all the way down to <0.1 Hz. This intrinsic neocortical excitability is an important contributor not only to sleep but also to the default awake state of the neocortex.
