The two most common types of temporal lobe epilepsy are medial temporal sclerosis (TLE-MTS) epilepsy and MRI-normal temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE-no). TLE-MTS is specified by its stereotyped focus and spread pattern of neuronal damage, with pronounced neuronal loss in the hippocampus. TLE-no exhibits normal-appearing hippocampus and more widespread neuronal loss. In both cases, neuronal loss spread appears to be constrained by the white matter connections. Both varieties of epilepsy reveal pathological abnormalities in increased mean diffusivity (MD). We model MD distribution as a simple consequence of the propagation of neuronal damage. By applying this model on the structural brain connectivity network of healthy subjects, we can predict at group level the MD gray matter change in the epilepsy cohorts relative to a control group. Diffusion tensor imaging images were acquired from 10 patients with TLE-MTS, 11 patients with TLE-no, and 35 healthy subjects. Statistical validation at the group level suggests high correlation with measured neuronal loss (R = 0.56 for the TLE-MTS group and R = 0.364 for the TLE-no group). The results of this exploratory work pave the way for potential future clinical application of the proposed model on individual patients, including predicting neuronal loss spread, identification of seizure onset zones, and helping in surgical planning.
