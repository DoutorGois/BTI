The effects of some ergot derivatives on the electroencephalogram and behavior of laboratory animals (mice, rats, rabbits) have been surveyed. The interference of bromocriptine on the dopaminergic central systems has been studied using behavioral (interference with the effects induced by L-dopa, 5HT, TRF or neuroleptic drugs) and electrophysiological (EEG) methods. While no clear effects of bromocriptine could be evidenced in mice, EEG recordings from the dorsal hippocampus of the rabbit showed a slight disruption of epsilon-waves after administration of 2 mg/kg i.v. of the drug or more.
