Carbamazepine (CBZ) is known to have beneficial effects in the treatment of epilepsies and in the prophylaxis of affective disorders. Since increased transmembrane calcium fluxes and intracellular calcium concentrations play a key role in the generation of epilepsies and possibly also in the development of these psychiatric disorders the effects of CBZ on epileptic discharges (elicited by caffeine, penicillin and low Mg2+) in CA3 neurons of hippocampal slices were compared with those of the organic calcium antagonist verapamil and found to be almost the same.
