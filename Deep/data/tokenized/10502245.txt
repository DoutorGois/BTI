The expression of the mouse axonal adhesive glycoprotein F3 and of its mRNA was studied on sections of mouse cerebellar cortex, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb from postnatal days 0 (P0) to 30 (P30). In cerebellar cortex, a differential expression of F3 in granule versus Purkinje neurons was observed. F3 was highly expressed during migration of and initial axonal growth from cerebellar granule cells. The molecule was then downregulated on cell bodies and remained expressed, although at low levels, on their axonal extensions. On Purkinje cells, F3 was strongly expressed on cell bodies and processes at the beginning of the second postnatal week; by P16 it was restricted to neurites of Purkinje cells subpopulations. In the cerebral cortex, the molecule was highly expressed on migrating neurons at P0; by P16, it was found essentially within the neuropil with a diffuse pattern. In the hippocampal formation, where F3 was expressed on both pyramidal and granule neurons, a clear shift from the cell bodies to neurite extensions was observed on P3. In the olfactory pathway, F3 was expressed mainly on olfactory nerve fibers, mitral cells, and the synaptic glomeruli from P0 to P3, with a sharp decline from P11 to P16. As a whole, the data show that F3 protein expression is regulated at the regional, cellular, and subcellular levels and suggest that, in different regions, it can be proposed as a reliable neuronal differentiation marker.
