Neural stem cells of human brain were cultured for a long time and successfully transplanted into the brain of rats exposed to acute hypoxia. Stem and committed cells, neuroblasts, and astrocytes were revealed in transplants by immunohistochemical assay. The transplants and brain tissue were not separated with a glial barrier. Human neuroblasts widely migrated into regions of neuronal degeneration in the host brain.
