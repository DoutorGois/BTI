Co-localization of calretinin immunoreactivity and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity was studied in the rat hippocampus and dentate gyrus. Neurons co-expressing both markers (CR/NADPH-d) were observed throughout the hippocampus and dentate gyrus. However, they were more abundant in the stratum pyramidale and radiatum of CA3, stratum pyramidale of CA1, and in the juxtagranular zone of the hilus. The NADPH-d activity appeared in 37% of the calretinin immunoreactive neurons in CA3, 42% in CA1, and 36% in the dentate gyrus, whereas calretinin immunoreactivity occurred in 41% of the NADPH-d positive neurons in the hippocampus, and 16% in the dentate gyrus. The morphology and location of the double marked cells could not be used as a characteristic of the co-localizing neurons. The heavily stained NADPH-d neurons occurring mainly in CA1 do not show calretinin immunoreactivity. NADPH-d fiber swellings could be observed in close apposition to calretinin immunoreactive neurons and dendrites, suggesting synaptic contacts. It has been reported that calretinin immunoreactivity and NADPH-d activity co-localize infrequently in other areas such as the neocortex, striatum, hypothalamus and tegmental nucleus. The relatively high proportion of double marked cells found in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus could be indicative of the importance of the CR/NADPH-d interneurons in the circuitries of these areas.
