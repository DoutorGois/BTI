The present experiment was designed to reveal the characteristics of interictal discharges (IIDs) induced by kindling of the rabbit hippocampus. Out of 21 animals, 13 developed stage 5 convulsions with a mean of 18 stimulations (Kindled (K) group), whereas the remaining eight animals did not (incomplete kindling (IK) group). A correlation between the duration of the afterdischarge and the behavioral stages was found in the K group. However, changes in frequency of total IIDs during kindling did not differ between the two groups. In the acute experiments performed after kindling, IIDs were classified into two types: simple and complex IIDs. The former was further classified into two subtypes (A and B) according to the laminar profile in the CA1 region. The A type of simple IIDs showed a negative polarity in the apical dendritic layer, while the B type showed a negative polarity in the basal dendritic layer. Complex IIDs basically consisted of two to three simple IIDs and were often followed by large irregular activity. Retrospective analysis was done, based on the classification of IIDs in the acute experiments (n = 12). Consequently, in the K group (n = 7), the frequency of complex IIDs rather than that of simple ones was closely related to the enhancement of behavioral responses during kindling. On the other hand, in the IK group (n = 5), simple IIDs occurred at a higher frequency, and did not parallel the changes in seizure behavior. It is concluded that complex IIDs play an important role in the propagation as well as the evolution of kindling effects.
