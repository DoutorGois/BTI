Changes in activity of monoaminergic systems of the left and right brain hemispheres after administration of saline and oxytocin were studied in male C57Bl/6 mice subjected to social isolation. The concentrations of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and their metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic, homovanillic, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acids were measured in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, and striatum of the left and right brain hemispheres by HPLC. In isolated aggressive males treated intranasally with saline, the content of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was significantly higher in the right hippocampus. Oxytocin reduces aggression caused by long-term social isolation, but has no absolute ability to suppress this type of behavior. Oxytocin reduced dopamine content in the left cortex and serotonin content in the right hippocampus and left striatum. Furthermore, oxytocin evened the revealed asymmetry in serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in the hippocampus. At the same time, asymmetry in dopamine concentration appeared in the cortex with predominance of this transmitter in the right hemisphere. The data are discussed in the context of lateralization of neurotransmitter systems responsible for intraspecific aggression caused by long-term social isolation.
