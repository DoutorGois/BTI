The effects of MDMA administration on oxidative stress markers in rat eye and hippocampus, and the neuroprotective effects of the antioxidant 3,4-dihydro-6-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-1(2H)-benzopyran (CR-6) have been studied. MDMA effects on liver were used for comparison with those in eye and hippocampus and to test CR-6 protective effects. Another goal was to test for apoptosis in retinal cells, as it is known that happens in liver and brain. After 1 week of ecstasy administration, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration increased, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and glutathione (GSH) content decreased in liver, as previously described. MDA concentration increased and GPx activity decreased in hippocampus; whereas no change was observed in GSH concentration. MDMA decreased ocular GSH concentration and GPx activity; no change was observed in MDA concentration. The number of TUNEL-positive nuclei increased significantly in rat retinas after 1 week of MDMA administration. CR-6 normalized the modifications in liver, hippocampus and retina mentioned above.
