This study focused on the effect of electro-stimulation of fastigial nucleus on the expression of NgR and on axonal regeneration after focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in rats. Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion was induced by nylon monofilament. Ninety-six male SD rats were randomly divided into sham group and ischemic insult groups at 12 hours, 24 hours, and 1 to 3 weeks after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to determine the changes of NgR mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of NgR protein and the state of axonal regeneration. Fastigial nucleus stimulation was applied at 2 hours after ischemia for one hour. The results demonstrated that NgR mRNA and protein in the infarcted cortex and hippocampus were significantly increased (p<0.01). The axons were grossly damaged at 24 h after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion when compared to the sham group. Fastigial nucleus stimulation decreased NgR mRNA and protein levels in the infarcted cortex and hippocampus (p<0.01) and improved axonal growth at 24 hours and 2 weeks after ischemia-reperfusion (p<0.05). These results suggest that electrostimulation of fastigial nucleus might provide a new strategy to promote CNS axonal regeneration.
