Seizure activity in the hippocamp has been studied on 6-10-, 16-20-day and adult rabbits. The pattern and thresholds of trace discharges of after-effect evoked by the electrical stimulation of the hippocamp were found to be similar in animals of all age groups. However, the amplitude of after-discharges significantly increased during the development of the brain. After the formation of penicillin epileptogenic zone in the hippocamp, EEG of all animals exhibited the identical types of focal interseizure discharges and electrographic correlates of seizures, yet the amplitude of epileptifiorm discharges on the EEG increased with age. Contralateral hippocamp was involved into the pathological process more easily in young rabbits than in adult ones.
