OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of yizhi jiannao granule concentration fluid (YCF) on the behavior, the apoptosis rate of hippocampus neuron and the expression of apoptosis gene Bcl-2, Bax in senescence accelerated mice Senile-Prone/8 (SAMP/8), and to discuss some mechanism of traditional chinese medicine YCF in improving the capability of learning and memory. METHODS: Forty 6-month old SAMP/8 mice were randomly divided into the old group, huperzine A (Hup-A) group and YCF group. Ten 4-month old SAMP/8 mice were served as a young control group. Four groups were given different drugs for 8 weeks, their behavior changes were observed, and the hippocampus were taken out to examine the apotosis rate by flow cytomeutry (FCM) and the expression of Bcl-2, Bax mRNA by RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the YCF group, the escape latency was significantly shortened, the time of swim in the platform quadrant significantly increased, the apoptosis rate of hippocampus neural decreased; the level of Bcl-2 mRNA and the rate of Bcl-2/Bax increased, and the level of Bax mRNA decreased. CONCLUSION: Yizhi jiannao granule can decrease the neuron apoptosis rate and the Bax level, increase the Bcl-2 level, and modulate the rate of Bcl-2/Bax in SAMP/8 brain, which is probably part of the mechanisms of inhibiting the apoptosis and improving learning and memory.
