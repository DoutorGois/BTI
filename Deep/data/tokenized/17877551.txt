Auditory orienting and discrimination were studied with combined multi-channel EEG and MEG recordings in a patient with unilateral amygdala-hippocampus-partial temporal lobe resection of the right hemisphere. The results revealed abnormalities of habituation in alerting- and orienting-related responses, and discrimination-related responses, elicited by auditory stimulation contralateral to the resected cerebral hemisphere. These results give support to the notions about the role of the amygdala and hippocampus in alerting and orienting, respectively, and of the temporal cortex in auditory discrimination.
