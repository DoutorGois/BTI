The excitatory responses to L-glutamate (L-Glu), quisqualate (QA) and kainate (KA) have been investigated in isolated pyramidal cells from rat hippocampus using intracellular perfusion and concentration clamp techniques. The responses to L-Glu and QA demonstrated rapid desensitization and complete cross-desensitization, while KA produced a non-desensitizing response. The activation of KA response was determined by the level of desensitization induced by L-Glu or QA pretreatment. It is concluded that QA, KA and L-Glu activate the same excitatory receptors with apparent Kd values of 9.3 X 10(-5) M, 5.0 X 10(-4) M and 1.1 X 10(-3) M, respectively.
