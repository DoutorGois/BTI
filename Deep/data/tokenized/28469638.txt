Within the CNS nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factors are involved in a wide range of functions both in homeostasis and in pathology. Over the years, our and other groups produced a vast array of information on the complex involvement of NF-kappaB proteins in different aspects of postnatal neurogenesis. In particular, several extracellular signals and membrane receptors have been identified as being able to affect neural progenitor cells (NPC) and their progeny via NF-kappaB activation. A crucial role in the regulation of neuronal fate specification in adult hippocampal NPC is played by the NF-kappaB p50 subunit. NF-kappaB p50KO mice display a remarkable reduction in adult hippocampal neurogenesis which correlates with a selective defect in hippocampal-dependent short-term memory. Moreover absence of NF-kappaB p50 can profoundly affect the in vitro proneurogenic response of adult hippocampal NPC (ahNPC) to several endogenous signals and drugs. Herein we briefly review the current knowledge on the pivotal role of NF-kappaB p50 in the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In addition we discuss more recent data that further extend the relevance of NF-kappaB p50 to novel astroglia-derived signals which can influence neuronal specification of ahNPC and to astrocyte-NPC cross-talk.
