Influence of single (enzyme activities was determined 5h after the preparation) and multiple (for 7 days) DOCA administration on 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5) and adenosine deaminase (ES 3.5.4.4) activities in homogenate and subcellular fractions of the hypothalamus and hippocampus of the rat brain has been studied. It has been shown that DOCA enhances adenosine metabolism in the hypothalamus activating both the enzymes while in the hippocampus 5'-nucleotidase activity increases whereas adenosine deaminase activity decreases. Possible ways of mineralocorticoid effects on adenosine system and the role of this nucleoside in these hormones mechanism of action on CNS functional activity are being discussed.
