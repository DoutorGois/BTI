The granule cells (GCs) of dentate gyrus exhibit regionally specific morphology, and continue to be born and to develop well into adult life. We used a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb2G7, elicited by immunization of a mouse with a microsome fraction of the hippocampus, to evaluate regional and age-related differences in GCs immunohistochemically. Weak cytoplasmic reactions were observed in many neurons, but intense MAb2G7-positive dots were observed only in GCs. Using electron microscopy, we observed that these dots were localized in the internal droplets of secondary lysosome-like structures in GCs. The MAb2G7-positive granules were quantitatively analyzed in young adult and middle-aged rats. Larger numbers of reactive granules were observed in the infrapyramidal blade (IPB) than in the suprapyramidal blade (SPB) and the numbers of positive granules were proportionally reduced in the two areas in middle-aged rats. The changes in the MAb2G7 immunoreactivity may reflect different activation or neurogeneration of GCs in the IPB versus the SPB, and in middle-aged versus young adult rats.
