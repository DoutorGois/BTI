Methyl methacrylate (MMA), a widely used monomer in the manufacture of acrylic polymers, has been reported to cause neurological deficits in industrial workers. The effect of MMA on regional brain biogenic amines and their correlation with behavioural responses were examined. Male Wistar rats received orally MMA (500 mg/kg body wt) for 21 consecutive days. Our results indicate that MMA markedly impaired locomotor activity and learning, while aggressive behaviour significantly increased. An overall enhancement of biogenic amine levels in pons-medulla and hippocampus was noted. In addition, for noradrenaline an increase in cerebral cortex and corpus striatum, for 5-hydroxytryptamine an increase in mid-brain and hypothalamus and for dopamine a slight decrease in corpus striatum were recorded. The changes in regional brain biogenic amine levels may be partly responsible for altered behaviour.
