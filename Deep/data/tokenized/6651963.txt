Rabbits with electrodes implanted in the dorsal hippocampus were trained on the acquisition of the nictitating membrane response. Posttrial application of subseizure-level electrical stimulation within a single session resulted in a facilitation of nictitating membrane response conditioning. In contrast, seizure-level stimulation within a single session and subseizure-level stimulation in multiple sessions had no facilitatory or deleterious effects on conditioning. It is suggested that dorsal hippocampus stimulation facilitates conditioning by activation of midbrain and cerebellar circuits.
