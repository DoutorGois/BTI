The influence of nootropic drugs on EEG spectral power of the cortex and hippocamp was studied in resting rats. All these drugs had a specific action on EEG spectral power, causing an increase and stabilization of maximum basic distribution peak of the EEG spectral power. Such action may be attributed to better organization of rhythmic activity in theta-range. The drugs also decreased interhemispheric asymmetry of the cortical and hippocampal EEG. The authors suggest that the increase and improvement of the basic rhythmic activity in the brain and an increased level of distant (spatial) synchronization form the basis for the nootropic drug effect.
