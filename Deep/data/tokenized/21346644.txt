Papez circuit is one of the major pathways of the limbic system, and it is involved in the control of memory and emotion. Structural and functional alterations have been reported in psychiatric, neurodegenerative, and epileptic diseases. Despite the clinical interest, however, in-vivo imaging of the entire circuit remains a technological challenge. We used magnetic resonance diffusion spectrum imaging to comprehensively picture the Papez circuit in healthy humans: (i) the hippocampus-mammillary body pathway, (ii) the connections between the lateral subiculum and the cingulate cortex, and (iii) the mammillo-thalamic tract. The diagnostic and therapeutic implications of these results are discussed in the context of recent findings reporting the involvement of the Papez circuit in neurological and psychiatric diseases.
