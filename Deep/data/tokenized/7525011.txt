The distribution of beta-amyloid protein precursor (APP) was investigated immunocytochemically in rats subjected to global cerebral ischemia (GCI) induced by cardiac arrest. Rats underwent 10 min of GCI with 3, 6, and 12 h and 2 and 7 days of survival. APP immunostaining was found extracellular and intracellularly. Multiple extracellular APP immunoreactive deposits around and close to the vessels appeared as soon as 3 h after GCI. Extracellular accumulation of APP occurred frequently in the hippocampus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus and rarely in the brain stem. These deposits were labelled with antibodies against the N-terminal, beta-amyloid peptide, and C-terminal domains of APP. Our data suggests that either proteolytically cleaved fragments of the full-length APP or the entire APP molecule accumulates extracellularly after GCI. This findings may not only implicate the participation of APP in postischemic tissue damage but also suggest the involvement of pathomechanisms operating in ischemia in Alzheimer's disease pathology.
