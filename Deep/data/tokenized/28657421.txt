Mounting evidence indicates that cancer treatments cause numerous deleterious effects, including central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. Chemotherapy-caused CNS side effects encompass changes in cognitive function, memory, and attention, to name a few. Although chemotherapy treatment-induced side effects occur in 16-75% of all patients, the mechanisms of these effects are not well understood. We have recently proposed a new epigenetic theory of chemo brain and, in a pioneer study, determined that cytotoxic chemotherapy agents induce oxidative DNA damage and affect molecular and epigenetic processes in the brain, and may be associated with brain aging processes. In this paper, we discuss the implications of chemo brain epigenetic effects and future perspectives, as well as outline potential links with brain aging and future translational research opportunities.
