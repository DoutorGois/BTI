The influence of genes, determining the coat colour in mice, on active avoidance conditioned reflex formation in a shuttle box was studied. Negative correlation was found to exist between theoretically calculated mean number of dominant genes determining the coat colour and the level of aviodance in a shuttle box. Among F2 hybrids and backcrosses the groups of mice characterized by different coat colour phenotype have similar concentration of neurospecific S-100 protein in cerebral cortex and hippocampus.
