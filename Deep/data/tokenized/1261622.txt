A study presenting findings of focal hippocampal x-irradiation in early infancy and late behavior at two ages was carried out using Long-Evans hooded rats (Rattus norvegicus). Animals from eleven litters received 150-R irradiation treatments for 5 or 15 consecutive days and were then tested in an open field situation and in a two-way active avoidance apparatus. The results indicated that the behavioral deficits paralleled those seen in animals with classical hippocampal lesions. The results were offered in support of a response suppression model for hippocampal functioning.
