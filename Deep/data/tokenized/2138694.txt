This paper describes the implementation of optimization methods for computer-aided parameter estimation of models representing the passive electrical properties of excitable cells. Two types of models are described whereby the passive electrical properties are characterized either as signal or system models, respectively. Examples are given to illustrate a) the validity of these methods, and b) to describe their application to biological data from dentate granule neurons.
