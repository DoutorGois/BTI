During development, when synapses start to be established, a primitive form of network-driven activity provides most of the synaptic activity. This pattern enables a high degree of synchrony in immature neurons in spite of the small number of functional synapses and could participate in activity-dependent growth and synapse formation. Relying on the giant depolarizing potentials that provide most of the synaptic activity in the developing hippocampus, this article reviews the common properties and generating mechanisms of these patterns, and particularly the role of the early depolarizing action of GABA(A) and glycine receptors and the sequential expression of GABA and glutamate synapses. Patterns similar to giant depolarizing potentials have been observed in a wide range of structures and species suggesting that there is a temporal template throughout evolution that constitutes an essential step in the formation of functional networks.
