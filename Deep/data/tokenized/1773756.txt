The effect on rat brain of a large number of stimulations with a high strength pulsed magnetic field was investigated in 31 rats: 10 naive controls, 10 anesthetized controls, and 11 stimulated and anesthetized rats. An investigational magnetic stimulating device with a circular 5.5 inch diameter stimulating head was used. The stimulating coil was energized by 1000 V, 8000A, 200 microseconds half sine pulses at a rate of 8 Hz. The peak field strength was 3.4 T, and the peak field flux was approximately 53,000 T/sec. Stimulation was performed for 20 min at a rate of 8/stimuli per second, for a total of at least 10,000 stimulations. The rats were sacrificed after 8 days, and their brains were examined using light microscopy with hematoxylin and eosin staining, or electron microscopy. Histological samples were taken from the neocortex, the hippocampus, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. No significant changes were seen.
