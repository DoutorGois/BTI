We investigated the use of extramaze and intramaze cues on the eight-arm radial maze. The rats received daily training consisting of forced-choice visits to four baited arms, a retention interval, and the availability of all eight arms with baits available at arms that did not appear in the forced-choice phase. The radial maze was placed in a featureless octagonal enclosure to minimize the availability of extramaze cues. Intramaze cues were provided at the distal end of each arm by placing a small object in front of the food trough; unique objects were randomly sampled from a large pool of objects. The use of extramaze and intramaze cues was assessed by rotating the objects, after the retention interval, on occasional non-rewarded probes, thereby dissociating the location of extramaze and intramaze cues. The rats used extramaze rather than intramaze cues. Implications for spatial representations are discussed.
