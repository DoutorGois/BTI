The protective effect of nebracetam on ischemic neuronal damage was histologically examined in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampal CA1 subfield 7 days after operation using stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) subjected to 10-min bilateral carotid occlusion. Nebracetam (50 and 100 mg/kg), given orally 10 min after reperfusion, dose-dependently protected against ischemic delayed neuronal damage in the SHRSP with occlusion; however, the blood pressure remained unchanged following nebracetam administration. These findings further support the notion that nebracetam protects against ischemic delayed neuronal cell death in the hippocampus.
