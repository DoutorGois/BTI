Experimental studies show depressive behavior in rats caused by hypothyroidism and antidepressant effect of thyroid hormones. The present study analyses changes in the hippocampal and cerebellar cortex local blood flow in the progeny of rats suffering from iodine deficiency before mating and during the whole period of gestation. The diet with very low iodine content results in a decrease of local blood flow in both brain structures, but the greatest changes were observed in hippocampus. Addition of the iodine to the diet eliminates the above blood flow changes.
