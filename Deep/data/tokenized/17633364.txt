OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BYHWD) and the different combinations of its ingredients on neurogenesis following ischemic stroke in rats. METHODS: The model rats of ischemic stroke was established by blocking cerebral media artery with electrocoagulation through craniectomy, and electric stimulation, given from 24 h after blocking, 2 h daily for 15 successive days. They were divided into four groups, Group A treated with saline, Group B treated with BYHWD, Group C treated with BYHWD but earthworm subtracted, and Group D treated with Danggui Buxue Decoction (DGBXD). The expression of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in cerebral tissue was determined by immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: Large amount of BrdU immunoreactive cells presented in the hippocampal region of rats in Group B and C, densely arranged, partial in cluster, with the figure significantly different to that in Group A (P < 0.01), and the amount in the ischemic side was significantly more than that in the opposite side (P < 0.05). While comparing between Group A and D, the amount of BrdU immunoreactive cells in the hippocampal region showed insignificant difference (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: BYHWD has a effect in promoting neurogenesis better than DGBXD.
