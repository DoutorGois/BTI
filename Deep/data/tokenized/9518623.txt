The purpose of this present study is to clarify adenosine (ADO) metabolism in guinea pig brain slices during simulated ischemia. In slice preparations after decapitation, ADO levels were lowest in slices of the cerebellum (1.2 nmol/mg protein), followed by the superior colliculus (3.4) and highest in the hippocampus (6.4), and the combined concentrations of inosine (Ino) and hypoxanthine (HX) were highest in the cerebellum (5.5), followed by the superior colliculus (3.5) and the hippocampus (1.5). After preincubation with standard medium with oxygen and glucose for 30 min, total ADO levels (tissue ADO plus ADO lost into medium during incubation) decreased to 0.3 in the cerebellum, to 1.3 in the superior colliculus and to 2. 9 in the hippocampus. On the other hand, levels of total Ino and HX increased to 21.1 in the cerebellum, to 14.3 in the hippocampus and to 12.0 in the superior colliculus. To investigate the effect of simulated ischemia on ADO metabolism, preincubated slices were exposed for 10 min in medium deprived of oxygen and glucose. The increases of ADO content after 10 min ischemia were 0.2 in the cerebellum, 1.0 in the superior colliculus and 1.3 in the hippocampus. In contrast, the increases of both Ino and HX concentrations were 2.9 in the cerebellum, 2.2 in the superior colliculus and 1.4 in the hippocampus. The total amount of the increase in ADO, Ino and HX was approximately 3 in all three regions. These results indicate that there are significant differences in the metabolic rate to degrade ADO into Ino and HX in various areas of brain possibly due to differences in adenosine deaminase activity in those areas.
